0,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7319106-kim-pallister,1,"This was a horrible book. I gave up on it a third of the way through. I'm not sure why people give the author high marks. Perhaps his earlier works are better and he phone this one in.The book claims to look at scientific advances in a number of fields (computers, biology, etc), and drawing from interviews with hundreds of leading scientists, make predictions about the next 90 years.What it does instead is the worst kind of pop-science futurism. The author picks and chooses from science that supports his favorite hypotheses, and then draws them out to extreme predictions. In doing so he pays almost no attention to factors that could influence other directions, gives no insight into his calculations (if any were done) on how to get to the endpoint. I'm OK with the idea of making concepts accessible to the layperson, but the leap from there to ""trust me, I'm a scientist"" is one that goes too far.In addition, the areas of the book he covered that I have some expertise in (silicon design and manufacturing, augmented reality, virtual reality) were so riddled with error, unimaginative future use cases, and misuse of terminology, that I couldn't trust him on other areas in which I'm not an expert.To add insult to injury, he uses a horrible amount of adverb-laden hyperbole. The first chapter alone had enough ""we will have the power of the gods of mythology!"" mentions that I almost didn't make it to chapter two."
1,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"ENGLISHWhat a significant and visionary milestone in the evolution of the entertaining non-fiction book. How difficult it sometimes has to be to breathe life into the scientific genre can be measured by the memory of the response to textbooks at school, which can happily be described as mixed. In some areas, more competition and free competition would pay off in exceptional cases. The book can be used as an example of the gems that non-fiction authors can master, as a collection of future technologies, trimmed for readability for laypersons and pure entertainment value. As the author has already subdivided into possible, unlikely and impossible technologies in previous works, in this book, he divides the 21st century into three periods and uses selected thematic blocks to show the future development in time-lapse. The topic is located in the theoretically possible, but still untried and the unconfirmed terrain. The trick, especially in category three at the end of the century, which is sometimes hard to believe, is that all technologies, machines, materials, and processes have already been tried out and their realization is possible. Of course, the time to implementation is estimated, but no thought of the book is mere guesswork or science-fiction. Instead, it is based on verifiable facts for which Kaku has interviewed several scientists, visited their laboratories and refined them into a compressed compendium. In particular, the apparent structure and easy-to-understand language let one visually walk through the considerable number of pages in no time.Especially for fans of Futurism and all related genres, there are mountains of ideas and fantasy creations whose realizability does not harm the imagination in any way. Instead, on the contrary, it gives additional impetus to the notion that, if achievements that are impossible shortly become possible, the developmental thrust will be all the more astonishing in centuries. It is also amazing how many founding fathers of science fiction have correctly predicted the development down to the last detail. Also, how many current genre representatives, due to the galloping research, run the risk of accidentally slipping into the typical genre of novels, as their visionary ideas suddenly become an everyday occurrence overnight.The grandiose ability of Kaku to make all the boring and dust-dry natural sciences so lively and exciting should be a guiding principle for authors of all non-fiction literature. Mainly if they write for the education sector, as understandability and entertainment value, especially in this area, unfortunately, often fall by the wayside. The only unworkable utopia is that internationally successful and wealthy authors are beginning to transform the antiquated school material. Alternatively, underpaid schoolbook authors will be kissed overnight by the Muse and mutate into dazzling narrators. Unfortunately, both will not happen so soon, even though it would be so important, given the educational misery and partly old foundations, to sow the enthusiasm for knowledge acquisition where one would expect it. At school.GERMANWelch ein famoser und visionärer Meilenstein in der Evolution des unterhaltsamen Sachbuchs.Wie schwer es mitunter sein muss, dem Wissenschaftsgenre Leben einzuhauchen, lässt sich an der Erinnerung an die Resonanz auf Schulbücher ermessen, welche mit Glück als durchwachsen bezeichnet werden kann. In manchen Bereichen würde sich mehr Konkurrenz und freier Wettbewerb ausnahmsweise eben doch auszahlen. Als Beispiel für die Perlen, die Sachbuchautoren gelingen können, kann diese auf Lesbarkeit für Laien und Unterhaltungswert getrimmte Sammlung zukünftiger Technologien gelten. Wie der Autor schon in vorangegangenen Werken eine Unterteilung in mögliche, unwahrscheinliche und unmögliche Technologien vorgenommen hat, so unterteilt er in diesem Buch das 21 Jahrhundert in 3 Zeiträume und zeigt anhand ausgewählter Themenblöcke die zukünftige Entwicklung im Zeitraffer. Dabei ist die Thematik im rein theoretisch möglichen, aber noch unerprobten und unbestätigten Terrain angesiedelt. Der, besonders in Kategorie 3 gegen Ende des Jahrhundert mitunter schwer zu glaubende, Kniff an der Sache ist, dass sämtliche Technologien, Maschinen, Materialien und Verfahren bereits erprobt wurden und ihre Realisierung möglich ist. Natürlich sind die Zeiträume bis zur Verwirklichung Schätzungen, nur entspricht kein Gedanke des Buches bloßer Vermutung oder Science-Fiction. Sondern fußt auf überprüfbaren Fakten, für deren Zusammentragung Kaku etliche Wissenschaftler interviewt, deren Laboratorien besichtigt und zu einem komprimierten Kompendium zusammengepresst hat. Besonders die übersichtliche Struktur und angenehm verständliche Sprache lassen einen die beträchtliche Seitenanzahl im Nu visuell durchwandern.Gerade für Freunde von Futurismus und allen damit zusammenhängenden Genres finden sich Berge an Ideen und Fantasiegebilden, deren Realisierbarkeit der Imagination in keiner Weise schadet. Sondern sie im Gegenteil durch die Vorstellung zusätzlich beflügelt, dass wenn in so verhältnismäßig naher Zukunft unmöglich gedachte Errungenschaften möglich sein werden, der Entwicklungsschub in Jahrhunderten noch umso erstaunlicher anmuten wird. Erstaunlich ist auch, wie viele Gründerväter der Science Fiction die Entwicklung bis ins Detail richtig prognostiziert haben. Und wie viele aktuelle Genrevertreter aufgrund der galoppierenden Forschung Gefahr laufen, unbeabsichtigt ins normale Romangenre zu rutschen, da ihre gerade noch visionären Ideen über Nacht plötzlich Alltag werden. Die grandiose Fähigkeit Kakus, all die als langweilig und staubtrocken gebrandmarkten Naturwissenschaften so lebendig und spannend zu gestalten, sollte Autoren sämtlicher Sachliteratur ein Leitbild sein. Besonders wenn sie für den Bildungssektor schreiben, da Verständlichkeit und Unterhaltungswert gerade in diesem Bereich leider häufig auf der Strecke bleiben. Womit die einzige undurchführbare Utopie wohl ist, dass international erfolgreiche und wohlhabende Autoren beginnen den antiquierten Schulstoff umzugestalten. Oder unterbezahlte Schulbuchautoren über Nacht von der Muse geküsst werden und zu blendenden Erzählern mutieren. Beides wird leider nicht so bald geschehen, obwohl es angesichts von Bildungsmiseren und einem teils antiquierten Fundamenten ruhenden Lernstoff so wichtig wäre, die Begeisterung für Wissenserwerb dort zu säen, wo man ihn eigentlich vermuten würde. In der Schule."
2,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"Lot of thrilling stuff here in one competent package from a scientist who puts on a futurologist’s hat to give us a tour of how far science will advance and change society over the next 100 years. His topics cut a broad swath with chapters on each of the following: computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth, and humanity’s stages of civilization. It’s fun to hear from a knowledgeable writer just how likely it is we will achieve many of the themes of science fiction. Ordinarily, I digest technological progress in little blips of news pieces or brief magazine features that tend to bounce off my mind. I know from my own experience how science accomplishments get hyped and distorted in the media. For these reasons, it was very satisfying to get updates and reasoned projections on a wide variety of fields of work The doubling of computer processing power each year has gone on for decades, conforming to Moore’s Law. Continued shrinking of transistor size driving this progression will soon reach a limit based on quantum limits to how small circuit templates can be etched. Still, before that limit is reached, computing capacity will be astounding and cheap processing power will be emdedded everywhere imaginable. Some of you will have played with the Android mobile phone voice interface Siri. I asked it ""Why is There Air?"", and in seconds it gave me a link to the Bill Cosby routine video from 1964. Pretty handy power already here. The recent release of Google glasses points the way to where portable computing combined with wireless Internet access might take us. Kaku projects that the only screen we will need in the future will a transparent one within contact lenses. Circuits with microlasers are under way that can beam data or video images right on the retina.Computing power readily translates into great success in playing chess, which is based on picking the best move from projecting zillions of possible responses of the opponent. However, true artificial intelligence (AI) progress is stuck in a rut. Attempts to program in autonomy are stymied by barriers in achieving performance based on common sense, and pattern recognition is barely at the level of the mosquito. But “bottom up” approaches for robots learning from errors are beginning to hold promise, and simulations based on brain circuitry are becoming a focus. On the question of when computers with advanced articifical intelliegence will achieve self consciousness (“singularity” in sci fi parlance), Kaku doesn’t know whether to side with those that say 20 years, others who say 100 years, or still others who say never. Unlike the Termnator scenario with Skynet starting a machine-human war, the author thinks we will make sure our robots are kind, addressing the contradictions possible in Asimovs 3 laws and avoiding the temptation to automate Predator drones in warfare. The medicine section of the book was fun for me due to my background in biomedical science and recent work on telemedicine programs. Having a computer interface through contact lenses and wireless voice control should prove pretty effective in medical care and emergency medicine. Kaku book predicts that within 100 years humans will to be able to control computers with their mind. Already we have paraplegics with scalp sensors linked to computer controls that they can write email and play 3D games. Next will be mind-controlled arms and legs for such patients. So maybe we won't have war with machines like Terminator movies make hay with. Biotechnology fused with nanotechnology has a lot of room for speculative scenarios. And if the genetic folks look like they are headed toward bringing back the mammoth, should we try to recover the Neanderthal? Would we put them in a zoo or Harvard? Are we on the way to being able to make a Jurassic Park? Though DNA is too degraded, maybe we can make a generic dinosaur by interpolating between bird and lizard genomes to recreated the ancestral genes. If the snake retains the genes for legs in a suppressed state, maybe some ancient genes are already in there.Nanotechnology’s promise of “making something from nothing” is still far from achieving machines that can carry out molecular assembly from raw materials. Still Kaku does a good job in covering early stages in progress along these lines and the technical issues involved. He has a nicely concentrated discussion over the implications of a future society where jobs and work are largely unneeded. The worker’s mantra of “each according to his ability” will change into “to each according to his desire.” Similar to many sci fi renderings, many believe that:…without the motivating factor of scarcity and money, it could lead to a self-indulgent, degenerate society that sinks to its lowest level. Only a handful of the most artistically motivated will strive to write poetry. The rest of us, the critics’ claim, will become good-for-nothing loafers and slackers. For the future of energy, he is deft and informative about progress on initiatives such as hydrogen powered cars, fusion plants, solar energy plants in orbit, and frictionless transportation using magnetic lifting driven with superconductivity. For the future of space travel, he seems reasonable in his projections for colonies on the moons of Earth and other planets and exploration of asteroids. Serious work is going on the dream of a space elevator, but prospects for massive production of materials strong enough to sustain such a device are unclear. Kaku favors the likelihood of detecting an alien civilization, but he is pretty cautious in predicting the sci fi dream of spaceships with “ramjet” engines scooping up hydrogen as fuel for a fusion engine or with antimatter drives. Instead he seems to favor unmanned interstellar exploration by tiny craft with self-replicating miniature robots, possibly in the form swarming nanobots that can join up in various ways to morph into diverse machines.The book is an easy read for people with only modest scientific literacy. For sci fi fans, it should whet their appetite even more for wonders of the future."
3,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"This books is more about the TECHNOLOGY of the future than the physics thereof.Really, if you've kept up with Tech news, you can just skip reading this book...I counted no fewer than 34 references to ""God"" or ""gods"", a bad sign on it's own.There is more time dedicated to ancient mythology than to actual physics!The most annoying is the indicative future used without proper qualifiers.For example, he says something ""will happen"", instead of examining the LIKELIHOOD that it will happen.This is Kaku's worst writing habit, his hyperbolic/extreme language a close second.He loves to use words like ""telepathy"" and ""magic"" when he really means mind-machine interfaces and advanced technology.His over-confident tone is made worse by the preposterousness of some of the claims!Kaku bizarrely champions Kurzweil and like-mined wearers of tinfoil hats.The whole singularity silliness is transparent nonsense to computer scientists.Kaku's proposed ""Caveman principle"" is moronic, he really needs to re-read ""The Selfish Gene""...This book is full of historical inaccuracies, if not dubious over-simplifications.Kaku blames human aging on 2nd law of thermodynamics, which is entirely incorrect.Aging is caused primarily by the shortening of telomeres, which is controlled by the genes.He goes on to correctly describe this, but his description contradicts this prior, false claim.The book is full of these outrageous claims which seem not to be meant literally at all.Rather, his writing style is to vomit extreme sounding language at the reader, presumably for entertainment.This ""Discovery Channel"" bullshit is horribly offensive, and intellectually dishonest.Kaku colorfully describes frogs and flies as ""lower organisms"", as if to mock readers with a High School education.As if to prove how out of touch he is, Kaku proposes it will soon be common place to have one's genome on CD-ROM.CD-ROM? Who still uses CD-ROMs?! Get with the program, grandpa!!I can't count the number of times I vented my frustration by saying ""cool story, bro"" aloud while reading this book...On a lighter note, the book includes a good commentary on economic bubble, and the changing world of music/newspapers.The final message of the book is that ""the people living today are the most important ever"".This is justified by our being the generation building a ""planetary civilization"".I can't stand this sort of arrogant, self-centered grandiosity."
4,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2624548-robert-kroese,3,"I got this book out of the local library because I heard the author on NPR and the book sounded interesting. I'm doing research for a near-future sci-fi novel and this sounded right up my alley.First of all, the title is a misnomer. This book should be called Technology of the Future, as it's only tangentially about physics. The prose is painfully bad at times, tending toward cliches and mixed metaphors. Consider this gem, for example:""Like a kid in a candy store, he delights in delving into uncharted territory, making breakthroughs in a wide range of hot button topics.""Or this one:""In a word, perhaps no.""I found the references to Greek mythology and current cinema strained and pointless, and most of the content of the book is dumbed down to an almost ridiculous degree. It's also somewhat vague, repetitive and occasionally self-contradictory. Kaku is very ""gee whiz isn't this neat"" about everything and his attempt to deal with the social and ethical ramifications of the technologies he's gushing about read like essays written for a high school English assignment.Still, there are some really cool ideas hidden amongst the nonsense, so if you get the book from the library like I did and skim through all the blather, it's worth picking up."
5,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758662-marty-essen,5,"This is probably not a book some hard-core science fuddy-duddy is going to enjoy. But if you are just fascinated by learning new things or contemplating the future, this soft-core science book is for you.For me, any book that makes learning fun is a good one. Just think of how many people will pick up Professor Kaku's book that haven't read much more than a science-related newspaper article since high school!My favorite sections of Physics of the Future were the chapters on the Future of Energy (especially his discussion on global warming) and the Future of Space Travel (especially his discussion on nanoships). But so much is covered here that most people will find something that piques their interest.Professor Kaku has a gift for making learning about science wonderful and exciting. And in this book, he'll make you ""think of the possibilities!""Marty Essen, author of Cool Creatures, Hot Planet: Exploring the Seven Continents"
6,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2764493-mike-mullin,3,"Excellent when Kaku focuses on technology, physics or string theory. When he veers onto other topics such as history, education, or culture Kaku produces about one WTF? statement per page. Not only are his opinions on these subjects often totally unsupported by evidence, they occasionally contradict other assertions found a few pages away. Even when Kaku sticks with what he knows, his predictions for the future seem almost laughably optimistic and naive. Every problem has a technological solution that, like a glittery rainbow unicorn, will swoop down to make us happier and wealthier. Never mind that all technologies have dark sides--in one blackly humorous passage Kaku extols the virtues of antimatter as rocket fuel while briefly sweeping over its potential as a global suicide device. By the fiftieth time Kaku used the phrase ""In the future,"" I was thinking: In the future, we'll all have access to drugs as good as the ones Kaku's taking right now."

Now I plan to read more by him. This book gave me a lot to think about and explained technology and concepts in a way that made them accessible to me. Fortunately, the author writes about a lot more than physics. He covers many areas of the sciences and social sciences and interweaves ideas from various disciplines in a comprehensible and entertaining manner."

But now I kinda do! Michio Kaku made it all accessible while not dumbing it down at all - he's just got a great writing voice and way of expressing things that's easy to follow. Obviously knows what he's talking about and cares about giving you as much information, in as engaging a way as possible. In general just a lot of fun to read and experience!"
10,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75241261-armina-salemi,5,What else could I ask for?
11,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"A light fun albeit selective exploration of the future of technology. From internet connected contact lenses and magnetic cars to starships and designer children, Kaku identifies many of the possible advances to occur in the next 100 years. If his optimistic presentation holds it will be a great time to live. His greatest concern seems to be global warming which in his hopeful projections, mankind is able to handle. However he just touches the problem of man’s violent history and leaves out the future of weaponry and other sinister uses of technology. With all the conflict in the world as I read this from the Ukraine to Africa to the Middle East to Ferguson Missouri, it is hard for me to feel as upbeat as the author. Kaku’s wondrous world of 2100 could be, but will it? Perhaps his quote of Gandhi at the end best expresses the challenges we humans face to make it another 100 years:The Roots of Violence:Wealth without work,Pleasure without conscience,Knowledge without character,Commerce without morality,Science without humanityWorship without sacrifice,Politics without principles."
12,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2494540-colin-bendell,4,"Wow. I'm super excited about the future! Michio Kaku connects work being accomplished the labs with the applications in the future. This isn't about imagining some mythical utopia, but looking at the discoveries and inventions that exist today and how they can be combined and utilized in the future once the economies of scale and mass production are flushed out. For example: We already can remotely control micro robots and we have the ability to analyze cells on a single micro chip. In the future we should be able to inject micro controlled robots into the blood stream that then can perform biopsies and analyze the results instantaneously. The only odd thing about the book is that Kaku seemed to reference 'Pentium' chips numerous times in the first half. It was almost as if the first part of the book was written a decade ago when people still knew what Pentium chips were.On a personal note, I am not filled with dread of a future when moores law has hit a physical ceiling where chips can't get any faster. What will we do?!"
13,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9021165-sam-lichtenstein,1,"I read a couple hundred pages on an airplane, and I regret having made an impulse-purchase of this book in the airport bookstore. Like others, I was disturbed by the poor writing (annoying tone, repetitive and useless allusions to mythology, weird Star Trek obsession...). And as others stressed (and which if I'd had more time before my flight I might have realized by skimming more thoroughly before purchasing), this book has practically no physics in it. At some point I might go back and read some of Kaku's predictions in more detail, but on the whole they strike me as no more illuminating than the guesses of anyone even modestly familiar with some of the early-stage technologies the author is riffing on. In particular, there is very little depth in his analysis of the impact caused by various technological shifts. For (what strikes me as) more incisive futurism, I suggest the work (especially on ""ems"" or whole-brain emulation) of economist Robin Hanson. "

One advantage of a patients intestines and detect cancers, without the inconvenience of sticking a 6 foot long tube up the large intestine.In addition, DNA chips are alsio being created which detect mutated genes when youblow on them. That'ss just a sample of the technology being created.I love the Michio Kaku's writing style, he is not only scientific but he describes the future in a way you can actually picture it your mind.An interesting book that predicts the future within the next decades to the next century by a physicist. So, I highly suggest this book if you like physics and technology."
15,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,4,"I had the pleasure of hearing Michio Kaku speak at a convention and figured if his books are as thought provoking as his speeches, I should grab one. He does write well but I think the title of this one is a bit misleading. It ranges far beyond physics to a variety of sciences to lay out a timeline of coming advances but most importantly it goes far beyond science to human relationships, economics and trade and personal lifestyle. Probably the most intriguing development to me it the incorporation of computers into a contact lens that is capable of being controlled telepathically and that can perform all the functions that current machines do and more. Pick up a copy in a bookstore or library, read the last section which describes a ""day in life"" of a person on New Year's day in 2100. If that doesn't pique your interest in knowing how he got there, probably not your type of book, but it was certainly mine!"
16,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350659-michael,5,"When I was little I had a book about what would happen in the future, and it was one of my favorite things. Heavy on illustrations. I remember that the pictures were of people in floating cars, buildings under water, that sort of thing. Fanciful and mostly just made up, but tons of fun to think about. I am wishing right now I knew where it was. I guess there's no way that book or anyone could have imagined what actually has happened! Much more impressive in many ways. Hell, the internet came out well after I started college. This is from a much respected physicist. Probably as well-known for hosting documentaries and such as any work he's done. A spokesman for Physics. He's on the Science Channel and Discovery Channel all the time. Even the History Channel. Michio Kaku. A celebrity scientist, very smart guy. Japanese descent, well-spoken, and able to convey the excitement of scientific discovery as well as anyone I've seen. He works at City College in NYC, where I was trying to be a doctor. Ha! Of course whatever particle physics classes he was teaching were waaay over my head. But I met him in the hall a couple of times and said ""Hey, love your shows!"" This book is great. He takes the large scale view of many differing technologies. Nanotech, biotech, genetics, computers, energy, robotics, space exploration, and more. And he speculates where these things are going, and often how they will converge. The book is both wildly speculative and well-grounded in current science. Tough to do. It has to be taken with a grain of salt, but Dr Kaku makes a solid case each and every time for where he thinks things are going. I am getting this one for dad."
17,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2700343-pamela-slytherpuff,1,"See more of my reviews at Bettering Me Up.I was really disappointed in this book. I was expecting more information on physics (darn the title for misleading me!) and was instead presented with a book about the future of technology. Which is cool, since that's my field of expertise and I've seen some of the things that Kaku mentioned in the book.There were some glaring omissions (where is Virgina Tech's CHARLI? And no DARwin? He's the RoboCup champ, for goodness sake!) in the AI section, though it's possible I skimmed over them while my mind was wandering. I'm not going back to check.After I finished the first two chapters, I could read no further.The writing made me cringe. I'm surprised that an editor didn't catch some mistakes: lack of proper grammar (especially colons and semicolons); repeating information from previous paragraphs; cliches and hyperbole; and so on. Kaku repeated the phrase ""it may take decades to accomplish this feat"" over and over. And over and over and over. Well, yes. This is a book about the future, right? (Darn the misleading title again!)"
18,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35931700-george-saoulidis,5,Great foundation for hard sci-fi inspiration. Mr Kaku is a well educated nerd and we love him for it.
19,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,3,"Physics of the Future is a light, breezy account of where many scientists and technologists saw their fields advancing as of 2011. It's a nice historical document in that way, and also a very easy to read sketch of the future from an expert perspective. It's also a very positive, optimistic book.Michio Kaku breaks things down by scientific and technological disciplines, exploring each one in turn: artificial intelligence, energy, space travel, health care, computing (again), nanotechnology, and industry (dubbed ""wealth""). He invokes a mythological figure for each chapter, not to show off but to embody his thesis: ""By 2011, out destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared."" (10) Personally I think things will be as likely to turn out in terms of Lovecraftian horror.I give Kaku credit for doing the interviews underpinning this book. He connects with some fine folks, notably the criminally underappreciated Mark Weiser (19ff), sf writer Greg Benford (142)But I have many issues with Physics of the Future, starting with its tunnel vision. Yes, it's a book about scientific development, yet Kaku can't help himself from speculating about politics, business, and culture. These reflections are glancing blows, far too brief to be useful, and often simply naive or bizarre. There's a discussion of the entertainment industry without taking copyright seriously. He calls for a scramble for controlling the world, but doesn't see this as, say, destructive (unless he's fine with that: see 297). Kaku discourses on energy in the laboratory, which is fine (although too bullish on fusion for me), but then offers suggestions for companies that fly in the face of everything we know about the energy industries and their politics. His coda, a science fiction imagining of some days in the life in 2100, manages to envision a person's immediate experience while flailing into a cartoonish socio-cultural void.I can take issue with speculations in each chapter. There's not enough on peer to peer computing, for example. The wealth chapter (again, really about industrial production) is very friendly towards increasing total economic output and the options available to individuals, but isn't too interested in distribution, much less class or international politics, seeing things really as a matter of education. He's too pessimistic on space travel, missing the private sector and new national projects. Yes, it's easy to pick on another futurist, but when we make these forecasts they reveal much about our predispositions and research.By the book's end I was grumpy, and annoyed at the frequent lashings of Hollywood sf movies. Despite myself I did like the triumphant image of humans making a Kardashev Type I civilization. And Kaku's optimism, while I can poke holes in it, is something I personally need, being too easily disposed to a Slavic/academic melancholy. Maybe our dystopia-addled era can use a dose of Kaku."
20,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4867502-jennifer,3,"This was an interesting book for me. I'm a scientist myself, but my field, geology, tends to look into the past rather than the future. It made me more aware of the upcoming breakthroughs in physics, medicine and computers. I liked the fact the author is a quantum physicist himself and fully knowledgeable about these ideas and actually got to physically test and see the technology himself. I had no idea how far away we are from creating a true artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, but how close we are in major breakthroughs in medicine such as organ replacements or building a colony on moon. The latter is hindered by cost only, but the technology is there. The science is broken down very simple, so anyone can read this. The one irk I had was he has a very optimistic view of humanity and all these breakthroughs will be for the good of the people. History says that some inventions will have a dark side and there are people and societies that will exploit that. Examples include gunpowder, used originally for fireworks, now more used as a weapon and nuclear energy. "
21,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8811289-correen,5,"Kaku makes the complex understandable. That is, one does not understand the complexities but rather has a sense of what is happening. This book creates a sense of wonder. His look into the 22nd century seemed too pat but still challenging to the mind. Given how difficult it has been to find cures for cancer, parkinson's, or even the common cold, it is hard to consider how disease could be eradicated. On the other hand, the use of dust sized computers, seems quite possible.I would recommend this book for inquiring minds of most ilks. "
22,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912138-alex-givant,5,"Excellent book about future of humankind. Each chapter divided by 3 portions: near future (until 2030), mid of the century (2030 to 2070) and far future (2070 to 2100). Considering he wrote this book 8 years ago we may be more advance that he projected."
23,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153098-chris,2,"This book had potential but ultimately didn't do it for me. Kaku looks at current trends and developments in science, technology, genetics, medicine, etc. and attempts to picture how human life will be changed by 2100. Positives:Kaku gives a pleasant tour of the many fascinating discoveries and upcoming developments in science and technology. Also, props to him for attempting a thoughtful, well-reasoned guess at what the future will look like.Negatives:Kaku plays it way too safe. In his effort not to get anything wrong he really doesn't say anything that interesting about the distant future. His predictions feel pretty obvious in the near term, and extremely vague in the long term. Also, in a sense this book is a bit pointless. If you're interested in the topic you're probably already aware of most of the developments he describes. I'm not a scientist or a worker in medicine and technology, but just by keeping up on the most popular news stories in these areas I was already aware of almost everything he discussed. That's probably going to be true for most people interested in a book like this.Finally, I was a bit annoyed with his over-enthusiasm for technology and science. I'm a big fan of these things too, but he continuously downplays the potential negative aspects of technology and optimistically promotes their potential positives. It's as though he really believes the advancements of the next 100 years are going to turn us in the noble characters of Star Trek, and will only be used to improve us as a species. He also makes ridiculous conclusions based on sweeping historical generalities about human history, vastly oversimplifying (and offhandedly minimizing) religious beliefs, and essentially all cultures that existed before our glorious present. There's a strong feeling of 21st century elitism, looking down at all those who lived in the cultural dark ages before us. "
24,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,5,"Michio Kaku, a professor of physics at the CUNY Graduate Center, sure knows how to make science both gripping and interesting. After the great bestseller, Physics of the Impossible, which tackled all those great science fiction inventions we’ve heard so much about in books, going in detail about when these said inventions would plausibly be invented; he brings things closer to home in Physics of the Future, focusing on inventions developments over the next century.In his new book, Kaku goes into detail where the next hundred years will take us on a number of different subjects, and what possible great things humanity will come up with next. The chapters run the gamut from the future of the computer, AI, nanotechnology and medicine, to where the future of wealthy, energy, and humanity will take us. Each chapter is divided into three parts: the near future, covering the present until 2030; midcentury from 2030-2070; and the far future from 2070-2100. In each of these parts, Kaku covers important discoveries and inventions that will be developed, working off of the technology and knowledge of the current period.Kaku fans and science readers will love Physics of the Future because, while Physics of the Impossible was pretty disheartening to learn that a lot of the cool inventions like transporters and time travel would not be invented until many thousands of years in the future, Physics of the Future covers a lot of fascinating technology that will be developed in many of our lifetimes.Originally written on September 21, 2011 ©Alex C.

25,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71311630-harrison-chang,5,"I absolutely loved reading Physics of the Future, by Michio Kaku. I have read Mr. Kaku's previous book: Physics of the Impossible. I bought this book and Physics of the Impossible back in the US during summer break and I was already very into science and the history of it. I became extremely fascinated by Mr. Kaku's theories and how he predicts the future of Mankind and Earth. My favorite parts of the book would be his predictions on future space travel, medicine, and nanotechnology. He wrote a lot about how we would reach Mars, our designs for spacecraft and also future cancer cures using nanotechnology. One of the most intriguing chapters was his explanation of the future of spacecraft designs, including the Ramjet Fusion theory, which uses a giant funnel that scoops hydrogen from space, since hydrogen is unlimited and would fuel the spacecraft. Another favorite would be the Orion Nuclear spacecraft, which uses mini-nuclear bombs dropped from a funnel, which would propel the craft at extreme speeds, but what was most fascinating was that this design worked and was tested in the 50s and early 60s but was discontinued in 1962 (due to the 1962 treaty banning above-ground detonation of nuclear devices, signed by the US and the Soviet Union). I was amazed by the numerous theories and the infinite possibilities of space travel, which triggered my love of astronomy and physics. This book was like taking a trip into the future and would be a must-read for any science-loving reader. I'd give it a 5 out of 5! "
26,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1240986-dave,2,"It's not bad, it's just not great either.I quickly got tired of the tone, which seems melodramatic. He talks incessantly about reclaiming the power the ancient gods were said to have, like the Greeks'.It also takes a while to get going and to understand the structure, which takes an area of technology and then explores it near, mid, and long term future.After all of that, I felt like I had heard of most of the technologies he talks about before. The most interesting parts are where he projects farthest out even past the year 2100, or when he talks about the large-scale societal effects of the technologies, rather than the technologies themselves. For example, what would it mean for capitalism to have a 'replicator' that can produce whatever the user needs? What would it mean for population when people are able to live substantially longer? What would it mean for competitiveness when parents can design their children to gene?He tends to be optimistic about all of these things, where a fiction author might take any one of these questions and explore what would happen if we made selfish choices. The book I read after was Oryx and Crake, which did just that."
27,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33746852-queenie,2,"2 things I'm certain of:1. Dr. Kaku is a sci-fi movie fanatic;2. Dr. Kaku loves Greek and Norse mythologies.Reading this 2011-book in 2018 is liken to going through a condensed, dumbed-down compilation of my Twitter feed speculations throughout the years / today's middle school intro science & technology textbook.It covers various topics in technological histories and advances such as computers, AI, biotechnology, nanotechnology, energy - briefly on fusion power and magnetism even-, climate change, space exploration. Some more amusing than others, all rather simply dabbled in.Interesting to note that we now have self-driving cars, genome-editing is possible with CRISPR Cas 9; androids exist (ahem, Sophia), despite not having a consciousness / common sense, yet. Let's see what Nasa's TESS will find on its space ex mission."

Some of them read like they should be part of a sci-fi blockbuster or thriller, but Michio Kaku weaved in actual research, observations, or scientific numbers/accounts to explain how or why they're more than possible. I particularly liked the bits about nanotechnology, gene sequencing, and space exploration."
29,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16311569-cindy-h,4,"I’m not gonna lie, 80% of this book was way over my head...but the parts I understood were beyond cool and fascinating. This was read for #PopSugar challenge a book about technology...."
30,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17648164-umair-khan,4,"What is the future going to be like? Physics of the Future tries to answer this question in an engaging, thought provoking and visionary account of the possibilities that, according to the author, Michio Kaku, will be transformed into reality in the coming decades. The book will not be a disappointment to fans of Kaku and can be considered as a sequel to his previous work, Visions, but with a more expansive view.Physics outlines four fundamental forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force. Kaku is of the opinion that each time a force of nature is understood by scientists and harnessed by engineers it sets in motion a chain reaction of novel and unique technologies determining the course of human development. In Physics, Kaku interviews more than 300 scientists and inventors who are working day and night to push the boundaries of science and technology. Essentially, the theme of the book is similar to the works of futurists like Ray Kurzweil, however, the treatment of the topic is more vivid and easier to understand.Kaku seems to be following the footsteps of visionary futurists like Leonardo da Vinci and Jules Verne. He explores the impact of physics on the areas of computer science, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, alternative energy and space travel. Kaku scientifically predicts what new technologies will enter in the following decades, what will be achieved by the mid-21st century, and finally what we will accomplish by the end of it.The narrative, introducing prospects of controlling computers through the human mind, resurrecting extinct animals, travelling to other planets and genetically enhancing our disease resistance, is exciting to read. The author claims that we might even be able to bring back the Neanderthal. However, he pinpoints the ethical dilemmas associated with such achievements by quoting Richard Klein, an anthropologist at Stanford: “Are you going to put the Neanderthals in a zoo or in Harvard?”In the last chapter, Kaku introduces the reader to an imaginary character living in the 22nd century. Biologically, he is in his 70s but the age of his organs is mid-30s. He rides a self-driven car. Nano-bots monitor the crucial indicators of his health while roaming in his bloodstream. What distinguishes this book from works of science fiction is that every prediction in the book is based on research and supported by prototypes being developed across the globe.Kaku also analyses the economic and social history of our civilisation and explains that new technologies are the engines of both scientific and social change. He rightly points out that the economic recessions of the 1850s, 1920s and 2008 were due to the “speculative fever” created around specific sectors: the railroad, automotive stocks and real estate, respectively.He warns that when the British Empire was shifting its focus from scientific innovation to more mundane matters of power-play, the US was emerging as a leader in research and advancement of knowledge in all fields. However, if the majority of the US talent is going into the investment sector and managing the finances of others, in which region will the most brilliant minds pursue the cause of innovation and exploring the truth?Kaku further chalks out the ranking of civilisations which was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev — on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was mainly proposed to identify the powers of extra terrestrial intelligent civilisations and classify them into three types. Type I consumes planetary sources of energy, mainly sunlight that falls on their planet; Type II consumes all the energy produced by their sun, while Type III consumes the energy produced by all the stars of their galaxy. Our current status is perhaps that of a Type 0 since we consume the energy of dead plants (oil and coal). Kaku estimates that given the economic growth rate we will be able to achieve the status of a Type I civilisation by the end of the century.Physics of the Future not only tells us what is probable and possible in the future, it also gives researchers and inventors a timescale to measure their successes against. Moreover, it makes the reader feel excited about the times we are living in, when we can expect ‘miracles’ to happen in our lifetimes. Kaku points out that “By 2100, our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared.”SOURCE: http://www.dawn.com/news/634292/non-f..."
31,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,2,"I'm not sure about anybody's ability to predict a century into the future (especially if you give credence to the idea of accelerating returns in technology), but I was willing to give this book a shot after hearing Michio Kaku in interviews. In particular he piqued my curiosity with the claim that all the ideas in the book are grounded on currently existing prototypes or established scientific theory.Now after having read it, I think Michio is only giving a survey of some select topics, and the only ones that I think he handled well were the ones most closely linked to physics (e.g. space travel, nanotechnology & quantum behavior, global power generation). The other fields he dives into, particularly his analysis and extrapolation of consumer technologies, were disappointingly off target or lacking in proper depth.The book is occasionally so superficial in its treatment of some prototyped technologies that it reads somewhat like painfully outdated sci-fi from Michio's childhood in the 50's. The book is written to be highly accessible, but he does uninformed readers a disservice by giving equal weight to illogical and 'improbable but not impossible' possibilities. My biggest problem with his predictions are that they center on only a set of technologies that Kaku has experience with, extrapolated all the way out to 2100 without much consideration of how all the unmentioned possibilities will change his visions for the future.As an example, Michio doesn't do the best job keeping our present circumstances and his far future predictions from mixing anachronistically: e.g. the frequently repeated ""...when we carry around our own genomes on a CD-ROM"" for a ""2030-2070"" range prediction. I worry that Michio Kaku is just paraphrasing some of the ideas out there without really thinking about them any more critically, like a mediocre science journalist or sci-fi writer. Again this could be an artifact of his intentionally writing this book to be broadly accessible, but I don't think he found the right balance.The best parts of the book are in the second half, particularly his chapters on The Future of: Energy, Space Travel, Wealth, and Humanity (respectively) and I did enjoy most of this material despite a scattering of the same problems mentioned above. Sadly, I think Michio Kaku completely botched his concluding chapter, ""A Day in the Life in 2100"", and I think the preceding Future of Humanity chapter would have been a much stronger ending. The ""Day in the Life"" conclusion is silly speculative fiction and the best (worst?) example in the entire book of his anachronistic and muddled sci-fi visions. Michio Kaku is great when talking about physics and large scale trends closely linked to humanity's knowledge of physics, but judging from this book alone he doesn't put together upcoming technologies into realistic or compelling future scenarios very well at all, ending up with an incomplete picture somewhere in the uncomfortable border between imaginative thinking and unwarranted speculation."
32,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,4,"This is a fascinating survey of what's actually happening in the cutting edge of science and technology. He walks through computers and vehicles and energy and space exploration and even culture. For each area he discussed deeply what's happening now, then gives thoughtful guesses to what will develop in early 21st century, mid-century, and late-century. His understanding of science is broad AND deep. His vision of the future of science is compelling. Some highlights: Tiny computer chips will be embedded in everything--almost literally--and we'll live in a cloud of data that's ridiculous. Robots will outnumber humans--but they won't be able to do anything but the physical tasks we program them to do (including driving our cars and planes). Magnetism will finally be mastered and we'll run our world on magnetic power rather than electric power. And by the end of the century remote control robots will be building a moon base for us to continue looking into the stars. However, I docked him a star because he displays a naive understanding of culture and history. He makes sweeping mistakes like seeing being religious as the enemy of science when history actually shows that many of the greatest science cultures were so precisely because of their religious beliefs, or his easy dismissal of cultural conflicts in the new world and his idea that once food and shelter are universal then haves and have nots won't be a real issue. So read this for the tech ideas and endure his comments about becoming like the gods of old and reaching cultural utopia. "
33,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Michio Kaku is a great science writer (as well as being a physics professor), but futurology is a difficult subject to make interesting and all too often what you get is lists of 'in the future you will have an X that will do Y,' which gets dull fairly quickly.Where Kaku's approach is good (which is to base his ideas on physics) is in the future of energy. His chapter on space exploration is good too - he is a great enthusiast for this, and that comes across strongly here. The only proviso is that the main controlling factor on space exploration is not science but politics. A man wasn't put on the moon for science, but to put the Russians in their place. We haven't done much manned exploration since for the same reason. It's too expensive for science to control things.To be honest I was even less convinced about the consumer technology ideas. If space exploration is driven by politics, consumer purchases are driven by the market. Yes, the science & technology has to be able to deliver (so you couldn't have an iPhone 10 years ago), but it doesn't decide what will and won't become popular.The book finishes with a chapter on the way the world will be a single civilization (even if nations still exist in a weakened form) by the end of the century. This seemed the least science-supported speculation. If anything we seem to be fragmenting more.All in all, a good try - but futurology remains closer to fiction than popular science."

I get that he was trying to summarize everything he'd written in the book in an interesting way, but I'm not a huge fan of 2nd person povs and it came off as annoying and unneeded. "
35,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070282-jenny-williams,5,"After reading this selection I strongly believe Michio Kaku is one of the brightest minds in his field. Physics Of The Impossible was an amazing book and this one blows it out of the water. I can't determine if I am so fond of it because of how advanced our technology will be in the near future or if I am truly fond of his writing. I know one thing for sure, some of the different advancements in technology is going to change the way we live life in way too many ways. What I mean by that is the advancement Kaku covers isn't technology like a new version of an XBOX or something of that sort. Michio Kaku covers advancement in technology like the worlds biggest atom smasher in Switzerland under a mountain, circling a mile exactly. This atom smasher is one of the biggest advancements in our technology opening doors to creating so much energy that we will be able to travel through space at a speed close to the speed of light. That's only the example I remembered best but there are so many throughout this book it excites you for our future. Kind of. "
36,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,3,"Since I had already read the book ""Visions"" by the same writer nearly three years ago, this one did not really generate much of an interest within me due to the much common material. Although, for someone who may have never read ""Visions"" or ""Physics of the Impossible"" (which too I had read in 2011-12), I strongly feel that ""Physics of the Future"" can tend to become very interesting if one likes to ponder on how technological the world is going to get within the next century, and how far will it be feasible to apply and integrate it within our daily lives.A Good Book, but a vast majority was already included amongst the first two of his books on the same genre. The chapter on the Future of Wealth, was kind of new though!A 3-star because the content was not new for me; otherwise I would rate it with a 4-star."

In fact, the action of the first film is kicked off by a message recorded in 3D by Princess Leia and conveyed by the robot...""

I understand that for those who know a lot about physics and technology, it may be to easy, but for such people as I am, it was great. Well, I didn't like everything what I read (especially, the beginning) but later it got much better. I really enjoyed topics about artificial intelligence and robotics, the future of medicine and genetics. I hope that many forecasts will come true."

44,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27777097-thomas-jacob-jr,3,"An enjoyable, cursory overview of some of the most exciting technological achievements we may expect mankind to engage with over the next century. I came across Michio Kaku, as I am sure many others have, by watching an interview on television a few years ago, and I was struck by his loquaciousness and intelligence. Describing contemporary scientific concepts, especially quantum physics, in a way that a layman can understand is no small feat. In Physics of the Future, Kaku focuses on several industries (private space exploration, computer technology, medicine, and others) and tries to predict what respective advances we may expect by 2100. Oftentimes he uses examples from popular science fiction, specifically Star Trek, as a frame of reference. This book definitely falls into the 'pop science' category, with only brief asides into more technical and mathematical information. Any fans of popular science fiction work in film, television, or literature will be already be aware of many of the concepts here, and truthfully, any one of them could easily fill an entire book by itself (the 'recommended reading' section at the end is a goldmine for further exploration). Kaku sometimes makes sweeping generalizations without going into further detail that may seem presumptuous, but it is usually in attempt to keep the pace light. Also, since this was written in 2011, some sections appear a little dated even only six years later (an entire section on private space exploration, for example, doesn't mention either Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos, two of the forerunners in this field). Recommended for those looking for a brief overview of some of the exciting advances in technology that we can expect to look forward to over the course of our lifetime. For those looking for a deeper dive into any of the aforementioned subjects, the dozens of recommended works at the end should serve as an excellent primer. "
45,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"Peering into the future of mankind and predicting what lies in store for us a few decades from now, has always been a dicey endeavour. In general, predictions pertaining to unchecked population growth, resultant famines, wars over access to resources, gloomy prospects for the future of developing nations etc have mostly proven to be unnecessary alarms rather than reality. A few major historical instances come to mind. Rev. Thomas Malthus in the late 18th century, Dr. Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University in the 1960s, and MIT's Club of Rome report in the 1970s were famous for damning our future, particularly that of India and China due to their large populations. We find that both India and China have done pretty well in the forty years since. On the other hand, predictions about the end of slavery, end of European colonialism, an era of less work and more leisure have all come true. It seems as though we tend to take both a gloomy and hopeful view of mankind and misjudge its potential for making correctives when it comes to how human beings, our societies, governments and institutions would behave in future under changing conditions.In contrast, predictions regarding scientific and technological advances in the fields of medicine, computers, biology, astronomy etc have more frequently proven to materialize successfully, at times sooner than expected. The Moore's Law comes to mind immediately. This book itself shows how accurately Jules Verne, in the mid 1800s, predicted life in Paris in the 1960s as consisting of skyscrapers, air-conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains and fax machines. It seems as if we have a better grasp of machines and man's interactions with them and the development of this man-machine future. This book by theoretical Physicist Michio Kaku, crystal-gazes into this future as led by the advance of science and technology. Even if one does not accept all the projections, we end up learning a lot on what stunning possibilities are out there as we live out this century.The book is organized on what we can expect in the near term (by 2030), the mid term (2030-2070) and the long term (2070-2100). The future is explored through the domains of Computers, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Medicine, Nanotechnology, Energy and Space Travel. But it is not just speculation from a Theoretical Physicist. The author had discussed with hundreds of scientists who actually work today on these ideas and had compiled out of this interaction, what is possible in these three time periods. The presentation and language in the book is simple and accessible even to the average non-science minded reader and that, in my view, is a great positive about the book. I shall outline here some of the future products and possibilities given by Dr.Kaku which grabbed my mind:MRI machines which are just a foot long, looking like cell phones which can be passed over the human body and detect cancer (2030)Computers which scan fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) patterns in the brain and decipher a person's stream of consciousness and thereby detect what he/she is thinking (2070-2100)Computers being able to reconstruct a person's facial features given a strand of DNA from that person'e hair or bloodTissue engineering to manufacture a whole body part by extracting a few cells from the bodyResurrection of extinct life forms like the Mammoth or the NeanderthalNano-particles which enter and kill only cancer cells and leave healthy tissue untouchedchanging one shape to another at the push of a button, just like the T-1000 in 'Terminator-2'Molecular Replicators, capable of creating almost anything we want, the same way that nature can “take hamburgers and vegetables and turn them into a baby.”Fusion plants dotting the countryside by mid centuryLanding on an asteroid or on a moon of planet Mars, Space ElevatorsThe final couple of chapters deal with the future of humanity, planetary civilizations and how life would look in 2100. One can feel the child-like enthusiasm of Dr.Kaku in writing about all these possibilities and it makes the book enjoyable reading. He uses references to popular sci-fi movies from Hollywood to illustrate many of the ideas. In fact, as I read the book, I developed a greater respect for movie makers like that of the Terminator, Matrix, Star Wars, Avatar and so on.We have heard recently of anxieties being expressed about Artificial Intelligence and its destructive potential by luminaries like Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The eminent futurist, Ray Kurzweil has suggested in his work 'The Singularity is Near' that by 2045, a $1000 computer would be a billion times more intelligent than all humans combined and hence creating an uncontrolled runaway singularity. But others like Douglas Hofstadter and Mitch Kapor have dismissed these notions. This book discusses this topic substantially and believes that mankind will develop 'friendly AI' and use it to enhance itself rather than letting itself be ruled by mean-minded robots. Dr.Kaku shows six reasons why there are major roadblocks to such a singularity.On the negative side, just as in other books on the future, this one also has its tiresome speculation on the 'sick men of Asia'. Dr.Kaku quotes a report by Peter Schwartz of the Global Business Network on the dire future that is likely in the demographic nightmare of South Asia. Sea level rise due to Global warming in the latter half of this century could cause massive flooding and chaos, resulting in millions of refugees across the borders of Bangladesh into India. Governments could lose all authority and collapse, resulting in nightmarish looting and rioting. Rising tensions and chaos and inability to control may result in nations resorting to nuclear weapons!It is only scientists who tell us that Human societies, weather and climate are non-linear systems and even a very small change could have a massive effect, called the butterfly effect, making it difficult to predict the long-term futures. Then, I don't see how the author is so sure of destructive global warming in the future and also the consequent behavior of south Asians. In spite of being repeatedly wrong, futurists cannot seem to resist making dire predictions for the future of nations with large populations.The book is enjoyable reading and educative as well. I strongly recommend reading it. Even though Physics plays an important role in all the science that is discussed in the book, I am unsure of whether 'Physics of the Future' is the most meaningful title for the book. When I picked up the book initially, I thought it would be a book on String Theory."
46,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645507-jason-schneeberger,5,"I don't usually do book reviews this long anymore, but this one that I won't soon forget. If ever. Based off of the known laws of nature, author and world renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku met with, and interviewed, 300 of the leading scientists in the world about what our world will be like in the year 2100 through the ever increasing advancements of technology. This book lays out the most likely scenario of computers, AI, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel and wealth from those interviews and how they will shape the world by the year 2100.Oh what a fantastic and thought provoking book this was! It's great to read a book about the future that isn't nihilistic, apocalyptic and negative, but rather hopeful and full of wonder! Sure, the very real threats of chaos, nuclear war, global warming etc are addressed in this book, but in ways that give rise to ways around such problems instead of weakly giving into them.I'm always wondering why every sci-fi movie based in the future has to be apocalyptic, or negative about where the world is going? It's easy to see the bad decisions we are making as humans that drive this thinking and make it seem like a sure reality to come, but where are the optimistic stories? Where are the stories that show us prospering and thriving as a world in the future? Those ideas and thoughts are in this book! Hopefully some good screenwriters and filmmakers will get inspired and make a movie based off the ideas in this book. I want to see it! Almost all of us alive now will not get to experience the world in the year 2100. Not unless of course the age reversal science described in the book becomes a reality (and it seems as though it's a very real possibility in the second half of this century), but this book brings much to the imagination of looking out a window, into the world at the dawn of the 22nd century. I can't say think of anything bad to say about this one. I absolutely loved everything about it. BUY IT!"
47,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Informed speculations engagingly presentedIt’s easy to see that Professor Kaku had a lot of fun writing this book since more than anything (at least for this reader) this book was a pleasure to read.Typically Kaku begins each chapter with some reference to the ancient gods or some other form of mythology or folklore, mainly for contrast or to highlight human yearnings that are being fulfilled today or may be fulfilled in the near future. He then mixes in some science fiction movies, stories or novels that he likes or finds instructive (or not). He adds some personal research and experiences with some of the great minds of our time as he makes his predictions, speculations and guesses on where we are going and when we are going to get there. Partly because of his celebrity and partly because of his wide-ranging knowledge and sharp intelligence (not to mention his charm) Kaku is able to talk with Nobel Prize winners and other cutting edge scientists and engineers all over the world the way most people talk to their neighbors. Areas of interest, each with its own chapter are computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth (i.e., economics), and what life will be like in the future on a day-to-day basis. Each chapter gives Kaku’s speculations for the “Near Future (Present to 2030),” “Midcentury (2030 to 2070),” and the “Far Future (2070 to 2100).”I’m going to try to NOT second guess Kaku but I do want to focus on a few areas of personal interest and add a comment or two. “It is a law of evolution that fitter species arise to displace unfit species; and perhaps humans will be lost in the shuffle, eventually winding up in zoos where our robotic creations come to stare at us…Perhaps that is our role in history, to give birth to our evolutionary successors.” (p. 100)I think this is likely, especially if you add our genetically engineered successors. If so we can then think of ourselves as the “intelligent designers” of the demigods to come.Kaku weighs in on the possibility of our robotic creations becoming more intelligent than humans. (Seems very likely.) He speculates on robots producing “ever-smarter” robots that might “devour the resources of the planet in their insatiable quest to become ever more intelligent.” (p. 101) This can be seen as a near corollary of the idea that robots will become our masters and take over the planet. Since robots can only do what is programmed into them, these ideas depend on poor or malicious programming. (Beware the black hats of the future!)On page 116 Kaku points out that “there is no universally accepted definition of ‘smart.’” He doesn’t elaborate but I want to say that the unstated question is “smart for what”? Is the goal, e.g., happiness or world domination? A different kind of smarts might be required in each case.In talking about what jobs will still be available for humans in the midcentury future, Kaku makes the excellent point that those jobs will require “nonrepetitive work that requires pattern recognition.” (p. 305) He includes garbage collectors, police officers, construction workers, gardeners, and plumbers. However where I live as soon as they get a robot to drive the truck garbage collection will be a completely automated task. We have plastic containers set out on the street which are picked up and emptied by a mechanical arm from the truck. (Yes, the future is now.)In Chapter 8 “Future of Humanity” Kaku presents Nikolai Kardashev’s Type I, II, and III Civilizations based on energy consumption. (A Type II civilization, for example, consumes all the energy from their sun.) What I found interesting is Kaku’s statement that we “are leading to a single point: the creation of a planetary civilization.” (p. 327) I think the term “planetary civilization” is what we need to replace the currently (in some quarters) offensive term, “world government.”Kaku makes the sharp point that movies with “cross-cultural themes…packed with internationally recognized celebrities, are big money makers for Hollywood.” He sees this as “evidence of an emerging planetary culture.” (p. 334) He adds on the next page that “Local cultures will continue to survive, coexisting side by side with the larger global culture.”Some of Kaku’s dreams (perhaps) are room temperature super conductors and space elevators, to name just two that are highly speculative but would be amazing if realized.In the chapter on artificial intelligence, Kaku gives his three-pointed definition of consciousness. (Actually with becoming modesty he writes, “…if I were to venture a guess.”) In my book “The World Is Not as We Think It Is” I also give a three-pointed definition:“One: awareness of the world (including awareness of our self and our processes, that is, self-awareness).Two: self-identity. Notice that awareness of self is different from this identification with self.Three: experience or sensation, the feelings we get when we experience the world. This is sometimes called “phenomenal consciousness.” An example would be the subjective experience of the color red, or the taste of a strawberry.” (p. 82)Here is Kaku’s delineation from page 97:“1. sensing and recognizing the environment2. self-awareness3. planning for the future by setting goals and plans, that is, simulating the future and plotting strategy.”The slight differences are instructive. He leaves out self-identification, perhaps rightly so; and I leave out planning for the future. Also I presume that Kaku includes self-awareness in his first component. Personally I would include planning for the future in my first component, “awareness of the world” as well; however to emphasize “simulating the future” is a fine thing to do since humans are on another level in the animal kingdom when it comes to imagining what might happen.I should mention that in writing this book Kaku did not just tune into the zeitgeist but actually read prognosticators from the past. Two who did well were Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Condorcet. Since Kaku’s predictions are mostly favorable for humans, I hope his predictions do as well. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Hard Science and the Unknowable”"
48,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227342-richard,3,"Michio Kaku's book, Physics of the Future, concludes with a comprehensive prediction of what life will like in 2100 as the subtitle indicates. The majority of the book is made up of predictions about how technology will evolve in the intervening years.The book was written in 2011, so some its contents are already dated. Interestingly, certain predictions about the near future have already come to pass. Other predictions appear to be a little delayed. To be clear, Mr. Kaku is very humble in the introduction about the ability to predict the future. One of the concrete statements he makes about the future is the idea there is a great deal to be optimistic about. He examines individuals in the past who were pessimistic about the development of technology, and he shows how wrong these individuals proved to be in time. For this reason, I think he is correct to say the future belongs to the optimists.I enjoyed the book; however, I don't think it is worth more than 3 stars. It has some important ideas, but the audience is narrow to a certain extant. It seems to offer inspiration to the future scientists who will make these breakthroughs; however, it isn't as relevant to the average reader. We will eventually see the changes predicted, but they are mostly decades away. "
49,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,4,"This is a great book by a great physicist. I only rate it 4 stars because his thoughts and predictions can only be tested in 2100. I promise to raise my rating to 5 starts in 2100 if his predictions are correct. That is because according to Michio Kaku medicine will evolve greatly allowing people to live a lot longer than now. Not that I don't plan on living for 113 years as it is.The reader will find insights about the future of computers and AI, medicine and nanotechnology, space travel and energy. Kaku also takes on the nature of humanity as a whole in the next 100 years.And bear in mind these are not the predictions of Nostradamus, Michi Kaku knows first hand what he writes about."
50,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55246199-erin,3,"I love Michio Kaku! I'm only giving this one 3 Stars because it is pretty similar to some of his other works and he repeats these concepts. This is only noticable since I have read his other books, but if you haven't and are interested in theoretical physics, give this a try!"
51,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20481392-james-biser,4,"This scientist has an interesting view of what will happen at the end of the current century. Because he studies what is happening with our culture, he can anticipate what advancements will be made and when we can expect them. This is a good read:"
52,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080484-teji,4,"The author’s passion for both physics and science-fiction is evident throughout this piece of speculative non-fiction. The work explores several areas of emerging technology and applied science, not just quantum physics. As the author notes, his predictions are “reasoned estimates of when the prototype technologies of today will finally reach maturity”. His extrapolation of what he thinks is likely to occur in the near (2010-2030), mid (2030-20700, and far (2070-2100) future, are intriguing and thought provoking. The organization is very repetitive-- almost as if it were written as a series of articles that were later post-edited into a book format (although I don't think that is the case). Also, the writing is a little dry in places-- but not intolerably so. Additionally, when speaking of the future, the author tends to geek out and engage in overwrought, almost giddy, statements about the “godlike” powers technology will grant humans within the next century. These flaws aside, overall, the writing is coherent and accessible. It will be interesting to see how well his forecasts for the next couple of decades hold-up.Quotes(view spoiler)[[In his novel, Paris in the Twentieth Century, written in 1863, Jules Verne] “predicted that Paris in 1960 would have glass skyscrapers, air conditioning, TV, elevators, high-speed trains, gasoline-powered automobiles, fax machines, and even something resembling the Internet…just a few years later he made another spectacular prediction. In 1865, he wrote From the Earth to the Moon, in which he predicted the details of the mission that sent our astronauts to the moon…He accurately predicted the size of the space capsule to within a few percent, the location of the launch site in Florida…the weightlessness that the astronauts would experience, and the final splashdown in the ocean…How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself he constantly sought out scientists…He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. Verne, more than others, realized that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles.” -Introduction“Another great prophet of technology was Leonardo da Vinci, painter, thinker, and visionary…Like Jules Verne, Leonardo was able to get profound insights into the future by consulting a handful of forward-thinking individuals of his time…In addition, Leonardo was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality.” -Introduction“As William Gibson…once said, ‘The future is already here. It’s just unevenly distributed.” -Introduction“Predictions for the future, with a few exceptions, have always underestimated the pace of technological progress.” -IntroductionThere are four fundamental forces in nature that drive the entire universe: gravity (unlocking the force of gravity helped to pave the way for the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of steam power, especially the locomotive), electromagnetic force (this unleashed the electronic revolution that has created a bounty of scientific wonders), and the two nuclear forces: the weak and strong forces. “When Einstein wrote down e=mc^2 and when the atom was split in the 1930s, scientists for the first time began to understand the forces that light up the heavens…the secret behind the stars…it also held out the promise that one day we would be able to harness this power on the earth”… quantum theory “has given us the transistor, the laser, and the digital resolution that is the driving force behind modern society. -Introduction“Exponential growth is often hard to grasp, since our minds think linearly. It is so gradual that you sometimes cannot experience the change at all. But over decades, it can completely alter everything around us. According to Moore's law, every Christmas your new computer games are almost twice as powerful (in terms of the number of transistors) as those from the previous year. Furthermore, as the years pass, this incremental gain becomes monumental. For example, when you receive a birthday card in the mail, it often has a chip that sings ‘Happy Birthday’ to you. Remarkably, that chip has more computer power than all the Allied forces of 1945. Hitler, Churchill, or Roosevelt might have killed to get that chip…Today, your cell phone has more computer power than all of NASA back in 1969, when it placed two astronauts on the moon…” Ch1“Today, when we enter a room, we automatically look for the light switch since we assume that the walls are electrified. In the future, the first thing we will do on entering a room…is to assume the room is intelligent…Around 2020, the price of a chip may also drop to about a penny…then we will have millions of chips distributed everywhere in our environment, silently carrying out our orders.” -Ch1“One reason why Moore's law has relentlessly increased the power of chips is because UV light can be tuned so that its wavelength is smaller and smaller, making it possible to etch increasingly tiny transistors onto silicon wafers. Since UV light has a wavelength as small as 10 nanometers, this means that the smallest transistor that you can etch is thirty atoms across…But this process cannot go on forever…You can even calculate roughly when Moore’s law will finally collapse: when you finally hit transistors the size of individual atoms… According to the laws of physics, eventually the Age of Silicon will come to a close, as we enter the Post-Silicon Era. Transistors will be so small that quantum theory or atomic physics takes over and electrons leak out of the wires…At that point, according to the laws of physics, the quantum theory takes over. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that you cannot know both the position and the velocity of any particle…at the atomic level you simply cannot know where the electron is, so it can never be confined precisely in an ultrathin wire or layer and it necessarily leaks out, causing the circuit to short-circuit.” Ch1“However, scans of the human brain clearly show that thinking is spread out over large parts of the brain...Digital computers can calculate at nearly the speed of light. he human brain, by contrast, is incredibly slow. Nerve impulses travel at an excruciatingly slow pace of about 200 miles per hour. But the brain more than makes up for this because it is massively parallel… In a race, a superfast single processor is left in the dust by a superslow parallel processor.” Ch2“While hardware had grown [exponentially] by the ability to etch smaller and smaller transistors onto a wafer, software is totally different; it requires a human to sit down with a pencil and paper to write code. That is the bottleneck: the human. Software, like all human creative activity, progresses in fits and starts, with brilliant insights and long stretches of drudgery and stagnation.” Ch2“…genetic analysis shows that aging is concentrated in the ""engine"" of the cell, the mitochondria, or the cell’s power plant. This has allowed scientists to…look for ways to accelerate the gene repair process inside the mitochondria to reverse the effects of aging.” Ch3“Normally, we don’t see quantum forces at work in everyday life. But quantum forces are everywhere…if we are largely empty, then why can’t we walk through walls?...The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons can exit in the same quantum state. Hence, when two nearly identical electrons get too close, they repel each other. This is the reason objects appear to be solid, which is an illusion…When we sit on a chair...we are hovering above the chair, floating less than a nanometer above it, repelled by the chair’s electrical and quantum forces.” Ch4“The quantum theory has only one thing going for it: it is correct. Its accuracy has been measured to one part in ten billion, making it the most successful physical theory of all time.” Ch4“Science and technology are the engines of prosperity…” Ch7“The combination of changing social conditions and the mastery of the four forces propelled Europe to the forefront of nations. But technologies are dynamic, changing all the time. They are born, evolve, and rise and fall…technologies obey certain laws of evolution. Mass technologies usually evolve in four basic stages…In stage I, the products of technology are so precious that they are closely guarded. Paper, when it was invented in the form of papyrus by the ancient Egyptians…was so precious that one papyrus scroll was closely guarded by scores of priests…Paper entered stage II around 1450, when Gutenberg invented the movable type…one person could possess one book containing the knowledge of hundreds of scrolls. Before Gutenberg, there were only 30,000 books in all Europe. By 1500, there were 9 million books…By around 1930, paper hit stage III, when the cost fell to a penny a sheet. This made possible the personal library, where one person could possess hundreds of books. Paper became an ordinary commodity…Paper is everywhere and nowhere, invisible and ubiquitous. Now we are in stage IV, where paper is a fashion statement. We decorate our world with paper of all colors, shapes, and sizes. The largest source of urban waste is paper. So paper evolved from being a closely guarded commodity to being waste.” Running water, electricity, and computer have followed the same pattern. Ch7“But as technologies evolve, they create abrupt changes in the economy that sometimes lead to social dislocations. In any revolution, there are winners and losers…What jobs will flourish by midcentury? How will the evolution of technology change the way we work? We can partially determine the answer by asking a simple question: What are the limitations of robots? As we have seen, there are at least two basic stumbling blocks to artificial intelligence: pattern recognition and common sense. Therefore, the jobs that will survive in the future are…ones that require these two abilities.” Ch7“Developing nations may be able to take advantage of the information revolution. They can, in principle, leapfrog past the developed nations in many areas. In the developed world, telephone companies had to tediously wire up every home or farm at great cost. But a developing nation does not have to wire up its country, since cell phone technology can excel in rural areas without any roads or infrastructure. Also, developing nations have the advantage that they do not have to rebuild an aging infrastructure…” Ch7“…the Unites States has maintained its dominance in science and technology in spite of the fact that U.S. students often score dead last when it comes to essential subjects like science and math…(It should also be pointed out that this ranking corresponds roughly to the number of days that students were in school. China, which ranked number 1, averaged 251 days of instruction per year, while the United States averaged only 178 days per year.) It seems like a mystery that, despite these awful numbers, the United States continues to do well internationally in science and technology, until you realize that much of the U.S science [talent] comes from overseas. The United States has a secret weapon, the H1B visa…But the H1B visa is only a stopgap measure. The United States cannot continue to live off foreign scientists, many of whom are beginning to return to China and India as their economies improve…The United States will eventually have to overhaul its archaic, sclerotic education system. At present, poorly prepared high school students flood the job market and universities…Employers continually bemoan the fact that they have to take one year to train their new hires to bring them up to speed. And the universities are burdened by having to create new layers of remedial courses to compensate for the poor high school education system…” Ch7“When physicists try to analyze civilizations, we rank them on the basis of the energy they consume. This ranking was first introduced in 1964 by Russian astrophysicists Nikolai Kardashev…he proposed three theoretical types: A Type I civilization is planetary, consuming the sliver of sunlight that falls on their planet, or about 10^17 watts. A Type II civilization is stellar, consuming all the energy that their sun emits, or 10^27 watts. A Type III civilization is galactic, consuming the energy of billions of stars, or about 10^37 watts…Each type is separated by a factor of 10 billion: a Type III civilization consumes 10 billion times more energy than at Type II civilization…which in turn consumes 10 billion times more energy than a Type I civilization. According to the classification, our present-day civilization is Type 0. We don’t even rate on this scale, since we get our energy from dead plants, that is from oil and coal. (Carl Sagan, generalizing this classification...[estimated] that we are actually a Type .7 civilization…we can mathematically estimate that we will attain Type I status in about 100 years, given an average rate of economic growth.” Ch8“Also, if room temperature superconductors are found in this century, it means a complete overhaul of our energy requirements. Waste heat, in the form of friction, will be greatly reduced, increasing the efficiency of our machines. As we mentioned, the majority of our energy consumption, especially transportation, goes into overcoming friction…it would take almost no energy to move from California to New York if there were no friction.” Ch8 (hide spoiler)]"
53,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9619705-anna,0,I just want to see an updated version of this book explaining why most of short term predictions didn't work out.
54,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,2,"The book was extremely informative about current trends in science (and some technology). It lives up to its title in discussing physics of the future. The author is a skilled writer who is gifted at communicating highly abstract and obscure ideas.So why only two stars?I did have some issues with the overall books and how this project was carried out. Some were more troubling than others. The major issues include:1) Too much scientific triumphalism -- The clear storyline in the book is that science will render most of the troubles of life either moot or less relevant. Diseases will go away, aging will be suppressed, and immortality lies around the corner! Hovercraft will be developed, robots will be everywhere and solve our problems, and traditional issues of scarcity re health and food will go away. I suspect that this technological paradise is being oversold, just a bit. Lifespan has been extended, but arguably more by prenatal and care for newborns, coupled with public health measures such as mass inoculation coupled with the aggressive combating of traditional killers like smallpox. We still haven't figured out much regarding the flu or the common cold! Yes there has been progress, but is heaven really that near? Have we proven ourselves worthy of godlike status?2) There is very little on economics throughout the book. The author has apparently read some of Thurow's futurist work but not much else. Science and technology need to be brought to market and commercialized before they can hope to revolutionize our lives. Perhaps the government will do it all?? Well the government might fund defense research and NSF grants but last I heard it still did limited work on commercialization.3) What about politics? The twentieth century brought amazing advances in science and technology but also rule by thugs, gangsters, and murderers that applied technology to the extermination of millions. Oh Brave New World . . . . !4) The author pushes his futurist motivation -- using a near future, mid future, and far future framework, but in the end it comes down to extrapolation between two poles - heaven or catastrophe, with the chance of catastrophe severely discounted. Not much of a choice!5) The author raises the need for education in science and technology, suggesting that they have read Goldin and Katz, but only talk about it in the context of H1B visas and information intensive jobs that go wanting. What about the increasing numbers of people in the US who are almost completely left out of the new age because of their poor education and training? Kaku may be setting up the world of Wells' Time Machine without knowing it. How can we move into a scientific and technology heaven, when most people are fit to work at Wal-Mart at best? What will all the dummies do once the robots take over our jobs? . . . which negative utopia comes to mind? the Matrix??6) This could be partially excused, since no author is perfect and the book is informative. What is more troubling about the book is that it is two or three chapters too long and the extra chapters detract from the book's value. Once the author moves from the descriptive and commentary and mild extrapolation in most ot the book to a more normative tone when he discusses the evolution of a planetary civilization, he loses me completely. He takes a framework by Kardashev to identify civilizations we might encounter from space and order them by energy use (???) and applies it to how our civilization might develop. Note here, we are using a framework with absolutely no data or experience behind it, with the exception of the sci-fi movie genre, and turning it into the summary framework for a book purporting to provide an update to general readers on the state of research in physics!! Needless to say I was not convinced and was chuckling - for the wrong reasons -- as I worked through the end of the book. This appears to be a common problem in big reach synthesis boos -- Ian Morris' book on why the West rules comes to mind, although the latter is a much better book overall.5) By the end of the book, I was wondering if there were particular reasons why Kaku appeared to have ""lost it"" when he just should have stopped writing fifty pages sooner.6) Overall, I don't regret reading it. I just regret finishing it."
55,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12945730-jack-ferreira,3,"I like Michio Kaku, he seems like a pretty cool, down to earth guy. I'll get some criticism out of the way, because overall I did enjoy the book.I have seen interviews and tv shows he's been in and though I do like him sometimes his atitude bothers me for some reason. I can't quite put my finger on it, maybe it has something to do with this slightly over-pandering way of explaining things. It looks like he thinks the only way his readers will understand what he's saying is by constantly referencing Star Treck, Star Wars and other products of science fiction which really isn't needed. I understood him perfectly well when he talked about portable MRI machines and DNA chips before he felt the need to display a picture of a Star Treck ""tricorder"" (just in case we couldn't grasp the idea by ourselves). I thought these constant references were a bit odd because this isn't a hard book to comprehend. It's not necessarily insulting but at the same time it feels a little condescending. This is especialy present in the final chapter (""A Day in a Life in 2100""). It was completely unecessary and cringeworthy, he may be a great theoretical physicist but he is not a great writer (outside of non-fiction, at least). That said, I learnt a lot from this book. I will probably forget most of it, I admit, but it made me feel up to date on our current technological advancements. I liked the way he split up each chapter, making it nicely organized and easy to navigate through. It was great reading about realistic predictions for the future of computers, AI, energy, nanotechnology and space travel. The future of wealth was also discussed which took me by surprise and I sincerely apreciated it, since it really is something important to consider.As he talks about the future of humanity he introduces some very interesting concepts. It leaves me excited for things to come and curious of how it will change our way of life.Obviously, we should all take these predictions with a grain of salt. I'm sure Michio Kaku has more or less figured out the near future, but up to the year 2100 he gets quite vague. Some people see it as a bad thing, but I don't blame him. Any book we read, from an author who goes out of his areas of expertise must not be taken for granted. I have seen people comment on misuse of terminology and a lot of non consideration for alternate scenarios. This is why I love people like Richard Dawkins, who write books within their fields and whose content I absolutely trust.It's a nice book if you don't look upon it as a definitive guide to the future.I am now in the mood for some science fiction though."
56,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53461468-rasty,5,"Its amazing when you first read that book , it's not about how science developed or anything like that , but its about how science will develop and will shape our destiny or thoughts to our whole world , michio kaku one of my favorite writers about science , and that was amazing from him :)"
57,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526063-mary-jean-harris,3,"This was quite a good book with lots of fascinating predictions for the future, as well as a survey of technologies currently being developed. I'd give it 3.5 stars (you need 1/2 stars, Goodreads!). Michio Kaku writes about the places he's visited, mostly research labs, that are working on new technologies, including bioengineering, nanotechnology, quantum computers, robotics, gene therapy, self-driving cars, space travel, and space elevators. Kaku's enthusiasm for these future changes is undying throughout the book, and it makes an enjoyable read. I can't agree with him that all this will result in positive change for the future though, especially as technology becomes more invasive and embedded into our lives, drawing us even further apart from the natural world as well as opening up the possibility for people (and governments and organizations) to control us in this system. It sounds eerily similar to the matrix, but Kaku doesn't seem overly concerned about any of these issues.Additionally, Kaku unfortunately falls into the trap of global warming hysteria: he takes it for granted that humanity is causing a climate crisis, a position that is highly contented and strewn with propaganda. As a scientist analysing a complicated issue, Kaku does not apply his own standards of rational inquiry to this issue and instead accepts the politically correct position that, even if he dug a little deep into the issue before writing the book, he would realize is not supported by many climate scientists.Also, although I liked the last chapter about ""a day in the life in 2100"" overall, it was really corny and, for some reason, the main guy we're following works at an office with only men...do no females work in the industry?. Also, this online dating stuff has become prevalent and people just do it naturally, something I find really creepy.But despite these problems with the book, it was a great read overall and definitely accessible to the general public."
58,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4617137-sangita-takhur,4,"To me the big question is: how fast will our technology progress in the coming years? I know it is very difficult to give a solid logical answer to this question. I liked the book but I do not agree with Kaku on many points. I think Kaku used almost a linear model for predicting the future. I think we need more imaginative power for predicting the future. Like Kaku I too believe that, gene technology, computers, artificial intelligence and robots will advance rapidly. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. Future of the Computer: Mind over Matter, 2. Future of AI: Rise of the Machines, 3. Future of Medicine: Perfection and Beyond, 4. Nanotechnology: Everything from Nothing?, 5. Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars, 6. Future of Space Travel: To the Stars, 7. Future of Wealth, 8. Future of Humanity: Planetary Civilization, and 9. A Day in the Life in 2100. Kaku's approach is excellent, as if he is talking to a lay person, but he writes with a simple eloquence that makes these complex concepts accessible to the non-Physicist mind.Michio is too good in predicting the limitations of the technologies. One may argue that Michio's idea of robots and computers is similar to the AI from the movies in the 1990s, but we have to think year 2020 much brighter. Development on medicine, synthetic biology and nanotechnology is almost ignored. I was expecting more about quantum biology but that too is missing. But overall I liked the book. The book is good enough to stimulate our imagination."
59,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153756-jeffrey,4,"A fascinating look at how the world might change in the future, while also giving some good basic information on various subjects - for example, Kaku breaks down how gene therapy works, and also what it could lead to. Kaku's style of writing is informative and accessible, and the only time I found myself starting to lose focus was during the fictional narrative covering a typical day in 2100. In a way, that section suffers from a lack of imagination in what people would be like, despite having well thought out possibilities for technology; it seems more like an example of what someone from today would act like if we had all of that technology today. Still, that got me thinking about things... like, one hundred years ago, someone wouldn't have even been able to conceive of the internet, but even if they could imagine it, they probably wouldn't be able to foresee the rise of things like social media, youtube, etc. and how those things are changing the way humanity deals with privacy and public appearance.Kaku's pretty optimistic about the future (he even only mentions the idea of humanity going extinct one time), so this book is at times almost like a really well researched version of the cliched utopian future. Fortunately the book's foundation is in science and balances that vision with various realistic possibilities, and in any case it's a great source of basic information related to physics for the layperson."
60,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5559878-tyler-bray,5,"An awesome read!You may know Michio Kaku from documentaries pertaining to space and physics that have aired on the Discovery and History Channels. Professor Kaku teaches theoretical physics at the City University of New York. Michio Kaku sent out to interview different scientists in multiple fields to help him paint a picture of what the future may be like for humanity. He breaks his book up into different topics such as computer science, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, etc... Each chapter is broken up into three sections. Near future (present - 2030), midcentury (2030-2070), and distant future (2070 - 2100). Kaku does not speculate any farther than the date 2100. Many writers have tried to guess what the future for humanity may look like based off of cool ideas they think will come about through technology. The draw of this book is that you are reading from a perspective of an actual scientist talking with other scientists about their field and what the future for that field holds. Professor Kaku is optimistic in areas such as computer science, gene therapy, medicine, and nanotechnology, while he is less optimistic in areas such as artificial intelligence, cancer treatments (although finding it will be easier), and space travel.This was an extremely fun and insightful read, and I would recommend it to anyone who may be curios about what's around the corner in terms of our technological advancements. "
61,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"I listen to a lot of science-based podcasts so I found some of this book to be a rehash of things I already knew about or was familiar with, but the balance of the book I found very interesting. Kaku presents a ""Star Trek"" position on the future - one that is shiny and optimistic, rather than one of gloom and doom that you hear about from some pundits. In each section he goes right to leading experts to get their take on what the future holds. One of my favorite parts of the book was actually about the past - the history of science. Kaku explains how the Middle East and China were once leaders in scientific discoveries while Europe languished, but religious and social fundamentalism moved in to stifle scientific thinking while religion eased it's grip on the West and the tables turned. Today some of these same fundamentalist groups would rather see civilization return to the middle ages rather than increase their knowledge of the world and universe. Sad. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in science, it is certainly full of big ideas and a neat vision of the future. "
62,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79309757-robert-banas,5,"Michio Kaku is one of the smartest people in the world today. Knowing that, I thought that reading this book would be very difficult to understand. However, Kaku makes a lot of sense even though he is discussing very high tech and complicated things. One of the coolest quotes from this book was,""There is a big difference between someone who lives forever and someone who has a life span so long that it hasn't been measured yet"" (421). I thought this quote was really important because it is a pretty good summary of one of the book's themes which was what if. If AI technology and medicine improve greatly in the next 100 years, humans could possibly be living for hundreds of years. The book itself was really intriguing to me. I never was really interested in engineering and science but after reading this, I want to learn more about new, cool inventions. One of the flaws in this book is in the title. It is called ""Physics of the Future"" when it should be called ""Technology of the Future"" in my opinion. The last chapter is really cool as Kaku puts you in a day in the life in the year 2100. Hopefully we can be alive to see if his predictions come true."
63,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4365331-jimmy-ng,5,"This book is very much like Visions, another book written by Kaku published in the 1990s. In both books, he attempts to predict technological advancements and its implications to people living in the future. What sets this book different than so many others is that Kaku calls himself an ""insider"" (Kaku is a world renowned theoretical physicist who works on string theory). With his connections, he is able to actually interview and get input from the scientists and engineers who actually make technological growth happen! This way, Kaku, along with everyone else that brings us the future, is able to explain to readers counter intuitive, yet reasonably accurate, predictions. Back in 1990, he accurately predicted many things in Visions that have actually come to past. In POTF, he attempts to predict a century into the future. Although it is the case that the further into the future one predicts, the less accurate those predictions become, I believe Kaku has something going for him given his ""track record"" with Visions."
64,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/184044-steven,4,"I enjoyed Michio Kaku’s Physics of the Future. It is non-fiction that borders on being speculative fiction. What will the future be like? Are there any wonders that we can predict? Obviously, there are a large number that we can’t. But some we can.Kaku’s premise was to write only about those things that are actively being worked on and to predict only through the year 2100. So there are computers that are comodities. There are self driving cars. There are medical nanobots. There are fusion energy sources.What was particularly interesting was to read or hear about the things discussed in this book, new ideas that are suddenly realities. So as of today there are 5 states in which autonomous driving cars are already legal, on the roads for testing. And a few days ago nanobots were able to be pushed around inside human cells.If you wonder about the future and enjoy reading such speculations than this is a great book. The writing is so-so. But that is not why you would be reading it. I give it 4 stars for its content, not it’s writing."
65,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22668495-jaanika,4,"Easy to read, entertaining and inspiring collection of ideas that may be future for us. Although some people have some words to say about too many references to mythologies, philosophers, TV series or movies then I enjoyed them because it helped to create more connections. Different topics and chapters made the book interesting, versatile and easy to understand. As I read it in my mother tongue Estonian then I wasn't too happy about the editing..so many mistakes that it seemed already that they didn't read it through before publishing. In the last chapter when imaging the life of person living in 2100 the style was a bit funny and awkward. I definetely enjoyed Kaku's natural describing style more than that. All together nice book and I am waiting forward to see the future and maybe even reading this book again in 2100! :DPS! If You are max level scientiest then of course this book is not for you - it's still the popular science. Or maybe it is..if you want to know how to speak about science with a ordinary people without scientistic background."
66,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4707001-sharon-dodge,4,"Kaku knows what he's talking about; not only a physicist, he's the co-founder of string field theory. As wildly outrageous as many of his assertions may first appear, he is a man of science, interested in practical realities. In fact, much of the science he predicts for the future is in its infancy now, and as such his guesses are highly educated ones, in both senses.And I mention that because this book really is marvelously insane. Not that I argue against most of his predictions, but because they are so likely and probable and absolutely amazing. Sure, there may be a few too many science fiction pop culture references for the non-geek, but his charming, simple explanations of amazingly complex technologies are incredibly helpful. More, it's fun. Some of the chapters felt like Christmas: really? For me? Oh, gee! This book is a beautiful, magical story, and the fact that it's nonfiction just makes it more exciting."

To achieve the potential of the near future, the world will need more computer scientists and physicists; we will also need teachers, artists and creative people of all kinds (to inspire the scientists, and foster greater understanding of our new horizons and shared humanity), as well as wise and nurturing people to help guide humanity..."

It's a different thrill to read about technology that could be and almost is. Kaku writes with ease, detailing the current state of technology from literature as well as his own experience. He makes it obvious that the geniuses of the human species know so much more than us regular people at the top of the bell and what can be done with it. His chapters can help explain concepts that are heard about in the news (e.g. gene therapy).It's fascinating to find out that scientists are working so effortlessly on the atomic level, and that the future may be limited not by our invention but the depth of our understanding of reality. Kaku's book has alternated the way I read science fiction."

No, let me revise that. It made me infinitely skeptical. I instantly became the GOD of skepticism. Like we all will be some day, with the help of nano-skepti-pills made of lasers.""Yep, that's right, can't read it, nope, nope, never mind, author wrong. How could I devote time to this when I haven't even given attention to classics by less crazy authors, such as Birth Control Is Sinful in the Christian Marriages and Also Robbing God of Priesthood Children!!? "
70,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23843652-victor,3,"I was very interested in reading this book since I first heard of it. Unlike most books claiming to be able to foresee the future, Kaku has over 300 leading scientists backing his predictions. Most of the technology he mentions is in its early stages at this point, so it is most definitely not an overshot idea that the majority of these products will become integrated into our daily lives by 2050 - 2100. This book is great for remaining unread for a while and then being able to pick right back up. Kaku has manged to relate some of the technology to what we already have in our lives. I am glad the book also focuses on biological and medical advances alongside technological advancements. I am now most definitely certain I have been thoroughly informed on the approaching future. "
71,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29609954-james,2,"The author claims this book is something special, it's written by a scientist and this means the predictions will be better. Since I broke my crystal ball I can't say if this book has any more validity than those of well read non-scientists. As an example, Mack Reynolds back in the 70's wrote extensively about what we now would call smart phones, self-driving cars, digital libraries, telecommuting, etc. Reading these forty years later, they now feel more like a alternative universe story rather than the future. They are still fun to read, Reynolds was a great writer, something that Kaku is not. Anyone who reads about science and technology or reads hard SF will not find anything exciting here. Might be OK for people who don't read in these fields."
72,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52272269-123theone,4,"This book gives us a glimpse into the near future, mid century, and early 2100's using information drawn from many scientists in many different fields. While the title is slightly misleading (though there's a lot of physics, includes many other fields of science) the book is full of interesting information for the reader interested in science and technology, and full of ideas and inspiration for the science fiction writer, new to the craft or not. Though the little story at the end is /awful/ fiction writing (of course that's not the point of the book, but I like to joke) I'd recommend it to any sci-fi writer, anyone interested in science and technology, and anyone working in the many fields that he touches on."
73,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3163903-tim-shores,4,"I felt disappointed by the early chapters covering the nuts and bolts of Moore's law, AI, bio, and nano. The writing was fine, if too peppy with pop culture references, but it was too often uncritical. This changes when Kaku starts his chapter on the future of energy production and consumption. On reaching the later chapters, I understood that the book's path is not a linear march through the separate frontiers of tech, but a spiralling inward from least to most complex. The sci-fi movie allusions never gain enough traction, and the closing allegory describing life in the year 2100 is pretty unbearable, but I think his well-organized vision of the next 90 years is a valuable roadmap."
74,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4468062-rick-thomchick,4,"Michio Kaku, like Stephen Hawkings and Neil Degrasse Tyson, is one of the Great Explainers in our time. Kaku's specialty is String Theory, and the book is firmly grounded in science and technology, with scant discussion about the social or psychological impact of emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality contact lenses. Still, Kaku does hint at a darker side, acknowledging the possibility that the future might not be so rosy. Overall, the book is enjoyable to read, particularly if you've watched Kaku on television and can imagine his voice reading the book to you. Much better than the average ""world of tomorrow"" book."
75,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4586546-pippa,5,"This is a book that everyone should read. It is beautifully, clearly written and no knowledge is assumed. It raises awareness of the responsibility of this generation because the power that has been built through science could equally be used to create a great, world civilisation or to destroy everything. Wise, and educated, choices are essential. I read it partly because I am fascinated by the subject and partly because I am writing fiction based on real science. I was very happy with it and my only criticism is that it became slightly repetitive towards the end. I wanted more, but, for a general guide like this it was more than adequate. Now I just need to raid the bibliography. :D"
76,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3302957-amy-l-campbell,1,"Author lost a great deal of credibility when he stated that people would have their genetic sequence on a ""CD-Rom"" after a whole chapter about how we would blend the line between humans and computers. There were a lot of really outdated and awkward pop-culture references and analogies that seemed forced/inadequate. The author promised to back predictions with science but relied mostly on ""I'm a scientist, here's a rehashing of my credentials,"" rather than backing with examples of scientific principles and/or current research in the area. The few times he did do this, were often too brief and shallow to really feel substantial enough to support the claims. "

Kaku's writing is entertaining and accessible to the layman, sprinkled with pop culture references as he lays out current trends in technology and projects where things might go in the next century. His vision of the future looks a lot like an episode of ""The Jetsons"", but it's all thoroughly documented and based on research projects going on right now. And just when you think he's a little too pie-in-the-sky, he gets philosophical and wrestles with some of the social, political, and ethical challenges that will come with all these amazing advances. The next few decades should be really interesting, for better or worse..."

The concepts Kaku discusses are thought-provoking. He also has a way of writing that is approachable. This book isn't completely written in scientific jargon so that the average reader cannot understand. He breaks down the concepts in relatable ways. It was fun to speculate about the future while reading this. I particularly enjoyed how each chapter was broken up into the near, far, and distant future. This book is definitely something I might come back to. Who would've thought? "

There is a huge amount of information in the book for those not keeping well versed in today's technology. There is also some information for those who are keeping up. I disagree with several of the predictions but that the nature of perdictions. I do hope that the goal of ""starting discussions"" on how to bring about and use new techonologies and the need for education, is overwhelmingly realisied."
80,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67692170-samhan-m-syahman,4,"This book tells about Michio Kaku’s prediction of many things in the future, physically. He divided his prediction into 3: near future (present to 2030), midcentury (2030 to 2070), and far future (2070 to 2100). Michio Kaku himself is a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York. He is cofounder of string field theory and an author of many physics books. Kaku tells many intriguing ideas in many fields. First is future of computer and AI. Talking about computer that “can think”, driveless car, internet glasses and contact lenses, mind reading, telekinesis, etc. About AI, he talks about emotional robots, conscious robots that could make original work (paper, poem, etc.), and how people and AI live in the future. Next, he writes about medicine. Talking many things about future possibilities to solve cancer, editing genes, stop aging (it’s fun if immortal is possible, isn’t it?), resurrection of extinct creatures, etc. Then, he relates it with nanotechnology. He predicts that this field could zap cancer cell directly. He also writes about carbon nanotubes, quantum computers (using transistor made from the spin of the electron), and finally the most intriguing: a replicator. Basically, if science of this technology is being researched seriously, there will be a time when someone could make an atom just by programming them. Consequently, we could produce a thing from nothing, and we could make a replicator! Teleportation will be possible maybe not to move the whole body, but scanning the body quickly and use the replicator to make the exact body. Very funny. Oh, and he doesn’t always tell about science. He also tells his opinion about the impact in social economy, for example with replicator. If we can replicate money, what could possibly happen?Next is the chapter I expected very interesting, but I realized that I was expecting too high. It was the future of energy. Surely, the future will be the end of oil. We’ll use solar/hydrogen energy as the main source. Then, electric car will be very common. Everybody will just realize the impact of their fossil fuel usage, everybody will just start to suffer because of global warming. Human will use a technology to absorb CO2 back from the atmosphere. Actually, the technology has been existed now, but the price is unbelievably high. Then, far in the future, everybody will use magnetic car and train. Everybody will just realize how stupid that most energy in the past were used just to overcoming friction. Also, there may be a way to get energies from the solar & other star directly and somehow send it to earth. So, next, he talks about space travel.Surely, being a multiplanetary species is a very logical dream that humans must have. But yeah, of course it needs a very big price and time. Actually, technology to send people and terraforming other planet exist, but the price is very crazy. So, the problem is not the science. The problem is in the economics. Thats why SpaceX is very famous. It could make a rocket with a very cheap cost, nearly half of the conventional rocket, and its reusable. In the midcentury, mission to mars become more dominant and dominant. Humans will try every effective and efficient ways to terraform mars. Overcoming the cold temperature, the water, the soil, farming, one step at a time. Then, far in the future, rocket will maybe be not used anymore. To travel to mars or Jupiter’s moon that has been terraformed, humans will use a space elevator that created from carbon nanotubes. Moreover, rocket will be used to travel outside of solar cell using an antimatter energy source. Next, is the future of wealth. Talking about four stages of technology, jobs, future of entertainment, capitalism, and nations. Lastly, is the future of humanity. He classifies humanity into 3 types. Type 1 is the near future, 2 and 3 is far in imagination. Type 3 civilization, human has become an immortal species, explore most of galaxies, terraforming many planets in many system in galaxies, living with alien, and so on. He closes his book with a story of a day in the life in 2100.Well, I know all of that sounds amazing yet ridiculously impossible, but he writes based on his conversation with experts in their field. You can see there are 10 pages full of notes/his resources. Also, what else can be more ridiculous? Just see everything around us. How could by pressing a button, a lamp could be turned on? How could a dead thing flies? How could it be possible to communicate with someone far from us directly? If we think of it, all of technologies around us are also ridiculous, especially from old people point of view. So, I choose to believe the future. To close this review, I will cite a paragraph from this book, page 351-352:So the future is like a huge freight train barreling down the tracks, headed our way. Behind this train is the sweat and toil of thousands of scientists who are inventing the future in their labs. You can hear the whistle of the train. It says: biotechnology, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and telecommunications. However, the reaction of some is to say, “I am too old. I can’t learn this stuff. I will just lie down and get run over by the train.” However, the reaction of the young, the energetic, and the ambitious say, “Get me on that train! This train represents my future. It is my destiny. Get me in the driver’s seat.” Let us hope that people of this century use the sword of science wisely and with compassion."
81,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43608958-tor,5,"Overall:Kaku makes several educated guesses when predicting the future. The main takeaway from the book is to stay current on new technologies. As we humans by default think in lineaer terms, we tend to underestimate the pace of technological development. This is because technological development grows exponentially. This empirical phenomenon, called Moore´s Law, is the underlying premiss of the book. I first read this book in 2011 and picked it up again in 2017. And what seemed sci-fi back then, is now fast approaching. This goes especially for his predictions on self-driving cars, smart-devices, and AI. Let's also hope his predictions on health will materialize as well. Here are my notes from the book:Kaku´s Prediction MethodsPredicting the future is like predicting the weather. In predicting the weather, we use current weather patterns as a point of reference. Likewiese some technologies develop in distinct patterns, such as the exponential growth in computation power. Also known as ""Moore´s Law"", the computation power of the microchip has doubled every 18 months since its invention. With this law as a base, we can estimate how powerful computers are in the future and what future technologies this can unlock. For example; to estimate how long it is going to create a universal translator, we first break the invention into its two parts: text scanner and language processor. Then we can use Moore´s Law to estimate when these component technologies, and its integration, will be possible. In addition, social values today help us determine the future. The main driver is the ""Cave Man Principle"": our drive towards reproduction. As reproduction is closely tied to social status, we will always buy products that increase our social standing. Computers will revolutionize all aspects of our lifes:The spread of computer chips combined with the demand for ""smart""-devices, will result in every object talking to each other. For example, we could computerize our wallpapers to smart wallpapers. In the end, we will need a unified interface where all these devices can talk to each other. Kaku predicts Smart Contact Lenses. However, as this might have been the prevalent prediction in 2011 when the book was written, a smartphone might be a more accurate answer today. Further, augmented reality systems will empower consumers to trough crowd-sourced opinions and the collective wisdom. The customer of the future will only make an uninformed choice if he chooses to. HEALTH:Genetics, stem-cell technology and nanobots could drastically extend our lifes:Aging is the decay of cells over time. Contributors: Random mutations in your genes and damaging environmental factors: smoking, poor diet etc. With the accumulation of these deficient cells, the body struggles to function properly - leading to death. However, with the introduction of ""stem cells"", it is possible to stop the decay of cells. Stem cells transform into another type of cells. So if your liver is damaged through years of alcohol abuse, stem cells can transform into liver cells. This may create an entirely new liver! Similarily, cancer could be a thing of the past through gene therapy and the injection of nanobots into our bodies.Computers will continuarily monitor our health and detect illness before they occur. This could include monitors in our clothes that alert and prevent. Such sensors work with nanobots already in our bodies. Health care will dramatically change. Rutine visits might be a thing of the pastAnother way to extend life is to manipulate genes. Certain genes that could be able to extend our lifespan is currently not ""switched on"" in in our chromosomes. Hence by switshing on these genes certain genes, we would remove these natural by unneccesary limits to our lives. Sceintist has currentlu been able to use this technology in flies genes, increasing the lifespan of 110 %. So in the future, with a healthy lifestyle, cell manipulations & manipulation of genes might extend lifespan far beyond what they are today(imaging the hassle of calculating life insurance then). Kaku argues that a greater challenge to human lifespan is overcomming the serious environmental and structural problems. This includes both the inability to manage our finite resources such as oil and wildlife. But also the uneven distribution of these goods demographically. Kaku goes so far to question the survival of humanity by 2100 unless serious measures are undertaken. TRANSPORTATIONMagnestism will be the fuel of the future. By using ""superconductors"", magnets will float on top of the conductors - generating great speeds over long distances. In 2017, we can see a sign of this with Elon Musk´s hyperloop. Self-driving cars is also a force to be reconed with in the futue. But by 2017, this is already real. AIToday computers can process information much faster than a human. However, it can oly process a single calculation at the time. This makes a computer limited to excel in very specific tasks preprogrammed into the computer. The human brain, however, is composed of several simulaniously interacting parts working together to process information and form conciousness. This is called parallel processing. You can, for example, calculate where a ball will land by a long range of simulatious mental processes. By employing paralell processors in computers, computers become much more than calculators. TELEKINETICSThis is the power to move things with the mind. Advances in neuroscience are turning this into reality, by measure neural impulses of a brain. In the future, we will be surrounded by computers we can interact with using telekinesis. In a digital world of the future, what is real and artificial would be hard to distinguish. We will spend the majority of our time in digital realities. Maybe because these digital devices is a modification of our body itself."

The fault is not with the author, but in the the very nature of what he is attempting. His extrapolations are reasonable and of some interest, but rely on assumptions that are being seriously questioned by a number of other visionaries. Four stars for his effort."
83,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1151946-jacqui,4,"I love futurism and forecasting books and this one was very well written. The author made suggestion of where we could be in 30 60 and 100 years given current state of the art and historical trends in technology development. Controlling computers with our minds, pervasive augmented reality, the conquering of cancer and lots of robotic assistants, and possibly the end of capitalism. Very interesting. "
84,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7787625-lindsay,4,"Really, really interesting, and Kaku does a very good job of making difficult concepts very accessible. Close to 5 stars, but I feel like some of the ""current"" development is already out dated.

85,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6644907-alex,4,"I think I liked the latter half of the book more since it dealt with topics i was less familiar with such as economics, biology, literal rocket science, particle physics, etc. The last chapter with the 'day in the life in 2100' played out like a horribly cheesy sci-fi sitcom, but served it's purpose as a wrap up/conclusion of all that was discussed in the book.

93,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162048-james-carroll,3,"This was a fun book, but I believe that he is wildly overly pessimistic with regard to his predictions concerning strong AI.He proposed several ""roadblocks to the singularity"" which I would like to respond to. He writes: “No one knows when robots may become as smart as humans. But personally, I would put the date close to the end of the century for several reasons.""“First, the dazzling advances in computer technology have been due to Moore’s law. These advances will begin to slow down and might even stop around 2020-2025, so it is not clear if we can reliably calculate the speed of computers beyond that…""I believe that there are three reasons that this is incorrect:1. We don't know if the new paradigms that could replace Moore's law will allow faster or slower continued growth, so things could get better not worse... depending.2. Parallel computing could allow increased performance even if there is no immediate successor to Moore's law. For example, power consumption / flop continues to drop exponentially (https://picasaweb.google.com/jlcarrol...), and the Brain is a proof by example that it can get down to around 20 wats/10^19 cps... If that trend alone continues, then super computers will continue to increase in performance, even if Moore's Law comes to a screeching halt (https://picasaweb.google.com/jlcarrol...).3. If you look at my graph, super computers will achieve 10^19cps (the upper bound of the computing power of the brain) just after his 2020 deadline, so it will be too late for the end of Moore's law to stop the creation of strong AI https://picasaweb.google.com/jlcarrol....“Second, even if a computer can calculate at fantastic speeds like 10^16 calculations per second, this does not necessarily mean that it is smarter than us…“Even if computers begin to match the computing speed of the brain, they will still lack the necessary software and programming to make everything work. Matching the computing speed of the brain is just the humble beginning.To which I respond: That is strictly true, but if we have enough calculations for one computer to simulate the other computer (in this case the human brain), then that computer will indeed be as ""intelligent"" as the other. The only question is whether such a simulation will be possible, and if so, when it will be possible... more on that later.“Third, even if intelligent robots are possible, it is not clear if a robot can make a copy of itself that is smarter than the original.…John von Neumann…pioneered the question of determining the minimum number of assumptions before a machine could create a copy of itself. However, he never addressed the question of whether a robot can make a copy of itself that is smarter than it…“Certainly , a robot might be able to create a copy of itself with more memory and processing ability by simply upgrading and adding more chips. But does this mean the copy is smarter, or just faster…""It can be trivially shown that a computer/robot can indeed create a new computer/program/robot that is is smarter than itself. The fact that Neumann didn't do it doesn't make it any less trivial. How do you do it?Let's start with human examples, then discuss hardware improvements (assuming that there are no software improvements beyond the brain simulation algorithm), and finally we will discuss whether a computer cam make software improvements to its own algorithm.Humans easily create programs that are ""smarter"" than the programmer. For example, it is possible for me to easily write a checkers program that plays checkers better than I do. So if you consider intelligence as a multi-dimensional thing, it is clearly possible for an agent to create a new algorithm that is smarter in one or more dimensions of intelligence than itself, with a proof by example (I do it all the time).Next, hardware improvements:Michio Kaku admits that a robot can create a copy of itself with more memory and processing ability, but he doubts that such a computer should be called ""more intelligent."" However, if the robot built a copy of itself with twice the parallel processing power, and if that computer was intelligent by running a simulation of the brain, then it would indeed be more intelligent than before. Why? simple. It can now simulate two brains at the same time, or it can simulate one brain twice as fast (getting twice as much work done on a problem per thinking time spent). No one doubts that two people working on a problem do a better job than one, or that one person who spends twice as much time on a problem gets more done on it.This can happen because we are simulating the brain with chips that run at about 10^-9 sec, while the human brain fires each neuron at 10^-3 seconds. That means that at first, each processor will be simulating multiple neurons. If you then have twice as many processors, you get to have each chip simulate less neurons, and walla, you can now speed up the simulation considerably, or run multiple simulations at the same time. This doesn't scale up perfectly, nor does it scale up forever, but it will work for quite a while, until we hit limits around where we have one processor for each neuron or synapse (depending), each one running at 10^-9 seconds, and then you may hit something of an impenetrable wall to making the simulation of a single brain go faster. But that still gives us about 10^6 levels of improvement beyond human level intelligence before we hit that wall. Furthermore, after that wall you can still simulate more brains and have them collaborate, each one working on a different part of the problem. That type of scaling should continue roughly forever. Unfortunately twenty people are not always twice as good at solving a problem than ten, so this type of improvement may eventually create diminishing returns. Yet after that limit is reached, it would be possible to put each brain simulation to work on a completely different problem, essentially doing two things at once.It seems to me that we must admit that a computer that can do nothing more than add processors to itself is indeed ""more intelligent"".Now for the issue of software improvements:Can a simple software program make a copy of itself that is ""smarter"" than itself? It is trivial to show that this is true. ALL machine learning algorithms are algorithms that ""improve"" on themselves over time. If they copied their state at one point in time, and then copied their state at a later point in time, then they just created a copy of themselves that were smarter than their previous incarnation. But it gets better than this. It is possible to work on a meta learning algorithm that ""learns to learn"", meaning that it isn't just better at each problem because it has incorporated more data, but it becomes better at the fundamental problem of how to incorporate data over time. Or it is possible to use the computer to create a genetic algorithm that improves its own algorithms etc. There are thousands of ways in which it is possible for one piece of software to create another that is ""smarter than itself."" Studying this issue is an entire sub-field of machine learning that goes under the title ""Meta-Learning"" and ""Transfer Learning"" and ""Learning to Learn"". My masters thesis was on this issue and it is unfortunate that Michio Kaku appears to be completely ignorant of this entire field, or he would not have raised such a silly concern. (In his defense, he is a physicist not a computer scientist, however, if he is going to write about someone else's field, he could have at least consulted someone in that field that could have explained to him that he was not making any sense).“fourth, although hardware may progress exponentially, software may not…“Engineering progress often grows exponentially… [but] if we look at the history of basic research, from Newton to Einstein to the present day, we see that punctuated equilibrium more accurately describes the way in which progress is made.""The data seems to indicate that this is not true. If anything, software performance and complexity is growing faster than hardware performance: http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03...Furthermore, although I will grant him the idea of punctuated equilibrium, if you step back and view the trends from a distance, it often becomes clear that punctuated equilibrium is nothing more than the steps on a larger exponential trend. Most importantly, software builds on software. Each programming language from machine language, to assembly language, to a compiler, to modern interpreters, to complex and re-usable object libraries, to the current work being done by some of my colleges on statistical programming languages, provide abstractions hiding the complexities of the lower levels from those programming at the upper levels. This trend appears to be continuing, and it is this ""building"" effect that produces exponential progress.“Fifth, … the research for reverse engineering the brain, the staggering cost and sheer size of the project will probably delay it into the middle of this century. And then making sense of all this data may take many more decades, pushing the final reverse engineering of the brain to late in this century.""Yes, it will be complex, and yes, it will be expensive (his two central complaints). But he admits elsewhere in his book that it could clearly be done quite rapidly, the only roadblock being the money it would cost. He then makes the absurd claim that there is less perceived ""benefit"" to be derived from such a simulation, so people won't invest the capital needed to create that simulation. I believe that this is short-sighted. There are many commercial applications for each step along the road to this simulation, and they will only grow as we get closer. http://www.youtube.com/user/jeanderba... In fact, I believe that there are more potential economic benefits for this work than perhaps for any other in human history. Surely someone else besides me will see the potential, and the funding will flow.There are many projects working on completing this monumental task, and several are proposing a time line involving around 12 years (incidentally, that is about when my projection of super computer power crosses the upper bound for running this simulation). http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetec... http://www.youtube.com/user/jeanderba....Our tools for this task are improving exponentially. Our computer power needed to perform this simulation is growing exponentially, our brain scan resolution is growing exponentially http://www.singularity.com/charts/pag... as is the time resolution of these scans http://www.singularity.com/charts/pag....He does raise another concern related to this one, which I should address:“Back in 1986, scientists were able to map completely the location of all the nervous system of the tiny worm C. elegans. This was initially heralded as a breakthrough that would allow us to decode the mystery of the brain. But knowing the precise location of its 302 nerve cells and 6,000 chemical synapses did not produce any new understanding of how this worm functions, even decades later. In the same way, it will take many decades, even after the human brain is finally reverse engineered, to understand how all the parts work and fit together. If the human brain is finally reverse engineered and completely decoded by the end of the century, then we will have taken a giant step in creating humanlike robots.” (Michio Kaku “Physics of the Future, How Science will Shape Human Destiny and our Daily Lives by the year 2100” p. 94-95).We already mapped the brain connections of several very simple animals, but are currently unable to turn this map into an intelligent simulation. So it would appear that our hardware creates the potential for brain simulation long before our software catches up and is actually capable of performing the simulation. This is the root of his concern. However, there are a finite number of types of nerve cells, and hormonal interactions etc. Once we understand their behavior better, and once we create the algorithm for simulating them, after that moment, it is only a matter of scale and creating the larger more complex neural map. In other words, there is a gap between neural behavior and neural simulations. That gap is closing all the time. We will not be able to truly simulate the worm's brain until it closes, and we will not be able to truly simulate the human brain until it closes. But it won't close much sooner for the worm's brain than it does for the human brain. Once it closes, we can simulate both, (once our computer power and brain maps catch up).It is my opinion that this gap will close much faster than will our scanning and mapping of the human brain. That will take much longer. Why do I believe that we will be able to crack the behavior of neurons so soon? Because first, the complexity of this algorithm is limited by the human genome and its associated expressions mechanisms, and second, current progress in this area is quite promising, and it appears that we are currently quite close. I actually believe that simulating the brain is a much harder problem that does extreme optimists such as Ray Kurzweil who thinks we will be doing this sort of simulation around 2019 (based on the idea that the functional simulation is less complex than the full simulation, which we won't be able to do until 2023 at the earliest). On the other hand, I believe that we will need to do the full simulation first, and then explore that for quite some time before we understand how it is working. But that only pushes things back to 2050 at the latest. Michio Kaku's assertion that 2100 will come, and go, and strong AI will still be years away seems a bit silly to me.Michio Kaku's sixth and final argument against the singularity is: “Sixth, there probably won’t be a ‘big bang,’ when machines suddenly become conscious…there is a spectrum of consciousness. Machines will slowly climb up this scale.”This isn't really a roadblock to the singularity. Every Singularitarian that I know agrees with this. None of them believe that some magic moment will hit and everything will change. They believe that change will accelerate until you won't be able to keep up without merging with our technology and transcending our biology, so this ""roadblock"" is inaccurately named, and rather irrelevant."
94,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21161258-keith,1,"I would give this book a 1.5 if I could because there are some good points to it, but not many. Keep in mind any attempt to predict the future will involve a lot of wild assumptions. Even so, this still gets the reader thinking. I'll give a quick rundown of the chapters then get to more serious problems where the book goes wrong.Chapters 1, 2, and 4 are pretty good. The author seems to have a background that is more in line with these chapters. The 3rd chapter which covers medicine is a disaster. The author doesn't understand the politics and corruption involved in the field of medicine, and he believes some false claims that have been perpetuated for decades. The 5th chapter is great. The 6th is okay given that the future of space travel is very hard to predict. Then chapters 7 and 8 are terrible and chapter 9 is just a fun fantastical look into the possible future. In the third chapter a lot of the authors statements of fact that provide his historical perspective and basis for a possible future are completely wrong. Average life expectancy in the ancient world was not 18 to 20 years and most babies did not die at birth. In Europe, yes the life expectancy dropped to horribly low numbers due to the filth Europeans lived in. They had open sewers, poor hygeiene, and even used chamber pots to dump their feces in the streets (which then splashed on people, which is why men walked on the side of the sidewalk facing the road). The rest of the world was nowhere near as filthy as Europeans. Native Americans were shocked when they first saw how Europeans lived (and smelled). His history of doctors and medicine is also very distorted. His views seem to be based solely on European medicine which had a very strange history that involved magic and religious claims. The rest of the world however was far more advanced. Still today ancient chinese medicine is still used with great success and has been scientifically tested to prove it's effectiveness. Chinese herbs have been extensively studied and accupunture meridians are all accurate as shown by FMRI studies (using those meridians for any benefit is another story). Native Americans also had their own herbalists (along with other religious nonsense) that used herbs effectively just as they're used today. Even the Germanic people of Roman Times knew of the medicinal properties of garlic that we've proven scientifically today. Much of this knowledge wasn't guarded or hidden, but instead was past down throughout the generations. It's poor research and writing on the author's part to take one group of doctors in a wacky time period of Europe and say that represents the history of medicine. He also says vaccines increased life expectancy when they did no such thing. This is one of the most common delusions perpetuated still to this day even in our medical schools. The bulk of vaccines were produced in the 50's 60's and 70's AFTER the diseases they were claimed to prevent had already fallen in incidence by over 95%. What extended our lifespans was cleaning our filthy way of living that originated from Europe. We closed our sewers and put them underground, we treated sewage, and we stopped throwing our feces in the streets. We also made advances in hygiene habits. We advanced shipping so foods containing needed vitamins (especially C, as humans can't manufacture it) were shipped from tropical areas to the temperate zones, even in the winter. Scurvy rates dropped along with all other illnesses resulting in lower disease rates. The author mentions cancer treatments for the future but doesn't realize there are already better cancer treatments today such as using antineoplastons. Dr. Burzynski has a center that has been using these for years, but the government along with his competitors have done everything possible to shut him down and force people to continue using costly ineffective chemotherapy. He's cured non-operable brain-stem glioma which has never been cured by mainstream medicine. This treatment is stifled by government, just as many other effective treatments that will cut into the market share of the largest companies that control the government. The point is that the future of medicine isn't as rosy as the author paints it because he does not understand the corruption involved. The government does all it can to cater to the interests of the largest pharmaceutical companies at the expense of innovation and progress. He keeps making the wrong assumptions about vaccines saying the HPV vaccine prevents cancer and other vaccines might be made like it. But this vaccine doesn't prevent cancer and hasn't a single study showing so. It is marketed with false claims. He mentions the story of finding the spanish flu in a woman in Alaska and some soldiers bodies but just after this story came out years ago it was pointed out that scientists have no clue that the virus they found caused the spanish flu, or even that the spanish flu was a flu virus because at the time viruses hadn't even been discovered. The methods they used to identify the virus don't show it varying anymore from the flu from year to year as the flu virus already does. It's just a bad point to make since it turns out it's completely wrong. In the later chapters he keeps saying science creates prosperity, but he's putting the cart before the horse. Freedom creates prosperity and the opportunities to engage in science. This is why the U.S. and England (after the Magna Carta and political reforms) became a hotbed for scientific discoveries. He then states that scientific revolutions formed the booms and busts of the economy. This, along with many other things, point out the author's misunderstanding of economics. Each boom and bust he mentions was created by central banks printing massive amounts of money to fuel a boom which always creates a bust. This isn't anything new, it's basic economics, but sadly most so called economists do not understand economics, so it's hard for me to fault the author on this. In 2008 it even went beyond the FED with the government actually backing mortgages made by Fannie and Freddie. These were huge market distortions that were the result of political corruption not scientific progress. The dotcom bubble while playing off the Internet was also fueled by rock bottom interest rates created by the FED. Without so much cheap money fueling the system no one would have invested in silly companies like doorknobs.com that had no earnings and effectively no balance sheet. The author makes a lot of erroneous statments in the later chapters. Here are some:-50% of PhD students are foreign born because the U.S. doesn't produce enough qualified students.-Americans aren't qualified for silicon valley jobs-Capital and land don't matter-The government can't turn the Internet into a tool of terrorNow lets go through these. Foreign born students get a free education in the U.S. due to Universities pushing for diversity and getting rewarded for their claims of diversity. If a white American male and a foreigner apply for the same school and have the same test scores the white male loses every single time. That's just the plain sad fact of how our educational system operates. On top of this no one can give a white male a scholarship for being a white male. But there are all kinds of scholarships available to foreign born nonwhites. I actually advise foreign friends of mine to come here to get a free education. They are amazed at how willing Universities are to pay for their schooling. Plenty of Americans are qualified to silicon valley jobs which is why these companies get their pick of the cream of the crop. The author seems to think these companies can't find workers, yet the reality is engineers can't find jobs!Capital and land do matter. Try telling the poor that higher food prices are better for them. Try telling a small business that needs inventory that capital doesn't matter. Food prices are skyrocketing in the U.S. now and small businesses can't get loans because the government forces banks to mostly invest in government bonds. This should be a very clear example of the importance of land and capital.The government can turn the Internet into a tool of terror just as the FCC gave Bell a monopoly on telephony. It's all just a matter of the FCC. Hopefully it doesn't happen, but it certainly can just as China partially censors their Internet, and Cuba slaps extreme censors and controls on the Internet (chat services are even banned in Cuba). The Internet while it may seem like an eternally open structure we all have access to, is composed of actual lines and cables that can be controlled by the government. The NSA already spies on us just as was done in 1984 (the book not the year...well maybe both). So the outcome of 1984 is in no way off the table.The funniest thing the author said in the last chapter was that war fever is difficult to produce in a Democracy. I laughed out loud at that. The U.S. is a Democracy right? Well we are the world bully. Did Vietnam attack us? Did Iraq? Did Afghanistan (don't get confused, the terrorists came from Saudia Arabia and Yemen)? Did Libya? No. Instead we attacked all of them and we consistently bomb Pakistan on a near daily basis killing kids and thousands of innocent people. It's extremely easy to drum up support for a war in a democracy because the majority of the electorate is brain dead. Each time the government wanted a war they told the necessary lies and the country lined up behind them. The author doesn't understand the evils of democracy and this creates the assumption that our government will allow for the progress of technology into the future. The truth is Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what to eat. If the wolves don't like a new cancer treatment that is far better than theirs, then that treatment gets banned. If we could lower taxes and increase investment but the majority doesn't want to work and want the government to rob others, then the economy, and scientific advances slow. If there are more people benefiting from building bombs and fighter planes than there are people being robbed to pay for those bombs, then we'll build bombs.The big problems overall is that the author doesn't understand economics and how the government stifles scientific advancement. Sometimes his historical knowledge very off base as well. I would recommend that if you read this book, only read chapters 1, 2, and 5. You could read chapter 6 too. It's highly speculative but it can still be interesting. But stay away from 3, 7, and 8. Those chapters will seriously mislead you."
95,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6812675-marc-j,3,"Michio is one of the leading String Theorists/High Energy Physicists of the late 20th and early 21st century. To date, I've read Hyperspace, Physics of the Impossible and now Physics of the Future.The least focused book on actual modern physics, even at a shallow level, is Physics of the Future. This work is focused on a physicist's broad understanding of the applications of his field and how history has continued human evolution at an exponential pace after the works of Albert Einstein, Niehls Bohr and his many colleagues [including Richard Feynman on Quantum Theory] by showing the hidden world within our modern marvels.The work is excellent, sans the chapter on Wealth. It is the reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars. Michio has cited a few of his Ph.D colleagues from MIT and their wunderwall dreaming of ideal capitalism and its many ways of driving the cost of products down, as if living in an alternate reality. The tired claim that modern science has driven the cost of convenience down to pennies on the dollar has always left out the real rub: it is based upon the baseline of the initial creation of their first applications, but never shows a comparative relationship between future inflation and buying power of modern society, relative to the past.In other words, yes today's workstation would cost hundreds of millions to build in 1945. The science didn't exist but don't let that stop the comparison from attempting to pat ourselves on the back that technology has leaped our lives into some future paradise. In reality, cars still drive from point A to B and as a Mechanical Engineer I appreciate the refinements in materials, factors of safety, comfort and overall exhilaration of today's automobile over the 1957 Chevy, yet their cost value to the average consumer has exploded, over the length of ownership. A $1000 vehicle in 1957 would be a large sum of money. Today it is worth around $35k. The average 4 door Subaru Forrester runs around $35k. If you showed someone from 1957 the 2015 Forrester and the price I doubt they'd believe a vehicle that still drives from point A to point B can justify a 35 fold cost increase, all for convenience and added comfort/safety. In short, it wouldn't transform their life.Michio cites the notion that like Electricity going from a luxury to being pervasive, consumers will free themselves eventually from purchasing computers [mind you he wrote this in 2011, after iPhones and Android were sold in the hundreds of millions, annually] and will instead purchase time to use them. I'm sorry, but it is futuristic diarrhea like this that tells me unlike an actual applied physicist [a Mechanical/Electrical/Chemical Engineer, and more] theoretical physicists should stick to their day job of never having to design a life of application to make a living, and instead stick to spending a life in abstraction hoping to unify the laws of physics, ala String Theory.The idea that computing will become so pervasive that people will rent them [and pay for that time] like a toll tells me he truly sees nothing wrong with the pervasive greed and corruption that has continued to starve the masses, and continues to underwrite ``entrepreneurs'' who statistically have about a 1:1,000,000 success rate in the broad world of Information Technologies.Personally, I've had the fortune of working for Steven P. Jobs not once, but twice. First at NeXT Inc., and later at Apple Inc. I passed on PIXAR to apply my Computer Graphics background to stay at Apple. Michio and none of the world's top scientists/physicists will ever be mistaken for the next Steven P. Jobs. Steve made a lot of mistakes, and nearly wrote himself out of history. PIXAR brought him back to life and our merger [thanks to some clever friends at NeXT who pitched the idea to Apple] with Apple gave him the chance to reboot his first love: Apple.Apple is the pinnacle of driving the future of IT, not for being the next Microsoft or IBM. Never satisfied with just milking a cow until it is dry, nor paying exorbitant valuations for start-ups, Apple isn't driven to be the next 800 lb Gorilla that was Microsoft: the company that nearly destroyed the IT World in the '90s. Human evolution with technologies never gets it right the first time. In fact, they rarely get it right the first ten times.Instead of being first, Apple works to be the most refined and thus provide a consumer with the greatest product value. Routinely, the most sought after computers, with the highest resale value on Ebay and elswhere, are Apple products. They are the exception, not the rule. Like Ford, Gates and Company would charge you a retail license for a tiny improvement to each and every product they sell, until the public demanded they do more. However, when you own the industry that progress never happens, yet you would be hard pressed to find many who found their monopoly a problem: Teddy Roosevelt was the exception, not the rule, back in 1905 and today.This idea that today's capitalism [or any day's form or capitalism] is a level field of well regulated entrepreneurs fighting over your hard earned money is a pipe dream. There are still only 2 major platforms in the personal computer industry [three if you count Linux, but mainly for servers] after 40+ years of consumerism. Now there are only 2 major mobile platforms [iOS and Android]. It appears 3 or more indeed is a crowd and like a crowd get pushed out. The consumer carries the debt of those crowded relationships, and later passed to future generations.No Professor, we live in an Oligarchical system of near monopolists dictating their pricing, not because of consumers, but because of their fellow corporations along the supply chain setting their piece of the consumer price, leaving the consumer commonly indebted for life, not financially secure and dictating who gets what piece of their hard earned wealth.A high quality computer that can last you 5 years of quality productivity in 2000 set you back $5k-$7k, and today it still sets you back that much. The difference is that performance has improved but so has complexity and information overload.In Physics of the Future you cite paper currently as the largest waste product being surpassed, in the future, by throw away computer chips. You really expect anyone to take you serious with this prediction? Good luck. Your thinking that high powered nanochips will be filling up waste-incinerators by the megaton is ludicrous and will never happen. This District 9 world where people can scrap heap a supercomputer together is right up there with delusional AI developers thinking the Brain is just a neural net that needs mapping and rebooting. You cite common sense as one of the keys that separate Humanity from any future AIs, and I agree. Yet you overlook the paradox of the concept we call common sense. It is nothing more than an accumulation of experiences no computer can ever predict for the variables are too varied and indeterminate to categorize. It is partly experience, education and instincts that allow us to categorize those ``duh moments'' incorrectly as, ``It's just common sense,'' when it really is far less common. What variables would allow a computer to simulate instinct?Our senses and our self-replicating dense mesh network is not consciousness. It is not just a projected Neural Net allowing us to apply the greatest finally tuned shortest path parallel computing brain Neural Scientists want to imagine. We indeed can map the kinematic relationships of our limbs and rudimentary feedback systems of our five senses. Even you consider the notion of replacing humanity with our robot better selves is ludicrous. You don't attack their fallacies and that is a shame, even a little to humble the Singularity insanity so that money could actually be poured into more pressing matters like rebuilding the nation with new exotic materials that last a millennium, instead of a decade, and so much more.You dance all over the place regarding consciousness, as you know very well that there is no universally acceptable definition: we cannot replicate consciousness or if we could we would be able to map everyone's unique consciousness like the Human Genome.You cite the father of AI, Minsky, defining consciousness via Evolution as, ``Evolution haphazardly cobbled together a bunch of techniques we collectively call consciousness.'' If that's Minsky's idea of intelligently explaining human consciousness then please put that dog down. Instead of working to be able to interface with the CNS and attempt to decode our thoughts [and actually view through our consciousness] we see people spending decades attempting to replicate Humanity when they freely admit they haven't a clue on how to define Humanity other than to say it is billions of years of random evolutionary chance. There is nothing illogical about how we are the product of billions of years of evolutionary processes. It's the lack of quantifying and categorizing all the processes in evolution that shows we working against the universe, instead of with it, so to speak.I would hope after I read his next book concerning the Human Mind that Professor Kaku will put his efforts into a more altruistic work of applied physics that could help accelerate society not based upon some bubble based economic boon and collapse of our past, but how to help us explore space [Antimatter research], manage the environment and influence Congress on investing more into the applied sciences and humanities, instead of the next perpetual War Game.After reading the last chapter of life in the year 2100 I had to reduce the rating by 1 star. The imagination is off-the-charts making The Jetsons seem tame. I expected a much more conservative take on advances in science proliferating through society, but instead I see an ideal view of each chapter summarized in one via a scene that would make the Minority Report blush."
96,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14536914-roshan,4,"Physics Of The Future by Michio Kaku sums up the prospects of future science and technology enhancements with a progressive insight on the same. The author displays a relentless tendency to eat, breathe, and sleep science and technology. The book is terrific for the knowledge base it offers to science and technology book lovers. He covers wide aspects of technology such as computing, medicine, artificial intelligence in robots, nanotechnology and the role it will play in enhancement of storage and memory, cosmic energy of the stars and the physics backing the developments in this field, future of space expedition with the underlying imagination and reasoning by physicists such as the author himself, a gist on the predicaments of accumulation of wealth and economic prosperity of a country, the various perspectives on the probabilty of discovering life on other planets and the scope of establishing communication with aliens, and many similar nuances associated with various technologies that form an integral part of a country's overall progress. The author also takes the pain of visualizing and predicting the advanced version of human life by the year 2100. Some predictions form the root for hilarious and unrealistic technical entities' existence. The author's presentation of views in the conclusion are questionable and thought provoking. The more astonishing element in the read is its ability to correlate latest developments in physics with those in the technology domain. The articulation excedes the reader's expectation and anticipation in establishing a link between the same two aspects of modern science. A first glimpse of the book persuades the readers to nurture a truly fantasized opinion on the technical matter presented herein. However, a careful second revision unleashes the hidden possibilities of the predictions turning into a reality. In my view, the author's devised notion on the future of science and technology would outlast his presented limitation of a 100 year framework in this book. It's too short a period to take into consideration the realisation of the author's highly sophisticated predictions despite the fascinating pace of development achieved in science and technology to this day.Another aspect of the author's approach towards compiling his thoughts on future prospects of science and technology at one place can be easily grasped by his obsession with Moore's law. And, this law of physics is precisely the driving force behind the rest of the content offered in the book to science and technology enthusiasts. The first half of the book delves into the brief history of physics with the derivatives and correlations taking a higher precedence over life history of prominent physicists of 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. The author's views gain momentum and capture the faintest imagination of science lovers with the flip of every page and the completion of every part. The latter half offers a more conducive explanation to convince the readers on the highly debatable scientific and technological matters of implementing complex ideas. Michio Kaku's instrumental approach of arriving at optimistic possible implementation and devising of unimaginable science apparatus and technology equipment in medicine, nanotechnology, space exploration to achieve and facilitate extraordinary economic breakthroughs succeed in captivating the mind of book enthusiasts. The degree of his predictions amount to the graphical content offered to the audiences in sci-fi and tech-fi digital cine age. His extravagance in presenting unthinkable possibilities is well backed with genuine reasoning, though it sows seeds of suspicion in the mind of intellects regarding them turning into a reality in the near future. Further, the science manuscript includes an account on evolution taken place in the field of technology previously and the role these fundamentals will play in the establishment of future technological infrastructure. Among the technical evolutions that find a mention in the well structured book are the progresses achieved in microprocessors, integrated chips, printed circuit boards, medical equipment used in diagnosis and treatment of diseases, the improvement in the precision of telescopes used to observe planetary bodies and the corresponding devices used in artistic mastery of these observations, the advancement accomplished in defense equipment such as Radar, Geolocation satellites, and remote sensing technologies, the progress in telecommunication and mobile technology besides the simplest of human inventions such as use of running water to produce electricity, and printing news paper (also newsprint media). The author's science work is no less of a guide to the height and peaks modern technology can conquer, and in the process influence the economy of a state or a country to bring about positive vibes amongst the technocrats. The role played by technology in simplifying modern gadgets, and achieving the arduous task of reduction in the size of these gadgets is a fascinating human accomplishment by any standard. And, the author is quick to take notice of these advancements and propose certain highly sophisticated science and technology models to take modern technology to new unimaginable heights.The technical content offered to the readers varies from the minutest of technology components such as pixels in a picture (also resolution), alternative uses of DNAs to the largest of technology equipment invented till date such as rocket and spacecraft fuel propulsion methodologies, development of space shuttles occupy a centrestage in the book. The roles played by complex software applications, research and development, and the internet in achieving magnanimous connectivity and sharing of vital critical information among corporate and governments across several countries also find writing space dedicated to them in the science compilation. There is a section in the book dedicated to experimental setup which facilitates production and analysis of holographic images and illusions. By far, the most complex technology that physicists across the world have dedicated their lifetime in achieving breakthroughs through research. The innovation factor offered in the book breaches unimaginable scales and forces the readers into submission and to evolve in their belief and opinion on realization of the 3D technologies further extending to an annoying fourth dimension. There is no technological element that the author has failed to elaborate in his laudable work. The analogies he draws between mythology and technology such as artificial intelligence, while generously admitting that physics and technology have many a peak to conquer reflects his character of open mindedness.'Given that the earth's geometry is spherical, the readers on completion of this science and technology saga would be astonished to figure out that sitting within the confinement of four walls of their reading room, they have completed a journey of a lifetime after starting off from a start point to return to the same start point i.e. life has come a full circle for them in terms of human history regaining the age old powers except that the robots occupy their place in the concluding part of their expedition'This in my opinion is the beauty of the book I held in my hand throughout the reading experience.Name a technology and Physics Of The Future is up right there to dissipate and impart knowledge to the technology geeks. A leading example of this phenomena and the correlation between technology and medical biology is visible in the segment of the book that deals with neurology and its association with powerful super computing machines to devise neural networks. The neural network models proposed by the author through thorough research is very close to aptly being a replica of human brain. However, the author quickly adds that the complexities of human brain functions are very tough to simulate through neural networks and any effort to do so, would arise a need for large computers of the size of a museum with equally great and powerful computing and processing capabilities. And, this explanation precisely leads us to ambiguity with respect to the implmentation of these systems and many similar complex technologies proposed herein. The author also emphasizes the need for innovation in artificial intelligence while quoting magnificent examples of how simulation of human brain through neural networks could lead robots to take up the tasks of a cook or a doctor, thereby facilitating automation that heavy labor professionals crave for. The importance of Hebb's rule in neurology finds a special mention in this technology guide. Also, there are insights on the long standing stage of medicine with witchcraft, superstition, and hearsay impacting this field of study followed by the two stages that established their roots through genuine, full fledged medical research namely germ theory and molecular medicine. Apart from the aformentioned advances in medicine and pathology, the author has also dealt with Genomic medicine which concerns several psychological disorders and mental diseases such as Alzheimer's. As one can clearly anticipate, cloning techniques also gain a fair share of relevant mention in the technology compilation and it is well complemented by a section on gene therapy.If the industrial revolution led to progress in machinery and farming techniques, the technology revolution gave rise to a whole new era of telecommunication and computing paradigms. And, as humanity heads towards the supercomputing era, the mention of the impact nanotechnology has had on aeronautical, medical, and commercial applications becomes inevitable. The author's thesis on nanotechnology is indicative of the importance of Moore's law, and quantum theory, nanoparticles, nanomachines ruling the roost in the previously mentioned fields, primarily medical cures and aeronautics. With the flip of pages that lead to the final part of the book, the readers get a good deal of information on quantum computers, stem cells, MEMS, harnessing solar energy using solar panels, followed by a gist on the fundamentals of gravitational force, electromagnetism, weak and strong nuclear forces. In the concluding part of his work, the author desirably and to the liking of the readers chooses to take up the role of a critic describing the pros and cons, advantages and disadvantages of various science and technological ventures. The last section in the book leads to embarkation of its readers to a world oracled with ample sophistication and automation which the science enthusiasts show unwillingness to return from and the creator propagates willingness to open doors on.To reflect back on the book reviewed, Physics Of The Future briefly is a work on physics and the laws governing it put together by Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist, to serve the purpose of naming wide ranged technologies and their wide based application in various scientific and technical domains. The high point of the book lies in its ability to keep technology enthusiasts on their toes and engrossed until upto eternity after which the reader transforms into a disguised droid resembling a peloton subsequently basking under the glory of scientific and technological possibilities of the future. Physics Of The Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny And Our Daily Lives By The Year 2100 by Michio Kaku steals four stars from a planetary system comprising of five. A mind- blowing and mind-boggling insight on life after the millennials. Grab this book for a read if you like your physique, and don't fail to, if you like his physics. To the book enthusiasts getting introduced newly to Michio Kaku's theories on physics through this read, there's lot of weight in it to keep you interested in the technology of physics and physiques. An excellent reading experience. Chill-out Caucasians."
97,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4482549-brandon,4,"Many people have prognosticated the future, some too optimistically and some too pessimistically. Those who have predicted the future, people of many other professions and fields of expertise, believe that humanity will usher in new-found technological prosperity, become crippled by financial and social ruin, or somewhere in between. Unfortunately, though, with all of the predictions written about the future, very few have come true except for those who kept their predictions vague enough to allow for as many possibilities as possible.Michio Kaku’s new book Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and our Daily Lives by the Year 2100 is one more work among others that have aimed to foretell the future. Utilizing current research, expert opinion from the world’s top three-hundred researchers, scientists, and inventors, and his personal experiences with upcoming technologies, Kaku wrote Physics of the Future to describe the many possible scientific achievements of the twenty-first century and how they will impact humanity in the immediate future (Present – 2030), mid-future (2030 – 2070), and far future (2070-2100). Physics of the Future is a well-written text that suffers from inaccuracies in its predictions, mostly because he cannot predict with detail tomorrow. But it instead garners a riveting passion and love for the sciences that stays with readers for many years.Physics of the Future is easy to read. Additionally, it is also a quick read inasmuch as lower levels of diction allows for audiences to quickly grasp the messages that Kaku presents in his book. One can quickly read through his book, absorbing the implications of the book’s content in a week. The book is also well-organized, therefore providing natural breaks for readers. The first chapter is the prologue Kaku utilizes to introduce the subject matter of his book while simultaneously explaining how others who have attempted to predict the future were usually flawed in their predictions. Using this fact, and without providing adequate support for this claim, Kaku goes on in the prologue to bolster up his ethos by explaining that his book is as accurate as possible because the visions foretold in the book come from scientists, those actually doing the research, than those not engaging in the sciences and simply charting tomorrow’s future. From here, a majority of the book is divided into different categories, each chapter explicating a future for a specific set of technologies; this is divided into three predominant sections (although these sections also have many more sub-sections): Near Future (Present – 2030), Mid-Future (2030 – 2070), Far Future (2070 – 2100). The second-to-last chapter does not follow this format, allowing Kaku to reiterate the fact that humanity together decides its fatum. The last chapter is unique, summarily providing readers with a narrative that serves as a recap of the book. The chapters and sections are brief, allowing readers to take breaks as necessary in finishing the book. This organization also assists readers by making Kaku’s points obvious and quick to understand.Physics of the Future, with its readability, shares the problems its predecessors encountered as they expressed their visions of tomorrow. The arguments are based on assumptions. For example, Kaku posits that humanity will discover a material besides silicon to power computers insofar as Moore’s Law will soon no longer apply to computing power between 2020 and 2030. (Every two years, the computing power of computers double as transistors become increasingly smaller.) Kaku presents many future alternatives—quantum computing, atomic transistors—to counter the problem. Although this is vague, Kaku denies the other possibility: Humanity may not discover alternatives to silicon computing. Kaku does not address this concern, nor does he address a picture of the future where technological solutions are nowhere found to redress current social problems. Other incidents similar to this one throughout Physics of the Future wreck Kaku’s ethos although he is a well-known physicist, author of other books like Parallel Worlds and Visions, and host of manifold multifarious TV science specials and documentaries for different stations like Discovery Channel and Science Channel.Despite these pitfalls in Kaku’s arguments, his optimism about the subject radiates on every page. Perusing his book kindles an interest for science and societal advancement. Readers are drawn into the fire of scientific discovery, invited to question why they are not living with these promising technologies. In an almost utopian world that Kaku proposes for tomorrow, readers are attracted to ride on the backs of extinct dinosaurs, to soar the skies, to take that trip to the beach and relax directly from one’s own home virtually. Readers will wonder why the United States extinguished the flames of space exploration, the ideas of sending robots to the Moon and establishing outposts on Mars and nearby asteroids. In addition to all of the aforementioned questions readers will possibly have in perusing Physics of the Future, readers will question why life-robbing diseases like cancer have not yet been cured. Kaku does a satisfactory job of describing medicine’s implications and technological advancements in the future, but constantly brings up cancer. In the future, Kaku promises that President Nixon’s spirit and ambitions will finally rest insofar as his War on Cancer, declared in 1971, will be over—finally, a majority of diseases will be treatable. This is fortunate for cancer victims, cancer survivors, and their families; however, it weakens Kaku’s validity in his arguments as other diseases like heart disease are not given as much attention. Centralizing portions of the book around eradicating cancer also leads Kaku into making unsupported overgeneralizations like that of cancer “disappearing from the English language.” Making this overgeneralization and others similar to it only exploits an almost near-ignorance to admit that the cure for cancer may be insurmountable and may never be palpable for mass commercialization, degrading the argument for a future, a future of human prosperity. Kaku’s optimism about the future is double-sided. His optimism can encourage one to salivate at tomorrow’s promises and embrace them, but can also lead to ignorance in admitting the negative uncertainties of tomorrow by not answering the claims that it may be impossible to find a cure for cancer, or that it may be impossible to replace silicon computing. The dearth of validity in Kaku’s arguments may make readers not peruse the book, but one other attribute of the book lies in its value. Books that have foretold the future may depict the palpable realms of tomorrow like Raymond Kurzweil’s The Singularity is Near and Steve Kelly’s What Technology Wants, and in fiction books like Edward Bellamy’s Looking Backward, Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, and George Orwell’s 1984, but they do not necessarily empower humanity to chase after those visions.Kaku does. Constantly reminding readers of how humanity can control the civilization it builds, he utilizes the second-to-last chapter of his book, “The Future of Humanity,” to reiterate this point. People are the ends to themselves, i.e., people are in control of where they wish to be. This very principle violates the predictions Kaku foretells insofar as certain technological advancements can come sooner or later than when he says they will; devaluing the dates for which these technological marvels will impact people is how this book should be read. For Kaku’s vision is not necessarily founded on those dates. Rather, it is founded by the scientists, and more importantly, the people who choose whether to categorize science as first or last in their priorities for the near future.Michio Kaku’s Physics of the Future is readable, structured, optimistic, one-sided, and empowering. Indeed, many audiences would come to enjoy the book’s value and its purpose. However, the book is more suitable for two categories of people. The first category is people who are enthusiastic about the future, who rivet in excitement whenever one begins to speak of the possibilities for tomorrow’s culture, economy, polity, et alia. The second category of people, though, is more promising: Students currently enrolled in high school. This book is not necessarily suited in providing students a background into each of the technologies presented, but it does excellently in providing incentive to students. Physics of the Future is broad and covers extensive technologies, occasionally explicating on certain scientific processes for which some of the technologies operate. In turn, this may influence students, making them curious about how scientists are going about and making these technologies possible. The book presents briefly the problems that are conquering this current day and age, but motivates students to become more cognizant about them and more responsive to the progresses and hindrances held to addressing problems like poverty and global warming. Finally, Kaku’s optimism allows for hope as college-bound seniors and upcoming grades of students sail forward into the world, whether their destination lies in four-year universities, the military, or wherever else they may land up. These students will have to deal with tomorrow’s uncertainties, and there will be times in which they will not want to go forward with their dreams, but Kaku’s Physics of the Future is enough to give students another chance, to abet students to craft a future for which they will be satisfied with. A future they and the rest of humanity can live with."
98,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,2,"Physics of the Future is your standard ‘what will the world be like in 100 years?’ book of prognostications. Physicist and science popularizer Michio Kaku structures the book into three timeframes … the near future (up to 2030), mid-century (2030 – 2070) and beyond (2070 – 2100). He then looks at advances that will occur in a number of scientific and engineering domains (for example: robotics, medicine, artificial intelligence, computing, etc.) and describes potential advances in each based upon the current state and direction of research. Kaku is a techno-utopian, and as such, the book is pretty much exactly what you would expect. The human lifespan will be extended, robots will become ubiquitous, computers will become intelligent, poverty will be eliminated, our children will be genetically engineered to be disease free, fossil fuels will be a thing of the past, we’ll set up colonies on the moon and mars and we’ll all live happy, healthy, fulfilling lives in our shiny unisex jumpsuits. On the positive side, Kaku is familiar with the state of the technology in each of the areas he discusses. Thus his predictions begin by extending the current state of today’s research after assuming that it winds up being technologically viable, scalable, cost effective and adopted into broad public use. He then lets his imagination run wild as to the marvels we’ll achieve by the end of the century. Unfortunately, his imagination is pretty much based on what other people have written because everything he predicts is pretty much stuff I’d heard before (except for the idea of downloading software that would allow you to re-program the nanobots that make up every item of our homes, allowing one to reconfigure and redecorate the entire house at the push of a button). On the negative side, people are terrible at predicting the future, so there’s no reason to think any of his predictions will come true. But, one thing that we can be sure of is that every advance will have negative, unforeseen consequences and Kaku ignores these almost entirely (except in instances where he goes out of his way to poo-poo the naysayers). But he’s ignoring history:-	The combustion engine dramatically increased the amount of work a person could perform. It also brought about the existential threat of global warming. -	Splitting the atom was supposed to have brought unlimited free energy. It also gave us Chernobyl and the atomic bomb. -	The internet was supposed to have resulted in the democratization and proliferation of knowledge. Yet the proliferation of bullshit has been a notable achievement.To describe the miraculous advances in medicine that gene editing will bring while ignoring the threat of bio-engineered bacteria and viruses is illustrative of a blind spot that appears to be the defining characteristic of those who fall within the techno-utopian camp. Just imagine someone hacking the reconfigurable home described above … what do you think they would do? If you don’t believe they’d turn your living room into a lagoon of human waste as a practical joke, then you don’t understand human psychology (or toilet humor). The other thing that annoys me about these idealistic prognosticators of a utopian future is that there is rarely a place in their vision for the natural world (beyond the unimaginative proposal of bringing back extinct species). For them, the future is one that is entirely man-made with humans living in an artificial environment of their own construction. But this ignores another aspect of human psychology, our love of nature. Biologist E.O. Wilson calls this biophilia – the idea that humans possess an innate tendency to seek connections with nature and other forms of life. Perhaps these futurists believe we’ll simply genetically engineer this trait out of existence, but I think a more likely explanation is that, while they may have a decent understanding of technology, their understanding of human nature leaves something to be desired."
99,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14515345-erin-britton,5,"In his Introduction to Physics of the Future, Michio Kaku states that there were two experiences during his childhood that have defined his life and shaped his career. The first was hearing about the death of Albert Einstein and the fact that the world’s greatest scientist had died before being able to complete his most important work [his ‘theory of everything’]. The second of these critical experiences was his regular Saturday morning viewing of fantastical television shows such as Flash Gordon. These certainly sound like the formative experiences of someone who would look to the future of science in both a critical and imaginative way.Importantly though, Michio Kaku is more than just a dreamer; even in his youth he was an exceptional scientist and inventor. While still in high school Kaku built a 2.3-million electron volt particle accelerator in his parent’s garage. Previously he had built a cloud chamber with a powerful magnetic field and photographed tracks of antimatter. He certainly seems like the kind of person whose scientific ideas you can trust.Its credentials thus established, Physics of the Future considers what will have changed in the world by the year 2100 in several key categories: computing, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth and humanity. Each category is considered in a new chapter, with the chapters being broken down into innovations which will occur in the near future, those which should happen in the mid-century, and those which we will have to wait until the far future for. This structure is very helpful in demonstrating the progression of science and technology and so also serves to make the various predictions seem more achievable.While some of Kaku’s predictions for the future seem certain and very much achievable given the current state of technology [faster internet, TV walls, self-driving cars etc], some of the things that he foresees being developed in the next ninety or so years are really quite extraordinary. It’s amazing to think that scientists are within striking distance of spaceships powered by laser propulsion and sensors [or nanobots] in clothing that can scan DNA and diagnose illnesses. A great deal of Physics of the Future is, perhaps unsurprisingly, concerned with matters that still seem to be within the realm of science fiction. This is not to say that the evidence and arguments presented by Kaku are unlikely, just to emphasise how extraordinarily quickly developments seem to be being made.The world envisioned by Michio Kaku in Physics of the Future is both amazing and realistic. Kaku has a very clear writing style and is able to explain complex subjects in a way that is straightforward and engaging to the layman. His delivery as well as the mind-bogglingly interesting subject matter ensures that Physics of the Future is an absorbing read from the very beginning. While some of the prospective innovations will be familiar to readers of some of Kaku’s other books [Physics of the Impossible, Parallel Worlds], the majority of the material is new and any repartition that does exist is necessary in order to build a complete picture of the area under discussion.Physics of the Future is a fascinating and enlightening book. The future breakthroughs being discussed by Kaku are amazing, not least because they seem so likely to occur in the [relatively] near future. Additionally, the insight that Kaku provides into innovative and life-changing scientific work that is currently being carried out but that is perhaps not receiving the publicity that its importance should justify is also both important and illuminating. The future looks likely to be a very exciting [if germ conscious] place."
100,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48103245-oliver-trevor,5,"	Physics of the Future by Michio Kaku is an extremely interesting book about scientific predictions of the future’s technology. What I particularly like about this book is that, unlike a lot of other futurist books, Physics of the Future explains the science that would make future technology possible. The book makes predictions for the next few years, a few decades into the future, and for the year 2100. The first chapter (“Future of the Computer”) is about how, in the future, computers will need a new kind of technology. Now, Moore’s Law states that computers get faster every year. However, at some point, it will be physically impossible to create faster computers using silicon. Then, a totally new way of making computers (without silicon) will be needed. The second chapter (“Future of AI”) is about how artificial intelligence will improve in the future. As with the rest of the book, Michio Kaku describes many different AI robots of today that could evolve into future robots. For instance, the Honda Asimo is a child-sized humanoid robot that can act in a life-like way (but has no intelligence). What I particularly enjoy about this chapter is that, unlike movies/other books about the future, Michio Kaku doesn’t assume that robots will become conscious and take over the world. Mr. Kaku’s realistic theory is that robots will slowly get more and more intelligent, but will be programmed to NOT attack people. The third chapter (“Future of Medicine”) is about how, in the future, medicine will do magical things. Michio Kaku sites research about genes that could be manipulated for longevity, discusses how ‘nanoparticles’ (molecule-sized ‘robots’ that are made of chemicals but can go through the body to do specific tasks) will be used to attack diseases, and even mentions how it may be possible to grow custom organs. The central idea of this chapter is that analyzing DNA will help manipulate life in new ways (like manipulating human genes using genetically modified viruses to remove hereditary diseases). The fourth chapter (“Nanotechnology”) is about how machines/chemicals made of a few atoms and too small to see will become useful for tasks such as detecting cancer and entering the body. The fifth chapter (“Future of Energy”) is about different ways in which humanity will have to survive without fossil fuels. In this chapter, the author writes about various experimental nuclear fusion reactors that exist today. In chapter six (“Future of Space Travel”), Michio Kaku makes predictions that range from semi-manned moon bases to interplanetary colonies. Chapters seven and eight are extremely important, as they detail, using evidence from history, how money will move in the future. It is predicted that robots will take repetitive jobs and technology will define who has money. What I find interesting about these chapters is that Michio Kaku uses trends from history to predict the future. While chapter seven is mostly about money, chapter eight discusses how people will make what the author calls a “planetary civilization.” The very last chapter is absolutely my favorite. It’s a story of one ordinary man’s day, living in 2100. He owns a levitating car (it uses superconductors to hover), has many organs that were specially grown for him after an accident, and works for a robot firm.Here's a quote from that chapter:Leaving the bathroom, you wrap some wires around your head, which allow you to telepathically control your home: you mentally raise the temperature of the apartment, turn on some soothing music, tell the robotic cook in your kitchen to make breakfast and brew some coffee, and order your magnetic car to leave the garage and be ready to pick you up ... While drinking hot coffee, you start scanning the headlines that flash in your contact lenses.- The outpost on Mars is requesting more supplies. Winter on Mars is fast approaching. If the settlers are going to complete the next stage in colonization, they need more resources from earth to handle the freezing-cold weather. The plan is to start the first phase of terraforming Mars by raising its surface temperature.- The first starships are ready for launch. Millions of nanobots, each about the size of a pinhead, will be fired from the moon base, whip around Jupiter using its magnetic field, and head off to a nearby star. It will take years, however, before a handful of these nanobots reach their destination in another star system.- Yet another extinct animal is going to join the local zoo. This time, it's a rare saber-toothed tiget, brought back via DNA find frozen in the tundra. Because the earth has been heating up, DNA from more and more extinct animals has been recovered and then cloned to fill zoos around the world.(Physics of the Future by Michio Kaku, page 409)This quote summarizes many important topics from the book - using technologies like fMRI scans to get rudimentary readings of thoughts, using miniature, mass-produced nanobots to explore the universe, and doing medicine that involves DNA (such as cloning).This book makes me think of social issues because I’ll be living in part of what this book describes. The book notes the social issues of terrorism and nuclear war.There are groups, however, that instinctively resist the trend toward a Type I planetary civilization, because they know that it is progressive, free, scientific, prosperous, and educated. These forces may not be conscious of this fact and cannot articulate it, but they are in effect struggling against the trend toward a Type I [meaning global] civilization.Michio Kaku writes that, to become a “planetary civilization,” countries must resolve differences. In a “planetary civilization,” countries will apparently intermingle more freely. In addition, Mr. Kaku puts current world affairs into the bigger picture of where civilization is heading (like in the above quote). I like the part of the book that postulates that robots won’t take over the world, because it’s actually realistic. Having seen robots (and programmed them), I know that even making a vacuum cleaner robot with no intelligence is quite hard (Roomba vacuums must get into all the corners, not break things, get out of tight spaces, and still be easy to control). Considering that Siri has no emotions and can only do exactly what it is asked to, the idea of a robot overlord is ridiculous. The following quote from the last chapter, ""A Day in the Life in 2100,"" shows how unintelligent robots are (the person described is buying a robot dog to give to his nephew). You look over the latest robot dogs. Amazing what these pet robots can do, you say to yourself. They can play, run, fetch, do anything a dog can do. Everything but pee on the carpet. Maybe that's why parents buy them for their kids, you muse.Then you say to the robot clerk, ""I'm buying a robot pet for my six-year-old nephew. He's a very intelligent, hands-on type of kid. But he's also sometimes shy and quiet. What kind of dog might help bring him out of his shell?""The robot replies, ""I am sorry, sir. That is outside my programming. Perhaps I can interest you in a space toy?""You forgot that robots, no matter how versatile, have a long way to go before they understand human behavior.If I could speak with Michio Kaku, I would ask him whether he thinks that society will accept the idea of manipulating genes for any purpose. The book does discuss how manipulating genes may or may not be moral, but only says that genetically engineering something like intelligence will be extremely hard to do. The setting of this nonfiction is important because, unlike a lot of books about the future, a lot of the information is set in labs that exist today. Michio Kaku takes a cutting edge lab or experiment that exists now, then shows how it may continue in the future. Lastly, the last time that I read this book was quite a while ago. At that time, I didn’t know much world history and didn’t really understand world affairs. Now, reading the book again, I can fully understand more of the points in the chapter on the future of civilization. This is a book with enough information to last many re-readings, but it still uses understandable language."

They’re going to take us back into space and make us live longer. They are changes that almost blow the mind. And they’ve already begun.Michio Kaku is a world-renowned physicist that has always been fascinated with all sorts of science. And in Physics of the Future, he looks at what’s currently happening in computing, robotics, biotechnology, medicine, energy, and engineering, and explains how it’s going to affect our daily life between now and 2030, 2030 to 2070, and 2070 to 2100.The insights are awesome. The book’s a feast. Page after page.Did you know, for example, that there are parts of our DNA that have genes for certain traits, but those genes are turned off? For example, humans have genes for growing fur all over our bodies, but they’re turned off. Snakes have genes for legs that have been turned off. Chickens, one of the distant progeny of the dinosaurs, have genes for growing tooth buds in their beaks (imagine the grandchildren being chased by one of those bad boys). There are many more such dormant genes, and in the not too distant future, we’ll be able to turn them on.Did you know that today we can regrow organs? So far scientists can grow skin, blood, blood vessels, heart valves, cartilage, bone, noses, and ears from your own cells. They’ve be able to grow windpipes and bladders. Imagine damaging your eye and being able to grow a new one that your body won’t reject.Did you know that we’ve already been able to hook people up so they can move objects with their minds?And what about computers and robots? Many futurists fear the robots will become smarter than us and take over the world. Will they? Kaku explains why this isn’t likely with the technology we currently have and what really makes up intelligence.These are just a couple of the dozens of thrilling topics Kaku explores. And he makes it all so easy to understand and entertaining.A new world is coming, full of perils and exciting opportunities. An Kaku gives us an intelligent sneak peek.If you wonder what our world will be like in the near future, if you enjoy science and technology, if you want to be informed, then you will love this book. When you finish it, you can then move onto his book The Future of Humanity, which delves deeper into what we can expect in the near future in space. You can then move to The Future of the Mind, in which he explores in more detail what we can expect in understanding, enhancing, and empowering our minds."
102,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31346651-siriusly,3,"Here's another example of assumption gone wrong. I knew that Physics of the Future originally released several years ago, but I assumed that it was updated recently and I love Michio Kaku. So, I blinded borrowed the audio CDs from the library, ripped the discs, and transferred to my phone. This should have been my first indication that this isn't updated...To be fair, maybe the topics in Physics of the Future were new and fascinating upon release, but science moves fast. Being a casual follower of sciencey stuff, I didn't get much from this book. One thing that I DID find revelatory is Kaku's hypothesis that financial booms and busts follow technology booms. He didn't say that tech causes financial busts, but there definitely is some correlation.Sadly, I don't think that I can really recommend this book, unless the publisher releases an updated version. If you're new to following tech and science, this could be a good book to start. But, go in knowing that some of the projections that Kaku made are off (self driving car tech, automation, gene editing) and that some of the advancements mentioned are fairly common now. Also be prepared for a big section of the book dedicated to climate change. Not that this is bad, but too much time was spent discussing this. (YES climate change is real - whether it's caused by us humans or part of Earth's climatic cycle - it's real and it's going to cause serious trouble - especially if we don't try to do something about it)This reminds me of another gripe: rambling. Kaku got a little too rambley in some bits. Too much exposition. Too much irrelevant information. Much like this review..."
103,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90448520-sena,4,"To be honest, I was expecting much more from this book nevertheless it informed me on the things I had interest in and enlightened me on some stuff which I had had no idea of. (I think the reason of disappointment lies in the title. It gives you a vision of what the future might look like and does it on the basis of the current works in physics, astronomy, space, etc. and also by looking at education, history and human nature - not merely ""physics"". That word leads one to a wrong anticipation. I, for example, was anticipating more depth of concepts in physics) Whatever. Let's reflect some thoughts. It starts with a fictional utopia fantasy but if you keep going on you'll see it's not completely fairytale-ish. It debates war, illnesses, mistakes, and so forth. But even the utopic ideas cannot be deemed as a fiction novel since the writer builds it according to the works that going on in the labs and in related fields. Yet, no one can point where the lief goes. But it's gratitude-worthy for letting us know what people try to create in those fields.It was bizarre to always read the same movie references, I'd prefer more diverse examples. Also, a yearning for a 'mythological type of God-like human'? Sorry, it was funny.There were good facts about human nature, the dark sides in our history and even in the moment. It was just and brave. Moreover, some facts make you realize how things developed and makes you brainstorm how will they develop from now on.So my conclusion is, the writer is obviously in possession of significant knowledge and vision however, being an author is another thing. It's like, you can know how magicians trick but putting a show requires other talents. Also shoutout to the Turkish translators, this was the best translated book I have ever read!"
104,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88372371-jasper-wood,1,"Physics of the Future, while bringing up some generally good ideas about possible technologies of the future, fails in its methods of describing and supporting possible new ideas. The book is organized into sections, each one describing past predictions, current technologies, and Kaku's opinion of what the section's field will look like in future years. The description of past predictions, while not nessacarily needing to be as long as it is, does bring up some interesting points and provides insight on how wrong the rest of the book will be. Physics of the Future was published in 2011, and as of 2019 is already just as correct as Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey was at predicting future technologies. Kaku predicts that ""[all] four walls of your living room will have wall screens, so you will be surrounded by images of your relatives from far away"" (22) and that a ""mighty mouse gene"" that ""increases [...] muscle mass so that [a] mouse appears to be musclebound"" (79) will be spliced into the human genome. Obviously, the reality of either statement is laughable now, with VR headsets becoming more mainstream and CRISPR not being the miracle system capable of seamlessly editing DNA that it was thought to be 2011. Kaku opened his book promising not to ""[underestimete] the pace of technological progress"" (11) and in doing so wrote lengthily on any whisper of a breakthrough. The best way to describe Physics of the Future would be as a transcribed conversation about future technology with somebody who has no experience in the field and whose knowledge of current research is what they see in sci-fi movies."
105,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"Forecasting is a difficult task. It is far more difficult when the forecaster is trying to predict the likely developments in an exponentially changing field like scientific and technological progress. What makes it worse for the book is that someone is reviewing it many years after the publication.For any future reader of Prof Kaku’s 2011 work from now on (2019), the most interesting aspects are his long-term forecasts - ie, what he expects to see beyond 2050. Some of his absolute near-term predictions have come to a pass, while some macro trends seem to have shifted within AI, biotech and data sciences at least. Prof Kaku has no major over-arching theme, like singularity, climate-led doom, or endless life and prosperity for all - like in many other seminal pieces on these subjects. All these themes and many more are covered in the book perfunctorily. In Prof Kaku’s future, none of these themes will lord over everything while all of them will remain nearly equally valid/invalid as new products, connectivities, body extensions, ways of living etc continue parabolically. This could be more real-life like, but make for less fascinating reading in a book!The book, like real life, has many topics of a different kind meshed together. Some ideas are presented more succinctly and frequently in popular magazines/papers these days. As a result, the book contains few aha moments while many topics appear too commonplace in our world full of future-portraying tv serials and internet articles. The exceptions are when discussions move to a relatively distant future beyond 2050.Overall, interesting with many novel/fancy ideas in the long future sections but not path-breaking."
106,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84499280-david-baer,3,"I didn't learn anything new, mainly because I've been a futurist fanboy my whole life. But it was a fun read mainly because the implicit message is ""things are going to be All Right."" One day soon, we will all live forever and have hovercars (not kidding).The last chapter, a day in the life of 2111, was hilarious. I have no idea where to begin. It reads exactly like a 1950s futurist's fantasy about, say, 2020. The author has never seen a technology he didn't like. I don't need to check if Michio Kaku is male; if he's female I will eat my smart-hat, complete with its mind-reading chips and biosensors. (Googles Michio Kaku) Oh, he's THAT guy - I see him on the Science channel all the time. I quite like him. He's the relentlessly cheerful ""the oceans will boil"" guy.Anyway, the author apparently doesn't see any possible downside in having tech companies monitor my every movement, every moment, down to my heartbeat and galvanic skin responses. For him, it's not about the tech companies, it's about the technology: I go pee in the morning and the technology monitors the effluent for signs of disease (or other things...). I say ""book me a vacation"" and the technology makes suggestions based on a few petabytes of my personal choices that I have willingly or unwittingly digitized and turned over to the corporations who own the tech. He has apparently never thought about the implications of total techno-surveillance. He imagines we will be free in our technological utopia. I, on the other hand, read his final chapter as a re-imagining of George Orwell's darkest fears.But again, I liked the book because it was a few hours of ""everything's gonna be GREAT."""
107,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30003293-bianca,3,"I gave this book three stars for the content and ideas it presented. Once they sink in--nanobots, nuclear fusion, genetic engineering, etc.--they truly are mindblowing. And to think they're being developed right now and might be ready in a few years! That said, my biggest issue is the editing (or lack thereof) of this book. It is unnecessarily long, repetitive in introductory sentences, and monotonous. I have to keep putting it down so the itch to take a red pen and just strikethrough some text passes. Also, there is no coherent threading from one chapter to the next, and while that may be a minor gripe, it does compound the problem.Also a problem (of sorts) is that this book was published in 2011 and I'm reading it in the year 2017, when Elon Musk (bless his soul) has already perfected the electric car and recovered and reused a Falcon 9 rocket. The six-year difference seemed like a whole century in scientific development, and some of the book's predictions now seem a little off by a few decades (i.e., Kaku predicted that by 2070 to 2100 we would have magnetic cars and trains, but one look at the progress on the Hyperloop says we might get there by 2030).Overall, this is a good gateway book to understanding all the strides being made in various fields of science right now. Just leave your inner editor at the door."
108,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38660953-karen,4,"Listened to the audiobook, which was suitable for x2 speed but the narrator was a little monotonous. Closer to 3.5 stars.Overall an interesting, thinking person's book. The author regales us with numerous reasons why he's an expert on current technologies and thus able to accurately predict the future. He does follow up his bold claims with multiple interesting scenarios and technologies that are shaping the world now and how he sees the world unfolding in the next 100 years because of their influences. It's more or less segmented into topics like technology, medical applications, space travel, etc. The last chapter is written like a day in the life of a human in 2100, and was likely the most memorable (and least monotonous) section of the book. Fascinating, but it was just missing a little something-something.Favourite quotes:""Scientists now realize that forgetting may be as important as remembering in making sense of this world and organizing our knowledge.""""The world's greatest contraceptive is prosperity... Science and technology are the engines of prosperity.""""Walking in the Venusian surface, you would suffocate, be crushed to death, and your remains would be incinerated by the heat and dissolved by the sulphuric acid.""""Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life."" ~ Emanuel Kant"
109,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41396647-peter-corrigan,3,"Alternately fascinating and depressing, Kaku takes us through a tour of where physics and science may take our world in the next 20 to 100 years. Written in 2011 so you get to check some of his 'near-term' predictions. The cheap sequencing of the human genome seems to be on schedule. The end of Moore's Law seems close, he suggested around 2020, the latest estimates hover around 2025. Biotechnology, nanotechnology, AI, computing, energy, medicine, space travel. It is all quite stunning and he regularly cites old Star Trek and Star Wars technologies that are already coming to pass or will soon. Makes you realize how revolutionary Star Trek really was! Kaku has generally a very optimistic attitude about human nature and an almost glib attitude to the possible impact of things like genetic engineering, hugely extended life spans, and AI. Maybe it will all work out very nicely like he seems to believe. Nothing will stop it, that much is certain unless a higher power intervenes. One thing seems certain, the rich will get much richer in ways that transcend money and are probably already happening. Whether all this wonderful change applies to the teeming masses seems dubious. Either way, this was a fascinating tour of the incredible impact of science and technology on how humans will live in years to come."
110,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83500406-kayla-juskavitch,5,"I genuinely thought I wasn't going to like this book for two reasons. 1.) I'm reading this book for summer reading ( it is a mandatory grade) and 2.) because it was about the future and all the technology of the future. Now I am not very much into the future and focusing on robots and different kinds of developing technologies; I barely even watch futuristic movies. However, Michio Kaku’s take on explaining what he and other leading researchers believed what was going to happen within the years 2012-2100 was absolutely fascinating. I have had this book glued to my side ever since I rented it from my town’s library and I am utterly amazed at how interesting it is. The book is a total of 368 pages, disregarding the starting chapter and sources pages, and it is divided into 9 main chapters with subchapters. The subchapters are the three time periods that Kaku divided up from 2012-2100, and the development of technologies as the chapters continue is astounding. As the story continues, I would become more ingrained in the book and was constantly wondering what technologies would be developed and how they would. This novel is a masterpiece and an absolute must read for futuristic technology lovers.. "
111,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70722554-josh,4,"Physics of the future is a great book that allows you to take a peek into the future. It is a great book that allows you to know what type of inventions will be made and, how our lives will be changed. This book explores everything from space elevators made out of really strong material, artificial intelligence, space travel and different propulsion methods for space travel, medicine with tiny microscopic nanobots and many other technologies that might become a reality in the distant future. It warns us about the danger of global warming and Rising Waters. It tells how we might combat these issues from building giant dams to protect our most populated cities from rising waters and to using renewable sources for energy. The also book talks about what challenges are stopping us from making us more intelligent and how we can combat the challenges that limiting our current advancement. These challenges include needing to find a room temperature superconductor to the task of making space travel cheaper. It also talks about Mars and how we might colonize it one day. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves physics, technology, and, Science."
112,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,4,"I am hard to please on this subject. I prefer more technical treatments on physics. This is not such a book. Nevertheless, the author won me over, probably because he was not speaking from his own point of view. He had interviewed other scientists and was presenting their views as well as his own. He did a good job at this and it added a lot of variety.Any problems? Like his previous books he tends to repeat himself. I recognized similar passages from his book ""Parallel Words"" and ""The Physics of the Impossible"". There were infrequent so their existence didn't pull me away from a general enjoyment of the book.The other problem occurred as he was wrapping up and extolling the virtues of science. While I agree that progress in society has been pushed along by scientific discovery, I disagree that science was the primary mover. In fact, some of the worst social disasters could have been avoided if we had all been a lot stupider. Nevertheless, I would not give up those scientific advances just to avoid those social disasters. Such things cannot be avoided by stopping the advance of science. They can only be delayed.I'd read this book again."
113,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94008587-blake-coats,4,"TL;DR - gives some interesting thoughts on how technology will advance and change society up until the year 2100.An informative read that is worth your time if you are curious about how technology and civilization will advance throughout the rest of this century. While we never truly can know what will happen in the future, this book does offer many possible and interesting theories. And if you're worried this will be a dry, technical read - I didn't find this to be the case. Some details get very technical, but I didn't find it overwhelming to where I couldn't understand the basic concepts.Only real nitpicking is that it's called ""physics of the future"" and is marketed to discuss mostly technology but it does cover some other future topics such as economics and politics briefly as well. Which is understandable, as future technology will certainly impact them - just worth noting as those sections read a bit differently and may not fit your taste if you were purely interested in the technology side of things. Also, there are a few times where the author is a bit repetitive but it's not worth a serious complaint - just a minor nitpick."
114,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67204030-louis,3,"a bit of a slog to get through. some repetitive sentences (like the gods of mythology...) but I liked the pop culture references. liked how he tried to measure his predictions against some criteria (be in development now, not break the laws of physics, etc) guessing that far into the future is as much about social and economic predictions as technological. so some of it might be slower than predicted. Guess it was published in 2011 or 2012 as no studies are later than 2010, so he mentions Tesla in passing but not SpaceX. fun ideas though. seems to get the physics behind most of it as well as the institutional bias that are inherent in some fields (the most AI researchers are physicists and have the same worldview) the last few chapters are where I feel it was weakest. but the falling behind academically in the west thing is a bit scary even though he tempered it with the west being more creative. how do I develop both in my kids?"
115,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59696537-pauline,5,"This was the first book I read on science. It completely blew my mind off!Not only does Kaku tackle complicate matters in easy words, he also explains his world view in a very refreshing way. From economics to human nature, his views are so unexpected to me that pretty much everything made an impression on me. It is like my brain has been rewired just by reading this book.Another aspect of this book is the amount of optimism it carries along. Even though some technical developments appear scary and threatening, even though some possible scenarios mentioned into the book can be downright frightening, one cannot close this book with a feeling that nothing can be done. It is in fact the opposite. I now feel like there is nothing the future cannot grant and nothing cannot be done anymore.Hope Kaku will write more on the subject and be translated in more languages! We need such books to be spread. "
116,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18959010-nihal-vrana,5,"This is a very ambitious and charming project and Kaku handled it really well. It is a bit leaning too much over physics, but for the other parts, it is highly informative without being neither too technical nor too simplifying. For me, the quality check was how he handled my area, tissue engineering. It was factual, easy to understand; he missed some subtleties but that is normal and the people he picked to talk with are very good choices too. So, if I extrapolate that to the rest of the book; it is safe to say that it gives a reasonable snapshot of what is to come. It is slightly naive in its treatment of certain social and economical ramifications and has this golden age sci-fi overt-optimism to it, but I find that cute also. The only criticism I have is that it kinda omitted chemistry (it can be said that nanotechnology parts are chemistry, but they were not treated like that), where some amazing stuff is happening. It was my first Kaku book, I will read his others for sure."
117,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3366427-dave,3,"The author quite clearly explained his vision of a possible future for the planet. Much of the science includes ideas and innovations about which I had already read, but he skillfully integrated much of what is happening in research and development into a startling potential reality. It all sounds quite remarkable. But I don't believe the transition from a 0.7 civilization to a 1.o planetary civilization will be as smooth as we hope. And even if we manage to attain it without destroying the environment and each other, we will still not have addressed human nature and selfishness. Even in a 1.0 civilization (as in the Star Trek universe the author references), people will still be greedy, envious, and power-hungry. Will it be possible to engineer our descendants genes to remove negative behavioral and personality traits?"
118,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6974552-kent,4,"This is a really fascinating book talking about future technologies that very well may be real life within the next century. This book is similar to his ""Physics of the Impossible"", but the technologies he is talking about here are ones that are actually being researched and created now, albeit in their rudimentary stages. In their respective chapters he talks about the future of computers, AI, medicine, energy, space travel, nanotechnology, and my personal favorite, wealth. The wealth chapter focuses on how our world may run in the next century when it comes to economics. He seems very optimistic about most of these ideas, but he does write how we may have a difficult time transitioning into a Type 1 civilization, as we are still plagued with greed, bigotry, and class systems. It will be interesting to see what becomes of these great leaps in technology."
119,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11386942-jonathan-desimone,4,"This is a really interesting survey of where technology may take us in the next 100 years. The author breaks it down into several components, healthcare vs. space vs. transportation, and talks about current developments, medium term potential and where we might get to by 2100. It's a very thoughtful approach in many ways and easy to follow. His ability to distill complex topics is quite good making this an accessible book even for the person afraid of science.The only thing that stood out to me was his review of computers. In many cases he applies the logic of exponential progress and how things might evolve in amazing ways. For some reason in computing he sort of lets current physical silicon limitations dictate without going to where quantum computing or other technologies might take us in this realm. But apart from that it was a really excellent book."
120,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3112117-christina-dudley,4,"This was a quick, fun read, and it made me check to see when it was published because some of Kaku's predictions for the near and distant future are already under way! Because I love to read brain books, I knew about how we're already figuring out how to ""read"" particular thoughts. There's a ways to go (see Kaku's discussions of how lame robots are at navigating obstacles because they're not the pattern recognition pros we are), but interpreting basic commands is already nearly there.I do think he's a little hopeful about humanity rising entirely above infighting and reaching the look-how-scientific-advances-have-helped-us-all-get-along-! within the near future, but I have a fairly bleak view of human nature. I'd love to be wrong. But who cares? I'll be dead. Hope my great-grandkids enjoy the post-electric world and using their unreproducible creativity."

Two gripes: 1.) The author let out a lot of steam with the discussion about advances in space. Sure, it seemed interesting but I kept on thinking one question throughout the chapter: ""To what end?"" What is the purpose of pushing to travel to other planets or worlds? Oh well -- just a small gripe. The entire chapter on space fell desperately short, especially comparing to the rest of the material. 2.) I felt the concluding chapter was thoroughly boring. I understand the purpose behind it -- but it let out even more steam. Otherwise, the rest of the book was captivating. I still highly recommend it to anyone. I'm even encouraging my 10 yr old to read it."

He intones repeatedly that science is the engine of progress and lays out many examples to show how innovative have had cascading effects driving other innovations. At the same time, we are influenced by ""the caveman principle, "" that our personalities and motivations have not changed much over the past 100,000 years even though we live longer, healthier and wealthier lives. Humans will have to overcome old patterns of belief if we are to achieve the type of sustainable civilization that the fruits of technology make possible.

Is it that I am only interested in those couple topics? OH, maybe it's that I determined beforehand those were the ""safe"" ones that wouldn't make me have panic attacks. Maybe next time I'll read something about dinosaurs.

As with his talks and lectures, in this read he enthralls with his highly educated predictions for humanity by the dawn of the next century and he does so in a way that only Professor Kaku can do - with wit and charm and and an oh so pleasing demeanor to his written words. Be you a fan of the man or someone curious about what science might have in store for our species ... what wonders your children and grandchildren and great grandchildren might experience in their lifetimes that are only dreams and imaginations today, then prepare yourself to take a genuinely possible trip into the future that only Dr. Kaku can take you on with such aplomb.

I finished it in 5 days. Many of the chapters begin with tales from Norse and Greek mythology that illustrates the technology explained in that chapter. There are some scientific terminology spread across some pages, but they're used sparingly and I never felt left out.If there's a gripe that I have for this book is that coming from a third-world country the speculated technologies mentioned in this book may not be coming to my neighborhood when it actually comes out!"

Some of the ideas seem outragous, like the space elevator, but it's interesting to note that some other ideas are already very easily acheiveable, like the talking walls which is essentially Apple's Siri or Google Now. So it's not unreasonable to imagine how the crazier ideas could soon come to be a reality. He seems to predict science and technology will be the saviour of all humanity, and there's an overly keen aspiration that humans will become gods. Nonetheless it does make you believe so much technological advance is tantalisingly close and you kind of get to see how it might work.Verdict: Infused with fun ideas and game changing advances, there's a constant running theme that science and technology will eventually solve all of the world's major problems. A great read, though overly obsessed with humans becoming gods.

Probably because I am interested in the future of tech and have yet to read a book that explores it other than this one, so my opinion will probably changeA great way of summarising the inevitable technologies of the near future, however that's all it is - a summary. Would have been nice to learn more these technologies with even slightly more detail.May be even out-dated to an extent today as advances have been made since writing and new techs have emerged but a definite must read for learning about the future of science in general.However, this book had very little to do with physics which is misleading and disappointing. Would have been nice to learn about the *physics* behind these technologies.I do love the cover of this edition though....."
128,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12646169-stefan,3,"paints a very colorful picture for every segment of life and science that is going to be relevant now, in the near and in the far future. all based on research happening in laboratories now. basically sci-fi without much fiction. yet stifled by a lot.of hyperbole and blunt assumptions without facts or calculations. it is a good foundation for the not-so-tech-savvy, getting an idea what research is actually done today, but everything that is his imagination of the future has to be taken with a grain of salt. no one can be an oracle, but least so when done with so much disregard for human tendencies and current development. still good food for thought. (plus what is it with him wanting us to be gods all the time?)"
129,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2229658-thomas,3,"I am now on my fourth Michio Kaku book, and they're getting kind of repetitive. It feels sort of like this was ghost-written, given a few wording errors when discussing basic science -- mistakes I don't feel like Dr. Kaku would have made. Regardless, he's basically covering most of the same technologies that he covered in Physics of the Impossible and The Future of Humanity.Another significant problem, here and in prior books, is that Kaku is not a social scientist, but he often attempts to be. His social science is terrible. He relies on wide-eyed speculation that is thoroughly tone-deaf to issues of class, race, colonialism, imperialism, and gender politics.Nonetheless, I've enjoyed his books, even if I take his speculations with a grain of salt."
130,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7118531-vlad,2,"Fun review of current physics research and how it might play out going forward. But the author's one-dimensional idealistic naivety about how software and culture work require the reader to discount the predictions. For example, he dismisses the potential for state governments to become technical big brothers. (The book was written before China advanced the frontier of possibility in technical-enabled autocracy.) He thinks a simple ""kill switch"" on robots will allow humans to shut down AI/bots run amok with a simple command. He believes we'll have stopped fighting within 100 years, and will have abolished territorial nation-state territorial disputes, etc. Felt shallow and pat and not at all connected to deeper thought in political science, technology, etc. "
131,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,3,"Just okay. I picked this up for a few dollars at a used bookstore, thinking I would use it as a sort of a quick reference as I read or write future-set stories. It does help sort technologies into how quickly they will (probably) come to pass before 2100, from near future to midcentury to far future. This book can't offer more than a quick survey of each topic, and if you want more in-depth information you'll have to seek out other sources. The more science-focused earlier chapters are the best, but once Kaku gets outside his expertise and starts trying to make predictions on humanity, wealth, politics, etc. things kind of go off the rails. Some of the book is also outdated, given that it was published in 2011, but that's not the book's fault."
132,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74893332-sandra-niko,0,"Basically, it’s an interesting book to read, but I had another edition, where there’s 702 pages, and somewhere in the middle I got so bored. We can sum up everything that he said on the last 30% of his book as - “We don’t have any f*cking money, but if we do, it would be great to have this and that”. It’s quite captivating at the beginning with the variety of suggestions about the future, but it can be clearly seen that it was written by a scientist. There were no place for predictions about people’s reaction, when they would know that everything is being checked by a Big brother. So, if he were working with a sociologist, it would be a perfect work, but for now, he’s talking about the future partially. "
133,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29612179-john-ghekiere,4,"My biggest takeaway: innovation follows some macro-scale patterns. I love to see macro-scale patterns. I had the blissful good fortune that I consumed this book via audiobook while reading a paperback copy of “Empires of Light” by Jill Jonnes. Michio Katy’s book actually overwhelmed me at certain points but together with “Empires” brought me a fascinating perspective about the inevitability of technological progress. “Physics of the Future” made me roundly uncomfortable due to sheer scope of the coming technological advancements. “Empires” showed me that I feel much like everyone in the 1890’s felt when electricity entered their lives. If it’s scary, then it’s roller coaster scary, not cancer scary. "
134,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8840577-jason,5,"Fantastic, insightful look into how technological evolution projects into the next century. It's amazing that many of these things may be less than 100 years away, but then when we look back at the last 100 years, and the 100 years before that, it's hard to rule it out. Some parts sagged a bit in terms of how interesting the content is, but overall, this is an incredibly well-researched and fascinating book. I love that it closes the last few chapters by peering backward in human history to highlight key lessons that are critical for society to learn from in order to tackle the challenges ahead!"
135,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46694832-magdeline-johnson,5,"Rating: 4.25 starsThis was a lengthy one. It's like a chocolate cheesecake. Consuming ot in small frequent doses is best =) This book discusses science from its historical use to its future implementation in daily life. It's great for science geeks and peeps who want to get a broader grasp on physics. It's downfall is it's publication date (this is a science book therefore the moment it goes into print it's already outdated to some extent) and the excessive facts spewed at a mind numbing rate. However, like I said just treat it like chocolate cheesecake and it's a good book! The audiobook is a better option in my opinion."
136,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27227668-maksim-malik,4,"I didn't like the constant comparisons to Greek mythology, but overall I enjoyed the book. The book was good for getting the imagination to run. I didn't agree with all the possibilities Kaku presented, but the ideas were interesting. Personally I felt in some ways he both underestimated the growth of technology in some parts as well as overestimated it in others.I agree with other reviewers in that the title is misleading and the book doesn't deal terribly much with physics. I don't find it much of a big deal since I read the book blurb before purchasing and knew what to expect.More on AI and transhumanism might have bumped it up to a five star book for me."
137,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27188212-zach,1,"author is so busy making claims about what will be that he forgets to ask himself ""would people even want this?"". the amount of stuff he claims will be commonplace that I would absolutely not want nor purchase is crazy. almost everything he talks about is something I had no interest in. He makes no attempt to explain how anything is possible, he loop holes it by explaining the rapid growth of tech in the past couple decades and then having you assume it will continue that trend resulting in all his claims.The writing sucks, the narrator of the audio book sucks worse.What a terrible book"
138,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57383407-alan,4,"I have to admit that I wound up skimming through a couple of chapters. I loved the introduction so I couldn't wait to read more. Some of the book was fascinating and some of it was terrifying. Some of the things he wrote about that may happen in the future seemed a little bizarre and far fetched even for two-hundred years from now. I liked the way he wrote about the past, (the Middle Ages for example), and how the world could one day wake up and find that it has been pushed back a few hundred-years. I'm currently reading The Future of Humanity by Michio Kaku, so far I like this one even better. "
139,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13337559-oche-malik,4,"A nicely written realistic prognosis of the future of Humanity that covers the role technology will play in shaping our lives in this century and early next century. Many of its predictions have already come to pass since this book was published in 2011. Some of the predictions sound superfluous to the common mind but are actually well thought out. The downside of the book is that the author keeps repeating himself several times. Perhaps that shows his excitement or it's a technique to buttress his points. It however is a partial eyesore. Despite this, I give this book a high rating and I recommend it for anyone who wants to have a glimpse of our common future in the universe."
140,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36223164-anna-b,5,"There is quite a lot of hard science that is delivered through somewhat accessible language and I give kudos to the author and editor. I read Visions and is quite convinced that Michio Kaku can definitely tell us what the future of the world will be like through technology and the eventual plateau of it. I would have like more insights on the socio effects and it's a nice touch to actually read about Singapore in this book. I would say living in 2100 is not much different from living in 2050, only that we have access to space, harness alternative energies, living longer and customising the future generation - this is the dangerous part."
141,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3398492-bickety-bam,5,"Fun and informative. A 10-year-old book of future predictions had me totally entertained. As I read, I looked up many of the topics to see whether the predictions were on track. Sadly, many of the space programs mentioned in the near future sections have been cancelled, but many others seem to be progressing as forecast.Video clips of Michio Kaku have circulated on social media discussing our ""Type 0 Civilization"" status. This topic is discussed in some detail on the book and is so relevant now as we see culture clashes over the pandemic response. The Cave Man Principle is useful for making sense of the current world.Overall, I quite enjoyed the book and recommend it."

143,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53546447-heather-murray,4,"I loved this book! I want to live to 2100 just so I can see all of this come true. The only thing I didn't like was, in the last chapter, the author portrayed what could be a typical day for a business man. He had a meeting with his board, some of whom were there as holograms only visible if you had on the glasses. My problem with this is he's speaking to board members who are all men. In 2100. Really? There couldn't have been some women in his scenario? This was the only part of the book that rubbed me the wrong way. "
144,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30618777-yanesh-tyagi,4,"Considering that the book was written in 2011, it's already in the past. However, most of Kaku's predictions are about to become reality.Kaku talked about true AI and gave the example of Honda's ASIMO robot. Today we have Sofia, a robot that can have a conversation with human. It can think, make a decision about what to say next, phrase a sentence and speak it.The same is true about other things that Kaku predicted such as wearable devices, health trackers, brain interfaces etc.Nevertheless, it was a good read."
145,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75564472-chris,3,"4.5/10I had high hopes butwas disappointed with this book. A lot of it sounded like my out of touch college professors trying to sound like they have a good grasp on what is going on today by taking one potential technological breakthrough then telling me how it's going to change the world.Near the end he gets to his specialty which is physics rather than technology and the last 1/4 of the book is pretty good, but overall is say skip this one. If you're looking for a good futurist book, the author's Future of Humanity is MUCH better"
146,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47867392-mayeen-malik,5,"Really incredible book packed full of rare facts and future predictions. Michio Kaku is a master at simplifying complex scientific theories into easy-to-digest passages for the lay reader. He covered many areas, especially nanotechnology, biotechnology, and telecommunications. The narrative set in the future, though a bit cheesy at times, illustrated just how different life can be by the year 2100. For anyone who is interested in the trajectory of science and the current progress of mankind, this is an ideal read."
147,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118465209-aarushi-dhir,4,Michio Kaku writes a very well detailed conjecture that is engrossing. Can be a bit intensive for some people because of the amount of information but it is well laid out in a simple way while maintaining an impressive flow. Must read for any one with a scientific/futuristic temperament. (Additional tip - Pretty interesting evidence-backed source for writers who want a little help with good ideas for sci-fi worldbuilding.)
148,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13133290-semen-frish,5,"The book is a huge source of kind of up too date research references. It's amazing and impressive. From one side a lot of sounds futuristic from the other some aspects are totally old fashioned. It's very nice to see disruptions in energy, electric cars, VR/AR and AI that already happened through were predicted in 2030-2010 :) Physics is definitely fuels innovation, yet impossible challenges fuels inspiration :)"
149,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5933543-caroline,4,"We read this book as a jigsaw. While my classmates read and presented on other chapters, I focused on Chapter 5, ""Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars"". All the chapters discuss the cutting-edge technology that Kaku predicted in 2011, most of which is currently happening. From solar energy to driverless cars to AI, he outlines the positive and potentially negative outcomes of these advancements. "
150,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/791555-chris,4,"I was kind of lost by some of the physics, but on the whole a very clear and succinct 'map' of major changes by area (e.g., energy or civilization) broken out by present to 2030, 2030-2070, and then 2070 to 2100. Also, largely optimistic which, I mean, future prediction (flying cars!) often turn out to be silly, but a nice change from most of these books which make you want to run for a spaceship."
151,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39364424-eric,3,"More like ""technology of the future"" than ""physics"", this expands on sections of Kaku's previous book ""Physics of the Impossible"" by extrapolating into the future what our current technology and our understanding could accomplish. Nanobots, chips everywhere, interstellar exploration via nano-swarms, and of course our robot overlords. A pretty easy read with some ideas that make you think about what the coming years could be like."

But our tools will not be magic wands and potions but the science of computers, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and most of all, the quantum theory.""Very, very interesting read about the potential future of science in our world over the next 100 years. Michio Kaku presents information that is (almost always) easy to understand even for people who are not physicists."
153,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48367542-lazar-shulekov,3,"I find the book not well strcutured. There is also many repetitive sentances which you want to skip while reading the book. There are some interesting facts inside the book. What i like the most is the comparision how people saw today's achievements in their time.One thing i still cannot understand is why all astronomers are aiming to fertilize Mars spending billions of dollars, but leave Earth's deserts aside."
154,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72297244-madeleine,4,I read this book in 2014 and found it very interesting and mostly easy to read. I would recommend it to anyone interested in measured predictions about where human life is heading from a scientific perspective. You don't have to be a scientist in any way to easily access the ideas in this book so don't be put off by the word 'Physics' in the title!The chapter on AI and consciousness I found particularly interesting and has stuck with me.
155,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62429828-yannick,4,"Very good with flaws. Strengths: - Creates vision for the future of humanity. From there on you can assess on your own what's realistic and what not. - Techno-optimistic but reflected on the fact that technology also can be harmful. - Easy-to-read. Weaknesses: - Sometimes too bold and overly simplistic about its assumptions and outlooks but it is okay as long as you do not expect ""in detail future scenario modelling"""
156,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60117098-patrick,3,"This was an interesting read; however, for someone who is a semi-informed science enthusiast there were few topics in the book that I hadn't encountered in news articles over the past 8 years or so. That's the major drawback to writing a book about cutting-edge science- it's out of date by the time it's published. Still, not a bad book particularly for readers who don't follow regular science publications."

I think he most greatly underestimated the growth of AI, even in the past decade. My favorite part was his discussion of how we might explore the universe with molecule size spaceships... it didn’t address how we’ll get data back, but I guess we need to be surprised by something..."
158,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7257488-fred-rose,2,"I skimmed through this, there wasn't a lot of tremendous insight in the book, but seems to be a fairly dry look from a technologist's point of view (this is a book about technology not physics). Actually it's all about technology. So that part of his predictions may be reasonable but his predictions about culture and politics were through rose-colored AR contact lenses. I did like the space chapter though, probably because it's mostly science fiction."
159,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17908732-chad-manske,4,"Kaku is a well regarded theoretical physicist (think Sheldon Cooper from Big Bang Theory!) in the science field and this 2011 release makes the case for future technology advancements based on the history and current trends in specific fields to include computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, space travel, wealth and humanity writ large. A very readable and thoroughly researched book that sparks innovative imagination! "
160,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95754372-grace,3,"Kaku gives some insight about the possibility of future advances in technology, but the writing leaves a bit to be desired. He talks about existing technology and how those might change over time and references popular sci-fi technologies, such as those of Star Trek and writes about how technology might advance in the coming years. The ideas are more of a general picture rather than how we achieve these advances in specific steps. "
161,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10698669-mark-censor,5,"What will technology bring over the next several decades? From magically controlling our physical environments with our thoughts to clothing that tracks our vitals and nano-probes exploring the far reaches of space, Kaku lays out the basis for a technological wonderland only a few years out. And it’s all based on technologies that are already being developed. Published 9 years ago in March 2011, the predictions so far have held up well. "
162,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7665938-bethany,3,"Life in 2100 is basically going to be the 1990 Arnold movie- Total Recall. But on a serious note, there are some cool ideas coming down the pipeline and any opportunity to reference sci fi in a non-ironic way is pure gold. Since I’m 10 years late reading this, I was want to point out the irony of his huge miss in the intro/1st chapter. All that stuff just happened because of a global pandemic.... so, I’ll forgive that oversight. The rest is totally likely. "
163,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65226819-gettinotterhere,3,"The exploration of content was interesting, but I wanted more out of it. It often felt like Kaku breezed over many of the dependencies for his predictions, leaving the book feeling like his wishlist for the far future. Interesting read, but any kind of approachable depth to the subject would have been better."
164,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20647243-hi-phan,2,"Despite the name, there wasn't much of actual physics involved. It's more like ""Technology of the future that you already knew about"". There weren't much discoveries in this book. I was expecting to get some insight into how physics will actually change the world. Instead, it's just him talking about how he gets to try all these cool technologies we read about in the news as a renown scientist and how much they will improve in the future. And well...how we'll be God. "
165,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66317335-roundface,5,"I wish I've read this book earlier. It explains main scientific progressions affecting humans' destiny. Things we take for granted now are based on decades of scientific endeavor. To predict the future, we have to know the history. Recommend this book if you want to know the physics history of last century and how it will shape our future. "
166,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42371310-johnny-leon,4,"A fun and informative jaunt through the next century of technological innovation. Kaku's book was written in 2011 and it is amazing how in 6 years, already some of his predictions are either coming to fruition or being trumped by an unforeseen innovation. The next century will indeed be the turning point in human civilization."

Some people really enjoy worrying about whether robots will be running humans in the future and while I think some rogue robots may occur, it seems turning them off is still a fine option."
168,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6555360-mustafa-muftuoglu,5,It may look like one of those popular future prediction books but Michio Kaku has written this book to make you ask some questions on what we have today and how it may evolve in the near future (30 years period) and far future (100 years period). I like the way of his explanation on the things we define 'impossible to be' can actually exist in the future. Highly recommended. 
169,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71186843-zachary-delgaizo,3,"The view of the future is neat, however the whole ""gods of mythology"" thing gets really annoying really fast. On top of that, sections can really drag on. Chapter 2 is really the worst offender, and it seems less factual than the rest. Overall however, I'd recommend it to people who want to see what the future may hold."
170,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79281465-indy-randhawa,3,"Kaku it is undoubtedly a brilliant man, but this does not necessarily make him a good author. There are a few instances where he delves deeper into a topic, and this is where the book is most interesting. Unfortunately, many of the topics only receive a superficial discussion. The book is very accessible, so much so, that it feels dumbed-down and incomplete."

It is broken down into sections of time so as to make it easier to differentiate the events that could occur in each time. It is also broken down by topic, this makes it easy to understand and read."

173,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29712250-tyler-zhang,5,Absolutely loved it. I love how he provided so much support for his claims through discussions with famous scientists all over the globe (including himself of course). Reading this book felt like that moment as a highschooler when you're in your first chem class and the boring-looking professor lights something on fire or something ridiculous that gets you hooked onto the subject.

However, he often fails to consider the social aspects of technology, and when he does, his analyses of civilizations, responses to innovation, and ethics are overly simplistic at best. The book would have been much improved if co-authored by someone whose expertise was in sociology of technology. "

177,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38621505-cara-w,5,"Began in September, but finished after finishing the October Book Club Book. Michio Kaku writes about what the future looks like through science and technology. The book was published in 2010 - and his predictions are scary on track. He covers VR and AR, nanotechnology, active materials, and really foolish governments as a real danger to advancing human kind. That's the really scary part."
178,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6348552-omar-rodriguez-rodriguez,3,"The author picks a small selection of future technologies and spends most of the book discussing sci-if books or films where the technologies appear, and the history behind the study of related fields. Unfortunately very little time is actually spent on digging deep into the actual details or the physics required for such technologies.TL;DR: few physics, lots of pop culture. "

It gives me stupidly high hopes for the future, even if those hopes are somewhat flawed. Some people are saying that some of it is misinformed and yes, that’s understandable. But most is so exciting, and it gives you something to look up to."

281,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5128242-andrew-leon,4,"The premise of Physics of the Future is that Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist, would look into the actual science being developed today and, based on past progress in developments, make a projection (prediction) about the kinds of things we can see in the future. Assuming we, as a race, live long enough to see those things come to fruition. And, yes, he talks about that ""if,"" too.For me, Kaku spent too much time dwelling on the future of medicine. Not only does medicine get its own chapter (chapter three), but it's laced throughout the book. I get it. I do. People are concerned with medical advances that can allow them to live how they want to live with no negative consequences, and, actually, some of the research currently underway might make that possible. It is entirely possible that my generation will be the last generation to die and that the next generation (my kids) could have potentially unlimited lifespans. There's even an outside chance that some of those developments could happen before the end of my generation, but that would require a remarkable breakthrough and, still, probably only be available to the fabulously wealthy. Kaku is considerably older than me, so I can understand the focus. Still, he covered the same ground about early cancer identification at least half a dozen times.The other thing he spent too much time on was magnetism. Kaku seems quite enamored of the idea of telepathically controlling the environment through the use of superconductors, and he refers to this a lot during the course of the book (much like the nanomachines which will detect cancer). The problem is that this relies on the accidental discovery of something which may not actually exist. Our current generation of superconductors weren't developed, they were happened upon, and he bases much of his magnetism predictions on serendipity.He also seems to be overly optimistic about the future of mankind, at least from my perspective. He spends a considerable amount of time explaining why the ""singularity"" won't happen or, if it does, why we'll be able to control it. He makes a point about how, one day, the most sought after thing on the Internet will be wisdom, this after stating how humans are essentially the same as they've been since we became human. He expects ranting bloggers and funny cats to disappear as we all become enlightened, and I think he's been watching too much Star Trek. And that he doesn't really know humans very well if he thinks we (as a group) will give up funny cat videos. And blogger rants.However, all of that said, the book is fascinating. The technology discussions are fascinating. And the chapter on the future of wealth is extremely fascinating. The unstated comparison of the US to the Ottoman Empire is especially compelling. Nutshell: At one point, the Ottoman Empire led the world in science... until it gave all of that up to embrace religious fundamentalism. Let me re-state that: At least 50% of America's leading scientists have come from other countries and more and more of them are, instead of staying here, returning to those countries after they've received their education. America, because of the deplorable state of public education, is not producing sufficiently educated people of science. It's not our focus anymore.If you're at all interested in the book, now is the time to read it. Only four years away from publication, and parts of it are already becoming outdated. The section on self-driving cars is a good example. Current projections are that self-driving cars will be as common as smart phones within the next decade; Kaku doesn't really expect them to start even showing up until around 2030. He makes no mention of quantum communication and only mentions quantum computers as an unlikely option. IBM has just developed a computer chip that could completely change the computer industry. Warp fields have been created, too, another bit of science Kaku glosses over as being the least likely of options.Still, it's fascinating. Even the stuff about the space elevator, but that's mostly because he spends time talking about carbon nanotubes during that part, and carbon nanotubes, if we can figure out how to make them long enough, are another technology that could completely change the world.Of course, the drawback, even though Kaku has made it very accessible, is that it's very heavy on science. Well, it's all science, so I can see it being difficult for some people to get into. For whatever reason. But, you know, if you're writing any kind of science fiction, right now, this might be a book you want to have on your desk."

284,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12255603-siddharth-gupta,5,"Mind blown. Predictions of the future are always problematic for a myriad reasons. Prof Kaku painstakingly consults domain experts to predict the scientific evolution of themes he is exploring. Remarkable how deterministically he address the future. Since the book came out almost a decade ago, some of his predicted theories are already a reality. Surely intrigued me. Has catapulted his other writings to the top of my reading list."
285,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7937636-jansen,4,"My worst fear in life is not death, but the idea of dying and having something really cool happen the next day. For example, I just know that when my number is called, aliens will finally come to our planet and make contact with human civilization.To that end, my curiosity about what might happen in this century, providing I don't live to see it all, has been somewhat satisfied by Michio Kaku's intriguing book, ""Physics of the Future."" I've had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Kaku featured on science programs about UFOs. This book, however, is not about UFOs, rather, it talks about some of the futuristic inventions and cultural changes that may unfold during this century. Michio Kaku doesn't run away with his imagination in this book, and I felt satisfied that he was making a fairly good projection of what may come based on where we are now. For example, he believes that microchips will soon be found in everything and will be as common as paper. Appliances will be smart and able to communicate with us, our clothing will be able to diagnose our illnesses and even call for help if we are injured and incapacitated. This is just the tip of the iceberg. The book covers many topics from the future of medicine (we won't cure the common cold but will be able to tinker with our genetic make-up) to wealth (middle managers will disappear while novelists and creative types will still be in demand because artificial intelligence will still be limited) to civilization itself (we are a type 0 civilization because we get our energy from dead plants; type 3 civilizations can get their energy from the universe itself and would seem godlike to us). Likewise, transportation will move away from fuel burning, and we may see more magnetic trains and vehicles. We probably won't colonize Mars or even the moon in this century, but we will get a good start. Of course, developments in any arena rely on the availability of funds, and cheap innovations will rule the day. Mr. Kaku does a good job of illustrating how innovations become the mainstream. At first, innovations and discoveries are a necessity, but, ultimately, they become fashionable and permeate throughout our culture. As an example, in ancient China, only the emperors had paper. By the 1800s, it was more widely available but still very expensive. Nowadays, it is everywhere. By following this pattern, we can see how the things that are more expensive and exclusive in our culture at present may one day be commonplace as their cost is driven down.Some of the predictions seemed a little off base to me. For example, Mr. Kaku believes that the Internet will be in everything by the end of the century. Even the most mundane tools will have Internet access. My only problem with these kinds of predictions are that we may quickly arrive at a time where the Internet is obsolete and replaced by something else. It may seem hard to believe in this day and age, but who could have predicted the rise of the Internet even in the '80s? (Providing you weren't Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.) Likewise, how can we think that something won't arise to take its place?As is the case with most books of this nature, the predictions are filtered by the time period that it was written in. It's funny to look back on predictions of the future from the early 1900s and see just how wrong they were. In 1984, we weren't exactly living in a fascist world where our every move was monitored by Big Brother. (Some would argue that time is now.) By the same token, we aren't getting around in George Jetson type space cars and the prototype of Hal is, today, no smarter than a common cockroach. (Artificial intelligence won't be on the level of a human mind until after this century.) All in all, this is a fascinating book and one that I recommend highly to all futurists like myself. If we are lucky enough to be cured of aging and have our aging reversed (Mr. Kaku predicts we will see it this century), then we can all gather at 2101's version of Starbuck's and pour over ""Physics of the Future"" to decide what Mr. Kaku got right, and what he got wrong. "
286,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5663350-michelle,3,"I like Michio Kaku and loved his book Hyperspace, so I was excited to read this one. Despite some annoying problems (which I'll outline in a moment), this book was an interesting read (even though I liked Hyperspace better). It's fascinating what kinds of innovations scientists have been working on and what we as a species are capable of, already. Kaku makes predictions about how innovations in computers, AI, medicine, nanotechnology, space travel, wealth, and human civilization itself will develop in the near, middle, and far future. Some of the predictions seemed outlandish, but then, just 100 years ago in 1914, the idea of the Internet and smartphones would have been crazy talk. So, problems with this book? They are as follows:Where are the women?!Kaku interviewed and quoted dozens of scientists for this book, whose projects he shared and described. Of all of these many brilliant scientists he discusses in an over 400-page book, only about two were women. I have nothing against men. However, by the third chapter, each time Kaku mentioned another man's work...followed by another...and another, my annoyance grew and grew. The very last chapter was a fun fictional sketch of how life might be in 2100, with the technologies described in the book applied to the life of a fictional character. This sketch is told in the second person, but the main character is male, and so the story has a male point of view. This character is an engineer, and his boss is male. Apparently so are all of his colleagues, because there's a scene where they're having a business meeting and the boss addresses his team as ""Gentlemen..."" Our fictional main character goes home and his robotic doctor has a male persona. The main female character in this sketch is the love interest of the main character. She's not a scientist but an artist (she's also a web designer, so at least she has technical skills). When I finished the book, I scanned Kaku's list of recommended reading. All written by men.It's sad to me that a book about the future of science and technology does not include women, and when it does (in the futuristic sketch), it places them in stereotypical, not-hardcore-scientific roles. I don't believe for one second that there are fewer than two women working on innovative scientific and technological research.I don't think Kaku intentionally left out women. Rather I think it's just something that his male privilege lets him forget. It's also a great illustration of the fact that the science industry is still male-dominated. I hope that's not still the case in 2100!Quantum Physics is ""correct""According to Kaku, that is. Quantum Physics (his specialty) is absolutely correct. He says so in the book. No ifs, ands, or buts, it's the real deal. Just in case you were wondering.I don't have a problem with him believing that (and hell, it may really be correct, I'm not a physicist so what do I know). My problem is with his arrogant finality on the subject.The ""Future of Wealth"" ChapterI don't know what happened here. I thought the chapter would discuss the future of personal wealth and how innovations in products would affect the concept of money in the future, but instead we get a halfway political rant, with Kaku's own personal views about the priorities nations place on science and tech. Which is fine, but his tone comes across as arrogant and absolute/final. Also, this particular chapter felt like an un-edited first draft. Repetitive and rambling. I skimmed a large portion of it. The writing itself in this chapter didn't gel well with the rest of the book. Odd overall.In conclusionI'm going to keep this book around to see if any of Kaku's predictions / the projects he describes actually come to fruition in the next 10, 20, 30, etc years. I'll read it with my grandkids and we'll probably laugh -- either out of awe because the predictions came true, or out of pure entertainment because the predictions ended up being way off from what REALLY happened..."
287,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Physics of the Future by Michio Kaku ""Physics of the Future"" is a fabulous, thought-provoking, engaging and accessible book on the physics of the future. What sets this book apart, is Dr. Kaku's prodigious knowledge and his innate ability to convey complex topics in an engaging conversational manner. This fantastic 416-page book is composed of the following nine chapters: 1. Future of the Computer: Mind over Matter, 2. Future of AI: Rise of the Machines, 3. Future of Medicine: Perfection and Beyond, 4. Nanotechnology: Everything from Nothing?, 5. Future of Energy: Energy from the Stars, 6. Future of Space Travel: To the Stars, 7. Future of Wealth, 8.

Each chapter begins with a couple of chapter appropriate quotes, an appetizer of an introduction (with a little mythology analogy for good measure) and then broken out by three subchapters: Near Future (Present to 2030), Midcentury (2030 to 2070), and Far Future (2070 to 2100). 3. Great use of popular culture to make his points easy to convey. The use of popular Sci-Fi movies to explain complex concepts is brilliant. 4. A fantastic idea of a book and I couldn't be happier that Dr. Kaku is the mastermind behind it. Great wisdom throughout. 5. Great science for all to enjoy. The future looks fascinating. 6. Finally, a fun, profound yet accessible book about physics of the future. 7. This book is like the behind the scenes look at the science behind the best Sci-Fi movies ever. Excellent! 8. The best way to predict the future is to consult the greatest minds, the subject matter experts and Dr. Kaku does exactly that. 9. How the four fundamental forces changed human history. 10. The future of Moore's law. 11. Our minds will control computers...just make sure husbands get this technology before the wives do. 12. Will robots inherit the earth? Only if they're fembots but I digress. 13. Fascinating look at why brains are superior to computers. I think. 14. Optogenetics...optowhat? Read and find out. I see. 15. Punctuated equilibrium best describes the way in which progress is made. 16. The fascinating future of medicine. You shall be healed. 17. We must clone Dr. Kaku. 18. Designer children, too late for me... 19. I want to be a geneticist... 20. ""The quantum theory has one thing going for it: it is correct."" Love that quote. 21. Nanotechnology...no small feat. 22. Energy saving ideas. Like you've never seen before. Powerful stuff. 23. Global warming...the topic just keeps heating up. Great explanation. 24. Space technology is far out! 25. The number 25,000 has a totally new significance to me. You can count on it. 26. New propulsion systems considered. It's not like it's rocket science...oh wait it is. 27. Science and technology are the engines of prosperity. NEMA. 28. The rise of intellectual capitalism. My two cents. 29. The importance of using science for the good of our planet. 30. Dr. Kaku does a wonderful job of tying everything together with an amusing story. 31. Great list of notes and a recommended reading list that has my attention. 32. Fascinating book from cover to cover. Negatives: 1. Links didn't work. 2. Some folks, particular those in the science field, may object to the book being ""dumbed"" down. I have no complaints since the book was meant for the masses. 3. Having to wait for Mr. Kaku's next book. In summary, this book is a real treat. I absolutely loved it. Great science, interesting facts, and a fascinating look at the future. Dr. Kaku is such an engaging, brilliant man; he tackles an ambitious project like this and succeeds on all accounts. This is the reason why I love science and this is the reason I enjoy reading books. I can't recommend this book enough. A well deserved 5-star book. Bravo! "
288,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,5,"We live in a remarkable time of human history. Since the industrial revolution, society has been radically altered by new innovations on a regular basis, and the rate of those world-changing transformations is ever-increasing, like a snowball growing in size and strength as it barrels down a hill. In Physics of the Future, Michio Kaku attempts to identify what changes may come in the 21st century, after interviewing hundreds of scientists from various fields. The result is extraordinarily interesting, covering projected developments in computers, artificial intelligence, medicine, nanotechnology, energy, and space travel as well as the future of wealth and humanity itself.Although Kaku's field of theoretical physics doesn't lend itself well to lay understanding, here he writes expressly for a popular audience, inundating the text with references to pop culture. While he does engage in some scientific discussion from time to time to explain the basis of new technologies, the book emphasizes their effect on everyday lives, and his ultimate goal seems to be to wake the public up to the potential of science and the importance of appreciating it. When writing on technology, that's easy to do -- there's no shortage of new toys that Kaku can tantalize readers with. Imagine being able to take care of your entire morning routine -- cooking, errands, etc -- with a few orders given to your home computer via a headset while you sit in bed, for instance.Considering the range of chapters, there seems to be something for everyone here. Being keen on human space flight, for instance, I looked forward to reading about the various ways in which we might further explore the deep black. While I try to stay well-read on that subject, Kaku touched on approaches I'd never heard of --like launching swarms of ""nanoships"". Our medical prospects seem exciting and wondrous. His predictions on the future of computers frankly horrified me, as he envisions increasing immersion inside virtual environments, or rather a day in which there's no real distinction between virtual and 'real' environments. We're already seeing this today, with applications for our gadgets that read the environment and give restaurant reviews for the dining establishments on a given street, but in the future this interaction will rely on contact lenses that project the Internet onto our eyeballs.Kaku's work is triumphantly optimistic about the way technology will continue to dominate human lives, which I appreciated given the cynical spirit of our times. However, more thoughtful consideration to the possible consequences of these technologies on our lives might have been in order. His projections point toward a world in which humans are increasingly spectators in their own lives, the subjects of Matrix-like domination by technology. Considering the health problems our current use on automation has given us, do we really want a future in which that is increased? There are seven billion people alive today, most of us doing jobs that Kaku sees machines doing in a hundred years. The kind of social disruption that widespread job losses would cause is unimaginable. He also takes a curiously light attitude toward energy. It would seem to me that in a world as technologically dominated as his in 2100, the section on energy would be fundamentally important -- the foundation on which every other section is based. Instead, it is treated as lightly as a commercial advertising toys mentions the need for batteries.Even with these limitations, Physics of the Future recommends itself. It's open to anyone remotely literate and should have surprises in store even for those who consider themselves tolerably well-read in matters of science and technology. I imagine the sharpest criticism would come from those interested in social sciences like myself."
289,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7537934-zach-edelman,0,"In the past 200 years technology has grown exponentially. we’ve went from the first bicycle to the sports cars of today, and will proceed forward to the self driving cars of tomorrow. The rate at which technology is advancing is incredible and scientists and physicists are dreaming and building the ideas of tomorrow. I for one am amazed by the rate at which technology is improving and am forever thankful I picked up this book. In Physics of the Future, Kaku plays journalist and interviews over 300 of the world’s top scientists in microtechnology, medicine, chemistry, biology and many other fields. To make sure the reader is not overwhelmed Kaku blends the insights from the other scientists with the his own to create a deeper understanding of the topics that he can truly connect to the reader with. Physics of the Future is truly brilliant. The author walks you through really advanced topics and ideas in a couple pages and leaves you with a good understanding of what you just read. An example of this would be Kaku explaining Moore’s law, which states that computer processors double in power every eighteen months. Kaku’s book explains what technology’s advancements and impact on society is all about. The book’s main sections cover what life will be like in the 2000-2030s near future era, and how advancements today precede it, what life will be like in the 2030-2070s midcentury era and how advancements today will precede it, and what life will be like in the 2070-2100s distant future era and how ideas today will precede it. Kaku speaks very fast paced and makes it easy for people with absolutely no experience in the fields of engineering, science, or computing to understand what he is talking about.The author’s craft was very speedy and direct. Kaku used little figurative language and absolutely no symbolism. Kaku did allude to a lot of things in science fiction tv shows and movies like the voyagers and space-tools used in Star-Trek. Kaku wrote great for the audience that would be reading the book because he answers all the questions and moves at the same pace you do. This book is absolutely great and a must read for anybody who wonders about how the trends of today will forerun the inventions of tomorrow.Physics of the Future is a book published in 2011 by Doubleday. Kaku’s book is theoretical nonfiction, meaning that based on the current scientific data it is assumed to be fact. This book fits great in the theoretical nonfiction genre because it explains a lot about the current scientific community's views on what the future of technology will be like and how trends will affect the human creation process.Michio Kaku is an American theoretical physicist, a futurist, and a communicator and popularizer of science. He is a well known author in the scientific community, he often makes appearances of radio, television, film, blogs, articles, and other books. He has written several books about physics and topics relating to physics. Some books he has written are Parallel Worlds and Physics of the Impossible. Of his books, Physics of the Future comes second to Physics of the Impossible. The audience for which this book was written would most likely be young adults to adults because the book talks about complex laws and theories of physics like “String Theory” and “Multiverse Theory” that would be way too difficult for many kids our age and younger. If you are very into science and inventions, you should start reading this book the first opportunity you can because it talks about some of the coolest inventions I have ever heard of and how they will affect our lives in the future. I would recommend this book to anybody who has any interest in science and the future and understands physics at least a little bit because you will learn a lot and your mind will simply be blown."
290,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80167050-alex-billedeaux,5,"Kaku makes sweeping (and sometimes presumptive) predictions about the future of technology in America, using current research as a basepoint. His book is a great way to get excited about scientific innovation."
291,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2181868-booksweetie,4," If you are a non-scientist, don't let the word ""physics"" in this book's title PHYSICS OF THE FUTURE scare you off. Author Michio Kaku in this 2011 work writes for the non-scientist.  Indeed, readers who seriously keep up with science and technology may not appreciate this book as much as those among us who represent a more generally educated reading public, but who don't particularly focus our reading (and/or television viewing) on science and technology topics.  So, don't expect equations or other detailed physics explanations. This book is not really a physics book so much as it is the author's enthusiastic reports about the present and imagined near future after interviews and discussions with more than three hundred scientists from multiple disciplines. (Their names and affiliations are listed right after the table of contents.)  Consider the subtitle: HOW SCIENCE WILL SHAPE HUMAN DESTINY AND OUR DAILY LIVES BY THE YEAR 2100. That one phrase is a great summary of the content of this book. If that subtitle arouses your curiosity, maybe this book will be for you. The chapters are clearly organized beginning with the Introduction: Predicting the Next 100 Years. Separate chapters follow: the future of the computer, future of artificial intelligence, future of medicine, nanotechnology (manipulating at the scale of individual atoms/molecules), future of energy, future of space travel, future of wealth, future of humanity, and a day in the life in 2100. The order of the main chapters appears somewhat flexible, meaning that a reader could (after reading the introduction) choose to skip around at the chapter scale, according to topical interest or time constraints. An aside: I didn't skip around myself though the reading in some places certainly seemed denser than in others, and I could imagine other readers also bogging down. Certainly, we all have different backgrounds and interests, so I try to remember to be flexible when things get detailed and my own attention flags. That's when I try to remember to skim for a bit. Or to take a break and return later. Or, in this particular case, it would have been okay to jump ahead to a chapter that sounds more interesting at the moment.  Within the chapters, readers will also find helpful sub-headings such as near future, mid-century, or far future. (Note: Skipping around is not recommended within the chapter itself.)The prose is mostly straightforward and unadorned; the writing is occasionally interspersed with references to film and science fiction that may or may not be uniformly illuminating or appealing, depending upon the reader's own experiences. Readers may enjoy seeing and hearing the author (and others) at the wonderful BIG THINK site. http://bigthink.com/users/michiokakuNo sooner had I finished reading PHYSICS OF THE FUTURE, then I heard an announcement that Michio Kaku has a new book just released (February 25, 2014 publication date) called THE FUTURE OF THE MIND. More happy reading is in store for me, I hope, about the fascinating present and future of the brain and mind!   .   "
292,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4760568-eric,4,"So before I delve into the review of the book itself, for all the reviews of people who are complaining that this book isn't scientific enough because it doesn't have empirical data, calculations, and is more about technology than physics: screw off. If the few ""physics purists"" had their way, no one would purchase this book because normal people, even people with science degrees, such as myself, would not buy this book. This is the main problem with science today; it doesn't mean anything to the average person. People are dismissive of science because they think it's elitist and those who understand science look down upon those who don't. Just like Kaku said (this is a paraphrase), ""the future is here, it's just not evenly distributed."" Kaku openly admits in the introduction that this tome is more about futurism than anything so I'm not sure why people are upset after reading through it and saying ""this isn't science, this is futurism.""Anyway. Each chapter takes different subjects and breaks them down into the chronological direction those particular fields are most likely going to lead and the direction is broken up into the near-future, the mid-century, and the far-future. This book was written in 2011 and just 3 years later some of the particular technology he describes in the near-future is already coming to fruition, such as the self-driving car, glasses/contact lenses with computer chips, and tissue engineering (the field I myself am trying to break into). If you were to read only one chapter, I would say to read the future of wealth. Whether your interest is science, technology, economics, history, political science, education, or just about anything else, these particular 40 pages are important. No one speaks about the transition that global capitalism is currently going through, you just have the knee-jerk reactionaries who think the system is flawless and the radicals who want to bring the system to collapse no matter how many innocent lives it harms. Kaku lays out the simple truth, we need to rely less on commodities and natural resources and more on intellectual innovation and computer software in order to keep economic growth increasing. The chapter on the future of space travel is inspiring and makes me want to put a lot of my energy in advancing that field even though I will probably not live to see humans landing on celestial bodies besides Mars. The chapter on the future of energy is also pretty cool. It breaks from the conventional ""ditch oil and ditch oil NOW"" sentiment and stresses the importance of utilizing what we can while we improve renewable technologies until they become cheaper or until we can harness dark matter as the ultimate energy source.What I also really like about Kaku is he constantly stresses where futurists have been right and where futurists have been wrong. Don't take everything written in this book to heart because someone somewhere will be disappointed. Having said that, I think this is a pretty good guideline for what we can expect in the future. All in all, I think everyone should read this book and if you're skeptical, give it a chance."
293,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5620169-amber,3,"This is an interesting book about how technology--I suspect some chemists and biologists would quibble with everything described in the book being called physics--is likely to change the world over the next 100 years. The author's experience in writing for broad audiences is clear, and he does a very good job describing these technologies in plain terms. Interestingly, most of this technology has already been developed, it ""only"" needs to be commercialized in the years to come.Some of his theories:--that microchips will become like paper, embedded in everything walls (functionally screens), contacts, etc.--that nuclear fission will produce power within the next 100 years. As he describes it, this technology seems achievable, but as he notes, it has seemed relatively close for decades now. --that cars of the future likely will hover above a magnetic track, which will drastically reduce the energy required for propulsion, since the vast majority is used to overcome friction. --that nanotechnology is likely to be the foundation for major technological progress. This was interesting to me because it's something that you hear a lot about at Rice, but I never understood especially well.He also has a scarily prescient paragraph on the potential for a nuclear accident eerily similar to what happened at Fukushima.In general he is very dismissive of resource exporting as a path to development and/or economic success; this certainly has been contradicted during the last 5-10 years but may be true in the long run. He cites Japan as a successful economy without domestic energy production, but the rising cost of energy imports has been a real headwind to Japanese growth of late. Of course, technological breakthroughs that render economies more efficient would limit the impact of these rising costs--as would breakthroughs in production costs or resource access that render energy less expensive. He is very dismissive of the latter as well, arguing that oil production costs are skyrocketing, bordering on ""peak oil""-type arguments--while prices skyrocketed in 2008, there is a lot of potential for high-cost production that has barely been explored or tapped. I will be quite surprised if this turns out to be the case. Much more likely, in my opinion, is the former argument, that energy prices will fall because we use less of it.He also makes lots of mythology references; it's clear that this is an interest of his, but it can drag for those without the same passion. I also found the chapters on space travel less interesting, because they seem so much less practical, and moreover, useful. He also tended toward somewhat simplistic arguments that more money spent on any kind of research=good, rather than any sort of delineation about what areas might yield the best investments. (Surely, not space travel.)"

You will find yourself on a journey with Kaku as he interviews many notable scientists. Along the way the author will explain his predictions of the future in each field as he describes what it would be like to live with that technology. For those who don’t know Michio Kaku; he is a theoretical physicist who contributed to “The String Theory”, he also has his own TV show on the Science channel. My review on Physics of the Future is for you to decide whether or not this is a book for you.	This book is targeted to a particular audience which is one with a joy of science. The author dives into the life of science and visits all spectrums of our technology, while introducing his predictions to where it may lead us. Taking you through sub-genres of fields like quantum computing and how it will be our next evolution of the computer world. As well as augmented reality, where the physical world meets the virtual world. The author uses great detail in his descriptions so the understanding of High School science is at least needed to keep up with what he is talking about. Kaku takes a creative way to expressing his predictions. The author describes the world and what it would be like for each and every developing technology that he introduces. Along the way he interviews many scientists, which contribute to their own views on his predictions. Kaku uses strong linguistic dialect toward each field of research he discusses, so at times a dictionary may be needed. Do not let this intimidate you as for the creative and colorful descriptions over take this down side.	Kaku presents everything as creative and imaginative as he can without stretching the truth. He presents the amazing research that is being performed today such as Einstein’s theory of spooky science Quantum entanglement. Kaku lets you see that what is and once was science fiction is coming to life in labs across the world. He gives you a full insight of the growth of each field and where it may take us. In doing so he gives us vivid descriptions of how the technology will be brought to life. 	The author does a fantastic job stimulating the imagination. I feel that this was a fantastic read for anyone that has an interest in where our technology might take us. The only thing I have against the book is that I feel Kaku played it too safe. A majority of his predictions can be foreseen by anyone picking up a monthly Science magazine. That doesn’t mean he did not do a wonderful job explaining the great possibilities of the future, I just wish he stepped up to talk about the controversial topics that are being left out of mainstream media.

‎By 2100, our destiny is to become like the gods we once worshipped and feared. But our tools will not be magic wands and potions but the science of computers, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and most of all, the quantum theory.

Michio Kaku takes the reader through the current research being done today in several areas such as medicine, computer science, AI, energy, etc. and what we can expect in the near and all the way to the beginning of the next century. And as he says, magic wands and potions will not be our tools. My own journey with magic began with, like many other people, the Harry Potter series. All that magic neatly wrapped up in a story that I could never live out in reality (except, you know, in my wildest dreams). But as I grew older I found science. Biology, chemistry, math, and most important physics. To me, this is as close to magic as I'll ever get, and that's enough for me. Okay, the HP magic is pretty cool, but still. Naturally, this book was for me, and I knew that the instant I saw it.Anyway, Kaku presents some downright amazing stuff. Probes finding cancer before it breaks out. Cars driving themselves and thus preventing deaths related to car accidents. Robots living among us as equals. Space travel and a wider understanding of the universe. Being able to move things with a mere thought due to help from superconductors. Means to help us live longer. I mean, seriously, who wouldn't want all this stuff?Now, I'm not going to pretend I know ever aspect of every area Kaku brings forward. I'm far from educated in them all, and I have seen other reviews claiming some parts is wrong, both in terminology and other aspects. But I'm not going to say either is right or wrong. People have predicted the future and what science will be able to bring with it too many times and I think believing something is impossible is simply the wrong attitude. Because there are certain aspects that are done and told exceptionally well. Kaku is obviously a smart man and the scientists he's interviewed are so as well. And I strongly doubt they are wrong as well. Many of them are highly-respected scientists (this I actually know for sure), and have great insight in how the future might look for us. What can be the problem is that Kaku himself is not an expert and might have gotten a thing or two wrong, but I doubt the actual science is wrong since many of the theories are in a stage where prototypes of various sorts are in the making.And, come on, it's more fun to believe the future will evolve and give us new incredible devices and means for living. And, controlling things with your ming? Don't tell me that isn't magic.| BookLikes | Leafmarks |"
296,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35995783-rae,2,"""But science by itself is morally neutral. Science is like a double-edged sword. One side of the sword can cut against poverty, disease and ignorance. But the other side of the sword can cut against people. How this mighty sword is wielded depends on the wisdom of its handlers.""You can say that again.I didn't enjoy this book sadly. It portrays a bleak and depressing future that I don't want to be a part of. Designer babies, robots going berserk, chips in everything, screens for walls, robotic pets, reprogrammable sofas?! It made me want to turn the TV off and hide in a cave somewhere.Even if this technologically advanced dystopia sounds amazing to you, I still wouldn't recommend it because although Michio Kaku is an extremely intelligent and enthusiastic individual... I think he's way off the mark with his predictions.Most of his conjectures are based on theoretical advances and involve a lot of extrapolation.. This is obviously the case, he doesn't have a magic mirror to the future - however, it's too farfetched for me, he makes some huge jumps that I'm just not buying.So, he's an optimist, where I'm a sceptic. Healthcare-wise, he predicts the future of the robodoctor and the cancer-catching mini-MRI machine and analytical washbasin. I work in medicine where we can't even get the basic computer system to work reliably! Modern GPs rely pretty much solely on clinical experience to assess patients... Replacing our ilk with a simulated doctor is going to take longer than 100 years. I don't think the warm, caring relationship we develop with patients is that disposable! I can tell from other reviewers that there are other discrepancies - e.g what's happening in the silicon world etc. Things I know next to nothing about.In other words, if even a quarter of the predictions in this book for the far future come true I will eat my hat.It's not all bad. This book covers a lot of bases, from space travel to nanotechnology and has some engaging nuggets of history built in. Despite taking the premise with a pinch of salt, I've learned a lot about physics and science in general. There were some interesting philosophical points towards the end that I appreciated.Sadly, the enthusiasm of the author wasn't contagious though. I think Michio Kaku himself sums up my beef with this book a lot better than I could;""Children might celebrate Christmas not by opening presents under the tree but by downloading software for their favourite toy that Santa has emailed them and the catoms making up last year's toy become the hottest thing on the market.""If this doesn't sound like downgrading the Christmas experience then maybe give it a go. I guess I'm just old fashioned."

So this book should be perfect for me; a string theorist looks at science of today and make predictions for the rest of the century. Yet I am not over enthusiastic. It might be that when he touches upon fields I know something about (e.g. superconductors) I spot the small errors, probably introduced in an effort to make the text more accessible. However, his reasoning is clear and easy to follow. It took me ages to finish the book but this is because I just can not find the time to read these days. The text is easy to read, his style is straight forward and the text is carefully laid out. He has a tendency to repeat himself but not the extent that it becomes annoying. I sense the presence of a good editor.The perspective is American and sometimes a bit naive. The common view that China is less innovative is reiterated here. What I think Kaku and others miss is at least two things; there are over 1 billion people in China meaning that just a small fraction of creative persons will translate to a huge absolute number, and the Chinese will not be content with just making plastic pieces for the rest of the world meaning that if they perceive lack of creativity a problem they will do something about it. When I read about how some things will not be outsourced to a low cost country in the same book that discuss which jobs will not be taken over by robots I start doubting the authors arguments in the latter case as well. Kaku is at his best when he predicts technology based on research performed today. In these passages he has credibility, a bit strange since it is not possible to check on what he predicts. When it comes to predicting how people will live and act in the future he does not live up to the same high standards. In general predicting social changes is more difficult than predicting technical evolution. In this book this becomes apparent especially in the last chapter where Kaku describes hypothetical life in the year 2100. Despite the tremendous changes that has taken place his characters behave and interact in ways quite similar to what is seen today. Looking back a hundred years makes one realize that there has been tremendous development in the social field as well in technology. Despite all my objections I still think it was worth while to read this book since some of the questions Kaku touches upon are of great importance for our future life on this planet. It is easy to just run off and develop cool new stuff without any second thoughts but sometimes you should take time to reflect on what type of society you will find yourself in when you retire."
298,0385530803,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54151026-surender-negi,4,"Rating 3/5 Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100  Michio Kaku  has become my science star by this single book. I must admitted that This book is not put down kind of book. I have read 25% in single blow the day I brought that master piece. Now Michio Kaku explain every inch of science behind his futuristic idea. Let it be Dyson sphere, Laser weapon, Nano medical chip, Internet glasses, advance diagnose tools all are possible within garb of Physics today.But I feel that Kaku's futuristic approach didn't count the terrorism, religious extremism, War, Global warming and others obstacle which is faced by current generation. One side science is always been advancement of humans, but we must not forget that science and technology has power of annihilation of earth. I remember the opening words of J. Robert Oppenheimer after testing of nuclear bomb from the famous Hindu spiritual text  Shreemad Bhagwat Gita ""We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, ""Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" I suppose we all thought that one way or another.""-J. Robert Oppenheimer  This very line describe the dark side of technology and lack of responsibility inside humans. We humans have capacity to become ""God"" but do we have power to controlling ""God Power"". I am sure in near future Human will get Human power to annihilate the whole earth. But Can human has power to control the impulse of destruction? can human come out from his animal instinct of territory and race? Can human ever been able to think beyond other religion, caste, customs, race, skin, territory, nation? In Sanatana Dharma,  Bhagwat Gita  also says about Mind :-
""Who control the Mind, Mind become best of adviser. but Who can not control the mind, mind become his greatest enemy"" 
In early Hindu scripture talk about the controlling the mind against the impulse. But current world seems to be loaded with technology and rescued from responsibility. Now back to the topic, Kaku's book drive you every corner of scientific advancement. from Medicine to weapon, from education to space travel....even beyond the universe. But in Just remaining 85 years. Its seems ""Impossible"" to me."

It is about the many scientific discoveries that will welcome us into our future. What is perhaps most impressive is that much what Michio Kaku describes is already being worked on. In other words, the job you think you will do after college will probably not resemble the one you actually perform after graduation. This is a great book that must be read with a very open mind. I loved it."
