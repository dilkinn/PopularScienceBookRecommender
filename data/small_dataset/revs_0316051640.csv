0,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,4,"Stop the search. Recall the teams. I have found the non-fiction, summer read of 2010! The Disappearing Spoon.First, what’s a summer read, Mr. Josey Wales thumbnail photo? A summer read is one you can enjoy during a vacation to the beach, with fresh cocktails and clean towels provided by the swarthy, bronzed attendant at a seafront hotel. You can finish it in a few days in bite-sized chunks, it doesn’t overpower you academically, you learn a little, and the subject is something entirely new to you, which allows you to ‘escape’ mentally just as you are physically from that 50-hour, weekly cubicle career and hateful commuter traffic.The book catalogues the 200 year history of the piecemeal development of the periodic table in chemistry. Wait, this is not your high school chemistry class! Sam Kean uses the most idiosyncratic, unusual, serendipitous, and funny events to tell this story. You learn as much about the brilliant, boisterous, bi-polar, bastardly, and braggadocio scientists as you learn about each element on the periodic table. Each of 19 chapters pulls together several periodic elements and outlines their unexpected similarity and relatedness--atomically, quantumly and culturally. And the narrative moves fluidly back and forth through time to capture the relevant history of each element. The book highlights discoveries that are still being made, current as of late 2009.Strontium, Molybdenum, Ruthenium, Francium, Ytterbium. Neptunium, Berkelium, Californium, Lawrencium. What are you all about? How were you discovered? Why are you so important? And why the heck are you so rare? This is neat science told in a fun and effervescent way. There are some awesome, awe-inspiring, and yet sometimes pedestrian, elements out there. Science ofttimes moves forward in jumps and spurts, and Kean is quick to relate how it moves chaotically, unexpectedly, bizarrely, and accidentally. The author reviews not just core chemistry but also history, physics, cosmology, and psychology. The scientists and their Rube Goldberg experiments are as interesting as the results. Periodic elements are really cool (yes, I actually said that). They’re phenomenal, toxic, powerful, rare, ephemeral, magical, radioactive, and have the most interesting relationships to each other. We’re told why, when, and how they’ve been used and abused through history, and how they shepherded great leaps in the advancement of human civilization.The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way. Kean uses good rhythm in the book, chapters of uniform length, and a bit of humor to bring it all home. He pulls it off effectively--Mr Wizard meets chaos theory. Sixth grade, mall, ‘wow’-science is discussed right next to the paragraph about how to produce absolute zero or 35 million degrees, both of which, incidentally, are created by lasers.In the end, you’ll learn a little, laugh a little. You may not remember anything from this book 2 years from now, but you will retain this: elements are neat as hell, and thank goodness for chemists and physicists. New words: depilatory, eluted"
1,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,0,"My GR friend Jason writes sturdy and trustworthy reviews, but I must take exception with him here :The Disappearing Spoon is quick, light reading out in the sun. It handles complex theory in a comfortable, approachable way.Yes, it is all that, IF such stuff as this makes sense to you :The strongest solo acid is still the boron-based carborane (HCB11C111) And this boron acid has the best punchline so far : it's simultaneously the world's strongest and gentlest acid. To wrap your head around that, remember that acids split into positive and negative parts. In carborane's case you get H+ and an elaborate cagelike structure formed by everything else (CB11C111-) With most acids it's the negative portion that's corrosive and caustic and eats through the skin. But the boron cage forms one of the most stable molecules ever invented. Its boron atoms share electrons so generously that it practically becomes helium, and it won't go around ripping electrons from other atoms, the usual cause of acidic carnage.Well, this could be part of the rules of Quidditch for all the sense it makes to poor general reader me, so I think The Disappearing Spoon is really for science geeks who think stuff about German chemists being hornswoggled out of a Nobel Prize for Alchemy by some Californian sharpies in 1951 or a neat account of the crucial properties of the biomolecule which are called handedness is the very thing for those moments on the beach when there isn't any eye candy around."
2,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3504278-kate,4,"Okay. Let me tell it to you honestly.This book is not the most well written book - the sentences are clunky and there is not a clear narrative. It is much more of a rambling collection of stories and facts and quirky science knowledge.That said, I couldn't get back to reading this fast enough. I thought about a book about the scientific table throughout the day. I stole a few minutes wherever I could. I carried this book with me and was even *gasp* early to pick up the kids so that I could read a few minutes in the car.I mean, the opening factoid is about our ability to trace Lewis & Clark's trail by following the mercury laced poop trail. I love that shit. Growing up, I never loved science. I didn't learn the periodic table in school like others did. And so, there were times in this book, where I only understood a few clauses in each paragraph because the concepts were so advanced, but the author did a great job of bringing it back to a laypersons' comprehension in the next paragraph. So, in summary, this book is written for all levels of science (or not) nerds. It is full of incredible tales and the fun secrets and stories of the people involved in the development of the periodic table (and science as we know it).I will absolutely be rereading this book - most definitely when the boys are learning the periodic table in school."
3,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,4,"This is an absolutely brilliant idea for a book and it’s a superb book. It’s beautifully organized and well written. It’s a wonderful way to learn and/or deepen knowledge of chemistry. This book is fine for laypeople, but will give meaning and extra enjoyment even for advanced chemistry students. Much appreciated by me was that the information imparted was over my head only a very few times, and that’s saying a lot, because I’ve never taken a chemistry class.This book covers the elements of the periodic table via its history and by telling stories about the various elements: their history of discovery, how they’ve been used at various times, various people who found ways to make use of them. Anyone with a smidgen of curiosity about any aspect of life should find many things here that they find interesting. So many subjects are covered including astronomy, war, South Pole exploration, health and illness and poisoning, history, other sciences, the personalities of those who have contributed to the findings in the field, and so much more. It’s jam packed with useful facts and enjoyable stories. The relevance of the elements (chemistry) in everyday life is made so clear.There are many lovely digressions that turn out not to be digressions at all. There were very amusing parts, including funny quips that frequently pop up, and all of those quips have substance. It has a sort of gossipy (in a good way) tone. I learned so much. I found out that I love Linus Pauling and many other scientists who’ve contributed to the field. I was surprised how much of what’s been discovered in the field of chemistry has been done fairly recently, and how it’s still a growing, living scientific endeavor. While I’ve always been interested in science, and I did want a chemistry set when I was a child (request denied), I knew deplorably little about chemistry. Like the author, I loved playing with growing balls of mercury from broken thermometers. Quite a few of the elements themselves were, of course, familiar to me, but I didn’t know much about them. I had a bit of chemistry in other college science classes and in nutrition class. As I read, I frequently wished I’d memorized the table before reading this book. There is a table of the elements in the back of the book but it includes abbreviations only; it is not embellished; there is no list of elements by name next to it. However, in the index, thankfully, the elements are listed in bold, and I referred to that index at the beginning of every chapter when some elements were listed, in what looked to me like unusual Scrabble tiles. I read the notes as I read along, and they were easy to find because they started with page number and beginning of phrase in bold as a match their section in the book, but I’d still rather they’d have been included in the text proper to make the information even easier to read and to make it flow more smoothly.This book should be part of every beginning chemistry class. It makes the subject so interesting. This is certainly not the only attempt to make chemistry a great deal of fun for everyone. The book mentions the Tom Lehrer song, The Elements (which can be seen in many places including here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYW50F...).I really enjoyed this book, although I did end up reading it slowly, and I did take one break to read the young adult novel Mockingjay, which I’d been waiting to read for nearly a year.This is a gem of a book and such a great idea. I adored the humor, and there was a lot of it. I’ll let readers see for themselves why the book’s title is what it is.I hope that Sam Kean (or someone) writes similar books about physics, mathematics, etc. etc. I would definitely read them if they were as clever as this book."
4,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28470777-mackey,5,"This is on the banned book list - why!? Oh that's right. Certain parents think that science is too ""real"" for their precious babies. What a lot of baloney! The Disappearing Spoon is, quite literally, one of the most fascinating, informative, FUNNY, books about the Periodic Table that I've ever read. Okay, it is the only book about the Periodic Table that I've ever read - but it is amazing. For those who love science or for those who simply would like to better under the elements that make the cosmos what it is, then this is a must read for you!! As for the ""disappearing spoon"" trick - well, you'll just have to read the book to find out the secret to this parlor trick for yourself! You'll be glad that you did! "
5,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"There's a certain type of goodreads troll -- the one who defends their beloved book by saying something like, ""Well, if you knew the topic didn't interest you why were you stupid enough to pick up the book?"" To that goodreads troll I now have an answer: this book.If you had told me a few weeks ago that I'd find a book about chemistry and the periodic table of elements difficult to put down, I'd have had a hard time believing you. But I did. This book was funny, interesting, even gripping at times, and always engaging. I took off a star because I'll admit that I didn't get all of it despite the author's best efforts. I guess it would take more than a fun book to turn me into a chemistry person. But it was still a wonderful read, and not a guilty pleasure because it was actually educational. This meant I could feel virtuous for once while I ignored my various responsibilities in favor of more reading.So not only did I get to enjoy a good book, I feel vindicated in my ongoing belief that a a sufficiently good writer can make any topic interesting, even to a reluctant reader. Yes – sometimes it pays to leave your reading comfort zone. And when it doesn’t, you have every right to complain because it is about the book, not just about a personal bias with regard to the content. For a good book, there should be no such thing as a “right” or “wrong” reader."
6,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431873-emily,3,"This book took me 76 days, or almost three months, to read. In this case, I needed all seventy-six individual days to work my brain through passages like this one:
For instance, thirteen aluminium atoms grouped together in the right way do a killer bromine: the two entities are indistinguishable in chemical reactions. This happens despite the cluster being thirteen times larger than a single bromine atom and despite aluminium being nothing like the lacrimatory poison-gas staple ... The clusters work like this. The atoms arrange themselves into a three-dimensional polyhedron, and each atom in it mimics a proton and a neutron in a collective nucleus. The caveat is that electrons can flow around inside this soft nucleic blob, and the atoms share the electrons collectively. Scientists wryly call this state of matter ""jellium.""
All you need to know is that I'm sort of an idiot. If you read the above passage and thought, ""This makes perfect sense! What an appropriate way to explain jellium, a state I've always been interested in!"", then you are less of an idiot than me and will probably enjoy this book very much. To give more context, here's how much of an idiot I am: when I took physics at Stanford (on the way to my successful minor! ha!), I had a lot of trouble with electricity and optics. To study, I did literally every single problem from those chapters, and I did the word problems multiple times. When I got to the final, I immediately recognized one of the problems I had done at least four times, was jubilant for about 2 seconds, and then realized I had absolutely no idea how to do it. (I think I only got half credit.) That is how good I am at squashing scientific concepts into my brain. On the positive side, I find all of this very interesting, and because I forget it so quickly, I have a lifetime of renewed discoveries ahead of me."
7,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie,5,"This does for the periodic table what I am always trying to do for math....link the science to the historical events, the people, and the economics that push scientific discoveries. I was fascinated by the many details about the hunt for elements, the private lives of the Curies, the radioactive boy scout, the dangers of storing rare elements in the Congo, and that the same man who invented nitrogen rich fertilizers, is also the inventor of zyklon B. It also made me want to read more about The Manhattan Project, so I guess its time to put the Rhodes book on my wishlist."
8,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112699911-orhan-pelinkovic,4,"The spoon disappeared in a cup of tea as the spoon was made out of gallium that melts at 29°C - not my cup of tea. This book is rich in empirical evidence and interesting tales of the last 200 years of history and discoveries of the chemical elements of the periodic table. However, the countless stories lacked the threads that could have given them a common fabric.The periodic table, which is currently comprised of 118 elements (112 at the time the book was written), is an ongoing process. The number of elements in our 14 billion year old universe increased over time. Right after the Big Bang a couple of elements formed, but later through nuclear fusion in stars, and stellar explosions known as supernovas, created and released the other naturally occurring elements. The remaining elements in the periodic table are synthetic (woman-made / man-made). The book walks us through Mendeleev's periodic table of elements that is composed of the main ingredients that chemists, physicists, and other scientist use for their recipes and experiments. The author shares many amusing background stories on how numerous chemical elements were isolated and shaped the way wars were fought, politics conducted, and relationships impacted.We see how women, like Marie Skłodowska Curie, her daughter Irene, Lise Meitner, and others played a pivotal role in the evolution of the periodic table.The author also recognizes that science, as a whole, was greatly contributed by immigrants.Somewhere in the first quarter of the book an interesting question was asked by Kean and that is whether theory or experiments are responsible for the advancement of science? I wish this question was further elaborated. The reader will definitely walk away with a considerable amount of interesting information, but not enough understanding of the subject matter. The author spent almost the whole book informing, rather than teaching and challenging me to think. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in getting a tour of the chemical elements and their backstories.[I read the Montenegrin (Serbian / Croatian / Bosnian) translation Kašika koja nestaje - autor Sem Kin. Laguna 2018 Publishing / 459 pages / 111,901 words. Great translation.]"
9,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,2,"I should have liked this book more and I can't really explain why I didn't. It's not poorly written (though it ain't Solzhenitsyn) and it's not that uninteresting of a topic, but I just found that after the first 40ish pages, I dreaded having to read more. It was like pulling teeth, only a bit less painful, even without the option of novocaine.I think part of it was that the book wasn't well organized. The author seemed to jump around the periodic table at his whim without keeping a consistent framework (perhaps that was the point, it was a bit unclear to me). Anyway, the writing is OKish enough and it is certainly very well researched, so I can understand why many people have liked it. And it's really not a bad science book, but for some reason I just found myself having a viscerally negative reaction to having to read the next chapter (well I guess I didn't have to keep reading on, but whatever). I don't know, I wish I could pinpoint the source of my discontent with this, but it is what it is, so feel free to try it out for yourself."
10,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,4,"""Never underestimate spite as a motivator for genius.""I can't really speak to the scientific accuracy of this book, but I really enjoyed listening to the stories that come from the periodic table. I feel like I learned some things, which isn't that difficult of a feat since what I remember from my high school chemistry class has more to do with the people sitting near me (we called ourselves the Peanut Gallery). I have vague memories of a teacher, the great Thorstein Sabo, who tried to teach us about the periodic table by telling us stories about electrons playing cribbage in the electron hotel. I didn't really get it. This book groups different elements, and tells stories about them in context of political intrigue, devastating consequences, and lifesaving discoveries. Coincidentally, I am also reading Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age, a book with a lot of parallels to The Disappearing Spoon. Where The Disappearing Spoon demonstrates how war interrupts scientific process, Rites of Spring shows the same about war interfering in the arts. You have to wonder how much farther, or at least different, both science and the arts would be, had we never had the world wars consuming the first half of the twentieth century.The tiny pieces of information I didn't know would fill a book, this book. It would be impossible to even recite them, but I particularly enjoyed the story of argyria, silver poisoning, and the senate/governor hopeful who drank collodial silver in preparation for Y2K. Argyria turns your skin blue... permanently. Papa smurf!I also made a note to myself to check out the poet Lowell, who is one of the first people to be treated with Lithium for mental illness. Salt (not an element) was also put into perspective with Ghandi and enforced iodine and I just don't know whether to be grateful that my government is preventing birth defects or to be freaked out that they are adding things like iodine to salt and fluoride to the water. The audiobook was great for this. Sean Runnette has a unique voice that I enjoyed in zombie stories but still translated well to science!I will leave you with a song I could not get out of my head during my listen to the second half of the book."
11,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,3,"This book constipated my reading for almost a month. I have overdue fines from other books that were stacked up behind it. Not because I wasn't enjoying the book: it's readable, fascinating, and chock full of the very anecdotes about science and scientists that I love. So then, why the hell did I find this book so hard?It's precisely because the book is a collection of anecdotes that it was so hard to read. I felt like I was trying to grasp quicksilver (mercury, symbol Hg from Latin hydragyrum, meaning “water silver”) as this steady diet of atomic information arrived. Actually, that's a lousy metaphor: quicksilver is a glistening hypnotic liquid because its atoms stick together. These atomic anecdotes didn't: nothing stuck in my head, nothing stuck to each other. There was no overall organizing principle to the book that I could divine, and reluctantly I finished it barely the wiser than I begun.This book demands flashcards. I want to know the anecdotes. I want them to stick. I am going to have to work at it, however, beyond simply reading the book, if that is to happen."
12,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5476515-amanda,4,"I'm going to have to stop saying that I don't like non fiction. This is the 3rd ""science ish"" book I have enjoyed recently. This was an interesting look at history as told thru the periodic table. I can't really speak to the accuracy of the science but I really enjoyed reading all the tales. I recognized a lot of the science names but learned some knew things about them. The parts I found the most interesting were how great an effect WWII had on science and scientists and the parts about mental health and brain health. I listened to the audio narrated very ably by Seaan Runnette."
13,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,3,"Drive by review both literally and figuratively. Interesting/educational book with interesting anecdotes. Assumes a level of scientific knowledge not necessarily found in a casually curious science neophyte. IOW, way over my head. Rather hard to maintain focus and interest when you are barely understanding the composition of the simplest atoms. My take aways from the book are that the Periodic Table is drawn the way that it is beyond formatting choices. There are reasons that every element is located where it is on the table. The fact that the Periodic Table is mapped the way it is, is a scientific marvel. Also, Helium is the only element on the Periodic Table that doesn't combine with any other elements to form molecules. It sees itself as perfect. That's it. My sum total take away from the book. Some rather lucky and stupid scientists travails too...3.5ish rounded down because I forgot what element the disappearing spoon was. The stories didn't stick.Listened to the audiobook. Narrated by Sean Runnette who did a respectable job with a complex and sometimes tedious subject."

15,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127002-ginger-k,2,"So far, not so great. The degree of anthropomorphizing of atoms in the introductory chapters has left me completely puzzled about the actual science involved. I have no idea what it means that oxygen is ""a bully."" Does oxygen shake down other atoms for electrons? How does that even work?However, the chapter on chemical warfare has been (disturbing but) interesting. If the rest of the book is historical-figures character-driven, rather than atomic character-driven, then my overall opinion of the book should improve. Ugh, spoke too soon. Most of the chapter discusses chemical warfare in Europe around the World Wars. Therefore, most of the chapter is about named individuals -- chemists and soldiers and heads of state. And then one gets to the last four pages which are about how the cell phone industry's demand for niobium and tantalum fed the war in the Congo... a war which is all tribalism and ancient grudges (unlike Europe's wars?). ""Gruesome stories have circulated about proud victors humiliating their victims' bodies by draping themselves with entrails and dancing in celebration."" Lurid detail, but with no names, no location, no citations. I wish I were kidding. Gruesome stories circulated about 'the Hun' during the war, too, but I didn't see those stories getting a whole lot of coverage in this science book and for good reason -- so why are the stories about Congolese atrocities getting uncritically repeated here? And then to just win at post-colonialism, he unironically quotes Joseph Conrad, who ""once called Congo, 'the vilest scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human consceince,' and there's little reason to revise that notion today."" Thank you ever so much for perpetuating the stereotypical images of the Dark Continent, images which don't need revising despite being a hundred years out of date."
16,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,4,Okay I will start by saying this is a fascinating book but you will need some understanding of the periodic table and chemistry - now I am not saying you need to be degree level but it will make some of the references a little easier to spot and the importance of some of the statements just that little more dramatic. That said and I have read a number of chemistry books both for fun and for academic reasons (yes okay I am chemist) but I did like how the author approached the subject of each chapter. I will admit that it did sort of follow a formula in that he would explain the focus of the chapter (which element or family of elements) a long with hints of entertaining stories and anecdotes. He would then go back to these stories and explain them further - with the idea that he would reinforce the message of each chapter. So I guess you would have the technical scholarly part followed by the humorous and entertaining story. For me I thought this was a great way of bringing the message home without either being boring or overbearing. This is a great book for those interested in chemistry. Yes by the nature of the book it focuses on the elements and little of their compounds (although it does talk about their chemistries) but its a great launch pad in to further studies 
17,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This book is quite an entertaining read. It is packed with interesting anecdotes about scientists who explored the outer fringes of the periodic table. I even learned a little bit of chemistry. The book is organized in an intelligent manner--each chapter is devoted to some theme, with a small group of elements that fit into that theme in some way. Sometimes the author strays from the exploration of elements, but he always seems to relate to the chapter's theme. The only thing that puts me off a bit, is the author's style. It is a rather folksy style, where the words ""um"", ""well"", and ""friggin"" can be found in the middle of a sentence."
18,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"In a breezy style, Kean intersperses chemistry and physics with a potpourri of stories revolving around the elements. He explains how the elements formed and how they were discovered. He blends complex science and human interest in his examples of how the elements have been used and influenced history. Kean transitions quickly from deep discussions of atomic structure or quantum mechanics to oddities such as the nutcase who turned blue eating silver because he thought there would be no antibiotics after Y2K. Kean tries to make difficult concepts comprehensible such as the fine structure constant and why it is so fundamental to our understanding of the universe. He also fills his book with obscure facts such as how many ounces of the element astatine there are on the earth. The answer is one. And if you find it, it will be gone before you can do anything with it. Kean serves up tidbits of the lives of the scientists including their personal and professional quirks and claims to fame. He focuses on the developers of the periodic table from Mendeleev who is credited with the original to Glenn Seaborg whose discoveries of super heavy elements expanded it. We learn about Linus Pauling’s unraveling of the structure of protein and his misguided attempt to be the first to crack the structure of DNA. Crick and Watson cagily won that race. He discusses the discovery of quantum mechanics from Max Planck’s initial findings about the spectral distribution of black body radiation to Einstein’s concept of energy as a particle and on through Bohr, Heisenberg and others. These are just a few of the brief vignettes of famous scientists in Kean’s book. The Disappearing Spoon is full of good stuff for those who want their science lightened up by entertaining sidebars. It’s a bit of a teaser. Kean gives you just enough to get interested in a topic. So I found myself frequently going on line or considering getting something more in depth. The book’s diversity makes it a great way to find something new you might want to know more about. It’s also the perfect book for readers with short attention spans."
19,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"This book was lots of fun, and it certainly taught me more than I ever learned in high school chemistry class. Quite honestly, if someone had asked me for a definition of ""chemistry"" before, I don't think I would have known what to say. At the same time, The Disappearing Spoon wasn't like a lecture in the least bit, and instead folded tons of scientific information into stories about the scientists and their accomplishments. I'd recommend it to anyone who's curious about a subject they may have only encountered at the 101 level."
20,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3548626-ian-tregillis,4,"This is a rare specimen among the books I tend to read: a two-bookmark book. I was skeptical when this first came to my attention. I grew up reading any and every science-related book I could find. My early fascination with books about science -- particularly chemistry and physics -- led, many years later, to my day job career. (I also blame Dr. Who for this, but that's a longer story.) But it was a long road, and not surprisingly along the way I lost my enthusiasm for reading books about science topics in my spare time. I always have, and always will, love the fact that people are writing and reading them. But somewhere, along the way to becoming an adult, the stuff I used to love as a kid started to feel like... homework. Like taking my work home with me.I thought a book filled with strange anecdotes related to the Periodic Table sounded like a terrific idea for folks that would be interested in such things. But that I would not be one of those people. This, in spite of the fact that when I was much younger (before I finally got to learn about all the stuff I wanted to learn) I used to spend hours staring at the Periodic Table, studying it, trying and failing to unpack its arcane secrets. (And yet somehow I'd completely forgotten about that until I read this book. This book deserves four stars just on the basis of helping me remember this.) Eventually I learned about the mathematics of atoms, and how this gives rise to the Periodic Table. And it was glorious. But then I grew up. Life as an adult is heavy on the mortgage payments, lighter on the soul-stirring wonderment.So, yeah. I figured I didn't need to read a book about the table because I already knew how it worked. It's still true I didn't need to read this book, but the 10-year-old inside me sure did. I'm glad I listened to him.Sam Kean (who, judging from his photo on the rear flap, could be a friend's lost twin) adopts a casual, easygoing tone, which keeps the book easily readable, even when the subject matter might become dry in less capable hands. He touches on the scientific underpinnings of the subject when necessary yet never gets bogged down in the weeds. And though he glosses over the details in places (as is the only right thing to do in a book like this) his explanations make for clear, concise distillations of the subject matter. Never did I find myself tempted to skim, even when I was familiar with the background details. I'd heard a few of the stories in this book, but only a few, and those I'd either misremembered or learned incorrectly in the first place. Much of the information in this book was new to me, but all of it was fascinating. This is much more than a book about the elements and the table upon which they reside; it's also a book about the people who discovered them, loved them, hated them, yearned for them, tried to recreate them. As such, it's filled with remarkable and fascinating tidbits. I didn't know that exposure to tellurium can make a person reek like garlic. I didn't know that beryllium tastes like sugar. (Where I work, the eating of beryllium is discouraged.) I didn't know about the World War I fight over a nearly defunct mine in Colorado. I didn't know that Fritz Haber was such an epic tool. I didn't know that the ""S"" of the BCS theory of superconductivity went to prison.Much of the most fascinating and entertaining material is tucked away in extensive footnotes. The footnote section is worth reading just on its own. The author clearly couldn't resist including many of the little tidbits he'd learned in the course of his research. But rather than breaking the logical development of each section with a tangential anecdote, he leaves the digressions to the footnote section. This section is worth reading just on its own. The notes appear so frequently that I needed two bookmarks, so that I could flip back and forth between the body text and the footnotes section. If you do decide to pick this up, absolutely do not skip the footnotes. Some of the best stuff is in there. Much of it isn't strictly related to the periodic table, but it's golden just the same.The book is organized logically, following the first attempts to classify the elements through to cutting-edge speculations about the ""island of stability"", quantum dots, and other current topics. Each chapter is organized around a theme -- Elements in Times of War, Elements as Money, The Elements of Madness, Poisoner's Corner, etc. The narrative thread of each chapter weaves its way through multiple boxes on the periodic table. (In a lovely piece of book design, the periodic table entries for the relevant elements appear at the top of each chapter.) Kean does an enviable job of developing each chapter logically, and deserves much credit for finding such clean paths through what could have become thickets. In a few places, the narrative's relationship to the chapter theme felt a little forced. But the information along the way is so fun, and presented so well, that I never cared. "
21,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"This book was an interesting compendium of stories linking up the various elements of the Periodic Table. Not only did I learn about the various scientists who discovered this or that element, but I learned a good deal about many of the elements themselves. It was entertaining enough that I kept coming back to it to read more. I've got a much better understanding now of elements and what makes them differ from each other. And I didn't even realize that elements can change (or decay) into other elements. Never really thought about it, I guess. Now I know how it can happen (though not every element does this.) Lots of cool facts and odd stories about odd scientists are embedded in this book. Recommended for anyone interested in science, especially those without a Ph.D. It's rocks for jocks. "

It makes chemistry and physics comprehensible and fun. I listened to it in audio and thought the narrator did a fantastic job with it. He actually made the jokes sound funny. He knew what tone the author was striving for and he hit it spot-on. However, I think I ended up missing a lot by listening rather than reading. The book is so packed full of fun facts and numbers and, of course, references to the periodic table. I'm sure there were charts and diagrams I just didn't get in an audiobook. Plus, my attention would wander and I would completely lose track of what was being discussed.I think I'm going to get a copy of this when it comes out in paperback.

The Periodic Table! Chemistry! How could I possibly be completely enthralled by such a book? How could I dare give it five stars when I wasn't able to truly understand a lot of what I read?Because of the writing, pure and simple.Kean makes chemistry accessible for the willing-to-make-an-intellectual-effort layperson - but it's not just the chemistry. It's the characters BEHIND the chemistry, the stories of their discoveries and the things they overlooked. It's about the politics and the culture and the drama of the creation of that little set of boxes that we're all so familiar with.I was fascinated.I have found myself sharing little anecdotes with my (yes, young) children and my friends. I pulled out the book at dinner tonight and had to tell the story of that ""disappearing spoon"" to everyone at the table. I loved the history, both in our modern world and the earth itself. It feels like this knowledge is so essential to human life, that these things he is talking about are, literally, at the root of what we're all made of and Kean is just able to share that information in an interesting and not-your-stuffy-old-professor style.Yes, there is a lot of science in there, but don't be scared though. You can still get so much out of the stories if you're willing to let yourself gloss over the really deep stuff and just glean as much out of it as you can. I'm going to return my copy to the library and then buy my own, so I can read parts of it again. I liked it that much. "
28,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5310185-qoh,3,"This book takes a monumental topic -- the periodic table -- and breaks it down into various digestible topic areas. While I enjoyed it (and learned a lot of history of science trivia I'd been unaware of, what with my head stuck in the 18th century) and had a few ""a-ha"" moments as some organic chemistry concepts FINALLY made sense to me (14 years after my last ochem class), I have two big problems with the book. -1 star because the book needed editing. Badly. Kean's writing is usually OK, but sometimes forced, folksy, and pedantic. I could go from enjoyment to annoyance to wanting to throw it across the room and/or get out my red pen. -1 star because there is no comprehensive bibliography, which is a cardinal sin in a book about science, just a short list of books. I have no doubt he did a lot of research, but there should be *some* accountability. Instead, in endnotes, there are more folksy stories (that require flipping to the back of the book to read, and which were usually only tangential and not particularly interesting footnotes to the main story, meaning the flow was disrupted for no good reason). In any case: interesting topic, good stories, only OK execution, and little authorial accountability. I really can't see myself reading anything Kean writes in the future unless he cites his sources and drops the folksy facade. "

There’s all kinds of random facts, and he makes things like electron shells very clear — even for me, with my brain’s stubborn refusal to grasp it all. He writes with humour and enthusiasm, pulling out interesting characters and discoveries from the history of the Periodic Table and its elements.I’m just not as into chemistry/physics as I am biology. Even organic chemistry. I should be, but, alas. So I found that this dragged a bit — for me. It’d probably be unfair to assume it’d drag for you as well, if you’re actually a fan of chemistry.Originally reviewed on my blog."
30,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/981514-minli,4,"Entertaining read--and a fascinating subject matter. I'm definitely the right audience for this book: someone who knows some chemistry but didn't get any higher degrees in it, and is more interested in the historical, cultural building of the periodic table than the hard science.Kean's wry prose never lets you forget that his point of view is subjective and conversational: he paints caricatures of famous scientists and makes ridiculous analogies. His audience is undoubtedly American. He does his best to explain concepts (some of which I still remembered!) in layman's terms, though I kind of dozed off at the discussion of alpha. He does a good job giving awesome lady scientists their due, like Lise Meitner, Rosalind Franklin, Maria Groppert-Mayer and Marie Curie. I learned a bunch of things, how thallium is the worst ever poison (the poisoner's poison) and that cobalt-60 is the dirtiest and worst ever a-bomb. The structuring of the elements grouped into chapters, chapters grouped into parts, gave the book a flow and rhythm. It might have benefited from a longer conclusion.This book has made me feel like the biggest dork ever, because when people mention some element now, I have to squash the impulse to say, ""Hey! Did you know that...""The Disappearing Spoon also showed to me what my chemistry, biology and physics teachers in high school and college never did: how magical, weird, wonderful, temperamental, dangerous and dramatic science can be, how they're heterogeneously mixed with Romance and politics. I wish I'd had this book in high school."
31,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19832185-thomas-frank,4,"As someone who never took chemistry, I found this book to provide just enough of the basics about the periodic table to enable me to sound at least a bit better than completely ignorant when talking about the subject. Beyond that, it's filled with interesting stories about the people who helped build the table and discover many of its elements, as well as other events that revolve around said elements. I particularly enjoyed the one about Germany's clandestine operations in the U.S. during WWI.One nitpick I had with this book: Every 2-3 pages, you'll find an asterisk that corresponds to a footnote in the back of the book. I'm the kind of person who simply cannot ignore these, and as a result, constantly going to the back of the book to read them made it a bit harder for me to immerse myself in the main text. Now, this is mainly the fault of my own brain, so I'm not subtracting anything from my score for it. Just be aware of this fact if you happen to be like me. Personally, I think the footnotes would have been less distracting if they were put on the actual page where they were referenced.Still, this book was really enjoyable. I look forward to digging into Kean's newer works when I've got some time."

Subtitle: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the ElementsWho could have imagined such a volume written about that chart that hangs in every high school chemistry classroom? I’m an admitted science geek. I loved the “Mr Wizard” TV show when I was a kid. (He encouraged us to perform all sorts of experiments using our mother’s kitchen utensils and supplies.) I never wanted a Barbie doll, I wanted a chemistry set and a microscope! So, I’ve had this book on my TBR list since it first came out. And I have to say that I’m a little disappointed.It’s not that Kean is a bad writer; he isn’t, and he’s quite thorough in exploring this topic. His enthusiasm and fascination for the periodic table comes through. But, it was just too much even for this science geek. Some parts were far more interesting to me than others. I loved the chapter on poisons, for example. I was less enthralled with the political infighting on what name to give to a newly discovered element. Also, I made the choice to listen to the audio format. Sean Runnette did a fine job of performing the audio. However, the sometimes dry subject matter made for a more difficult listening experience. I might have enjoyed this more in text."
33,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3349963-craig-cottingham,4,"I was a chemical engineering major in college, so some of the background information (like the basics of the periodic table) was familiar to me and therefore a little tedious to read. Outside of that, however, this was a fascinating book that I think would be accessible to non-beakerheads.Each chapter is devoted to a group of elements that are related. Instead of going for the obvious groupings (the inert gasses, the halogens, etc.) he comes at them from a refreshingly sideways direction. There's a chapter on poisons (from the obvious like arsenic, to thallium, which was responsible for thousands of deaths from contaminated groundwater in Japan) and another on measurements (from the international standard kilogram, which is an ingot of iridium, to the cesium-powered atomic clocks which define the international standard second). Each one reads a little like an episode of James Burke's TV series Connections, the way the discussion of one element blends into another. Sometimes the connections and the groupings are a little contrived, but not jarringly so, and I'm sure it was necessary to avoid a ""here are all the elements that didn't fit in anywhere else"" chapter.Highly recommended."
34,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"There’s a lot packed into this book. I enjoyed the look of the history of the periodic table; how it got started, the changes made over time, the discoveries of elements. Intermingled are the stories of the people; the scientists who figured things out and made things happen. Intertwined yet again are the stories of the theory and workings of atoms; what makes them tick, what makes them unique, what makes them react. Then there’s all those scientists; some humorous, some deceitful or crazy for fame. I really enjoyed the bit about the periodic table in the future and how the table if ever-changing and expanding. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy chemistry, physics and anything “earthy”. "
35,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Fun romp through the periodic table - lots of chemistry and physics, but even more stories about science and the people who do it. Sam Kean has fun with history. The book is not very technical, but approachable and occasionally humorous. The stories are diverse - there are many elements on the table, so we jump around quite a bit. I enjoyed this on audio, found it both educational and entertaining, but I probably won’t remember much as there is no common storyline other than the stories being about elements."
36,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria,2,"Uneven and only fitfully engaging, The Disappearing Spoon is less a history of the periodic table and how scientists have come to understand elemental matter than it is a collection of facts about those elements and anecdotes about the various researchers who've discovered them. Sam Kean doesn't really have the knack for explaining (or re-explaining) scientific concepts to people who haven't studied chemistry or physics since secondary school, and relies too much on clunky metaphors and irritating anthropomorphisms. (For example, Kean writes that stars are ""[d]esperate to maintain high temperatures."" Stars are not sentient. They do not have feelings. Even more jaw-droppingly asinine, though, are sentences like ""In addition to Haber's being a Jew, Germany excommunicated him because he had become passé."" Do I need to break down why this is, at an absolute minimum, a tacky way of putting things?) He never actually fully explains how the periodic table works.More damningly to me, as a historian, is that Kean tries to write from a perspective which is determinedly presentist. His interest in the past seems to primarily stem from wanting to know the backstory of the discovery and refinement of certain scientific concepts, rather than any desire to engage with the history of science as an evolving conceptual system which is inevitably shaped by those who practice it. For a man who seems fascinated by the universe on scales both macro and micro, Kean seems profoundly uninterested in the human."
37,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,5,"What Neil DeGrasse Tyson does for astronomy and David Attenborough does for zoology, Sam Kean does for chemistry and physics TOGETHER. There were a few times when the author simplified technical explanations, which I think made it more confusing. For that reason, I almost gave this book a 4. However there were enough moments where my mind was completely blown that I decided it had to be a 5. The first chapter is boring, but it is well worth pushing through. (What is it with science and very boring first chapters. Always. Start with something that draws me in for cryin' out loud!) There is a fascinating chapter on elements in times of war (Gold? Who needs gold? Give me molybdenum and tungsten.) and of course causing wars. A chapter that delves into lasers and masers (Holy shit, this was awesome! Seriously? How did I not know how lasers work? How did I learn all of the basic principles in physics, but I never learned how they come together in the most fantastic, brilliant way? I am happy to have rectified this situation.) and also the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), a newish state of matter where a few thousand atoms becomes ""one giant marshmallow"" of an atom-a singularity and on a macro scale. This chapter ends with:""As technology keeps improving, scientists have gotten better and better at inducing matter to form the BEC. It's not like anyone's taking orders yet, but scientists might soon be able to build 'matter lasers' that shoot out ultra-focused beams of atoms thousands of times more powerful that light lasers, or construct 'supersolid' ice cubes that CAN FLOW THROUGH EACH OTHER WITHOUT LOSING THEIR SOLIDITY [emphasis mine]."" If I were a science teacher, the very next thing I would do after teaching this is have my students write a sci-fi story touching on where this technology is going next. What's it like to live in a world where solids can flow through each other? I know it's impossibly silly, but I immediately imagined humans that can walk through walls and stuff like that. Of course, this only happens at way below zero temperatures and on a very small scale. But you know, a girl can dream. There's also a chapter called ""Poisoner's Corridor: 'Ouch-Ouch'."" No need to elaborate. There's a chapter on elements as currency and of course fraud. There's even a section on how elements deceive our sense of taste-fascinating! (An example- chewing potassium gymnemate will make raw sugar heaped on your tongue taste like sand)Some other awesome tidbits:The person who discovered x-rays thought he went mad when he first saw the bones of his hands and a key hidden in a book. ""The primary component of taste, smell, is the only sense that bypasses our logical neural processing and connects directly to the brain's emotional centers.""""And whereas electrons absorb and emit light of the same color (yellow in, yellow out), fluorescent molecules absorb high-energy light (ultraviolet light) but emit that energy as lower-energy, visible light."" That's why we can see scorpions glow in the dark under black lights! This is what makes UV visible to us! The most powerful lasers today can produce beams that for a fraction of a second produce more power than the whole United States.Seriously, this book goes all over the place, but still manages to be organized. Loved it! "
38,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie,3,"""The Disappearing Spoon"" teaches the chemistry and physics of atoms and the periodic table. It's taught primarily in the context of short biographies about the Noble prize winning scientists (plus some others) who discovered the various elements or who discovered important things about how the elements or atoms are put together.Based on the book description I was given, I was expecting more trivia about the elements and how they are and have been used rather than a book teaching science with a main focus on scientists. However, the author's casual, lively, and sometimes crude tone made the stories entertaining--probably even more so to young males than to me. I did get a little tired of the author's judgmental attitude, though. It seemed like every human action had to be either brilliant or insanely stupid.The author's explanations of how things worked (atoms, periodic table, etc.) were easy for me to follow, but that might partly be because I took a lot of science courses in college. The initial science lessons were high school level, but the ending lessons were more college level (though high schoolers can probably follow them).The book primarily focused on science and scientists, but there were a few stories of invention, greed, destruction or just plain weirdness based around non-scientists. Though I didn't actually check to make sure, it seemed like every element on the periodic table was covered at least briefly. Some of the areas in which he discussed the use of the elements were warfare (chemical warfare, nuclear bombs, dirty bombs), medicine, politics, art, biology (especially DNA), as poison, as money (counterfeiting, a strange gold rush), and under super-cool conditions. He also covered a Big Bang model of how the elements were formed (with a ""see, no god needed!"" emphasis), how radiometric dating methods were thought up and used to generate dates for the age of the Earth that were old enough to give biological evolution a chance of occurring (since previous dating methods gave too ""young"" of an age to allow for it), and how biases can prevent critical viewing of scientific data (though he didn't seem to notice his own bias).He worked a lot of ""there is no God, humans & Earth aren't special, and evolution is true"" apologetics into this book. I wouldn't mind so much if, in the appendix, he hadn't presented what ""young-earth creationists believe"" by mixing true statements with misrepresented and apparently ridiculous ones as well as completely inaccurate ones. So now, if these readers come across the true argument, they'll dismiss it without really considering it--they'll think they know all about it when they don't.There were a few black and white photographs of scientists and a few charts. Overall, the book was entertaining and interesting, though not so much so that I'd want to read it again. The people who'd be most interested by it are probably teen or college age males who idolize science as pure and untarnished but who also like somewhat scandalous tales about scientists, their competitions to make Noble-winning discoveries, and their fights over who made a discovery first.I received this Advanced Reader Copy for review purposes from the publisher. "
39,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author relates many anecdotes of the discovery and uses of several elements with (as he says about those who know the periodic table) ""dweeby nonchalance.” It is meant to be a readable, interesting book of popular science for the lay reader, and indeed it is full of fascinating anecdotes about all things elemental. (The titular spoon is made of gallium, metal that melts in low temperatures and therefore a spoon made of it dissolves in tea. Ha ha, periodic table practical jokes!) Based on the title alone, I expected a lot of anecdotes such as the battle over the molybdenum mine in Colorado during WWII to help the Nazi war effort, or endless spats over naming rights of elements, but this book contains so much more. The madman Fritz Haber and his chlorine gas experiments; how the niobium in your cell phone helped finance the brutal Congo wars; an overview of the Bose-Einstein Condensate, the fifth state of matter; Henry Moseley’s electron beam; the alpha constant; why silicon-based life forms are extremely unlikely; Cobalt 60 dirty bombs; Monte Carlo science, itai-itai disease caused by Cadmium poisoning from mining companies on Japan; the role of gadolinium in MRI machines and cancer fighting; the left or right ""handedness"" of proteins; sulfur bacteria and how it relates to the sense of taste; the longest ""word"" ever, a technical term that is too long to be written; why we can unknowingly breathe in nitrogen without gasping for air until we suddenly collapse and die; why idolaters of Gandhi dislike iodine; how a lack of salt in a person suggests the nonexistence of the soul; how brass might be the nugget of truth behind the King Midas myth; how the science of bubbles led to the discovery of radon; and more. As you can see, the scope of this work is vast, possibly too much so. While it is written in a personable, conversational style, I felt that Kean doesn't manage to convey to the meanest scientific intelligence (namely me) a full understanding of the science he uses in the book, such as the aforementioned alpha constant, or how exactly electrons move from their ""shells."" Such information isn't necessary to appreciate the scientific history here, so for me it would have been better off cut entirely if impossible to simplify. I don't need the technical details to approve of a book that tells us that Lewis and Clark's route can be traced by the trace mercury in their feces, or refers to a Mark Twain story in which Satan is depicted as being made of radium, or that Paul McCartney was awarded a rhodium record (rather than gold or platinum) for his unsurpassed sales. That's the stuff that keeps the lay reader in their seats."
40,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"Sam Kean has written a witty, interesting book about the elements in the Periodic Table. He writes as if he was chatting with the reader in a coffee shop or a tavern, regaling his friends with one anecdote after another. He's imparting his knowledge of science by the use of quirky, fun facts and interesting stories about the scientists involved.This is not set up like a typical chemistry textbook. The chapters are divided into areas of interest such as astronomy, poisons, money, war, medicine, and periods of history. The author is a physicist so the book had a lot of information about elements made in the lab, radioactive elements, nuclear chemistry, and the atomic bomb. For me, that was the most challenging part of the book.He writes about Linus Pauling's theory of a triple helix being trumped by James Watson and Francis Crick's double helix model of DNA. The attractive Marie Curie was a source of gossip when she took men into dark closets to show them radioactive specimens. Ghandhi told the people of India to dry their own salt instead of paying a British salt tax, only to have many people develop goiter due to lack of iodine. The trail taken by Lewis and Clark is known because anthropologists found (poisonous) mercury capsules that the explorers were using as laxatives. These types of stories make science seem more approachable.The title of the book comes from a practical joke. Gallium, which resembles aluminum, is a solid below 84 degrees F, and can be molded into a spoon. When it is dipped into hot tea, the surprised guest finds the spoon disappearing as it melts away. (Youtube has some ""disappearing spoon"" videos.)This is a book that can be enjoyed by the lay person as well as a scientist. Some chapters will be much easier to understand if a reader has had an introduction to the Periodic Table, such as in a high school Chemistry course. I would have preferred having the footnotes on the bottom of the pages rather than in the back of the book. Overall, the author should be commended for making science fun."
41,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3096541-amy,4,"I have to confess I didn't pay much attention to chemistry. Once the instructor talked about electrons, protons, atoms and the nucleus I usually turned on my Walkman (the cassette kind, now antique!). It never seemed interesting because it wasn't something that related at all to real life. If I had a teacher like Sam Kean, however, that could have been different.Fast forward too many years, and now I'm engrossed in this nonfiction 'memoir' of the Periodic Table of Elements. Like any good biography, this has scandal, lies, fraud, madness, explosions (!!!) and lots of name-dropping. Kean explains just what the periodic table is, but in a format that reads more like a novel, with anecdotal details to liven it up. Mercury pills were used by Lewis and Clark for their health? Yep, and you can trace their path (um, at least their bathroom trips on their journey) by where scientists have found unusually high amounts of mercury in the soil. The poet Robert Lowell? Did lithium ruin his work by making him sane? Who knew the lies and fraud and mind games played by scientists intent on getting a Nobel Prize! There's no getting around it, this is a book that makes you think. It's not simple and it assumes you have a basic knowledge of science. Some areas were over my head, but not for long. Kean is a wonderful teacher with a sassy wise guy voice that livens up any of the deeper areas."
42,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47354-dave,4,"For me this book was a pleasure to listen to. I plan to read a paper or e-book edition shortly. A delightful, an engaging blend of lyrical prose, historic anecdotes and fascinating information. Reminiscent, to me, of some of the writing of Lewis Thomas, Oliver Sacks, Barry Lopez, Edward Abbey and John McPhee.Brain/mind candy or chicken soup for the nerd's soul. Does that make me a dualist?The chapter essays are wide ranging anecdotal expositions of elements and families of elements. Not only stories about the scientists who prospected for and predicted the existence of certain elements, and created schemata for organizing them but about the influence of various elements on cultures, politics, economics and even philosophy. The stories added greatly to my appreciation for and understanding of the lives and work of some well known and some no longer famous scientists. The meditations on peculiar properties of some groups of atoms and alternative arrangements for the Periodic Table bumped my rating of the book from between 4 and 5 stars to clearly 5 stars. Others not so smitten on the history of science and mathematics may find it only mildly interesting or even boring. A must read for nerds, history buffs and fans of creative non-fiction. "

A wonderful and engaging read from cover-to-cover. Sam Kean takes the periodic table of the elements, a chart that makes most people cringe at thoughts of high school (or college) chemistry, and turns it into a riveting drama about the table's origins and the hunt to find new elements. Science geeks will love the scientific jargon but you don't need a degree in chemistry to understand the fascinating stories behind the revolutionaries responsible for our modern day technologies. This is definitely a book you can read over and over and still find little morsels you might have previously missed. Kean is amusing, insightful and presents complex information in a very understable package. A must read for fans of scientific history."

I so wish we’d had this as a set text when I took chemistry in high school. Not only might I have understood the rubbish our teacher was spouting, I might’ve liked it and even passed the bloody thing! Nobody ever even bothered to explain the Periodic Table to us and why it looks the way it does. And it's true: watching a gallium spoon dissolve in a glass of water is pretty cool.I had no idea the world of chemistry and physics was such a hotbed of rivalry, gossip and scandal. Delicious stuff."
45,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80835-celeste-ng,0,"Fascinating to me as the daughter of a chemist--I grew up with periodic tables all around, quite literally (I had a periodic table placemat!). Some of these stories were familiar to me, but most were new. Highly recommended for those who want to why the periodic table matters, and to know more about how the elements have changed human lives, sometimes drastically."
46,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40823165-yibbie,1," Never would I have assumed that I would have to quit reading a book about chemistry because of a lewd scene, but I did. In his attempt to introduce us to different chemicals and explain their lives, the author personifies them as characters in a smutty romance. So I quit what was up till then, an interesting book. "
47,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,5,"I’ve been reading a lot of non-fiction lately, and for me, that’s really...well, unusual. If you had asked me a couple of years ago how I felt about non-fiction, I would have described it as eye-glazingly dull, a dry recitation of facts. But now I eagerly scour the non-fiction shelves at the library. I know -- it’s crazy!The only explanation is that non-fiction has gotten better. (It can’t be me that’s changed.) The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is a fine example of this better, more interesting non-fiction. Kean doesn’t skimp on the facts. He’s packed his book with oodles of information about the elements. What saves his book from being merely a mind-numbing collection of elemental characteristics may be gleaned from the book’s full title: The Disappearing Spoon and Other Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of Elements.Yes, it’s the madness and weirdness that brings the elements to life, and Kean seems to have dug up a fascinating story for virtually every element on the periodic table. For example, the title’s disappearing spoon refers to a (nerdy) practical joke in which unsuspecting victims are given a gallium spoon to stir their tea. I was particularly interested in the stories surrounding the radioactive elements, which ranged from an ex-KGB spy that was murdered with polonium-laced sushi in 2006 to a boy scout that tried to build his own nuclear reactor.Reading non-fiction like this is not only painless, but fun, and I’m convinced that I’m retaining all of those pesky little facts better that I normally would because I’ve so enjoyed learning them. Just wait until we meet at the next dinner party and I regale you with tales of elemental hijinks. If you’ve long despaired of enjoying non-fiction, perhaps now is the time to give it another try. "
48,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,4,"I pretty much knew I was going to like this book as soon as I heard about it. I mean, come on, it's about science! Some of the factoids I learned in this book will stick with me for a long time, like the naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, or the reason why the Washington monument is capped with aluminum. At first I was disappointed that the book had end notes instead of footnotes. I do like footnotes. However, many of them were so long that I understood the reason for it. I ended up just having two bookmarks, one for where I was in the book, and one for where I was in the end notes.On one hand, there were sections that I feel I would have liked better if it hadn't been so long since my last chemistry class. On the other hand, if I were more well-versed in chemistry, some of the stories wouldn't have been so new and interesting to me.There were one or two slow sections in this book, but the interesting sections more than balanced it out. More to the point, this was a book that made me feel smarter for having read it--that goes a long way.One minor quibble that bothered me is that while there were two blank periodic tables which I found quickly, the actual periodic table in the book comes so close to the end that I wasn't able to find it, and I was looking for one. I would have liked to have one to reference. By the time I found it, I was almost done with the book and didn't need it as much. If the periodic table had been printed as an end paper, or in the beginning, or even at the start of the end notes where I could have found it, that would have made it easier to understand some of what the author talked about. After all, it's been a while since high school chemistry, and I only look at that chart periodically. (ha ha)"
49,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951489-amanda,4,"Think back to your high school chemistry class. Chances are, the artwork adorning the classroom probably contained a poster with the periodic table of the elements. For some reason, all through 7 chemistry classes, my favorite was tungsten.Pop quiz - what is the chemical symbol for tungsten? Why, ""W"" of course! Why not T or Tu or Tg?? The ""W""is for wolfram, the German name for tungsten. Without it, those handy incandescent lightbulbs would not operate if it weren't for those tungsten filaments.I've always had a soft spot for science trivia, and the periodic table of the elements is full of interesting stories. If you have the same soft spot, I'd recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" by Sam Keane. The title references a property of the element gallium. Gallium turns from a solid to a liquid at 84 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the author, a favorite prank of grad students is to fashion spoons made of gallium and to hand them out with tea or coffee. The spoon looks like the metal of other silverware, but when used in tea or coffee, melts away - a disappearing spoon!Another reason this is a great book is that it humanizes many of the famous scientists. In reading through textbooks, you never see into the personal lives or professional struggles of the discoveries and constants described in the text. Yet in The Disappearing Spoon, you see the races to get published (discovering and naming rights to elements), the discouragement at being passed up for a Nobel Prize yet again, and how wars and politics shape the or stunt technology."
50,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933518-jason,5,"Sometimes books just fall in my lap....Although I do pretty much put myself in a position where they seem to fall from the sky at a brisk rate. I went to Barnes & Noble the other day with the wife, ostensibly to get a cup of coffee, and picked up this book and Jose Saramago's 'The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'. I couldn't tell you what it was about it that caught my attention. I'm doing that thing again where I read too many books at once, but despite my inward pleas to the contrary, I couldn't resist picking it up and starting to read. What a great book. Refreshing, endlessly intriguing. Every page was a pleasure. Basically a book like this tells me two things: what a whiny spoiled brat I am, and what a complete dimwitted ape I am. In these pages I read about a woman who rode horseback for 1200 miles through a Russian winter to get her kid to a college only to see him rejected, and she then rode 400 more miles to get him to yet another school after which she promptly, and understandably, died. That's just so Russian. Then I read about a man who not only invented the Bunsen burner, he also invented the Spectrometer, and subsequently discovered several new elements, all in the 1850s. I look at myself and realize I'm liable to get suicidal if we run out of half and half, and my greatest achievement in life has been to arrange The Police's 'Roxanne' for the ukulele. Sometimes a good dose of perspective is extremely illuminating. "
51,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3387843-celine,4,"Did you love it when your teacher told funny science anecdotes? Then The Disappearing Spoon might be the book for you.This book is exactly what it is made out to be. With a full title of The Disappearing Spoon And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements, it tells you everything you should know. Kean starts with the periodic table, talks about how it was created, and from there, tells of fun, tragic, or interesting stories about all of the elements.Most of the science in The Disappearing Spoon is understandable with a high-school knowledge of chemistry. But even if you don't know enough chemistry, those parts can easily be skipped. Most of the book is heavily inspired by scientific history, rather than science itself. If you want to know more about the bickering and rivalries between chemists, this book is perfect. The Disappearing Spoon is highly entertaining, and it's clear the author has done extensive research into the lives of the scientists he talks about. My only gripe is that he has the tendency to lose direction sometimes, and flounders between all of the threads of stories he started, no longer clear on exactly what point he wanted to make. "
52,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,1,"I need to make a new shelf for this one and books like it...read, mostly. This is at times a ""cute book"" but in spite of it's promise it will help you if you have a deep abiding love of chemistry before you crack it open.It doesn't really appear to be organized all that well and isn't truly geared to the average reader. He opens up with his early fascination with mercury (the element, not the planet or the mythological deity) and how it led him into literature etc. Then he sets out to induce us all into the wonder/wonders that is/are the periodic table. I wasn't drawn into chemistry beyond what's required in high school, neither was I here. It didn't work, I lost interest quickly and wasn't interested in going on with the class.Enjoy if it's cup of tea...not mine. Maybe you'll like it, but I can't recommend it."
53,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172893-sesana,4,"A fun read, for a certain value of fun. This is a book for science geeks, or those curious about science. If you're a full-fledged science geek, this could be a relatively light side read. If you're more of a layman, it's an opportunity to read some science that shouldn't be too far over your head, most of the time. I fall in the latter category. I wouldn't exactly call this a light read (though it's certainly easier going than some books that I've attempted) but the personable tone and fascinating stories kept me interested even when the going got a little tough. For a more science literate reader, those same stories would probably make it easier to get through the more familiar territory without getting bored. So yes, I did have fun, and I learned a few things, and I gave my brain a bit of a workout. Which is exactly what I like to see in a book about science."
54,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,3,"Since I have ditched my chemical engineering degree for a (once shiny) computer science one, whenever I see books like these I tend to gravitate towards them in pure nostalgia and consume them with a single minded passion. This book especially incited fond memories from my college days when we were consuming chemistry and its historical progress. I still have my periodic table poster that hung next to my bed for a good part of last decade. It was fun to read anecdotes, vignettes and author's own dealings with elements. The writing is casual, occasionally whimsical, terribly nostalgic and overall interesting. Though Kean refrains from overt use of technical jargon, it just isn't possible to escape it completely. With a dose of nostalgia, I enjoyed reading this."
55,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5984690-sean-o,5,"One of the top non-fiction books I've read this year. It's full of exactly the kind of stories I like: scientists and other clever people finding out about the universe. This one is all about the Periodic Table of Elements, and stories about every single element. Some get star treatment, but even ultra-rare Francium gets a shout out. The science is good and the writer doesn't dumb things down too much. He also makes excellent use of foot notes which provide great asides as well as jumping off points for further reading. "
56,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5999881-geoff,3,This book is filled with stories about the discoveries of the elements of the periodic table - some I knew and many I had never heard before. 
57,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"This is a relatively slim book, but it’s packed with super interesting stories you never learned in chemistry, like:1) Scientists tracked the path of Lewis & Clark across America by looking for mercury deposits. The party took mercury tablets to “cure” ailments, and wherever they went #2, they left mercury in the soil2) 7 different elements were discovered in Ytterby, a tiny suburban town in Sweden3) the elements in the periodic table haven’t always been around: originally, there was just hydrogen. Through a variety of reactions, hydrogen (the simplest element) produced all other elements on the periodic table in our solar system. (This makes me wonder: what do other solar systems look like, elementally? Did they experience the same reactions yielding the same elements, or an entirely different set?)4) the creator of the death gas used in WW2 concentration camps, Zyklon B (well, the first version anyway, named Zyklon A—it got slightly tweaked) was Franz Haber, a Jewish man famous for killing many Allied soldiers in painful chemical ways during WWI. Zyklon B was later used to murder thousands of people, including Haber’s own relatives5) Two elements called niobium and tantalum (named after Niobe and Tantalus from Greek myth) are found in the the Congo, combined in a rock called coltan. Niobium and tantalum are metals used in cell phones. The huge demand for coltan in the late 1990s/early 2000s caused anarchy and devastation in the Congo6) A scientist named Seaborg who worked on the Manhattan Project discovered the elements americium (which powers smoke detectors, by the way) and curium in 1946. Rather than announcing it in a scientific journal, Seaborg announced it on a children’s show, Quiz Kids (a child asked Seaborg if he’d discovered any new elements lately, and he explained that he had; judging by the mail he received from schoolchildren, teachers across the globe refused to believe the children’s claims the next week in school)7) the first antibacterial drug wasn’t penicillin (the first antibiotic)—in 1932, a man named Domagk discovered that Prontosil, an industrial dye, could be injected into a sick person to cure them of a bacterial infection (Domagk initially made this discovery on mice; when his daughter Hildegarde tripped while holding a sewing needle and acquired a life-threatening infection, Domagk gave it a whirl in humans, and she got better)8) Tellurium smells strongly of garlic. Beryllium tastes like sugar (despite being a toxic metal). Potassium tastes like salt!9) the European Union, appropriately, uses europium in the ink on euros to show they’re not counterfeit10) In the African nation of Gabon, there exists the only natural nuclear fission reactor known to exist, called Oklo—fueled by uranium, blue-green algae (pond scum), and plain water (the only reason there’s not a gigantic hole burned into Gabon? When the uranium reaches critical mass, it boils off the water, and without the water, the reaction stops). My favourite chapter was chapter 9 (on poisonous elements) because poison is cool. I was especially interested in how a local doctor (Noboru Hagino) discovered that cadmium was poisoning the people of Kamioka, Japan: with the help of a public health professor, he plotted the homes of all the people who came down with the mysterious disease (known as itai-itai, or “ouch ouch” disease), and was able to discover that they all lived along the Jinzu River, which carried cadmium, a waste product from the local mine. This reminded me a lot of The Ghost Map, which, as in the case of Kamioka, tells the story of how a local doctor and a public health professional teamed up to trace the root of a deadly disease (cholera, in that case) using mapping. (Speaking of London—I was also interested to see Alexander Litvinenko, murdered by polonium-spiked tea in a London sushi restaurant, get a mention; I recently saw his grave in Highgate Cemetery). Definitely a fun read if you have a spare afternoon and wish you knew the more fun side of chemistry."
58,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4053034-laura,1,"I didn't finish this book. I couldn't finish this book because the parts of this book that are about science I know could most generously be described as ""missleading at best"". If that's the case about the stuff I know, how much is true in the stuff I don't know? I'm called upon to teach some chemistry despite the fact my real chemistry knowledge pretty much ends at physical chemistry and astrochemistry - so I really don't need to fill my head with stories and theories that are pale reflections of the current state of knowledge when I don't read enough of the literature to judge how correct they are.I'm not sure where the author looked up the theory of solar system formation he gives in Chapter 4, but it wasn't in anything written in the last 20 years. If he'd turned in what's written here on an astronomy exam when I was in a generous mood I might give him a point or two for having a couple of right ideas in there, but he'd still have an F.I started to get a clue there was a problem when the author called the collision of comet D/Shoemaker-Levy 9 (1993 F2) with Jupiter ""intergalactic"". Huh? How is the collision of two solar system objects intergalactic? There's no evidence that SL9 was an extra-solar comet, much less an extra-galactic comet, but ok, he's using an odd hyperbole to make it sound more exciting. Overall the book has a very bubbly, casual style to it so I'll let him use this oddly chosen word. Things get worse however, when he implies Jupiter is the reason C/Hale-Bopp (1995 O1) came into the inner solar system. At this point I'm still assuming he knows that is not true and he's wording things really poorly, but I'm beginning to doubt I know enough of the science in other parts of the book to be able to see through this sort of thing elsewhere. However, it's when he writes ""Because the stellar wind blew only the lightest, most common elements as far out as Jupiter, it should have the same basic elemental composition as real stars"", that I pause and make a WTF!?! note in the margin. It takes me half a lecture or more to explain our current understanding of solar system formation, so I won't go through it all in this review, but the above is pure nonsense. More pure nonsense occurs when he mentions that the cloud of gas and dust our solar system formed out of was flat. There's no evidence for that and it's extremely unlikely dynamically. Simple physics flattens any shape of cloud collapsing under gravity to a spinning disk.Coming back to the missleading at best parts, we are told there are apparently mini-nuclear booms in stars counterbalancing gravity rather than thermal pressure. Booms implies a series of nuclear bombs going off when it is actually the steady rate of fusion in the interior of the Sun that causes the thermal pressure that balances gravity. Finally, given that I'm a planetary scientist, I just can't let slide the description of the Moon forming due to an ""asteroid or comet impact"". Well ok. If you want to call a roughly Mars sized planetesimal an asteroid or comet. However, there aren't any Mars sized planetesimals left that we'd call an asteroid or comet today. Mars is really in no danger of being demoted from planet-hood.I haven't picked on every problem with the astrophysics presented in this chapter, but all this and more brings me to the end of Chapter 4 with no trust the author knows anything about what he's talking about. This is likely not true given all the glowing reviews, one even appearing in the well respected journal Nature (I'm guessing a review by a chemist that knew no astronomy?). But having lost my trust it can't be regained, and I won't be finishing this book."
59,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9255064-melissa,4,"Chemistry has never been my thing. I hated it in high school (except for the part where we melted mechanical pencils over the Bunsen burner). Recently watching the chemistry Crash Course episodes has reminded me that chemistry is not just the boring science class I struggled to stay awake through in high school. Chemistry is everything around us and understanding a bit about it will help me better understand the way the world works.So I picked up The Disappearing Spoon with that in mind and was richly rewarded. Kean’s writing style was fun and made the subject matter interesting. He talks not only about the science behind each element, but about the scientists who discovered them and the impact they had on the world. For example Mendeleev, who is credited with creating the Periodic Table, had a fascinating start. He was born in Siberia, the youngest of 11 children. His father died when he was only 13 and his mother worked incredibly hard to give him the chance to go to school. Imagine having to overcome all of those things just to be able to go to school! Another favorite of mine was Marie Curie. Her fascinating life, including a marriage that was far ahead of its time and the discovery of multiple elements was so interesting. She won a Nobel Prize in a time when women in America weren’t even allowed to vote. I would love to a biography that focused solely on her.The periodic table has changed the world in both positive and negative ways. Kean doesn’t shy away from the damage that’s been done because of the discovery of a new element. He talks about the effects of vaccinations and medicines and also at the way chemistry made things like the atom bomb possible. When cell phones became wildly popular in the 1990s the fight to find more of the metal used to create them caused the Congo to explode with fighting. People were in a frenzy to provide the metal that was in such high demand. “Overall more than 5 million people have died in Congo since the mid-1990s, making it the biggest waste of life since World War II. The fighting there is proof that in addition to all the uplifting moments the Periodic table has inspired it can also play on humankind's worst, most inhumane instincts.”This balanced look at the Table reminds us that with great knowledge (just like great power) comes great responsibility. Almost any scientific advance can be used for good or bad and there will always be a struggle to use it correctly. BOTTOM LINE: The most interesting book I’ve read ever read about chemistry and one that kept me intrigued the entire time. We live in a truly remarkable world and I’ll never regret reading a book that opens up a new corner of that world to me."
60,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,4,"Ah, chemistry, how I love thee. I was the crazy lady in college who loved chemistry. O-chem, P-chem, stoichiometry. It didn't matter. The rules of chemistry always seem so hard and fast, full of constants that are so small or large that you can't even fathom them. And, if nothing else, I do love predicability. But Kean's debut novel showed me a whole new side to the periodic table that made it seem less...pardon the pun...elementary.Kean definitely has a way of making complex scientific ideas seem accessible. He doesn't just tell you about chemistry, he tells you the vivid, unique, competitive, and sometimes deadly evolutionary history of chemistry. Want to know how atom were even discovered? How those atoms are the base of elements? Want to know which elements proved the most elusive? Which ones launched the design of hundreds of periodic tables? Which ones killed, which ones won Nobel medals, and which ones ruined lives? Look no farther than The Disappearing Spoon.My favorite aspect of Kean's books are the historical aspects. He puts an entertaining story with the names we have all heard and connects them all together in a chemical game of Six Degrees of Separation. I am endlessly fasciated by a time when men and women conducted research that flew in the face of conventional wisdom and blazed a new trail into chemistry and quantum physics. I readily admit that I lose a bit of interest when we move into the 1990's through present even though there are a few still practicing big thinkers for whom I am considering being a groupie.It has been a long time since I have used the chemistry knowledge I love and even then I was not so much into quantum mechanics, so Kean lost me a bit in the last couple of chapters. And, ultimately, my love of biology trumps my love of chemistry so I didn't find this book nearly as squeal-worthy as The Violinist's Thumb. Regardless, 110% worth every second I spent reading it and once again left me in awe of how freaking awesome science it!Now, I think next I would like Kean to write about the discovery of oceanic life or how scientists came to study and explore space....."
61,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"I think my high school chemistry teacher would set herself on fire with a bunsen burner if she knew I read and enjoyed a book about the periodic table ☺This book not only addresses the scientific but also the political and social history of the elements of the periodic table. From the first recorded use of chemicals in warfare (the Greeks throwing stink bombs at their enemies, to what really killed the dinosaurs. One of the funniest side stories was about Stan Jones, who through some backyard experimentation, ingested high quantities of silver. Now if you ingest too much of this element your skin turns blue…… Permanently…….Forever. He ended up looking like a real live Pappa Smurf and I cant but giggle every-time I look at this picture.However as absolutely fascinating as these facts were, when the author started touching on quantum physics and comparing the behaviour of electrons to that of an elevator, not to mention his ramblings on the dual nature of light and bubble science, he completely lost me so I did the unthinkable and just skipped those chapters.If you have the patience to slog through tedious jumbled writing the reward is a plethora of the most interesting facts surrounding the elements of the periodic table and how it was constructed to become one of the most terrifying things for chemistry students the world over."
62,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286826-aaronb,5,"Interested in chemistry? Why not? Even if you have little to no scientific background you will get a lot of enjoyment out of this book. Sam Keane walks us through the history of chemistry, by breaking up groups of elements and giving tidbits on their discovery, the electron vs proton structure where appropriate, and adding historical context (who knew the history of ALCOA was driven by an inventor!) to make each element larger than life.Through it all, several themes resonate:UC-Berkeley was, and continues to be, a giant among men in the discovery of elements and in later fields such as quantum mechanics. Feynman and others on the Manhattan project dominate this arena, and the comparison with German scientific institutions - the runner up - is insightful.The history of science is one of experimentation and ruthless competition between would-be discoverers of elements. Even after discoveries are made, they are continuously under assault even decades later, and legends about even luminaries like Einstein being proved wrong are fascinating to unfold.And of course - the periodic table will *never* be complete! "

I would have read it and out-nerded the sh** out of my fellow chemistry nerds! I has this thought multiple times as I laughed my way through this book. Its is a must read if you had even a fleeting interest in Chemistry at some point in your life. After a quick introduction to the periodic table and basic chemistry the author dives into the periodical table. Each chapter is about a group of elements, why they are grouped together in the table, stories about who discovered them and when, interesting applications of the properties of the elements and other anecdotes. The comedy of errors surrounding Fermi's Noble prize, Oppenhiemer's attempted seduction of Linus Pauling's wife, Rutherford's personality - all hilarious to read. The author describes complex concepts like Superconductivity and Singularity with surprising lucidity (Chapter 16) . In general, the author's amazing grasp of all things Chemistry and a dry sense of humor lead to a spectacular book. Definitely a good read!"

Virtually every other page contained fascinating stories about the people who discovered or worked with the various elements.Two stories were particularly interesting. Linus Pauling won two Noble prizes, yet made plenty of mistakes and almost discovered the true nature of DNA ahead of Watson and Cricke; overall Pauling was a brilliant person who made significant contributions in a number of areas.Glen Seaborg has the distinction of being the only living person with an element named after him. More importantly the modern shape of the period table was designed by Glen Seaborg; I vaguely remember seeing pre-Seaborg periodic tables, but I was never taught (I majored in Chemistry) that the modern shape was Seaborg's. I got to meet Glen Seaborg at the 1975 International Science Fair."

I started out bored to tears and figured this would be one to put back on the shelf, but then something piqued my interest and I enjoyed it for several pages, then it became boring again so I skimmed through the rest of the chapter and yadda yadda until I FINALLY finished the book. The parts that I liked, I really liked, but the rest of the book wasn't that interesting to me. And that may be because although I enjoy most sciences, I have never liked chemistry, and now that I'm 12 years removed from college, I probably like it even less. What kept me plugging away were the interesting and sometimes amusing anecdotes-- x-rays, a backyard nuclear reactor, Curie's love affairs, Scott's Antarctic expedition, and, yes, a disappearing spoon, among many others. Definitely a worthwhile read if chemistry is your thing, but more skim-worthy if it's not."

I am a chemical engineer who works with chemistry on a daily basis, and yet I never found this book to be boring because it is too basic. This book is written in a way that makes it accessible to too people of all backgrounds. The only requisite being a curiosity about history and the world. That is not to say that I didn't learn anything technical from the book. The author's explanation of a what a Bose-Einstein condensate is was crystal clear and easily understandable along with how its existence is predicted by the theory of quantum mechanics. I definitely recommend it."

Confession: I have never taken a Chemistry class, (In the 70's girls took ""useful classes"" like shorthand :) ) so a lot of this talk went way over my head. I did enjoy many of the stories, especially the ones connecting with Marie Curie, I have always had a fascination with her. 3- The best thing about belonging to Book Groups, is reading out of your comfort zone."

73,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32232965-zain-hashmy,3,"I was never very good at chemistry. It seemed to me to be a hopeless subject, full of equations that didn't make sense, where balancing the elements was considered an essential skill, where memory mattered, and where weird sounding names reacted to produce weirder compounds still. It didn't help that my family's take on chemistry was that all chemistry is physics, chemists merely handle the boring parts of physics. This all changed when I began to struggle and fail in high school, Year 11, and my parents hired a private tutor in desperation. Amit sir was gruff, down to earth and he spoke my language. Before he agreed to teach me, he sat with me for a trial class. He wanted to determine whether he could teach me at all, or not. After that first class, which I had been dreading, he got up, and told my parents that he would be fine with taking me on. Quite surprisingly, I found myself wanting to study chemistry, because this was the first lecture where I understood exactly what was going on.My dad at this point told Amit sir that chemistry has been a family disease, and sir took it as a challenge, and said ""This is one disease I will cure.""After that, he did whatever it took to get me to study. He would come early and play chess, he would entertain my endless questions far beyond the scope of the syllabus and he would research to answer whatever I asked. By the end of two years, of all my subjects, I scored the highest marks in chemistry.When I read this book today, I am able to appreciate and enjoy it because I understand the bones and the basics of chemistry, which would not have been possible without him. This is why I began my review with this anecdote.This book will probably be slightly dry and slow for people who have slogged through chemistry in high school, just to pass their exams. Most of those people will not make it through to the end of the book. To other people, who have had a strong base, and who enjoy learning about the stories that went into the discoveries of elements, to those people who revel in the factoids of science. This book tells the unusual stories that went into discovering the elements and the many applications of those elements and their unique nature and abilities.For me, this book rates as 4 stars, and not 3, because I'm able to appreciate and enjoy the obscure history in the discovery of the elements, but I can't in good conscience give it the same rating overall, because I know that there are many people who I would not recommend this book to.My ratings go somewhat like this:3 stars: The book was readable and I finished it comfortably, but I would not actively recommend it unless it suited someone.4 stars: I will recommend the book to most people without thinking twice.5 stars: I will force feed the book to people even if I have to tear it into tiny bits and push it down their throats.Because of this categorisation, this book sits squarely at 3 stars. There are parts of it that go into unnecessary and boring detail, but the book survives because the writer writes with intense passion, and those details are a side effect of that passion. That is something I'm happy to over look.To Summarise: Read it if you liked chemistry or if you want to know more about it. Otherwise, duck. "
74,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"One of the prettiest books I have on my shelves right now is Theodore Gray's The Elements, a visual collection of all the elements that make up the physical universe. ""Everything you can drop on your foot,"" as he says. In it, he provides wonderful pictures and descriptions of the elements that we know, arranged as they would be in the periodic table. It's a gorgeous book, one that everyone should have - especially if you have children. If you want your kids to become interested in science and investigating the world around them, you could do far worse than to have this book on your shelves.Eventually, though, they'll be old enough and canny enough to ask, ""Well, how do we know all this? Where did we find these things, and how? And why are they in this order?"" That's the point where you hand them The Disappearing Spoon, sit back, and let Sam Kean take over.The story of the elements, and our understanding of them, is governed just as much by personality as by p-shells, as much by competition as by charge, as much by ego as by electrons. While the elements themselves don't pay any attention to human affairs, the quest to understand the building blocks of matter have sent us to the hearts of stars, the depths of the earth and, for various reasons, Ytterby, Sweden. [1]Kean starts with how he got into the elements, with a story that would horrify modern-day parents: mercury. When he was a kid, his mother would collect the mercury from broken thermometers and keep it in a little bottle on a high shelf. If they were lucky, she would let her children play with it for a while, swirling it around and watching while this shiny liquid metal split apart and fused back together perfectly, never leaving a bit of itself behind. It was a metal that flowed like water, and it was fascinating. If he had known at that age that ancient alchemists thought there were spirits living in mercury, he would not have been surprised.Keeping an eye out for mercury, he learned that modern scientists are able to follow the expedition of Lewis and Clark using mercury. The explorers carried with them a good quantity of Dr. Benjamin Rush's Bilious Pills, a ""cure"" for any illness that mainly contained mercury chloride. It was vile stuff, poisoning everyone who took it, but without an FDA around to stop this kind of nonsense, Rush made plenty of money. It probably didn't hurt his credibility that he was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. In any case, he gave samples to the Lewis and Clark expedition, and their latrine sites can still be found today by the unusually high levels of mercury that were deposited there as the men's bodies tried to get rid of the heavy metal as quickly as possible.Mercury also taught Kean about mythology - the Roman god of communication, modeled on the Greek message-bearer. It taught him etymology - the chemical symbol for mercury is Hg, which is derived from the Latin hydragyrum, which means ""silver water."" It informed him on literature, especially the Mad Hatter of Alice in Wonderland, who was based on the poor crazies who used to breathe in the fumes of mercury while setting felt for their hats.This one weird, eerie element was a door into so many other topics that he figured there must be others. And so he started work on this book, a collection of histories and tales, gossip and hearsay, all centered around the 118 physical elements that make up our universe. ""As we know,"" he writes, ""90 percent of particles in the universe are hydrogen, and the other 10 percent are helium. Everything else, including six million billion billion kilos of earth, is a cosmic rounding error."" Within that rounding error, though, some amazing things have been found.In the 19th century, the Russian Dimitri Mendeleev examined the common properties of different elements and was able to sort the elements in such a way that took advantage of their similarities. The violent alkalies along the far left, which will explode if given half a chance, and their cousins, the halogens on the far right, some of the most reactive elements in nature. Separating them are the noble gasses, which don't react with anything unless pushed to extremes. Without knowing about electron shells and the weird quantum things that happen on the atomic level, Mendeleev managed to put together a table so good that he was able to leave gaps in it that corresponded to elements that hadn't yet been found. And by telling the world that these gaps existed, the race to isolate and discover the elements was on.Kean's book is a great look at the way science works on a human level. How the search for high-quality porcelain led to the discovery of an entire class of elements, how Marie Curie would get into trouble by dragging her (male) colleagues into dark closets to show them how radium glowed, how nitrogen kills with kindness and lithium quiets an unsettled mind. The competition to not only find these elements but to name them and find uses for them has driven science forward in all fields, from geology to neurology, for the last two hundred years. Those 118 squares on the periodic table have driven men to travel the world, to create economic and political empires, to love, to hate, and to murder.If this kind of thing were taught in high school chemistry class, there would probably be a lot more kids interested in science as a career.The book is very readable, even if it does drift from time to time into more technical areas. One of my colleagues, who doesn't have an extensive background in science, said she was a little slowed down by talk of electron shells and quantum jumps, which I guess were not aided by Kean's elevator similes. But it did get her asking the right questions - how do we know atoms exist if we can't see them? How can we be sure that what is in this book is true? Those are the questions that Kean tries to answer in the book, but it's also the kind of book that may bring up more questions. It's ""gateway science,"" one of those books that pulls away the cold, rational veneer of the scientist and his or her endeavors, and shows what an exciting, weird, messy and dramatic place science can be. What's more, it shows how science is deeply ingrained not only into our technology, but our language, history and politics. An understanding of science, even at an amateur level, is a wonderful way to open your eyes to the great, complex and bizarre world in which we live.-----------------------------------------------------------""We eat and breathe the periodic table; people bet and lose huge sums on it; philosophers use it to probe the meaning of science; it poisons people; it spawns wars. Between hydrogen at the top left and the man-made impossibilities lurking along the bottom, you can find bubbles, bombs, money, alchemy, petty politics, history, poison, crime, and love. Even some science.""- Sam Kean, The Disappearing Spoon------------------------------------------------------------[1] The town has the distinct honor of having four elements named after it: yttrium (Y), ytterbium (Yb), terbium (Tb), and erbium (Er). What has your hometown got?"
75,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2863963-andree,4,"This is really interesting and well done. I enjoyed a lot of the details and anecdotes. I think at the end of the day though, I wanted more of the random anecdotes of the weird uses of some of the elements in the past, and less of the discussions on higher levels of physics and chemistry. The problem with higher level physics (less so chemistry, which I understand better), is that after a certain point it just sounds made up. I accept that it is not made up, and it is based on science, but if you don't know much about it, it's hard to latch onto some of the details, and I found myself skimming.I also think it's a touch long. It's a book of sort of randomly collected stories about the periodic table, but because the only overarching story is building the table itself, sometimes I again felt my mind drifting. I read this in fits and spurts over two weeks. It's not the kind of book you make it through in one sitting (though it did bring back any number of flashbacks on chemistry class).That said, I am delighted to learn that apparently Marie Curie used to haul male scientist colleagues into darkened closets to show them radium's glow (and associated radioactivity) with at least some regularity, and apparently on one occasion the demonstration was broken up by a colleague's suspicious spouse.2018 Reading Challenge - A microhistory"

77,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18844431-david-h,4,"Because of the nature of the history of various elements on the table, this book felt a bit scatter-brained in scope and details. For all that, though, it was an excellent read and I learned a lot about various elements. It helps to have a least some basic knowledge of chemistry, but it's pretty easy to skim over anything you feel might be overly technical."
78,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,5,"Checking off one from my far too many (just kidding...one can never have too many books to read) Small Stacks of Found Books that I kept setting aside for others, this is in one word a delight! Mr. Kean has done something marvelous here: making the periodic table fun and accessible! For science geeks (and professionals) it always has been, but for those less inclined...this is great.He says in his Introduction that from the one element mercury, he ""learned history, etymology, alchemy, mythology, literature, poison forensics, and psychology."" He also learned physics and chemistry, clearly, because it's all through this book, and politics that sometimes had play in the field. And Kean conveys the history and concepts in the best mystery page-turner style, along with humor and sagacity. Even if you know the history and concepts, the chemistry and physics (I'm not a neophyte to either), I suspect you'll learn something or somethings.Kean talks of the discoveries of the elements (and many of the gaffes), the origins of the table, the blanks and how they were filled. He delves into the biological interactions of some of the elements, from poisons to medicines, and how some elements mimic others, causing all kinds of havoc on the biological front. There is the politics of the Nobel prizes, the currency of elements, art and literature of elements. Something as seemingly simple as the Parker 51 pen gets copy time here, as the nibs were made of ""durable ruthenium"", ""an element little better than scarp until then.""Near absolute zero, bubble chambers, ""Tools of Ridiculous Precision""...there is so much information here. I couldn't begin to summarize with any justice. I'll share one nugget to illustrate Kean's keen science. (Forgive, please!) There's a chapter on toxicity of exposure (or ingestion) and a GREAT observation I flagged. Great to me, anyway. In talking about William Crookes, his ""lapse into spiritualism"", and succumbing to ""pathological science"", Kean explains pathological science:In explaining what pathological science is, it's best to clear up any misconceptions about that loaded word, ""pathological,"" and explain up front what pathological is not. It's not fraud, since the adherents of a pathological science believe they're right - if only everyone else could see it.(And here's the gem...It's not pseudoscience, like Freudianism and Marxism, fields that poach on the imprimatur of science yet shun the rigors of the scientific method.Love it! Pseudoscience! I've been saying so for years!It's also not politicized science, like Lysenkoism, where people swear allegiance to a false science because of threats or a skewed ideology. Finally, it's not general clinical madness or merely deranged belief. It's a particular madness, a meticulous and scientifically informed delusion. Pathological scientists pick out a marginal and unlikely phenomenon that appeals to them for whatever reason and bring all their scientific acumen to proving its existence.Kean says that a pathological science's ""believers use the ambiguity about evidence as evidence - claiming that scientists don't know everything and therefore there's room for my pet theory, too.""Read it. Highly recommended."

Instead, I found it utterly engrossing on many different levels.I really enjoyed the stories-- the stories of people and personalities, of discoveries that were searched for over many years and those that accidentally fell into place, of friendships and partnerships and rivalries.I also enjoyed the science itself. I consider myself to be a scientifically inclined, so this isn't a surprise. I've got a solid background in chemistry and physics, even if I haven't thought about it in years, so the concepts weren't new. The first few chapters are much heavier on the science, lighter on the stories. If they get to be too much, flip further in and read a chapter. If that's more to your taste, then just skim through the rest of the first section. I do think this book is accessible to those with minimal scientific background-- I think my daughter learned enough in 5th grade science about atomic structure to understand most of the stories.I also think there is enough there for those that have been dedicated to science their entire lives. In this case, the names will be familiar, but I think the stories will be new, and they will even more fully appreciate following the paths in the history of the various elements.I'm thinking Christmas presents here, and I'm strongly considering buying some copies for my daughter's school.

80,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12406850-roxanne-russell,0,"This was an impulse buy- a symptom of my late in life discovery of science history. I never have had the single-minded concentration for pure science, but I loooove a good story. And this book is full of better than good stories. Plus, Kean is punny-- a clever word smith who never misses a chance for word play. E.g. In describing Ernest Rutherford's attempt to date Earth's creation: ""Thorium then begets radium by spitting out another alpha particle. Radium begets radon with yet another, and radon begets polonium, and polonium begets stable lead.""Kean also deserves credit for bringing the role of women in from the margins and even pokes a little fun at the latent sexism of a couple of scientists who couldn't figure out how they missed fission: ""Fission escaped us, although it was called specifically to our attention by Ida Naddock, who sent us an article in which she clearly indicated the possibility... The reason for our blindness is not clear.""Notables:- A teenager who built a nuclear reactor in his shed-Hiding gold from Nazis in plain sight-Legit origins of the story of King Midas-Gandhi's vendetta with iodine-Sir Isaac Newton's revenge on a counterfeiting heckler- public disembowlment-The mainstreaming of my granddaddy's metal- aluminum"
81,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10964563-connie,4,"The sensationalistic and often crude writing style marks Mr. Kean as the journalist that he is. Hence, the writing is sometimes more agenda driven and biased than one likes to see in a science text. With the emphasis on historical anecdotes, however, this is more forgivable. His ability to so frequently associate chemistry to sex is an interesting, but hardly commendable, talent. I would personally mark the swearing level as moderate (or whatever word one would use to mean “somewhere between mild and severe”).Despite my lack of enthusiasm for the style, I learned a ton from this book. One of the things I like most about it is its ability to show how chemistry links in with other sciences. It shows many cool relationships. Most high school science courses mistakenly take each subject alone and disassociate it from any other. This book would pretty effectively combat that failing. Hence, I think it would work very well as supplemental reading for a high school or college chemistry course. I would, of course, be sure to mention the above caveats to anyone I recommended this book to."
82,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1009267-meg,4,"This book rocked my world. I mostly daydreamed through chemistry class in high school, and would rather have knocked my head against a wall repetitively than studied it in college - so needless to say, I learned a lot from Kean's insights.I won't lie, the theoretical chemistry and quantum mechanics went about ten miles over my head, but I'm friggin' in love with all the history and mystery surrounding the elements. I feel like I finally have a grip on what makes up our world. Not to mention how awesome it is to understand some of the great scientific discoveries made over the centuries: how we've determined the Earth's age, the steps of radioactive decay, potential silicon-based alien life, etc. This is the perfect book for intelligent people who didn't major in chemistry, but still want to understand and appreciate our periodic table. Kean doesn't come across as a pompous ass or talk down to the reader--he hits that sweet spot in between. Both informative and entertaining.Read on, fellow nerds!"
83,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/589958-leigh-ann,4,"Every college chemistry teacher should read this book! I've taken so many college/university-level chemistry classes, yet author Sam Kean is the first person who managed to explain the periodic table in a way that makes sense and is memorable without a lot of memorization. I now understand the way the elements relate to each other better than I ever have, even though my last chemistry class was over 14 years ago. The anecdotes about the different elements and the men and women who discovered them are entertaining, but the periodic table is the real star of this book. There are a few small sections that may be over the head of anyone who isn't familiar the behavior of electrons, for example, but it's easy enough to just skim over those pages to get back to the anecdotes. This is an excellent book for the armchair scientist, trivia enthusiast, history buff, or anyone who enjoys understanding more about the world around them. The endnotes alone are wonderfully entertaining."
84,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2185106-nicole,3,"I'm going to say that I feel like Mr.Kean took everything he knew about the periodic table of elements and vomited it into this book. I really enjoy the tidbits of information but I dislike to organizational format. Mr. Kean walks you through the table by introducing you elements related in properties. I personally would have preferred a chronological narrative. I felt like the players were coming in and out of the story- the table evolved and devolved. In one chapter is the late 90s race for heavy metals and the next chapter is pre-table with a different community of chemists. In spite of the jumpy time table, I think it's worth the read. I found it very thought provoking as a relative stranger to chemistry. However, don't expect a book that reads like a novel."

It is a science book that is written in a style that could be described as conversational. It has some humour in it, and lots of facts, anecdotes and tales of the the individuals who made the science of chemistry what it is today. One of the most fascinating is the discovery of a natural nuclear power station that has been running for 1.7 billion years.I have only given four stars as I feel that the book Periodic Tales, is much better at explaining the elements."

As an engineer who once considered majoring in chemistry, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Sometimes science can be rather dry, but learning the twists and turns of its history really makes it interesting. I always wondered why my European coworkers always referred to ""aluminum"" as ""aluminium"". Question now answered!

104,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4699735-jolene,4,"Chemistry was my favorite science in high school --- I liked the math, the predictability and experiments. This book brought back some of that wonder that I had as a young student. I listened to the audio which was read by the author. His enthusiasm was quite infectious and added to my enjoyment. I'm pretty sure that my eyes would have glazed over trying to read all though obscure elements (that weren't around when I was in high school!!).This is laid out as a series of vignettes --- organized by sets of elements. The stories are often about the people and the crazy competitive world of science. With the periodic table as the outline, Kean discusses everything from ""the big bang"" to the pathological science of spiritualism, and from self experiments and crazy medical practices that led us to trace the route of Lewis and Clark. While I won't pretend that I understood everything nor even remember most of it (even though it was very readable as a lay person) --- I am taking away a few tidbits. For example, I had no idea that chemistry and physics were so related and Krypton is actually an element (not just Superman's home planet). I would definitely recommend this for anyone with a passing interest in science, history and trivia."
105,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of,5,"I absolutely loved this book with its deep dive into curious details about the elements and the periodic table. Kean does a far better job of explaining how the periodic table helps organize our understanding of the elements and their chemistry and physics than any of my grade school teachers ever did, but then that may be partially because I'm an adult who actually wants to learn rather than a kid who is fucking around half the time. I like how he included lots of details about how the various elements were discovered, and the sometimes nasty politics and rivalry that went along with it, and the frequent missteps and mistakes. I like science books that give me new understanding that I didn't have before, and for a specific example I never understood why the larger transitional metals behaved so weirdly, and didn't follow a simple chemical pathways, until he explained the fact that the electrons in the d-shell get buried behind other layers (and this principle applies to even large elements moving up to the f-shell, etc.) making the different chemical behavior of these elements complex and difficult to tease apart. I also liked his explanations of radioactivity and how it relates to the periodic table."
106,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37763623-dipanshu-gupta,4,"I have always been fascinated with Chemistry. If I hadn't chosen Physics, I would have definitely learnt Chemistry at University. My interest in chemistry stems from how miniscule changes in the structure of atoms can have profound changes in their behaviour. And that's what the Periodic Table is all about, isn't it? The book was wonderful. It discusses each element in great detail, including its chemistry and origins. New elements have rapidly advanced our society: every element discovered has found a niche use and some elements have gone on to become so ubiquitous today that life without them is unimaginable (take Silicon for example). If anything, I'm a sucker for good science stories about the great men of science. I have read tons of such stories and anecdotes (just have a look at the books I've read and you will start to understand). Still, this book managed to give me tons of new stories about people I know and admire. It also introduced me to new people I admire now and raised my admiration of people whom I previously thought as fringe contributors. All in all, it was an enjoyable read and makes you really wonder how a simple table arrangement has shaped the world as it is today."
107,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy,4,"What a great fun non-fiction book! Perhaps this one just plays to my biases and interests, but I found this book and its look at the elements of the periodic table to be filled with interesting tidbits and trivia. Some of it I knew - I should hope so, seeing that I've been a pharmacist for over 40 years - but others bits were things that were fascinating side trips into the development of chemistry and physics. But there was much more here - star science, the Big Bang, dinosaurs, history, warfare, the development of sulfonamides and l-dopa, the use of lithium to treat manic-depression, sexism in science, nuclear fission, and the race to figure out the structure of DNA. This is not a dry examination of chemical elements - it's a fun trip discovering the basic building blocks of our world and the men and women who've strived through the ages to bring order and explanation to how they work. Wow, just wow."
108,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45145332-amber-knapp,4,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. A book about the periodic table - there were several topics over my head but it definitely sparked interest and brought tough chemistry and physics topics down to a non-chemist level. The addition of real stories, connections with history and literature were entertaining and informative. I actually listened to some of the book (the audio was great) and read most. I highly recommend reading the author notes in the back as you read the chapters (the audio does it automatically). Note: for those that care, this book is not written from a Christian worldview "
109,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75291257-liz-alexander,2,"This book had so much potential! A self-proclaimed nerd, I was excited about the idea of bringing a story-telling element (no pun intended) into science, to scratch the same itch that great historical fiction does. But I was disappointed. The actual tale of the disappearing spoon lasted about two sentences, and most of the other tales were either short-lived, uninteresting, pedantic, or disorganized. The structure of the book made me dizzy, the bad metaphors were hard to swallow, and the juxtaposition of a casual tone with unnecessarily esoteric vocabulary made it far too easy to put this book down. I learned a few things, but I’m not sure it was worth it."
110,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44035487-zahra,4,"More than anything, politics proved the folly of scientists burying their heads in lab work and hoping the world around them figured out its problems as tidily as they did their equations.In 2015, I read an article on argyria and the Smurf-like qualities it produced and was both amused and mesmerized so much so that I did a presentation on ‘Spooky Tales from the Periodic Table’ for my college chemistry class. Digging a little led me to this book and having read and enjoyed Kean’s previous work, The Violinist’s Thumb, I had to get my hands on it.This was easier said than done because for the life of me I could not find this anywhere until Shika gifted me a copy a while ago (Thanks again Shiks!!).Kean’s enthusiasm for the periodic table shines through even with his subtle favoritism of American science hard to ignore (Americanizing aluminium to aluminum does not make it sound more premium in my opinion despite being reminiscent of platinum). Kean’s explanations are thorough, smart and well written leaving no room for confusion.Looking forward to reading more from him!"
111,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17550624-steve,5,"I found this easy to pick up and hard to put down. While I had a passing familiarity with some of the stories told in this tome, the author's easy writing style had me gobbling them up at lightning speed. As someone who has always found the periodic table of elements fascinating, it was delight to expand my knowledge of some of the well known (and lesser known) elements that comprise it, as well as, how it actually came to be organised in the way it is, as well as perhaps some future spanners that may gum up the works. Heartily recommended to anyone who enjoys science."
112,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33296806-dara,4,"Interesting book with an un-textbook-like telling. Still, it was over my head at times. Some of the passages were difficult for me to get through and I found myself having to reread multiple times. Yet others flowed nicely. That was likely due to my lack of knowledge, not the author's writing. I enjoyed the combination of science, history, and the ""behind the scenes"" view. It was a unique arrangement that I felt really opens up chemistry and science to a broader audience. I enjoyed all of the interesting facts I picked up. There are many that I'd like to explore more!"
113,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2467151-elizabeth-k,4,This was very charming. A lot of cute anecdotes about elements. I don't know if I have a lot else to say about it -- it seems designed for people who like cute anecdotes about physics and chemistry.

116,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3592034-erin,4,I love books like this - anecdotal gems butting up against history and science. Fascinating and entertaining. 
117,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5167235-sophie,4,"Every time I read a non-fiction book I tell myself: ""So much knowledge that I'll never be able to remember! What a fantastic job of gathering and structuring information!"" and this book wasn't any different. I really like how the author structured the different themes and felt that the transitions between the stories and the different elements were pretty flawless. And it was really funny too!The only negative thing I have to say about this book is that it might be quite complicated for someone who doesn't have a basic knowledge of chemistry. Some parts brought me back to school and I had to think hard to comprehend some concepts again, so I can't imagine for someone who didn't study it at all. But I'm kind of glad that he didn't explain everything from scratch, as that would have made some parts a bit boring. All in all, I great non-fiction read for anyone interested in science!"
118,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7364359-sunil,4,"At first glance, a book about the periodic table of the elements may sound boring. They're elements, and only a handful are ones you've even really heard or care about, like hydrogen and oxygen and carbon and whatever. Who wants to know about rhenium or ytterbium? You, that's who, because Sam Kean is going to take you on a whirlwind journey through the fundamental makeup of the goddamn universe.The Disappearing Spoon begins with a personal story about Sam Kean's fascination of mercury (Hg), which led to his fascination with the rest of the elements. Kean's book tackles a whole host of topics: subatomic particles, discovery of natural elements, creation of artificial elements, scientific rivalries, the Nobel Prize, quantum mechanics, the design of the periodic table itself, wacky element-related anecdotes, it's a lot. I learned so much cool information and random trivia I've already forgotten most of it because wow. While it pretends to have a structure that moves through the periodic table in an organized fashion, it's all for show because really Kean just jumps around and digs into stories.And that's what this book is. It's a collection of stories. It shines a light on scientists throughout history (and Kean absolutely highlights the many women overshadowed by their male counterparts), and it finds the whimsy in the world, like the fact that SEVEN FUCKING ELEMENTS WERE DISCOVERED ON ONE ISLAND. And four were named directly for it. Oh boy, there is so much element-naming drama in this book. Audiobook reader Sean Runnette is anything but dry, as he keys into Kean's sensibilities and turns the constant appearance of UC Berkeley into an amusing running gag.While the majority of the book is perfectly comprehensible for a layman, even I had trouble following some of the more detailed sections explaining chemistry and subatomic physics, which are not dumbed down sufficiently enough. There are metaphors available, Kean! Throw me a bone here!The Disappearing Spoon gave me a much greater appreciation for the periodic table and all the elements that reside there, not to mention the general pursuit of science and the curiosity to understand the universe. There's a lot more to care about than hydrogen and oxygen and carbon and whatever."
119,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8840781-w-r-edmunds,5,"The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements (or as I like to call it, ""SCIENCE!"") by Sam Kean is a well-written, anecdotal exploration of the history of periodic table and its influences on modern science. The author faithfully covers every known element, detailing its discovery while also discussing the current goings on in the scientific community at that time, and why (or if) those elements are important today.Back to the first days when chemistry started to evolve out of alchemy, to the beginnings of scientific method in Victorian times, through the separation of atomic physics from chemistry, all the way to current (circa 2000s) discoveries. As Kean, hops through time on his elemental trail (don't worry, each section is chemically or thematically connected) the little ridiculous stories that inevitably pop-up when discussing some of the rather quixotic notables of science, provide an amazing mnemonic for the most inane of facts. And some of the stories are almost too ridiculous to be true -- did you know that there was a naturally occurring nuclear reactor in Africa, up until a couple hundred thousand years ago?If you fashion yourself a chemistry, physics, or even just a history geek, you should read this book -- I guarantee you will spend infinitely more time chuckling than you did when you were reading your textbooks.5*/5*"
120,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23138688-ryan-y,5," In The Disappearing Spoon, Sam Kean takes a stroll through one of the greatest achievements of humankind, what he calls “an anthropological marvel”: the Periodic Table. He details each element as a story; a witty, informative and sometimes bizarre anecdote from the history of the Table. This book is a must-read for everyone, even those who don’t have an interest in chemistry. And for those that do, you will love it even more, from cover to cover and for each and every element.  Sean Kean writes with a contagious enthusiasm that only comes from loving and respecting the subject for years, all the way back to when he started collecting mercury from broken thermometers. From naming a virus after its amino acids with a 1,185-letter word, to pranking an unsuspecting peer with a melting gallium spoon, Kean artfully brings together the science of the elements and the tales of the “(frequently) mad scientists who discovered them”. All in all, he shows us that what may seem like a (while ingenious) plain and uninteresting table actually has a rich and absorbing history. I loved this book for the way it is written, how Kean weaves his words so that this book isn't just informative; it's entertaining. The subject of the Table is often very difficult to write about without sounding like the white noise in an airplane, yet the tales he spins are more engaging than any other. There may not be a cohesive theme, characters or development of such, nevertheless, he captivated me with his ""true tales of madness, love and the history of the world""."

A very interesting look at the history of the Periodic Table and the elements that shape our world. It read less like a novel and more like a series of related essays - but with the amount of information included it was really the only way to do it. Also, while there is a lot of information it is presented in a user-friendly and entertaining fashion. This book did require a fair amount of thinking to understand some of the concepts but that's why it was fun - challenging but not overwhelming. As an aside, I'm thrilled to see more non-fiction science works written for the layman. There are many areas of science I want to know more about but don't have the time or inclination to study academic journals in the field. I'm seeing an increase of works written in a ""popular science"" style and loving it.I will certainly read his second novel - The Violinist's Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code"
123,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15283898-jacob-mclaws,4,"This book was a really fun lens to look at science history through. The history of the elements is so tightly woven into the history of civilization and modern society that Sam Kean has no trouble making the periodic table come to life. His love for the elements and their 'personalities' is contagious. I spent quite a few nights between this book and my Visual Exploration of Every Known Element book. If you don't read this book, but you want to pretend you know what the title refers to just search 'melting gallium spoon'. ""Now if you translate quantum mechanics into English, always risky, the equation says that the uncertainty in something's position (delta X) times the uncertainty in its speed and direction, its momentum (delta P), always exceeds or is greater to the number H divided by 4 times Pi. The H stands for Plunk's constant which is such a small number, about one hundred trillion trillion times smaller than one, that the uncertainty principle applies only to tiny, tiny things such as electrons or photons. In other words, if you know a particles position very well, you cannot know its momentum well at all, and visa versa. Note that these uncertainties aren't uncertainties about measuring things, as if you had a bad ruler. They are uncertainties built into nature itself."""

Did you know the shape of the chart is significant? Do you wonder about the scientists who discovered these elements? Do you think the chart should be re-organized? If you are thinking seriously about any of these questions, you really need to read this book.Gallium is an interesting element, so much so that Mr. Kean alluded to it in the title of his book. You can see the disappearing spoon experiment on Youtube!Then there's Stan Jones, the Libertarian who ran for the US Senate in 2002. In an attempt to ready himself for the lack of antibiotics in the Y2K millenium scare, he began distilling heavy silver metal ""moonshine"" in his backyard. Drinking his concoction for four and a half years, he contracted argyria and turned ""startlingly blue.""

This book was on a “top 10 science books of 2010″ list, however, so I picked it up. It did not disappoint. I’d compare it to Bryson’s “Short History of Nearly Everything” in that it illuminates the scientific concepts by telling the tales of the individuals who made the discoveries or, in some cases, were affected by quirks of chemistry. I found the writing graceful and clear but it wass dense and I found myself skipping back frequently. Drift off for a moment and you could be quickly lost. My issue with chemistry (and where it overlaps with quantum physics) is that I have a hard time seeing its relevance to my own life. I enjoyed learning this stuff for interest’s sake but so much of it seems a bit, well, “out there” and irrelevant. To some degree, this book helped me see the importance of chemistry and quantum physics in our technological era but I did not feel like much of this will really stick with me and shape my view of the world. Clearly the author knows and loves his subject matter. As an introduction to chemistry I give it a big thumbs up but my next book will be back in my home turf of the biological sciences."

In college, I was a science major (at least for the first two years) so I took chemistry…and failed it. So then I took an easier chemistry class (aka “easiest” class possible)… and failed it. And then I changed my major to history, for obvious reasons. So it’s great that after all these years, I have found a book that actually makes me understand something about the field, even if it is the basics (which is honestly more than I grasped before). The author lost me in some places, such as the discussions on quantum mechanics and physics (did I mention I didn’t do well in physics either?). I feel like the book started out strongly but towards the end I just got bored, which could be more due to my lack of understanding than the book itself. A good read if one is looking at learning more about the basics of science with a mixture of history added in. There were some amusing stories found throughout the book and interesting people mentioned. Definitely a well researched book."

An entire book about the periodic table? No. Thank. You.Mr. Kean got just about everything right. If Mr. Kean and MythBusters had been around when I was in middle and high school, I would have been absolutely fascinated by science. Mr. Kean has dug up unbelievably amazing stories about each element - what scientists have done in order to become famous, make a discovery, be of value to their country - and told them in a wholly engaging way.My only complaint about The Disappearing Spoon is the conflict Mr. Kean has between providing a scientific document explaining science on an atomic level and creating a text the common non-chemistry-loving reader will understand. At times the sections about protons and electrons ran long and were distracting.That said, I do feel I have a better understanding of how elements work with or against each other, how they change or don't change, and that is a lot more than can be said for years of public science classes.Mr. Kean is an asset to the science community by making science interesting to those who don't like science."
128,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906247-jean,4,"Listened to this book (13 hours!) on a trip last week. Very interesting stories, particularly the radioactive boy scout and lots about the scientists who discovered the elements and the politics behind the stories. Some I had heard before, like the Watson/Crick ""discovery"" of the double helix, for which others should have shared int he credit. I particularly liked the discussions about how chemicals have improved our lives, including the author's assertion that we are who we are because of specific chemical interactions (I need to get the book to check this one out more). Kean also spends time talking about the possibility that Earth is not alone in the universe, what aliens might look like, and other theoretical questions. All the time I was reading it, I wondered how all of this could have developed without intelligent design - God. The negative in reading a book like this is that you have to listen to all of the author's theorizing, notes (most of which were interesting), and you can't skip the boring parts. I'd suggest reading it rather than listening. Otherwise, a good book. "
129,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11772351-david-kent,4,"A very entertaining as well as informative read. Kean takes us through a tour of the periodic table of elements, the mainstay of chemistry and physics. As exciting as that sounds (or not), the tour actually includes murder and madness, love and attraction, and a whole lot of history. Early in the book the focus is on the development of the table itself as scientists started to notice patterns of characteristics. Not surprisingly, these patterns relate to the deep-diving chemistry and physics of elements and you'll probably learn more about orbital shells and subatomic anatomy through this book than your introductory science class. The author goes on to examine specific elements and groups of elements as they come to be known, all while giving a voyeur's look into the often mischievous (and sometimes mad) world of the scientists - both male and female - who discovered them. Most science and history loving readers should find this book fascinating. Kean's writing style is jam-packed with information and yet easy to read. And even sometimes downright fun. The book is definitely worth reading."

Sam Kean chose a very intelligent subject yet made it understandable using antidotes make me care about the development of the periodic table. Why would I even try this book? Why would I even care about this book? Well, I don't know about you but after spending three years staring at it and never really learning it's true importance. I finally wanted to comprehend and learn to respect the ding dang thing. I was surprised how many historical events I already knew about but never recognized the scientific significance they represented. The only boring part was the ""longest names"" section which was a very short section and the only scary part was the true description of and my now understanding of what a ""dirty bomb"" is and yup, that could keep me up at night.I'll be honest, my plan was going to make this my book to read on the stair master over a month. I ended up sucking this book down in four days. I wish Kean had been anyone of my science teachers in high school. I would have been a hardcore science geek for sure and proud of it! "
131,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724379-nick,4,"Other than his style of footnoting, which I found distracting, this was an outstanding book on the history of science, told through the elements of the periodic table. While technically a book about chemistry, it actually wanders into biology, nuclear physics, astrophysics, alchemy, theology and a host of other areas, not all of them purely scientific. Some of the odd scandals and pseudo-scandals of science have a lot to do with popular culture and societal beliefs.While some of the sections use formulas that may seem strange and scary, the explanations are clear and concise, so don't panic if you hit a brief bit of math or physics that you've forgotten, or never learned.The problem with the footnotes is that all of them refer to a section in the back of the book, but not all are equally relevant to the text. Sometimes the footnote is a clarification, sometimes a related anecdote, sometimes a bizarre sidestep. They're almost all entertaining, but each one takes the reader away from the main text, both physically (lots of page flipping) and mentally."
132,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4127364-jeff,4,"I enjoyed reading this book. It is a good mixture of stories, theories, facts, and trivia related to the periodic table (but much more interesting than that might sound). The author strikes a good balance between explaining the chemistry and telling related stories in an entertaining way. Along the way, he covers the ""human side"" of the scientists who made key discoveries related to the periodic table; how science is affected by both commerce and politics, even office politics within labs; the elements in our bodies, the Earth, and the universe; how man has used elements throughout the years; and much more. I learned a lot, and was proud that some of the theories the author explained were still vaguely familiar to me from my high school chemistry class. If you do read this book, I'd approach it as a collection of short stories/anecdotes, rather than a book with an overarching narrative, though you might expect that based on the title. If you have the time and the interest, it's worth the read."
133,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5712415-sandra-ross,5,"I think I'm officially a geek's geek because I thoroughly enjoyed Kean's book on elements and the periodic table. By virtue of moving about every 1.5 years during my K-12 (no kindergarten for me, thankfully) years, by the time I got to the last school I would attend in this period, I had enough credits, with my voluntary attendance at summer school between 10th grade and 11th grade to get a last English credit I would need to graduate, to graduate a year early.Because of that, I missed taking chemistry in high school (I skipped straight from biology in 10th grade to physics in 11th grade), so this book was my first foray into the basics - and not so basics - of chemistry, the elements and the periodic table.Kean redeemed himself with me in this book as he unveiled for me the world of chemistry, elements, and the periodic table (with his usual flair for the quirky, fascinating, and little-known stories behind it all) enough to really peak my interest in doing more study into the subject.Excellent book."
134,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66514423-katie-richardson,5,"I love all the various facts, anecdotes, and bits of history the author uses to help you understand each element of the periodic table. I actually want to reread this at some point and try to absorb more of the information in this book. Some of the author’s stories really stick with you and help you really understand how particular element functions or the history of the discovery of that particular element. The story that stuck with me was the fact that if you were to breath in 100% nitrogen, your body has no capacity to realize that it is not getting oxygen. As the author explains, our bodies actually don’t monitor that we have enough oxygen, just that we don’t have too much carbon dioxide. In a 100% nitrogen environment you could still expel carbon dioxide, so you will calmly breath in this air and minutes later fall down dead, never knowing, before you died, that anything was wrong. (The author uses the example of the death of some NASA employees to illustrate this happening in real life.) "
135,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/832784-kristen,3,"This is the kind of science book I really enjoy. It's written for the layperson, it has a lot of really interesting stories, and it focuses a lot on the people behind the science and gives the human element (see also A Short History of Nearly Everything). I love that I now know why lithium works in helping people cope with depression and bipolar disorder (and it's such a fascinating reason!), and that I better understand some of the chemistry involved in the periodic table. I also definitively learned that I am not good with physics. Which I always knew, but have now confirmed.Is this a book that will stick with me forever? Probably not. Is it a worthwhile read (or listen--the audio was great)? Yes, definitely. If you are at all interested in science, and in the basic components of the universe, I think you'll enjoy this book. "
136,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127480-lisa-butterworth,5,"I freakin' loved this book. Kean's voice is charming and compelling, and his take on these stories are filled with humor and affection. He clearly loves science and loves scientists and passes this fascination on with story after story of quirky personalities, and strange properties, and mind-blowing physics and chemistry. For instance did you know that 1.6 million years ago, there was a natural nuclear fission generator in Africa? Or that that during WWI the German's sent spys into colorado to take over a molybednum mine (to make their big bertha guns), and they were totally successful. Or that the first three scientists to theorize, create, and recognize nuclear fission were all women? Or that the scientist who created nitrogen fertalizer and saved miliions of lives also created mustard gas and took thousands (and drove his brillant wife to suicide). Seriously, the best book!"
137,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3581866-virginia,5,Fascinating! This should be required reading in all chemistry classes. This book breathes life and drama into chemistry and physics.Kean is a very accessible writer and makes complicated chemistry and physics intelligible to the common person. I was enthralled by his stories (plus I loved his witty commentary and parenthetical asides) and found it fun when he mentioned people I knew by name only due to some law or element named after them. I loved chemistry in high school and college but I would have loved a deeper understanding of its history rather than just formulas and theorems. One minor quibble: I would have preferred footnotes to the end notes Kean used. The endnotes were entertaining and I would have liked the immediate context vs reading them at the end. I also enjoyed having a reading list and look forward to checking those books out. Excellent read! Highly recommend!!
138,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5696632-samantha-kirk,3,"At its best, this book is an engaging, interesting, and deeply informative book about the birth of modern chemistry.At its worst, it is a poorly edited gossip rag that takes indiscriminate potshots -- criticizing scientists for believing too readily, not believing readily enough -- and is filled with unfortunate, cynical schadenfreude.As to the editing -- Timothy McVeigh did NOT blow up the Oklahoma City Courthouse. He blew up the Murrah Federal Building. That is a MAJOR error that should not have gotten past the editors.Finally, Mr Kean, while ridiculing pretty much everyone, consistently talks about what atoms and molecules and elements ""want to do."" As the hard-nosed, error-free science writer, he ought to know that atoms, etc., don't ""want"" anything. They DO things because of their various physical properties.That is a whole lot of complaining, but I mostly enjoyed this. Mr Kean just needs a dose of the humility that he noticing that others don't have."
139,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6178196-maria,3,"I started reading this book because of an excellent recommendation from a friend but in the end I wasn't as enamored as she was. First off, I needed to keep a periodic table handy to keep track of the elements, makes reading and relating to the stories easier. Got to be honest too, chemistry was my worst subject, I understood the basic proton, electron, neutron stuff but start with the charges and the bonding and my eyes start to glaze over. Some of the chapters were more alluring than others- I particularly liked Parts II and IV, the chapter on the poisoner's corridor. There were some paragraphs in the latter part of the book where I was tempted to skim over but I stuck with it. And I can say agree with my friend that it was a definite sense of accomplishment to finish this book and be able to understand it. I loved the stories and learnt a lot. Sure wish this was available when I was in school, would have made chemistry a lot more interesting. "
140,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16767917-sherri,3,"This is an interesting, quirky book with two major flaws. The book takes the periodic table and the elements represented there as its subject matter. There are a surprising number of interesting stories and historical facts to tell. I learned a fair amount, though some of the science was over my head, and was entertained by many of the stories. Even so, the flaws were hard for me to forgive. The book is VERY choppy, jumping from story to story and subject to subject without so much as a chapter heading, subheading, or transition to guide the way. The author also uses a very informal writing style which drove me nuts. There were lots of fragments and run-ons and more dashes than any author should ever be allowed to use in one book. I found myself wanting to introduce the author to the semicolon and its varied and valuable uses. I know this makes me sounds like a grammar snob, but I only complain about grammar when it interferes with meaning and the flow of the writing. Here it did."
141,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35834258-sofia-mostardeiro,4,"This guy knows a lot about chemistry, maybe not so much about spiritualistic matters. I think the chapter on Crooke and spiritualism was a bit too ofensive. I have already read another book of his and unfortunately this thing (being a very spiritualistic person myself) probably caused me a bad impression. Also, for as much as I like this book and recognize a lot of information that I have already studied, (from reliabe sources) I have doubts if some of his versions are thaaat acurate... With these two points aside, I think it is a great book. I recomend it for those who hated chemistry classes, for those who never had chemistry classes, for those who soon will start to study chemistry... It is nice, fun to read, not a little bit technical and you might learn a lot. (Always good to have incredible facts to use in bar conversations) Do you know that many dinosaurs might have died of pneumonoconiosis?I do. :-) "
142,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"In the vein of Stephan Jay Gould and Olive Sacks, Sam Kean puts together an essay collection of stories built around the creation of and the periodic table. Each chapter tackles a group of the elements regarding the phenomena we call atoms, and how they structure to create different things and interact in different ways. Historical stories about the discoveries, the elemental explorers, and scientific properties provides for an enriching read on multiple levels (mental shells?) SK adds in just enough informal language (and swear words) to keep the attention and make this book just a straight-forward ""and this"" kinda book. He does a great job constructing the themes around each chapter of grouped elements, and the transitions within chapters create a smart and fluid narrative.Kudos Sam!."

Obviously I expected this book to be science-y, but for someone like me who is really, really not science-oriented, those passages detailing processes or why elements work the way they do, for example, caused me to zone out. I probably won't be remembering the names of too many scientists mentioned, or the atomic numbers of elements, or even the symbols for certain obscure elements, but I'm glad I read this book, if only for what little education I took from it."
144,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/655723-nick-black,3,"fun for sure, but not that much material that was really new to a reader of e.g.  The Periodic Kingdom, and really it was the poppiest of pop science, with only one equation and not even a serious attempt at hand-waving, and there were a few glaring errors, and at one point while discussing europium's use in anti-counterfeiting he says, ""it's reportedly banned to research"" which what the fuck is this ""reportedly"" business; you're the goddamn author, go find out. his footnotes ought have just been in the text; it wasn't like they were much more deep."
145,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"I think my family's reaction to this book may be a good guide for everyone. I'm a history buff, but a bit science-blocked, so while I loved the anecdotes about discovery and invention, I probably won't remember much of the science. The last few chapters went right over my head. My son, on the other hand, is a science major, and didn't find the book nearly informative enough, so he gave it up. This is definitely science for the layperson: the person who's more likely to remember Marie Curie's flouting of social norms than to understand what she actually did with radiation. But if you're one of those, you will pick up some things here and there, so the book is worth your while."
146,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13510558-teresa-osgood,3,"As promised, this book delivers interesting stories about elements, the periodic table, and scientists and other people who have been involved with them. The writing is engaging, with pretty good explanations of the scientific details. When we learn these things in high school, they seem pretty set in stone, so I was surprised at some of the developments that have happened since then. Details of old stories are interesting, too. I enjoyed reading some of them aloud to the boys, though the AP Physics student knew quite a few already, and the AP Chem student probably wasn't listening."
147,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/344179-brendan,3,"An interesting history of the chemistry and physics involved in discovering the elements, organized by means of the periodic table. Well-researched and entertaining. Perhaps a bit longer than it needed to be.Favorite fun fact -- Antimony used to be used to treat various diseases by means of a pill. Because of antimony's chemical composition, it didn't dissolve in the digestive tract. It was also very expensive. So people would re-use the pills, sometimes even handing them down from parent to child. Yeesh."
148,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5928435-jessie,5,"This book mixed personal stories with scientific facts for a fascinating read. Science was never my strongest class in school so I was hesitant to start this book but I’m so glad I read it. It was interesting to know that politics play a huge role in scientific achievements. For example, certain sciences were pursued during war times and not for the better of mankind. certain female scientists weren’t given recognition because of their gender. Imagine what we could accomplish without those barriers! "

The narrative -- I use that term loosely -- barely tied a series of interesting tidbits together. It read like someone standing and reading aloud one Trivia Pursuit card after another. which is a shame, because the tidbits WERE interesting. They just weren't enough to make it a good read."
150,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5344627-sarah,4,Zoomed through this book. I shall have to skim through it again before giving it back. It has really extended the physics I have been reading about into chemistry. A great bridge between quantum physics and multiverses and the real world. (If it is real!) It's a jokey book with lots of human and historical interest as well as the chemistry/physics of the periodic table and I loved the mix and learned a lot.
151,0316051640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9348511-milauni,4,"It was really really good and captivating until the last 40 pages when Kean really only focused on radioactivity and physics (which isn’t my cup of tea at all). But the rest of the book was a fantastic read, I loved learning about how each of the elements were discovered and all the drama behind each discovery. It was well written and easy to understand and follow even if you don’t have a background in chemistry. "

Although many are interesting, a 2 paragraph story on how so and so discovered this and got a noble prize does not make up for serveral pages explaining why electrons won't bond to form this or that.
