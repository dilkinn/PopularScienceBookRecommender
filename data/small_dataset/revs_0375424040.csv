0,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"The Drunkard’s Walk is a book about randomness, a topic that most people, unless they happen to be mathematicians or have a strange fascination with statistics, probably don’t think too much about. As a species, in fact, we generally prefer not to dwell on randomness, but rather to assume that we are in control of much more of our lives than we actually are. In this new book, physicist Leonard Mlodinow attempts to show why underestimating randomness is really not a good idea. He lays a foundation for this discussion by outlining the development of mathematical and scientific thought on the topic. When humans assumed all outcomes were due to the whims of the gods, there was no need for a concept of randomness. But that didn’t stop gamblers from trying to improve their odds in games of chance, and it is to them we owe a debt of understanding on the topic.Mlodinow spices up some rather technical discussions about development of the theory with interesting personal history of the major players (including a guy who figured out his baker was cheating customers by compulsively weighing his bread for a year and noting the differences from random distribution) and numerous fascinating studies on the topic. Along the way, he makes a compelling argument that the human propensity to see patterns where there are none can get us into a great deal of trouble, as anyone who has ever lost money in the stock market has probably figured out. It’s not just gamblers and investors who would benefit from understanding these concepts, however. Mlodinow also shows how misunderstandings of randomness and statistics can affect jury trials and medical studies and makes a compelling argument that the success of an individual business is usually far more impacted by randomness than it is by the personal talents of the CEO or movie studio head.Much of what Mlodinow discusses in this book is highly counterintuitive. That, combined with the above mentioned desire to believe we are masters of our fate, explains in part why we so often underestimate the effect of randomness on our lives. But acknowledging the power of randomness does not disempower us, Mlodinow argues. Rather, it allows us to focus on the aspects of our lives over which we really do have control, such as how persistent we are, and not take so personally the random luck--both good and bad--that touches all of us.

1,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a very fun, entertaining book about the myriad ways in which random phenomena affect our lives. There is nothing really new here. As a physicist, I am already well familiar will all of the concepts introduced, concerning probability and statistics. But oh--what a variety of fascinating applications!I love the story about the ""Ask Marilyn"" column in Parade Magazine. Marilyn vos Savant holds the record for the world's highest IQ. She discussed the famous ""Monty Hall"" problem, and got aggravated letters from 10,000 readers, including 1,000 PhD's (many mathematicians!) who claimed her analysis was wrong. Nevertheless, she was absolutely correct--people just do not have a firm grasp of probability concepts.The book explains lots of interesting puzzles and paradoxes. For me, the best part of the book is the discussion of how statistically random events conspire to make ""outliers"". This comes up again and again, in understanding ""genius"" mutual fund managers and fast-growing mega-companies.My only disappointment, is the book's emphasis on the so-called ""normal"" (Gaussian) distribution, to the exclusion of other distributions. Many economic and natural environmental events are outliers that deviate from the normal distribution, as described so well in Benoit Mandelbrot's The (Mis)Behavior of Markets."
2,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,4,"Lots of people might think they can compute the odds that something will happen. For instance, If my favorite baseball team is playing an opponent with inferior stats I might be pretty sure my guys will win....and place a small wager. But random chance - which is the rule rather than the exception - could trip me up. A so-so batter on the other team might miraculously hit a grand slam home run! 😲In this book Leonard Mlodinow explains how randomness affects our lives. For example, a publisher rejected George Orwell's book 'Animal Farm' with the remark ""it's impossible to publish animal books in the U.S."" And before he became successful author Tony Hillerman was advised ""to get rid of all that Indian stuff."" John Grisham's books were repeatedly rejected at first. And J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter book was rebuffed a number of times. These writers persisted and eventually happened on the right publisher....but other (perhaps equally talented) authors didn't. Random chance at work! Of course if we really want to figure out how likely it is that something will (or won't) happen we have to rely on math. In this book Mlodinow elucidates some of the math concepts behind probability theory and statistics - a lot of which is complex and requires re-reading a couple of times (for me anyway). So I'll just give a very basic illustration.Suppose Don picks up two coins and tosses them. He wants to know how likely it is he'll get one head. Don figures the possible outcomes are: zero heads, one head, or two heads. So, he thinks there's a 1 in 3 likelihood. Nope.Don has to consider all the possible sequences: heads-heads; heads-tails; tails-heads; and tails-tails. Two possible outcomes yield one head - so the chances are 1 in 2 (50%).A basic principal of probability theory is that the chances of an event happening depends on the number of ways it can occur.Here's another example: In 1996 the Atlanta Braves beat the New York Yankees in the first two games of the World Series (where the first team that wins four games is the victor). So, what was the chance the Yankees would make a comeback and win the series - assuming the teams are equally matched? After explaining all the possible ways the Yankees could win the remaining games, Mlodinow calculates that the Yankees had a 6 in 32 chance of winning the series, or about 19%. The Braves had a 26 in 32 chance of winning the series, or about 81%. Against the odds, the Yankees won! Mlodinow goes on to explain that - if one team was better than the other - that would weigh into the calculations and the odds would be different. This same type of reasoning can be applied to competing businesses, television shows, movies, whatever. And even if the odds favor the 'better contender', sometimes - by pure chance - the 'worse contender' will win. Of course 'experts' try to predict all kinds of things: whether stocks will go up; if a superhero movie will be No. 1 at the box office; whether Toyotas will sell better than Buicks; if a certain horse will win the Triple Crown; and so forth. And Mlodinow explains that - no matter how 'knowledgeable' the maven - the predictions might be wrong. The reason: our brains aren't wired to do probability problems very well. 🥴In the book, Mlodinow discusses Pascal's triangle, the Bell Curve, random number generators, the best strategy for picking the 'correct door' on 'Let's Make a Deal', the likelihood a woman carrying fraternal twins will have two girls, whether scolding a worker who does badly and praising a worker who does well makes a difference in their future performance, one man's strategy for winning at roulette....all kinds of interesting stuff.Pascal's TriangleBell CurveLet's Make A DealTwinsThe book is informative and contains a lot of fascinating stories about the philsophers and mathematicians who developed probability theory, how they did it, and why (usually having something to do with gambling.... ha ha ha). I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to readers interested in the subject.You can follow my reviews at http://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com/"
3,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I hadn’t realised I had read this guy before, and remarkably recently. Euclid's Window The Story of Geometry from Parallel Lines to Hyperspace was a fascinating read and oddly enough, I was even reminded of it as I was reading this one and I still didn’t put two and two together (an appropriate enough metaphor for books on mathematics) until I was well over half way through. They are very similar books – presenting an entire field of mathematics to a non-mathematical audience from an historical perspective in simple and engaging prose.The historical perspective is very important, too. Marx said somewhere that all subjects are pretty much history – even though that has rarely been my experience. This book shows that this is the case and shows (me at least) the benefits of this approach – as someone who learns best through narrative an historical approach is just the ticket. In presenting the history of probability theory and statistics in context and through the questions that haunted the various people who contributed to the advancement of the science I feel I have a much better understanding of these subjects than I gleaned at university where I struggled to remember which formula went with which particular sting of words in the question. This guy would make a fantastic teacher: actually, he makes a fantastic teacher in both of these books. He also points out the difference between probability and statistics, a distinction I’d never really picked up on previously. Probability is the study of data when you know a fixed probability of something. So, you can look at the results of a series of coin tosses in which all of the coins show heads given you know each toss has a 50-50 probability of coming down heads. Statistics is essentially working backwards – given a series of data how do you work out the underlying probability.The main point in his presenting all of this maths is to discuss why humans seem quite so incapable of rationally predicting outcomes based on the data presented to them and (as the maths shows) are quite predictably irrational in the mistakes they make in seeking to understand the meaning of particular strings of data. This stuff is handled better and more amusingly by Fooled by Randomness The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets, Predictably Irrational The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and even in How We Know What Isn't So The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life (the oddest quote on the back of this book is from Stumbling on Happiness's author Daniel Gilbert who says this book is ‘occasionally hysterical’. If you want laughs with your science, read Gilbert or even Euclid’s Window, I can assure you that you shouldn’t buy this one for the jokes).But, having said that what this book does do is give a wonderfully simple understanding of the maths that is taken for granted by the authors of these other books and which in itself is a powerful incentive to read this book. The first chapter and last chapter of this book in particular are essential reading – the discussion of Hollywood film studio executive Sherry Lansing is instructive in both showing how much we overstate the affect ‘leaders’ have in the success of a company and also how we blame them and praise them for things that are probably little more than random noise. The notion that is reiterated throughout this book that exceptional performances are just that, that is ‘exceptional’, and that these exceptional performances will tend to be followed by a more average performance is a lesson we would all do well to learn.And here is why, what about this question? Is it better to praise someone after they have done something well or to severely criticise them after they have done something badly? Scientific studies looking at this question show unequivocally that praise is better than criticism. But is that what we do? People actually have good reason to do the exact opposite of what is proven to be the better technique of obtaining better performance. You see, if someone does something exceptionally well and you praise them for it their next attempt (given their previous attempt was ‘exceptional’) is likely to tend towards the mean – that is, it is likely to be worse than their previous go. People being what they are (creatures that are determined to see causal relationships even where none exist) will therefore conclude that their praise encouraged the high performer to ‘slacken off’ and to therefore do worse in the task the next time it was performed. But now look what happens the other way. Someone, just as randomly, does particularly badly at a task – so you scream at them and ‘wear their guts for garters’ as the expression goes. What is likely to happen the next time they do the task? Well, they are likely to also find their performance tends back toward the mean – that is, they will apparently get better at the task. So ‘experience’ teaches us the exact opposite of what is the best method of achieving better performances from the people we are instructing – rather than ever praising people, ‘experience’ tells us to never reward good performance and only to ever punish poor performance. And this is all the case because ‘experience’ is wrong due to us misunderstanding the lessons of randomness.This misunderstanding isn’t just the case in the pedagogical curiosity discussed above, but is much more general. We praise CEOs when the stock price goes up and sack them when it goes down, we delight when opinion polls have our favourite party gaining a percentage point in the popularity stakes and find ourselves in the doldrums when their fortunes fade by the same amount (even when the error in these polls can be as high as three percentage points and so these ‘shifts’ are actually completely meaningless) and we put people in prison because there is only a one in a million chance someone else did it, when there are three million people in the city where their crime took place. There are very disturbing consequences to our not understanding statistics, to our not understanding randomness. If you read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time and could not follow the odd part in that story about changing your bet if you are on Let’s Make A Deal you should get this book. (Briefly, if there are three doors, only one with a good prize behind it and after you have made your selection the host discloses that behind one of the two doors you didn’t pick there is a rubbish prize – if you get the chance to change your selection, you should. I know, it doesn’t make sense, I know it sounds like your chance is still 50-50, but that is part of the reason why you should read this book).Gamblers generally ought to read this book. You will see (actually, you probably wont see anything of the kind, as gamblers are just as fooled by ‘experience’ as the bad teacher discussed above) that we are constantly fooled by what we ‘know’ is true, even when it isn’t. I remember talking to a guy who was explaining to me how he played two-up – a particularly Australian gambling game involving two coins. He told me about a time he won lots of money because heads kept coming up and so he shifted his beating because tails were ‘due’. Okay, so he won money, but not for the reasons he thought and there was no way I would ever have convinced him of this. You see, while there is a law of large numbers in probability theory – that is, if you toss a coin a very large number of times then if the coin is true it will tend to land 50% of the time on heads – there is no corresponding law of small numbers. And the mere fact that the coin has landed on heads for five or even fifty flips in a row does not mean tails is ‘due’. The fact we are so easily fooled by this is one of the main points behind this book. There are lovely explanations in this of Pascal’s Triangle and how this develops into the normal distribution curve. Fascinating and frightening discussions of false positives and biases that we invariably fall for. Then there are also topics on how we are manipulated and cheated because of our limited understanding of how randomness affects our lives. I’m finding that I can’t get enough of this topic at the moment – I’m hesitating, mostly due to not having the time, to buy a good book on statistics, it is nearly 30 years since I was taught this stuff at university and it might be finally time I learnt it properly.This is an essential companion book to so many other books on the topic of randomness and the consequences of randomness in how we understand (and misunderstand) our lives. I really enjoyed it and will now have to track down other books by this Mlodinow guy (and perhaps even try to remember his name so that I realise I am reading one of his books when I do.)"
4,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/995681-bronson-lauper,1,"Yes, I was an English major so, yes, I LOVE literature, but my statistics courses were my favorite courses ever. I can't claim to be an expert statistician since I haven't run a chi-square analysis in eons and since I can only remember the phrase ""data set"" but can't remember how to collect one (kidding), but COME ON! Some of Mlodinow's information is interesting, but much of his logic seems unfounded and certainly begs some sort of question (and often a rather basic one at that). I've only finished 1/3 of it, and I'm sure it has a wonderful ending for those with sadistic fortitude, but (statistically speaking) the likelihood of me completing any more of it is about eight deviations to the left on the s-curve, if ya' know what I'm sayin'. Sheesh."
5,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"There is a lot that is disturbing in this book. Are we 'Masters of the Universe'? Not so much.The author discusses in a breezy, easy to understand conversational manner how randomness and chance are behind many human decisions which we believe to be either based on educated guesses or personal skills, as well as how luck functions far more than we know in how things turn out for us. Briefly, but entertaining all the while, the author discusses famous incidents which illuminate the psychology behind mistaken beliefs of 'winning'. He discusses as an overview the math which makes obvious how rules of chance trump planned success, or how choices can be better made if one understands the probability of a choice's odds of happening. Each chapter covers an aspect of randomness and the math that helps expose it or measure it, and a brief biography of the people who created a part of this interesting class of math. Many of the chapters show how what appears to be the results of rationalized planning or expert decision-making which resulted in successful conclusions are not so, but instead are simply random luck, measurable by probability or statistical math. It's eerie because in explaining why so many things actually occur vs. how your brain perceived the occurrence the book leaves you with feelings that are similar to the feelings that happen when a promotion is given that you assume is because of your excellent record, but it turns out to be because none of your rivals showed up due to a car crash on the highway. Complicating efforts to get on top of luck, in effect increasing it in your favor by learning probability math, appears to be so difficult of an exercise in logic in some cases that expert mathematicians flub it, which the author demonstrates in a couple of chapters. The conclusion this all leads me to is that people are truly lemmings with delusions of grandeur, yet through all of the illusions we create to feel we have more control and power over human events than we actually do, somehow through math, crunching numbers in formulas, these same lame brains of ours are able to 'see' reality, even though we totally ignore it to live and function. Does that bother you as much a it bothers me?"
6,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6708700-steve-bennett,4,"My mom carried a holy card of St. Jude with her at all times. St Jude is the patron saint of lost causes. This book suggests that lost causes and what the public commonly refers to failures may just have had bad luck. Mlodinow demonstrates a lot of what the world chalks up to superior skill or thorough preparation is actually due to randomness. Or as Ecclesiastics states, in perhaps less scientific but more concise terms: ""I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all."" The Western world loves to hail victors and humiliate the losers. Yet, the difference between winning and losing is often mere chance. Mike Shanahan when he was wining Super Bowls in Denver was considered one of the best NFL coaches. This year, when he was going 3-13 with Washington, was considered one of the worst coaches ever. Did his coaching skill truly change that remarkably? Many times while reading this book, I thought it might be sending the message, ""Don't try, because randomness is a bigger factor of success than skill."" As in Ecclesiastics: ""All is vanity. What does it profit a man all his toil under the sun?"" However, the message is actually the opposite. The message is not to feel forsaken during apparent lost causes. The wheel is still in spin. Or as Tom Petty would say, ""Even the losers, get lucky some time.""  "
7,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"Let's suppose you are on Let's Make a Deal with Monte Hall. There are three doors to choose from. Behind the doors are a goat, a can opener, and a new car. You want the new car. You pick door #3. Now Monte Hall says he will trade you door #3 for door #1. First he shows what's behind door #2: a goat. Now should you trade door #3 for door #1 in the hopes of getting a new car? Here are your three choices: (A) Trade because the odds are greater of getting a new car if you trade, (B) Don't trade because the odds are less, or (C) It doesn't matter because the odds are equal. Make your choice and explain why you did so, and I will tell you if you are right. By the way, the great mathematician Paul Erdos got this wrong. Here's another story. A pilot trainer yells at trainees who mess up and they do better landing next time, but when he praises a pilot for landing well, the trainee does worse next time. Is it better to yell? No, but you can see why coaches think it works. Odds are that the pilot who messed up will do better no matter what. Those who did well will eventually do worse. Story #3: the probability that two events will both occur can never be greater than the probability that each will occur individually. Yet intelligent people continually think otherwise. Unless an odd detail is added. So what I am learning from this book is really about how human ignorance can occur. And I always want to be vigilant about myself and my own ignorance. I'm a Socratic believer in the idea that ignorance is at the root of all our ills. #4: Legend has it that Paul Erdos quit amphetamines for a month and said, ""Before, when I looked at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. Now all I see is a blank piece of paper."" #5: The chances of an event depend on the number of ways in which it can occur. #6: Try the birthday game at a party. Chances are that two people there will share the same birthday. I have done this in a classroom, and it usually works. #7: In 1654, Fermat, he of Fermat's last theorem fame, held a high position in the Tournelle, or criminal court, in Toulouse. Pierre de Fermat is usually considered the greatest amateur mathematician of all time. But he also condemned people to be burned at the stake. #8: For the last 8 years of Pascal's life, he committed himself to God. He sold everything except his Bible and gave his money to the poor. He wore an iron belt with points on the inside. When he was in danger of feeling happy, he pushed the spikes into his flesh. This was Pascal's Wager: Betting on the existence of God. #9: Grading papers. I can speak from experience on this one. We had to grade papers from around the state on a scale of 1 to 4. We had examples of each. Yet some teachers gave horrible papers a 4 because they had ""sincerity"" or some such nonsense and others gave great papers a 1 because they were too structured. #10: Voting recounts. Why does every recount get a different number? Great question. It never comes out the same. Says something about the system. #11: Best way to gain 30 points on your SATs is to take the test a few more times. Law of averages means you will eventually get a better score. #12: Wine tasting is a bit of a sham. No need to go into the details. You knew it all along, didn't you? #13: There were 1,000 more highway fatalities after 9/11 because people were afraid of flying. #14: Table moving in the mid 1800s was caused by the fidgeting of the participants with their hands on the table. #15: The psychologist Bruno Bettelheim said survival in Nazi concentration camps ""depended on one's ability to preserve some areas of independent action, to keep control of some important aspects of one's life despite an environment that seemed overwhelming."" #16: Nursing home residents given control of their rooms lived longer and were happier than those who had no control. #17: Nobel laureate Max Born: ""Chance is a more fundamental concept than causality."" #18: When an event is happening it is difficult to see the outcome. Later we can't understand why we didn't respond better. President Obama's measured approach is probably the best. Things happen because of many minor factors beyond the control of most people.#19: Observers tend to have a lesser view of victims. A high view of wealthy people. #20: Vodka has no difference in flavor whatsoever. Yet ask anyone who drinks it and they will tell you otherwise. How stupid is that? #21: Stephen King's Richard Bachman books did not sell until people knew it was him. #22: A final word of advice from Thomas Watson: ""If you want to succeed, double your failure rate.""

8,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,2,"I have a math background and an interest in the mind and enjoyed reading books like Predictably Irrational and Thinking, Fast and Slow. Given Mlodinow's reputation as a physicist, I expected a reasonably sophisticated presentation, albeit one that did not require a heavy math background. I was prepared for the book to be basic and probably start with the rudiments of probability, but the presentation is SO basic that the title term ""drunkard's walk"" does not even occur in the book until page 176 (out of only 219 pages).This seemed more like a history of probability and statistics (an interesting one, I'll admit, with lots of amusing anecdotes about celebrities past and present), with a bit of discussion of probability thrown in. I understand that many writers are reluctant to present a lot of equations in books for the general public, but the result in this case is that Mlodinow makes general statements but never carries the explanation far enough to satisfy curiosity or be useful. He says (p 108) ""The key to understanding randomness and all of mathematics is not being able to intuit the answer to every problem immediately but merely having the tools to figure out the answer."" Despite the claim on the back of the book that ""Mlodinow gives us the tools we need to make more informaed decisions"", he fails to provide the reader tools, instead being content to tell us which historical figures developed the tools that are in use today. This can make interesting reading, but it is not what was advertised."
9,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,5,"Even better the second time--This little book is just so good—not only does it give you just enough math to make you feel curious and satisfied, it tells a ripping good story about probability theory and statistics, providing along the way compelling portraits of the eccentric scientists and mathematicians who contributed to the fields. This time, I wanted to refresh my memory of all the thorny problems probability and statistics give us (we are really, really bad at intuiting probability, as psychologists have again and again shown us). One good refresher among many was the fallacy we make in dealing with conditional probability, mostly prominently manifested in conspiracy theories and paranoid thoughts: these events happened, therefore there is a huge conspiracy. Or close to home (for me at least): an agent hasn't gotten back to me yet, therefore she must not like my work. Probability-wise these are based on the wrong probabilities, and logically, these are equivalent to the fallacy of affirming the consequent (if P then Q, Q, therefore P). So from the valid, highly probable inference, ""If there is a huge conspiracy, these events happen"" or ""If an agent doesn't like my work, she will not respond for a long time,"" we see the consequent—these events happened, or the agent hasn't responded in a long time—and draw the mistaken conclusion that there is a huge conspiracy. Or the agent doesn't like my work. What's wrong with this is that there are so many possible reasons why a series of events occurred other than due to a huge conspiracy, or why the agent hasn't gotten back to me in a long time (she's just busy!). In probability terms:the probability that she he doesn't respond to me in a long time GIVEN she doesn't like my workis high and valid, whereas:the probability that an agent doesn't like my work given she has not responded to me in a long timeis low (because there could be all sorts of reasons why she hasn't responded to me). Just to hammer it home, this can be illustrated with a simple example:If you are human, you eventually die.is a perfectly valid conditional, butYou (pointing at a squirrel) eventually die, so you (the squirrel) must be human.is definitely not.More importantly, what I for some reason failed to write about in my 2012 review and totally forgot about until I reread the book is Yale sociologist Charles Perrow's normal accident theory Mlodinow mentions in the last chapter, how disasters in complex systems occur when many little human mistakes just happen to coincide at just the wrong (or right—depending on your perspective) time. I was so interested in this theory that I actually bought the seminal book by Perrow himself (and duly put on the shelf for ""read immediately""). Excellent, excellent book.[Read 1/5/2012] Awesome--This book made me admire what modern statistics—a topic I couldn't care less—is capable of doing and convinced me, like Taleb's The Black Swan and Burton Malkiel's Random Walk Down Wall Street how randomness really rules our lives and it's important to recognize chance events and not mistakenly assign them some causality that's not there. The history of probability theory and statistics Mlodinow tells in this book is nothing short of fascinating, and I was floored by the answers to some of the problems he so deftly presents.For example:1) there are three doors. Behind one of them is a treasure, and behind two are geese. You pick a door. The host of the show opens one of the doors you've picked and show geese behind it. Is it better to switch your choice?The answer: yes. You will increase your probability of winning from 1/3 to 2/3. Why? Read the book to find out why.2) The Attorney's Fallacy. Take the O.J. Simpson trial. The prosecutor argued O.J. Simpson was an abusive husband. The defense attorney Alan Dershowitz then argued that the probability of an abusive husband killing his wife is so low, the prosecutor's argument for O.J.'s propensity for violence is misguided. In more detail:4 million women are battered annually by their husbands and boyfriends in the U.S.Yet in 1992, a total of 1,432 women (or 1 in 2,500) were killed by their husbands or boyfriends.Therefore, few men who beat their wives or girlfriends go on to murder them.Convincing, but that's not the relevant probability. The relevant probability is rather: the probability that a battered wife who was murdered is murdered by her abuser. And of all the battered women murdered in 1993 in the U.S.some 90% were killed by their abuser.Then there's the reassuring implication that success comes to you largely by random—publication, prizes, business success, fame, etc.—and that means the longer we persevere, the better our odds are of succeeding. As an aspiring writer, this non-deterministic paradigm of looking at the world has helped me boost my confidence and determination.A must-read."
10,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9133439-caro,3,"Despite the seemingly highly rated reviews this book has received, I suspect it is more of a case of this book was hard to read which means it must be good that accounts for its ratings rather than any credit to the author's writing.The Drunkard's walk, despite Mr. Mlodinow's attempts at following Mr. Gladwell's formula, does not succeed in copying Mr. Gladwell's easy to read voice as well. First of all, although the subtitle SAYS ""how randomness rules our lives,"" I actually found the book to be propogating the exact opposite, our lives are actually ruled by probability and math and not random at all. Second, there was no actual connecting theme in this book. It was a collection of the most random assortment of math stories that all seem to take place sometime in the 19th centuries. They were about bizarre discoveries or how math affected people's lives, I'm not exactly sure what randomness had to do with anything other than the stories did seem to be told by a drunken man. The writing was not easy, although if it was because it was about math and required extra concentration on my part, I apologize for that. I had to reread several chapters a few times in order to understand what Mr. Mlodinow was saying. I'm not exactly sure why his book was ordered in the way it was, nor do I understand how this became a book to begin with. The subtitle would be better renamed: 10 odd stories about math in people's lives and how none of this will affect you.Well. I'm glad I'm done with that book."
11,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48011083-steve,4,"I liked Leonard Mlodinow’s The Drunkard’s Walk. It’s an important reminder of those principles, studied long ago, now only distantly familiar, regarding randomness. Because our brains do such a poor job filtering data, owing to a wide assortment of cognitive biases, it’s important, it seems, to revisit the science of probability and statistics; this work achieves that end. I think it’s a better written volume than the four others I recently read on this topic.I enjoyed recounting the Monty Hall problem to friends. There’s got to be a way to make a quick buck off that trick? Anyone have any idea how?When I went to the library to pick up this book, I noticed a copy of A Confederacy of Dunces, by John Kennedy Toole, which I flipped through with a vigorous, yet brief, interest. When I got home, I started reading The Drunkard’s Walk. There, on p. 10, Mlodinow discusses what book? Why, A Confederacy of Dunces. The very next day, a social gathering I regularly attend announced their book club’s reading for next month: A Confederacy of Dunces. Now what are the odds of that? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?"
12,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1789478-shelley,2,"The weirdest thing about reading this book was the following:I watched the movie ""21"" in which a team of college students under the tutelage of a greedy professor make tons of money in Las Vegas by counting cards while playing Black Jack. In one scene of the movie, probabilities are discussed and the professor brings up the scenario of the 3 doors on ""Let's Make a Deal"" and asks the class if it's better to stick with your first choice of doors AFTER the host reveals one of the doors behind which there is no grand prize or switch to the remaining door. The correct answer would be to switch but most people don't get why. Not an hour after watching this movie, I continued reading this book, which I had started earlier and within a couple of pages, the author brought up and discussed the EXACT SAME SCENARIO and the reasons why you should switch in that situation.Talk about randomness! What are the odds on that?I found this book very interesting but being very dense when it comes to mathematics, I got lost in several places where the author went into great mathematical detail. I liked the historical aspects of the book, his descriptions of great mathematicians (Fermat, Pascal, Newton, etc.) and how thet built on each other's work over time."
13,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"I'll admit it. I like books by Malcolm Gladwell and Dan Ariely. I liked Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything and Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts. I know many consider these books lightweight and pseudointellectual, and that a more incisive critical reader than I am would probably make mincemeat of them. But I find them entertaining and interesting, even if they don't always hold up to critical analysis.The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives falls squarely into this genre, and some of the ground covered will be familiar to other readers who consume these books. The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives is a little different, though, in that it goes beyond cognitive biases and surprising stories of successful/failed fads and geniuses to discuss statistics and probability and the fact that we tend to underestimate the influence of chance and overestimate other factors such as talent, skill, and actual appeal. This may sound depressing, but we can actually view it as encouraging. Your talent and skill may be irrelevant. But because chance is so powerful, you can increase your likelihood of success simply by refusing to give up. Odds are, if you keep trying, eventually you'll achieve the results you want through sheer luck.The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives resembles Malcolm Gladwell's books in that the entertainment value of the examples perhaps exceeds the intellectual tautness of the connecting thesis. Still, though, this was an entertaining, readable, and interesting book which gives you a lot to think about and is fun without being a waste of time. "

Although there are some valuable things to learn from it. But I thought this book was going to have more to do with psychology but it has more to do with statistics and probabilities - mathematics... And do you know what my least favorite subject was in all of my Business degree? ... Statistics... Maybe it's because I'm not interested in it, maybe because I just don't understand it, but I hated and still hate it lol I think if were to want to learn about it I'd rather it in a textbook form and not a book."

Many people think acknowledging randomness is denying God.The book is a bit chatty, and needs to focus a bit more on errors people make with statistics in their personal lives ... but Mlodinow hit on an essential concept.I liked this lesson: that successful people are lucky, but that lucky people are persistent, flexible, and brave."
16,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,5,"You’re presented with three doors. Behind one door is a car and behind the other two doors are goats. Sound familiar? It is. You pick door number one. Instead of opening your choice, Monty opens door number two and reveals a goat. He then asks you if you wish to keep what’s behind your original choice (door one) or change your mind to door number three. If you think it makes no difference whether you switch or not and that your odds are 50/50 either way, you might be surprised at the answer and enjoy reading this book. If you are surprised by the answer to this ridiculously simple challenge, you’re in for a plethora of awakenings about the assumptions we make of the numbers and statistics we hear in our daily lives. Peppered with charm and wit; wonderfully read by Sean Pratt, I would highly recommend this title to anyone interested in a history of the development of statistics. Books about numbers are especially not easy ones to listen to but Sean Pratt reads this one at just the right pace and with just the right inflections to make listening to and learning from The Drunkard’s Walk totally accessible. I will often read two or three books at a time. This one, however, was just so captivating, it monopolized my complete attention. But then I’m a nerd and that too might be a requirement for truly enjoying this title."
17,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1538729-aaron,4,"Overall I'll give it to Leonard Mlodinow for writing a math book that's surprisingly accessible to the general public. Well, maybe it's not exactly a math book, or even a statistics book. But there's a fair amount of each and he did a fine job with keeping it generally light and interesting. Mlodinow explains that there are basically two definitions of random, and they don't always go together (pp. 84-85). The first is by Charles Sanders Peirce and basically states that a process or method is truly random if given enough tests, trials, samples, examples any outcome is equally likely as any other (the ""frequency interpretation of randomness""). In other words, regardless of how things seem (especially when you're only looking at very little data), there's nothing ""special"" going on that prefers or encourages one result over another. Mlodinow doesn't go in this direction, but I would say most people would relate this to/understand this in terms of neutrality, equality, fairness, balance, impartiality, etc. Setting aside debates in cognitive psychology and linguistics about modules and association, let's just say that most people would say these things are important (ideally) in business, law, politics - anywhere where people and things should be treated the same. Mlodinow then offers the second common definition of randomness, the ""subjective interpretation,"" where ""a number or set of numbers is considered random if we either don't know or cannot predict how the process that produces it will turn out."" Again, he doesn't take this road, but I think most reader would relate this to things like luck, whimsy, risk, guess, judgment, odds, choice, etc. You'd think that he'd establish these weird heavy definitions and and run with them for another 200 pages. But he doesn't. He leaves these definitions orphaned on pages 84-85, which is a shame because they seem to be the most interesting and relevant part of the whole book. What was the purpose of bringing them up at all? Better question is What is the purpose of the book? Sure, to sell books, makes some cash, and better inform the public. But more than that I think this book somewhat aims at the ""big dreamers,"" those people who seek big success, or at least dream about it, and want to know why it works. Or why it doesn't. Mlodinow uses a fair number of examples of business stories, Hollywood stories, scientist stories, and gambling stories. It's not a glorification attempt, but to illustrate that luck has a lot to with it. From Bill Gates to Bruce Willis, Stephen King to Anne Frank, Thomas Edison to George Lucas, luck plays a role as much as hard work. He offers the advice to persevere to those who aim to succeed because often not bad talent but bad luck that fails you. Okay, fair point. I think this is the kind of stuff that people want in such books so it's included for ""sentimental"" reasons, but it doesn't tell us anything we don't already know. What is interesting to me is the discussion of why we believe what we do and how we act accordingly. Mlodinow discusses factors that influence our perceptions and our ideas. He references a few studies, including Daniel Kahneman intuition studies and Melvin Lerner's Just-world phenomenon, but he doesn't really go into the details. In particular he glosses over part of Kahneman's study and overlooks a point that's essential to his own book. On page 22 he reports finds of a fictional character ""Linda"" described with, I guess you could call it, hippie or generally leftist leanings, and participants ranked the likelihood of 8 statements: 1. Linda is active in the feminist movement. 2. Linda is a psychiatric social worker. 3. Linda works in a bookstore and takes yoga classes. 4. Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement. 5. Linda is a teacher in an elementary school. 6. Linda is a member of the League of Women voters. 7. Linda is a bank teller. 8. Linda is a insurance salesperson. The point here was that number 4 includes number 7, but was ranked as more likely. Mlodinow used this study to show that intuition is not a reliable judge and that people tend to make obvious mistakes once they get an idea in their head. (Specifically, Kahneman demonstrated that people are more likely to believe something is the case when additional, even irrelevant information is provided. But I read something else in this study - that people probably take number 7 to mean ""Linda is a bank teller, but not a feminist."" Maybe the original study specifically controlled for this (I doubt it), but the point is that number 7 is not ""neutral"" or ""interchangeable"" with other items. Whether she is a bank teller seems (to some degree) to be relevant to her social-political identity, as much as any of the other items suggest. For example, if they use ""Linda's new shoes are blue,"" or ""Linda was born in July,"" people would say they're both totally irrelevant to the description and uninformative to where they should rank. Is this really a relevant point? Maybe, maybe not. But I bring it up to show how difficult it is to really identify what people take into consideration when making decisions, which is a big part of what the book is about - given the fact that so much is outside our control, awareness, or understanding, how do we choose wisely? A fair amount of the book is dedicated to math and statistics. I think most people will find it manageable, or can safely skip over anything technical without missing much. About half of it is really ""about"" the first definition above (frequency) - and that's the heavy math stuff. The other half is about how people act and think when there is not enough information to know better, and what goes into that thinking. I don't know if this would do much to really change how people think about chance, statistics or randomness, as he seemed to specifically avoid technical issues. Most people will probably just fit each case covered into their present ideas of any of those italicized words I put after each definitions. Those are the real concerns I think most people have on this topic, and he did a fair job covering them. I wouldn't call this a social science classic, but it was entertaining and easy enough to get through. "
18,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,4,"So this was pretty good. I had it on my to read list for awhile so I may have built it up a bit too much in my mind before getting started though because I kept waiting for the book to ""pick up"" in some areas. Overall though good read, really enjoyable. A lot of these anecdotes have been used before though. I think he could have come up with a few more unique scenarios. Still it was fun. I have always thought the wine ratings were a bit suss anyway. "
19,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2990467-ric,4,"[However taking this a step further, Leonard Mlodinow suggests that much of how our lives transpire is happenstance, defined by a supreme law of probability that governs what we experience and perceive as humans. "
20,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,5,"A great little book about statistics (my college minor), written by a professor of physics (my major field of study).I got my minor 11 years ago and haven't used statistics since. I've been aiming to take it back up again. maybe even do a career switch to data science (sometime down the road, at least two textbooks and a few online courses away - not to mention that I don't know of any data science openings in my city and I love my current house, and so does my husband...). I figured that plunging myself into pop books on the subject might be a good start.From a technical point of view, there's not much to be gained from this book. I don't recall seeing even a single formula. However, it's kind of impressive that a professor of physics could write a book about statistics without using any formulas. Well, he has written for Star Trek and MacGyver afterall...Definitely a good historical account of statistics and statisticians, which I'd had only brief exposure to before. Also, I liked how he kept pointing out that probability/statistics/randomness can really influence our experience of our own lives. For instance, Mlodinow's own father lost his first wife and children to the holocaust. But, had that not happened, his father would never have married Leonard's mother (also a holocaust survivor), and Leonard would not exist. Obviously, someone with that background must have spent considerable time thinking about such dichotomies as meaning and randomness."
21,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2681022-steven,5,"I found this book fascinating. I knew I didn't understand statistics, but I didn't realize how little I understood about randomness and probability. The Monty Hall problem (aka ""Let's make a deal"", Ch. 3); the effect that naming a girl child ""Florida"" can have on the probability of having two girls (Bayesian theory, Ch. 6, p. 107); the errors that people consistently make on relative probabilities (see, e.g., p. 36-40). I especially liked the sections on how we tend to find patterns where there are none, to base decisions on completely unreliable data. The author teaches that because success is so random, the best advice is simply to keep trying. He quotes Thomas Edison that ""many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up."" and Thomas Watson, of IBM, that ""If you want to succeed,double your failure rate."" In a world which is almost random, in which there is only a slight correlation between merit and success, ""Try, try again"" is not just an ancient proverb, it is a thoroughly modern and useful algorithm. I strongly recomend this book. "
22,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4235397-sarah-clement,4,"This book is a well-written, common sense account of probability for the layperson. I found it entertaining and it reminded me of past statistics courses - things I had forgotten I had even learned. However, it's not really what I was expecting. I expected more focus on how we misjudge probability in our every day lives, but that discussion felt ancillary to the discussion of the history of statistics in the book. I don't want to make it sound boring, because it wasn't, and the last third of the book was much more in the realm of what I was expecting. I really enjoyed reading about the fund manager stuff in particular. It confirmed my suspicion that most of the financial professionals don't really perform any better than if they were guessing at random. This is just the same as ""futurists"" or any sort of job that involves prediction. I would have loved it if he would have expanded this discussion into other professions (like futurists) because that would have been very interesting. All in all though, a good read, and I thought that the metaphor of the drunkard's walk was great...I just wished it had been described earlier in the book, but I guess he was building up to it!"
23,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/706046-tim-abraham,5,"this book is great. it takes you through the history of how the statistics and probabilities we understand (or try to understand) today were first proven. It's amazing how probability is just simply not an intuitive thing for the human mind. be prepared for some anecdotes that will leave you scratching your head. Mlodinov examples of human biases are entertaining and thought provoking. Anyone who likes interesting factoids, data, or wants to understand the world better will find this a good read."
24,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5995202-isil-arican,4,"A good, introductory book to general concepts of randomness, chance, and probability. The author does a great job explaining things in a simple matter, giving examples the reader can relate from daily life and demonstrates how this information can be applied to critical thinking/ skepticism.The book provides a compilation of common/known topics ranging from base rate fallacy, regression to the mean, Monty Hall problem while also providing an easy to follow summary of the history of statistics.The name of the book made me read it much later than I bought it because I was under the impression that the topics covered would be heavier and more advanced, but it isn't. Do not let the name fool you, it is pretty basic/ introductory stuff.The only caveat is that I partly read and partly listened this book while driving. Some sections do require you to see the calculations, and hearing is not enough. So I probably will re-read those episodes.Recommended to all who are into critical thinking - one of the key skill sets is to be able to understand the data presented in news reporting, health claims etc, and this would help to turn a critical eye to things we see, hear or read every day.“The first step in battling the illusion of control is to be aware of if. But even then it is difficult, once we think we see a pattern, we do not easily let go of our perception.” "
25,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8316749-katiemc,3,"I loved Thinking, Fast and Slow and I always had plans for doing a long and elaborate review of it. I even have a chunk of it drafted. Alas, that review will probably never happen. But I will say, if you liked this book and want to explore some of the concepts in depth without the historical references, I highly recommend it.So this book I liked. Being a math person, many of the ideas are not new to me. But I will add that being a person who has an affinity for real and complex analysis, set theory and topology, the world of probability and statistics has always been a pesky buggar. Proving the author’s main thesis, it is not one comes readily or intuitively, I have to work at it. Warning - this book presents the ultimate modern day probability parable of Monte Hall and his goats. This is a good problem, one that I have struggled with, understand conceptually, and have filed away. The only thing I will say about it, and it’s true of a great many problems that involve probabilities, the wording of the problem is of upmost importance. Probability theory is not always complex, but it can be tedious and careful understanding of the words that describe the problem are crucial. Another note about the book, there are several diversions into the history of math interspersed throughout the book. I found these tangents interesting and relevant, but sometimes distracting to the points being made. In an absurd sort of way, it indirectly reinforces the author’s premise that probability theory is not intuitive and it’s really hard to stay in that head space. It’s like when a difficult conversation gets derailed by smalltalk, sometimes it’s just too hard to stay intense and on point.A very important takeaway is the need for mathematical literacy in the world of probability and statistics. The 24 hour news cycle is filled with dubious blame gaming and attribution for everything from daily stock market moves to employment rates to crime rates, as if these were deterministic events. At least they are not determined by a finite set of known events. Imagine the sanity that would be brought to political discourse if this was to be acknowledged.2017 reading challenge checks the box for 15. A book with a subtitle .

26,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6143501-kim,4,"I confess to math envy. I can understand general concepts and ideas if they're presented in verbal form. Show me a page full of numbers and  mathematical symbols and my brain freezes up like a sprinkler at the North Pole. That's why I find books like this one so helpful. Maybe it's not helpful, since I can finish a book like this and have no less arithmophobia than when I started, but at least I can wrap my head around the concept.""The drunkard's walk"" is a phrase that came into use in the 1930s to describe random occurrences, everything from throwing dice to the movement of molecules through water. Those and dozens of other concepts you need to deal with daily are covered in the book, some of which are too close to life or death to trust to intuition.Mlodinow has a friendly and easy approach to these and other instances of making sense of numbers and statistics in order to make better decisions in our lives. With this he gradually draws us through a history of mathematics and thoughts about randomness from the ancient Greeks, through the invention of basics like plus and minus signs, through quantum mathematics and string theory. Even for this aging English major the trip was easy and pleasant.Among the ideas talked about include making the best decisions on Let's Make a Deal when you're confronted with three doors. You'll also learn whether to add or multiply variables when deciding on a roll of the dice or other random event, as well as the dangers of ""the gambler's fallacy"", which applies as much to investing as it does to gambling. The author also touches on polling and voting, explaining the ""margin of error"". He even teaches how to understand what doctors and lawyers are saying or hiding when they use statistics. Doctors for medical and pharmaceutical statistics, lawyers for probabilities on things like DNA and crime statistics.The book has now been out just short of 10 years. It's still useful and informative with few examples to tax your memory for things that happened a decade ago. The book is still available in new and used paper and hard editions, Kindle, and audio editions."
27,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1132102-steve-schafer,4,"A decade ago, the statistician author of this book tested positive for AIDS. The doctor informed him that the test was 99.9% accurate, so there was little hope for error. After an abysmal weekend, he began to question the relevancy this number. The incidence of AIDS (within his demographic—middle aged, non-IV-drug user) is 1 in 10,000. So, out of every 10,000 who take the test, 1 person will test positive and will have the disease. HOWEVER, with a .1% error rate, of those same 10,000 tested, 10 people will falsely test positive. To his great relief, he realized that even though the test is 99.9% accurate, only 1 out of 11 people like him who test positive actually have AIDS. It turns out, the author did not—both he and his logic were victorious. Page after page, The Drunkards Walk turns numbers upside down, constantly highlighting the irony of something so concrete being so elusive, misleading and often counterintuitive. Mlodinow’s approach is shotgun, encompassing a broad and fascinating history of the science of chance. He lays it all out in a very accessible manner, but make no mistake about it, some of his points require a minor ‘matheletic’ workout to understand.As much as this is a how-to guide for solving questions of probability, it is more of a how-not-to guide. It is Mlodinow’s primary assertion that randomness plays a much stronger role in our lives than we realize. Probability has its place, but it’s in the backseat, where we seldom keep it. Our world is full of data we use to determine where our own best chances lie—when this is often a lie in itself. And in coming to this conclusion, the book sums to more than just an understanding of probabilities, but of the human condition. We are hard-wired to seek meaning, patterns and control in life—even in the (frequent) event that they don’t exist. If you like numbers, it’s probable that you’ll relate to and enjoy this book."
28,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"This book is another one of those books that can be described as useful, informative, and other such not-really-flattering adjectives, but it’s a really good book and everyone should read it. It’s amazing how much we’re NOT meant to understand chance and randomness. This deficiency is not only a problem for your statistics and probability exams, but also in daily life. You need to read this book to see how sloppy reasoning and misunderstanding of randomness can impair our judgment in so many situations. One example: We fail to realize that if thousands of mutual funds do investments for many years, some of them will beat the market five years in a row just by chance (try saying that to the big egos managing the funds), as evident by the dismal performance of the same funds in the next five years. We simply overlook the effect of randomness in success and failure, and as a results give undo credit or blame to individuals (including ourselves). There are simply too many unpredictable and uncontrollable factors in this life. Another example – this one shows how we fail to understand the concept of conditional probability: If the chance of HIV tests resulting in a false positive is 1 in 1000, and if you have tested positive, what is the chance that you got a false positive? 1 in 1000, right? No, because if the true rate of HIV infection is 1 in 10,000 for your demographics, then only 1 in a population of 10,000 is truly HIV-positive, but 10 in that population will get a false positive. So chances are over 90% that you got a false positive! You really need to read this book. "
29,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2971930-vy,4,"This is an enjoyable synopsis of basic principles of probability and statistics. Lest that sound like an oxymoron, Mlodinow really does manage to be entertaining while covering such topics as Pascal's triangle, normal distributions, standard deviations, Chi square analysis, Bayesian analysis, and type I and type II statistical errors. He weaves in thought-provoking questions and injects interesting anecdotes about the mathematicians who came up with these ideas. If you are a mathematician, you won't like or need this book--there are very few actual formulas. I've learned all this information before, but my prob and stats courses were *never* this engaging, and it was too easy to get bogged down in the math. This book served as a good refresher course that actually helped me to retain a better sense of the big picture. I think it'd also be a great introduction to these topics for the uninitiated.Beyond the presentation of mathematical concepts, the book shows practical applications. There is a lot of discussion of what happens when we misconstrue the causality of random events and when we mistake a probability as a definite fact. You'll come away with an increased awareness of how chance occurrences shape our lives. Fans of Gladwell's Outliers will recognize some of these themes."
30,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390215-mike,0,"A very good and accessible introduction to probability and randomness. Most people don't appreciate the fact that most of what we see every day is the product of chance. Social scientists are, ironically, sometimes more blind to this fact than others, because we are trained to hunt for patterns, and we therefore tend to find them even if they aren't there. (For anyone who does statistics, one way of thinking about this is that the typical social scientist routinely underestimates the magnitude of the error term in an equation.) We get so caught up in what can explain, or think we can explain, that we forget to think about the many factors we can't. Oddly, although this is far from a self-help book, I think its main point can be useful for anyone who is feeling a bit down. Most success (and most failure) is the product of luck. The one thing we can control is our own behavior: persistence is all. "
31,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,4,"I loved this book. Because the author provides so many real-life examples to illustrate and demonstrate his ideas, this book is extremely interesting and useful and readable.One of my favorite passages in the book talks about the ""confirmation bias"". Francis Bacon described this bias as follows: ""the human understanding, once it has adopted an opinion, collects any instances that confirm it, and though the contrary instances may be more numerous and more weighty, it either does not notice them or else rejects them, in order that this opinion will remain unshaken."" To make matters worse, not only do we preferentially seek evidence to confirm our preconceived notions, but we also interpret ambiguous evidence in favor of our ideas.Like many other points made in this book I found this passage to be so useful in explaining so much of what is observed in the real world with real people."

Although many of the topics are familiar to late high school/early university maths courses, the history, anecdotal illustrations and examples are woven together to build an enjoyable story of what is generally considered to be a dry topic. Most of the examples are not heavy on the maths (I would have preferred a little more!) so the book should be accessible to most readers regardless of their self-perceived numeracy skills. Hopefully the book is read by a wider audience than those who have a professional interest, since there is broad relevance for most of us. The last chapter offers an encouraging perspective on coping with the vagaries of a random world on our need to be in control, at least in part, of our destinies. "

38,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,4,"A unique approach to a difficult subject!Mathematicians or, at least, those comfortable with mathematics will probably suggest that A DRUNKARD'S WALK offers little new to them in terms of concrete mathematical analysis that they weren't already familiar with. And I'm certainly inclined to agree.On the other hand (even as a graduate of a university program in applied math and theoretical physics), I found plenty of interest and a remarkable level of insight demonstrating how non-intuitive the correct approach to the evaluation of probability, statistics and the almost all-encompassing effects of randomness in real-life actually is. Mlodinow offers plenty of meaty examples to chew on that are drawn from a myriad of real world arenas - the stock market, sports, consumer preferences and sampling surveys, the ways in which defense and prosecution attorneys can lead judges and juries down mathematically irrelevant and entirely spurious garden paths, medical testing, misplaced blame or unearned congratulations for strings of failures or successes that are nothing more than random variation and much, much more. Mlodinow also gives his readers some fascinating insights into how the basic nature of human psychology is, in many cases, the fundamental reason for our misinterpretation of probabilities and statistics ... EVEN in those cases where we are well aware of the illogical underpinnings of our analysis.In short, as long as a reader already well-versed in the mathematics of probability and statistics knows what to expect, A DRUNKARD'S WALK is sure to please. Potential readers that are more math-phobic can be assured that there isn't an equation in sight and their enjoyment of a fine contribution to a diverse non-fiction library is a slam dunk!Paul Weiss"

So when the professor recommended this book to the class, I thought yes, let's read it. And while reading a nonfiction book that a professor recommends is a very nerdy thing to do, it's also exactly the kind of nerd that I want to be! (I'm jealous of all the people who willingly read nonfiction regularly and gain lots of cool knowledge while I stick to fun fiction)Anyhoo this book was very interesting and well written in a way that is definitely palatable for anyone, math background or not. It dragged a bit in the last third but is still cool. Would recommend!"

Drunk people are more likely to let the universe control their bodies. As you may know, the result is random (sort of). Thus the other way around is also true: the whole universe is drunk all the time! Damn, this even explains quantum mechanics? Sure. But this book is about the effects of a drunk universe in our ordinary lives. The bad news is: you don't need a drink to see randomness everywhere."

In it, the author gives an overview of the development of probably theories throughout history. Using that as a framework, he gives brief explanations of many of the theories and formulas in the field and provides real world examples to make them relatively easy to understand.The general takeaway from the book is that much of what we believe to be meaningful in our lives is actually just a result of meaningless chance. The moral is: Never give up on your dreams, because eventually, shear probability says you'll win. All in all, this was a good read."
44,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867629-justin,4,"UPDATE 4/30/13I'm revising my rating of this up a star, because I just realized that I'm still thinking about one of this book's concepts years later (specifically, how we view people who depend on factors outside of their direct control— CEOs, baseball players, etc.—without taking a long view of the trend towards the mean, thereby discounting the effects of random chance when evaluating their performance). Whatever nits I picked at the time I read it, this book taught me something interesting that I've since applied in my daily life, which is high praise for scientific nonfiction.-------I appreciate my many blessings when it comes to the big things that matter in life, but avoid gambling due to my preternatural bad luck in games of chance. How many times can one be dealt a 16 in blackjack, or roll under 10 on a 20-sided dice in one night, you may wonder? The answer, if you are me, is many, many times. Therefore, I was attracted by the premise of this book when I read one of its reviews: despite our proclivities for assigning patterns and assuming control of our destinies, blind luck plays a much larger role in our successes and failures in life than we give it credit for, and we can learn a lot about ourselves by understanding how randomness and probability are really applied.I’ve never had a good head for math, but statistics has always been an exception. Even so, I discovered that in order to ride along with this book, you need to be up on your math. Mlodinow is very good at explaining mathematical concepts in layman’s terms, with plenty of interesting (and sometimes hilarious) examples, and the book is probably a cakewalk for those who are interested and/or work in mathematics. Even so, I found my eyes glazing over every now and again as I tried to follow along.That being said, there is a lot of fascinating stuff in this book that makes for some interesting dinner-table talk. The book is targeted at those who aren’t math majors or probability experts, so even if you don’t quite understand the theories and equations that Mlodinow explains, he gives plenty of examples in which they apply, both hypothetical and real-life. He repeatedly makes the case that we don’t do a very good job in dealing with randomness, attributing results to unsupported assumptions and patterns that don’t exist, and shows in detail how this can affect everything from picking stocks and playing games to the fate of Hollywood executives and corporate CEOs. He even touches a little on the psychological and sociological factors that contribute to this, though I kind of wish he talked about that a little more; this book is solely about the numbers, and how to read them.And therein lies my only real complaint with the book: in his zeal to explain how randomness and probability work and are correctly applied, Mlodinow sometimes seems to discount situational context. Not all the time, to be sure; one particularly interesting example he gives on how feedback does or does not affect performance shows succinctly how situational context sometimes does not matter at all, and conversely, nearly an entire chapter is dedicated to how context can be applied to correctly determine an event’s chances. But in other places, the examples he gives to demonstrate particular statistical theories seem to be missing a piece, or only apply because he’s making them apply. Of course, that could just be my pattern-loving brain asserting itself in the face of indomitable mathematics. Still, I felt that Mlodinow’s arguments were weaker in some places than they were in others.In any event, there are a lot of neat concepts to be explored in this book, such as the idea of there being order in chaos (regression to the mean) and chaos in order (""the drunkard’s walk"" of the book’s title). And I particularly appreciated being reminded how cool and useful Pascal’s Triangle is. The most important conclusion to draw from this book, however, is the reliability of the one aspect of chance that we do have control over: the sample size. In other words, the only surefire way of achieving success in an endeavor, conclusively backed up by the math, is to not give up and try as many times as possible until the results we want come our way.This book is occasionally dry and somewhat daunting for the casual reader, but definitely worth a read for anyone that has a passing interest in statistics, and is full of interesting (and applicable) ideas on how chance really works in our lives."
45,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,3,"This is an excellent layman's guide to how random chance dictates various aspects of our lives, and how poorly equipped the human mind is to deal with randomness, even after training. It's also a good primer on various core concepts of statistics and probability, such as combinatorics, confidence intervals, and the central limit theorem.Mlodinow writes anecdotally, using salient examples from the news and his own life to illustrate how, in every conceivable domain, even intelligent people can't reason about probabilities and therefore come to the wrong conclusions. For example, Mlodinow got a false positive for an HIV blood test he took, and his doctor told him that since the test was 99.9% accurate, he was almost certainly going to die. But his doctor was making a common error in this kind of scenario. The relevant calculation isn't the accuracy of the test, but the probability of Mlodinow having HIV given the test result. As a straight white male who doesn't abuse intravenous drugs, his odds of having HIV are 1 in 10,000. It follows that in a population of 10,000 men in his demographic, 1 would have HIV and 11 would test positive for HIV (one true positive and ten false positives). This means that his chance of having HIV given the test result was actually 1 in 11, not 999/1,000 -- much better odds.My favorite aspect of the book was Mlodinow's summary of studies that reveal the biases in human thinking about chance. The human mind is unwilling to admit that chance could play so great a role in its everyday affairs, and so people consistently (and erroneously) assume that a person's success or failure in any endeavor must be due to the person themselves. Mlodinow present numerous studies to demonstrate this universal bias, in simple and unambiguous situations where, for example, a test subject randomly selected to be paid more for the experiment -- that the other subjects know was selected randomly -- will be treated with increased respect and deference relative to his (randomly) lower paid peers. He speculates that the human need for control over one's life leads us to consistently overestimate the chance that, for example, hard work leads to success and indolence to failure, or that outcomes in general can be predicted ahead of time based on past performance. These very human notions are demonstrably false, but so completely ingrained into our natural thought processes that even trained mathematicians make the same errors when they themselves are the subject of the study.Overall this was a pleasant and entertaining layman's math book, but I didn't find it particularly mind-expanding, probably because I was already familiar with most of the concepts Mlodinow discusses. For example, he spends several pages dissecting the now-famous Monty Hall paradox. These passages and several others were retreads for me, although well told. But I did appreciate his very human portraits about some of the great historical minds of math and physics, and he does an excellent job explaining the cultural and political reasons why these now-commonplace ideas about probability were so revolutionary at the time of their discovery."
46,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Mlodinow presents two definitions of randomness: the ""frequency interpretation,"" identified by Charles Sanders Peirce in 1896 as a method that will produce one set as frequently as any other set, and the ""subjective interpretation,"" based on our inability to predict results. (pp. 84-85) Falling under the subjective category is research dating back to the 1930s that showed that ""people could neither make up a sequence of numbers that passed mathematical tests for randomness nor recognize reliably whether a given string was randomly generated."" (p. ix)Unlike Nassim Nicholas Taleb in The Black Swan, Mlodinow has more use for the idea of the bell curve in describing overall expectations. However, he points out that it is impossible to draw the bell curve from a single data point, which is often all that we have. He writes: ""When we observe a success or a failure, we are observing one data point, a sample from under the bell curve that represents the potentialities that previously existed. We cannot know whether our single observation represents the mean or an outlier, an event to bet on or a rare happening that is not likely to be reproduced."" (p. 142)His book uses many examples from sports, such as the fact that firing a coach after a bad season doesn't correlate with improved team performance, although popular belief holds the coach responsible. These concepts were presented well and it was enjoyable to try to work through the math.Quotes:""The theory of randomness is fundamentally a codification of common sense. But it is also a field of subtlety, a field in which great experts have been famously wrong and expert gamblers infamously correct. What it takes to understand randomness and overcome our misconceptions is both experience and a lot of careful thinking."" (p. 21) ""We associate randomness with disorder. Yet although the lives of 200 million drivers vary unforeseeably, in the aggregate their behavior could hardly have proved more orderly. ... But it was not just the regularities that astonished them [the 19th-century scientists:]. It was also the nature of the variation. Social data, they discovered, often follow the normal distribution."" (p. 148)"
47,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1073647-robyn-blaber,4,"Few things are more annoying to me that when friends say ""Everything happens for a reason."" I'm reminded of Voltaire's Candide where he is annoyed by the philosophical concept of ""sufficient reason"". Voltaire wonders what the sufficient reason of the Lisbon earthquake was (the most devastating natural disaster of his era and the end of the Portuguese as a world power). Was the sufficient reason that Portuguese rescue workers needed rescue work? The possible answers make sufficient reason seem quite absurd.We know the reason for almost everything. Mathematical probability. If you flip a coin long enough, you will get a heads result. If you practice guitar long enough, you'll learn to play Stairway to Heaven. And so on and so on.As an evolutionary advantage, our minds automatically try to make sense of random events and bring order to the chaos. It makes us feel better... and even live longer. We ascribe things such as god, karma, luck, the illusion of skill or whatever we can imagine to explain random phenomenon, particularly when the phenomenon makes the odds appear long.What's the difference between a personal understanding of long odds and a general understanding? For example, what are the chances that you will win a lottery? Not good. What are the chances that ""someone"" will win the same lottery? Very good. If you narrow the scope of a long-odds event to your own personal experience, of course these events can seem like providence.The Drunkards walk was (for me) a little too simple. I've studied combinatorial mathematics and statistics and the book was a simple reminder of the works of Pascal, Fibonacci, Newton and a few others. For someone new to mathematics, however, I think it would be a better read... it explained simple combinatorics problems that I assume would not confuse a virgin to mathematics.In the end... the lasting idea is... our lives are ruled by chance and we can improve our lives by tipping odds in our favour. Before we can do this, however we have to accept that everything has odds and that we are rarely in control. Not easy advice, but worth the price. "
48,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"Yeah, that's right. A book about probability theory. And actually, it's not bad if you can either shrug off or endure a bit of lecturing on basic mathematics and statistics. Author Leonard Mlodinow sets out to review the history of probability, starting with the ancient Greeks and following the field's evolution and application. Mlodinow has a pretty good style, keeping things relatively low level so that anyone with a high school education in math can probably follow along. He also peppers the narrative with jokes and asides to break up the otherwise less-than-fluffy subject matter. And it works pretty well, though I suspect the lengthy discussion of the normal curve might have lost me if I hadn't already had all that info drilled into me in graduate school.My favorite parts of The Drunkard's Walk were the historical bits dealing with the personalities and biographies of the people who helped define the field. It's interesting to see how one, for example, labored as a would-be academic for years and years, before turning his burgeoning probability theory to gambling and making more money than he ever dreamed of. Actually, that theme shows up a lot --another section describes how another researcher working in the field went to a casino and used his meticulous study of roulette tables to uncover flaws in the system and make himself fabulously wealthy before they kicked him out.Where The Drunkard's Walk falls down (ha!) a bit is in its examination of the practical problems to which probability theory can be applied. That is, why it matters to YOU. The best books on popular science do this really well, and it moves the work from being academic to accessible by anyone looking to be both educated and entertained. Don't get me wrong, Mlodinow does some of this, but he doesn't really nail it as well as some others I've read. Still, if you've got a little bit of grounding in the topic and want to add some context to your knowledge, The Drunkard's Walk should do that quite nicely."
49,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4101122-jeremy,4,"A really nice overview of fundamental concepts in probability and statistics, in the context of the lives of the frequently bizarre people who developed them! If you wanted to learn more about this topic, this book would give you a good handle on the concepts so you could dive in and understand your awful textbook full of opaque formulas.I really enjoyed the descriptions of collaboration and inspiration among the people who made important contributions to probability.The writing style is overall a bit academic, but still good for a general audience without any background in the subject or extensive practice deciphering universitese. It's pleasant, casual, and the examples are easy to follow.Where this book falls down a little bit is in guiding you towards applying these concepts to your life or work. I think a reader would need a little more hand-holding and walking through specific scenarios to think about how to use these ideas. We're not likely to be guests on ""Let's Make A Deal,"" so even after working out the awesome and counterintuitive Goat Odds, it would still be hard to go through the same process for scenarios we're likely to encounter in real life. This is where an author like Malcolm Gladwell would really succeed with this kind of material - by coming up with a few good ideas for applications and running with them, stripping them down to their bare essentials and presenting a persuasive argument for how to identify your biases that are based on limited evidence, override your intuition and rely on real measurements of what is likely to occur. Mlodinow tries to advocate for this, but you'd need to develop it on your own, and where's the pop-science fun in that?"
50,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15155099-jacob,4,"I'm not good at math. I am, however, very good at being drunk. I had hoped this book would marry the middle ground and suddenly I'd be wonderful at maths. This didn't happen. What DID happen was the book proceeded to explain to me that being bad at maths wasn't necessarily my fault. Most people, as it turns out, are terrible with numbers. When calculating odds we tend to process with incomplete data and with an irrational relish for fallacies and rhythms in the realm of chance.Mlodinow takes us through the often counter-intuitive maths and history of divining the odds while also using thought exercises to try and connect the fickle ground between knowing and understanding. And the book that handles it's topics well. You may find yourself rereading certain paragraphs more than a few times, but retraining thousands of years of faulty inherited logic was never going to be easier. It's infinitely readable, which is great, because it should be read. This book, or at the very least the total of it's contents, should be forced upon everyone who wishes to engage in public life. It is a book not just about knowing the odds, but about appreciating just how deep they are in every faucet of our lives. Taken the right way the book can act as a liberating filter for one's self perception of the world. Your failures are never entirely your own, nor your successes. Win or lose you are at the whim of a grand and infinitely variable collection of uncertainties. You can never know what lies ahead, but with the right set of tools and the right amount of data you can figure the odds. Which I suppose if you enjoy knowing how unlikely it is you're going to succeed at something, is kind of like playing god. "
51,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26674095-gy,5,"For the start of this brief review that explains the book and our human nature let me quote from the book: A few years ago a man won the Spanish national lottery with a ticket that ended in the number 48. Proud of his “accomplishment,” he revealed the theory that brought him the riches. “I dreamed of the number 7 for seven straight nights,” he said, “and 7 times 7 is 48.”No known higher order of matter in the, by us known chaos (at least looks like that) we call the Universe, than we are! One of the main evolutionary skills of our mind to plan, anticipate, to forecast our everyday life, the outcomes of our actions, had been for millennia our main tool of survival and progress. Our mind that generates our self-model within a world that's surrounds us is working on that way as well. We are the only species capable for long term planning and that's force us to permanently create, apply and if face unknown to search for patterns.On other side however, we live in very dynamic, ever changing environment where the chance, the randomness, the lack of information and time for planning and making decisions are invading our comfort zone every single day, moment of our life.This book is about war between the chaos, chance, randomness, and the living being that can't survive without plans and search for patterns. It is about the way we make choices and the processes that lead us to make mistaken judgments and poor decisions when confronted with randomness or uncertainty.This is Mr. Molodinow's attempt to teach us to the principles that govern chance. Great book, love it and will read it again!"
52,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/270914-diana,3,"A little disappointing. I expected more mathematical examples, but non the less an interesting read. If you've had any experience with statistics, some of the more popular sociological experiments and a basic understanding of human psycological behavior then there are several sections that can be scanned thru. The chapter on false positives; especially in medicine caught my attention in particular. I was pleasantly surprised to read some of the more in depth history of the development of statistics, that isn't something I would have gone out looking for as reading material, so it was nice to get a little more exposure to the development of such a popular mathematical tool. As was the discussion of a dye molecule in a glass in relation to the attack on Pearl Harbor and 9/11.Bottom line . . . Mlodinow is making the case to stop searching for patterns to make sense of one's life, because there truly isn't one. Human perception and interpretation is/ are fallible. It's a all a game of chance, skill, talent, knowledge, location and number of attempts. All play roles but persistence equates to more opportunity to achieve. The same could be said of putting yourself in a position where there is a higher probability of something negative happening. Thought provoking and a great book for someone with little exposure to stats, etc. It's easy to read and a Mlodinow injects some humor throughout the book keeping it light and personable. "
53,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/784513-danielle,4,"Really interesting. I really enjoyed it. Here is my favorite quote from the book, which summarizes the entire theme: ""It is easy to believe that ideas that worked were good ideas, that plans that succeeded were well designed, and that ideas and plans that did not were ill conceived. And it is easy to make heroes out of the most successful and to glance with disdain at the least. But ability does not guarantee achievement, nor is achievement proportional to ability. And so it is important to always keep in mind the other term in the equation—the role of chance."" I'm also reading Outliers right now, which shares the idea of ""success"" not really being as hard-earned as we want to believe. Even among our idols, there's a good deal of luck involved. I like the idea that outward success doesn't really correlate with inherent worth.If you decide to read this book (which I recommend) keep in mind that there's a hefty amount of statistics (in basic layman's terms, but it did call up memories of Stats 105), and also a lot of history about the field of statistics. That being said, Mlodinow does an impressive job of making a dry subject interesting, and I never lost my motivation to keep reading. "
54,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128167-audrey,3,"I wanted to like this book more, and I did enjoy it a lot, but it was somewhat unfocused (and I somewhat doubt that Mlodinow was engaging in performative randomness).If anything, I think ""The Drunkard's Walk"" suffers from trying to be a few too many things at once; I could have done with a bit less biographical information about the mathematicians and statisticians whose work was cited. I also would have liked to see more math and hard numbers, which I suppose is a hard selling point for a book targeted at non-math folk. The case study format falls a bit short of Gladwell, though there are a few interesting examples (and just as many examples I've seen rehashed elsewhere).Overall, I also thought the book was more about statistical analysis and conditional probability than it was about true randomness, as the title and introduction and a lot of the chapter intros kept promising. I'd probably rate this at just above a 3.6, though I'm unmathematically rounding down. I got the sense I would much rather sit down with Mlodinow and have a conversation with him than try to read his at times serendipitous thought-association squashed into linear form. [Disclaimer: Most of my reading of this book took place after 1 a.m., so maybe that skewed my opinions.]"

The first time I read it, I hadn't yet encountered The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference or Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything. On a second read, I discovered just how snarky Mlodinow is about them and their tendency to infer patterns where they may or may not exist. I still think he goes too far, though. Just because randomness is everywhere doesn't mean that there isn't an underlying signal; randomness doesn't imply 50-50....And that's all I'm going to post here.

Whereas Pink caters to the popular manager and corporate slave, this addresses the nitty-gritty more. The writing is interesting and concise, which I perfer in my science books, even if they're pop science. Of course, this book tries to draw you in with the clever title, but doesn't reference it until the last few chapters, when you learn it has to do with Brownian motion. This is much more mathematical than I had anticipated, but so interesting on the points of history and the significance that I'm already putting it on my reread shelf. There's a lot to unpack here, and it deserves more attention. I have a sneaking suspicion that the ebook would be a valuable accompaniment to the audiobook. The narrator is excellent. He kept me going through the history of math notation and calculus, not my favorite subjects, with his diction. So good for this material. Well done! "
57,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5133745-sarah,4,"This is the sexiest book on probability and statistics I have ever read, fo' sho. What the title doesn't tell you is that it is a pretty fascinating look into the lives of mathematicians and statisticians over the ages, as well as a how-to guide for conducting your own experiments (which might come in handy if you have a burgeoning meth habit or have to take a statistics course). I would consider this a ""must read"" for anyone taking probability and statistics, because it breaks everything down into ""knowable"" language and magically makes math seem accessible. Jargon is kept to a minimum or explained and the examples and anecdotes are genuinely entertaining. Though Mlodinow doesn't take us there, the book is radically egalitarian in its political implications, though I thought the book the could be improved if he did a little more to cover the interface between math and psychology (e.g. how expectations influence outcomes, the normalcy bias, etc). Finally, the book gets +10 points for doing ann excellent fakeout at the end, which seems like it is going to be a heartfelt and moralistic stitching, and ends up being a message of doom and gloom of the highest order.

In addition to helping us question how we view events and often assign patterns when none actually exist, I now have a much better understanding of basic statistics. The author even explained the Monty Hall problem in a very understandable manner. Even if you are not a numbers geek, this book will give you a fresh perspective on the world around you and how you link events. With examples from business to sports to entertainment as well as our everyday lives, he makes the underlying analyses come to life. I think he gets a little bit preachy and heavy-handed in his analysis of Donald Trump, but it may be that he fails to go into the underlying info sufficiently - his other examples are much better supported. In listening to the audio version of this book, I was originally wondering why it was part of the Coach-In-A-Box series, but after reading it I think it really does belong there. As to my categorization of the book, I originally classified it only as a non-fiction/interesting book, but I added to my self-help and provocative lists also."

I enjoyed some of the real life stories the author included to articulate a point, but overall I can't believe that everything is pure random chance. I think a person would have to be an atheist, or at least very agnostic, to believe that there is absolutely zero influence in how things happen. I might be wrong (wouldn't be surprising) on that point. I can see how some things are left to chance, but you can greatly increase your chance through various means (be it skill, determination, who you know, etc) and I think the author probably said that, but I interpreted it wrong.Or maybe it's just all due to my confirmation bias. I'd recommend this book to people that already like this sort of thing, but it wasn't for me."

The Drunkard's Walk is an excellent book full of concepts about randomness that every person should try to understand. How humans understand randomness affects every aspect of life. This book was not as exciting as Superfocasting, but surely as worthwhile. Mlodinow presents many interesting examples of randomness that are often seen as meaningful in some way. The meaning we attach to events or information can direct our thought and actions. Since our perception is false, our thoughts and actions that are guided by our perceptions are questionable, and we should absolutely question them. This is simply a great primer for life in general.

And also because of a commentary written by a famous person on the cover of the book (in this case, STEPHEN HAWKING! Most probably that he/she just spent few minutes skimming the book). The problem is that each author copies from others with different titles. The things we read in these books are exactly the same in a basic statistics (or probabilities) course. You'll only benefit from the examples that they provide, not because they are practical but because they are exciting.I recommend not to waste your time with these book. Take a probabilities course which will benefit you more and more."

That's unfortunate because it affects all of our lives on a daily basis. Understanding how probability works is crucial to understanding the interactions and interplay of the many random events that surround our lives. Mlodinow does an amazing job of not just highlighting the ways in which randomness plays out, but also goes into some depth on the mathematical tools that allow us to analyze and comprehend this randomness.I similarly recommend the book ""Fooled by Randomness"" by Nasim Taleb. At first I was worried that this book would simply be a reprise of what I had already read there. While there was some cross-over, the books took different paths and ultimately complemented each other very well."

I especially enjoyed the conversation about why things like obvious after the fact. In this time of great glory of worship that is given to the billionaires, I advise more than ever that people need to understand math and science. When we do not have knowledge of how randomness works in the world, it is easy to give into deterministic beliefs. Hard work is not what causes wealth, and in return wealth does not mean you have worked hard. My favorite Mr. Thomas Hardy described it best when he said that we are judged not by the reasons for our actions, but on the accidental outcomes. ""The need to feel in control interferes with the accurate perception of random events."" "

From the middle of the book on, however, the author thought that it would be a neat idea to see if he could make his book as unreadable as possible. Born without the ability to skim, I read bunches and bunches of words that, whilst I may have understood them when I was a member of my middle school math team, have become less than meaningless to me now.Conclusion: This book is the perfect ""punishment reading"" for all those who say the phrase ""Well, I believe everything happens for a reason"".

While that book went over my head early and often, this book on chance, probability, statistics and randomness was much easier to understand and digest. It is littered with real world examples that are both compelling and illustrative of the mathematical points they were describing. The main concept to take out of The Drunkard's Walk is simple -- results are based on a good deal more random chance than skill, and the only tool we have to make that work for us is hard work and perseverance, as the more often we try, despite failure, the more chances we give ourselves for success."

However, even that is easy to understand, I think that the reader must have some basic maths or even statistics to fully understand the book. The person can read the book entirely by only believing on what the authors says, but if you want to prove some concepts, you will have to do some basic calculations.

Where this was the focus I thought the book was great: aspects like false positive HIV tests and film studio performance, for example. For this reason I enjoyed the final two chapters vastly more than the rest of the book. Trevor wrote an incredibly comprehensive review which sums it all up nicely. 2.5 stars, rounded down."

But really, it's about understanding probability and how our minds create pattern and order sometimes when none exist. Sometimes you can do things that favor your chances if you know what are the factors that can contribute to improving your chances. There is also a lot of information about the development of these theories and a lot of stories of how those theories are applied.

In other words, why some people play the lottery, or avoid flying on airplanes, etc. this book exposes the fascinating history of the development of the math behind statistics, and the modern misunderstandings of probability. A quote, Francis Bacon put it in 1620, “the human understanding, once it has adopted an opinion, collects any instances that confirm it, and though the contrary instances may be more numerous and more weighty, it either does not notice them or else rejects them, in order that this opinion will remain unshaken.”"

Each delves science and history to present new ways of understanding how things work. This books focuses on randomness and presents a study of how our understanding of it has evolved and how it continues to do so. Though the narrative can get bogged down in stretches of mathematics or statistics, it's an entertaining and very intelligent read. I now get to kid myself into thinking I'm smarter, though statistics won't bear that out. Recommended for any fans of these types of books."

99,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5602354-radek-sienkiewicz,4,"I have an interest in numbers and in how the mind works. I've read a lot on both topics. Randomness has surprisingly a lot in common with both.Maybe my interest in these topics is deeper than the average person's, or maybe the book was intentionally basic enough and with limited math elements so that it could be catered to the general public. In any case, I haven't found much new in the book in terms of concepts, probability, statistics.It had only the very basic concepts explained and didn't go into many details. For example, it mentioned only normal distribution, out of all possible distributions, and made it feel like it's practically the only one and all-powerful. Far from it.It had a lot of history about how concepts related to randomness were discovered, also many anecdotes about scientists and celebrities, past and present. That was entertaining, even if not very useful.There's also a lot about the way people think, make decisions and act rationally or irrationally, and how randomness plays a factor in it. That was interesting but because I've already read a lot about decision making, there was practically nothing new for me on this topic. What's more, I feel like every book on decision making is only a shadow or a derivative of ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman.A few random pieces from the book that I found interesting or memorable:* People are bad at estimating probability and randomness. Even when it's their profession. Even when they're told that they're bad at it. Even when they're told in which way they make mistakes, by how much and why.* We vastly underestimate how often we label someone or something as failure or success when in fact it was mostly caused by randomness (movies, CEOs, market analysts, actors, etc.)* Human brain always needs to find a reason. Something happens and the brain doesn't stop until it finds the reason why. Even if there's no reason at all, pure chance.* People equate money with wisdom.* There was an interesting experiment connecting a few concepts mentioned above (randomness, the need to find a reason, equating money with wisdom): Participants were playing a game of chance (e.g. coin flipping) and were told that they will be paid money for it. The goal was to guess as many coin flips correctly as possible, as a team. During the game, participants could try to persuade each other to change the guess. When participants were paid the same amount for the experiment, their decision-changing rate was the same. But when (based on a random choice) one was paid 3 times more than the other, the one who was paid more suddenly was much more reluctant to change his mind. The thinking goes: ""There's a reason I earn more money. It's because I'm smarter. This means I know better and I won't be persuaded by someone less smart who earns less"". Even though both participants knew in advance that who gets paid more was chosen randomly.The biggest takeaway and learning from the book: Take more shots. The more you take, the better the chance of succeeding, even if by sheer luck. And if you've won, don't gloat. If you've lost, don't despair. Both could be determined by random forces. Just take another shot."

Casinos are full of people who don’t realize that, in the long run, the house always wins. People who play the lotteries can buy lists of numbers that have recently come up regularly and so are ‘hot,’ or they can buy lists of numbers that have not come up recently and are ‘due.’ And none of them are worth the paper they are printed on.This book is about randomness, about learning how to interpret the probabilities we encounter in our daily lives. Mlodinow illustrates his points with interesting stories, some of which demonstrate how badly we can mislead ourselves when we decide to ‘trust our gut.’ Humans have a remarkable ability to see patterns, but are often led astray by thinking there is a pattern when in fact it is just random noise. The stock market technique called Technical Analysis is a good example of this, yet many people today still swear by it.It is surprising how many important decisions are made based on faulty statistical thinking. We call football coaches and CEOs geniuses when they show great short-term results, without pausing to wonder whether they are simply the result of random fluctuations, and fire them when the same short term variations turn downward. If you ever have to listen to a bore at a dinner party drone on about the ‘nose’ of the wine, about its beguiling, earthy notes of acidic red and black berries with insouciant undertones of vanilla and sandalwood…..and on and on and on, just smile and think ‘humbug,’ knowing that wine descriptions are about as accurate, and about as repeatable, as horoscopes. Just adding red food coloring to white wine is enough to flummox even supposed experts. Neither you nor anyone else can really tell the difference between a $6 bottle of wine and a $60 one, so just buy the cheap stuff and l’chaim. Similarly, vodka is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. Get that: tasteless. Expensive vodka does not taste any more tasteless than the cheap stuff, and yet, in 2017 Americans spent $6.2 billion on it, much of that on the high end brands. Vodka drinkers should save their money and enroll in Statistics 101.If you ever encounter Monty Hall and he asks if you want to change the door you have chosen – do it. Mlodinow has a whole chapter explaining this, but rather than get into the details, just accept that your odds of winning increase if you change doors.This book is not heavy on math, and the use of examples makes it easily accessible by anyone. It is a fun read, and informative to boot. We would all be healthier and wealthier if we had a better grasp of the probabilities that affect our everyday lives.And lastly, here is a quote from the Scottish poet Andrew Lang (it’s not in the book), “He uses statistics as a drunken man uses lamp posts—for support rather than illumination.” Keep that in mind when politicians start throwing around numbers."
101,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46538050-lance,4,"""Interpreting the role of chance in an event is not like interpreting a Rorschach blot; there right and wrong ways to do it.""I have been interested in this book since seeing it on the bookshelf of renowned neuroscientist Professor Gero Meisenboeck when I did my bachelor's project under him (*just let me pick up that name I dropped*), but as with all good things in life, I was finally spurred on to read the book when my beautiful husband took it out from the Reading University library this year.I really enjoyed the read. The coverage of basic statistics and probability was incredibly clear despite Mlodinow's choice not to use equations. He covered the history succinctly and with great wit from the theistic determinism of the classical era: ""'The Greeks held the geometer in the highest honour. We have established the usefuleness of the art of mathematics in measuring and counting.'"" through the turbulent life of Gerolammo Cardanno and his strange social context of being on the edge of the scientific revolution. ""Of course, to a mathematician a blunder is an issue of embarrassment, but to a gambler it is an issue of livelihood."" It was interesting to see that practical uses were the first motivations for the study of probability. Jakob Bermoulli created a method of judging the validity of a representative sample size, but his naive notion that achieving 99.9% confidence intervals might be practical prevented the work from coming into common use. Many scientists noticed their data followed a certain distribution and it was the behemoth Gauss who is credited with taking the step towards practical probability of investigating the normal distribution curve. I particularly enjoyed Mlodinow's example-driven descriptions of Bayesian analysis, conditional probability remains a concept which even many scientists are warily ignorant of. It was really interesting to here that such work was turned with enthusiasm to social planning and an attempt to predict data on crime, health and many other social factors. ""Quetelet recognised that l'homme moyen would be different for different culture and that it could change with changing social conditions."" This idea of ""normal man"" now seems vacuuous and somewhat disturbing, but without the intersection of statistics and social factors, what would have become of the field of psychology?""Although statistical regularities can be found in social data, predicting the future of any individual person is almost impossible.""I was particularly impressed by the psychology chapters. The fallicies of human thought processes are broad and varied, and the study of our consistent misinterpretation of randomness is a large field within psychology. ""If the details we are given fit our mental picture of something, then the more details in the scenario then the more real it seems and hence the more probable we consider it to be."" Educated people have been known to make logical contradictions on tests as simple as deciding whether words ending in ""ing"" or with ""n"" as the second-last letter are more common. We also trust anecdotal evidence and credit histories of recent success more than is mathematically reasonable. ""The misconception - or the mistaken intuition - that a small sample accurately reflects underlying probabilities is so widespread that Kahneman and Tversky gave it a name: the law of small numbers."" This requirement to uphold the illusion of control over our lives seems to be integral to good mental health. ""Disturbingly, eighteen-months later a follow up study shocked researchers: the group that was not given control experienced a death rate of 30% whereas the group that were given control experienced a death rate of only 15%."" There are many, many ways in which understanding human behaviour cannot be achieve without first understanding why our intuiition of randomness is so poor. ""When we perform an assessment or measurement, our brains do not rely on direct perceptual input. They also integrate other sources of information - such as our expectation."" Whether it's being beaten by rats on reward-driven tests because we think we can predict totally random sequences, crediting the financial market with more causality than is reasonable given past performance, or deciding that the one time you bought your son a cuddly horse is the reason he turned out gay (it was not Ed's fault, okay), chance holds the key to understanding so much of life and getting to feel smug when you see random events for what they are!""'No one has ever found a method of producing randomness that's any better than throwing a dice, and throwing a dice just won't do.'"""

The author gave some great examples and explanations of how things go randomly and why they are misperceived. The book also gave me some new insights and and a bit of understanding. However, it wasn't enough for me. It might be because I had high expectations, or because I had been thinking about this subject a lot recently and already knew a decent amount of the concepts and subjects he talked about, but I didn't get as much out of this book as I would have thought. I wish it would have gone deeper. Some of the examples he gave were really interesting, but it felt like he just skimmed over them, gave the basic explanation and then went on. For example, at one point he talked about Nero's paradox, and to properly understand the solution, I felt the need to google it. I'm still not sure I understand. I know this wasn't the point of the book, but it would've been nice if I didn't need external sources to understand what was explained. On the other hand, I felt as though it didn't cover enough. Although very interesting, I didn't foresee the amount math-history there was in the book. I also expected it to be more about how randomness rules OUR lives, including my own, but it mainly focussed on exceptional cases.I'm not trying to say the book wasn't great, which it was, but it didn't fully meet my expectations. I would recommend this book, just know what you're in for. If you're already familiar with the Monty Hall problem, Nero's paradox, confirmation bias and such, this might not be as mind-bending as you might have hoped for."
103,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1829065-mike,4,"Almost completely rewriting this. I'm not changing my rating; this really is a great book on an important subject. Random phenomenon are everywhere, and humans don't understand them well. We're not wired to understand them well. This book is a huge help, and will be a relief to anyone who's heard people say ""Well, I don't believe in global warming because last winter we got a lot of snow,"" or some load of crap like that. It's well written; there's a lot of storytelling; the storytelling fun and interesting. Along the way it gives coherent explanations of Bayes' theorem, the Monty Hall problem (simplest correct explanation I've ever seen), the origins of statistics and more. If you want an excellent non-mathematical introduction to probabilistic thinking, this is the book to get.But there's always a but. But, but, but...I have two problems with this book. They've been nagging me ever since I finished. First, Mlodinow spends a lot of time debunking the notion of ""hot streaks."" He's right, and that's important: most hot streaks in sports and elsewhere can be adequately explained by randomness. Randomness is inherently streaky and clumpy; it's not just a smooth gray. In fact, if you get something that looks smooth and ""random,"" it's almost certainly not random. So far, so good. BUT--when he moves from Roger Maris' record-breaking season to portfolio managers picking hot stocks, there's a fundamental asymmetry. With Maris, the author starts with the long-term batting average. We're not just ""flipping coins""; we're flipping a weighted coin, a coin that happens to land with the ""home run"" side facing up a lot frequently than it would if I were in the batter's box. That's all well and good; if I faced a season's worth of professional baseball pitching, I daresay I wouldn't get a single hit, let alone any home runs. But--and this is important--he doesn't do the same for the stock pickers, book acquisition editors, or Hollywood movie execs that he talks about. For them, it's just flipping coins. And it's one thing to say that, if you just flipped coins for 10 years, you'd have a 75% chance of duplicating a great financial manager's performance. It's another thing to imply that the manager's performance is just a matter of luck, not skill. Yes, there is a lot of luck involved, but where's the notion of baseline performance, of long term success or failure, that was the starting point for analyzing Maris' hot year? Maris' hot year may have been a random phenomenon, but it was a random phenomenon in the context of a lifetime .358 batting average. What's the stock picker's lifetime batting average? We never find out. And that's a big part of the story to omit.Second, he frequently forgets one of the most important aspects of the mathematical study of random processes. When we're talking probability and statistics, we're talking about interchangeable events. It's easy to forget this, but as Mlodinow himself points out, there are many, many ways to make important mistakes when you're talking about probability. The important thing about urns with black and white balls is that the balls are the same. (If you don't know about urns, take a probability course or read the book; they're baked into the history of probability theory.) If some of the balls were ovals and some were star-shaped, these probability experiments wouldn't work. So, back again to the stock pickers, the acquisitions editors, and the Hollywood execs. We agree at some level that all at-bats in baseball are equivalent. This is, of course, an idealization, but it's one we're fairly comfortable with. But all stocks are NOT the same, all books are NOT the same, and all movies are NOT the same. They may be the same within a certain class (energy stocks, cheap romance novels, spy movies). A stock analyst who's good with financials may have nothing to say about manufacturing. But at the high end of the spectrum (literary novels, fine wines, art movies), everything is unique, precisely in a way that Harlequin romances aren't. Probability and statistics are still powerful tools, but you have to be very careful about how you apply them.Since I'm in the publishing business, I'm particularly annoyed by the story of an editor who, in an experiment, was given a typewritten chapter of a V. S. Naipaul novel that had won a major award. She rejected it. I'm not a fan of Naipaul, so I'm sympathetic. But is that evidence of her editorial skill (or lack thereof), or of random processes? Since we're now in a world where every event is unique we have to ask more questions: what publisher was she working for? Grove Press, which publishes top drawer literary fiction with a tendency towards the avant garde (for whom Naipaul might have been too stodgy)? Or Bantam, which specialized in lightweight beach-side reading? In both cases, a rejection would have been perfectly appropriate. Probability aside, it's a cheap shot to say ""Because this book won a major award, we'd expect editors at a publishing company to accept it. If they don't, that's evidence that publishing is a random process."" Publishing (and movies, and wines, and maybe even stocks) are a different world, and the disagreements are precisely what is important. Modelling disagreement as random fluctuation isn't doing anyone a service. I may dislike Naipaul's fiction, but I hardly see that as a random result. We could ask about the conditional probability that an English major will dislike Naipaul, given that he has plays piano, has a strong background in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics, and likes Rushdie, and come up with some sort of number, but I'd have no idea what that number means. We're not picking black and white balls out of urns here--or if we are, the balls are of different shapes and sizes.Am I just going back to the human tendency to build stories where there is nothing but randomness? Am I just refusing to deal with the stark realities of random phenomenon that surround us everywhere? Perhaps. Then again, that's what makes us human. And in the many situations where probability and statistics aren't appropriate tools, such as picking books or movies, then all we have to fall back on is our ability to make stories, our ability to make sense. Where ""make"" is precisely the most important word in that last sentence. "
104,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71312811-jaker,4,"This book can be separated into three parts: theoretical knowledge, history and real life analysis. First part: the author explained to the readers the basic knowledge of probability, how they are used in real life, and the ways that people can misuse them.  Second: the author led us through the development of probability through the greats that developed the theory. The author builder up theories mentioned earlier on in the book and painted an exquisite “paint by numbers” artwork. Third: the author went more of our unpredictable and society of randomness. Of how we can always analyze the past, but that doesn’t always mean that we can predict the future, and how ability of a man isn’t directly correlated of what he did, and what a man did doesn’t always mean that he has much ability.The author made this book so interesting and convincing because of how he intertwined theoretical probability with our own lives, which also makes it easy to understand.The main idea I took away from this book is that randomness rules our life in ways that we don’t even know, yet it plays a big part on our successes and failures. Yet our ability is still a main part of what kind of life we live. We can’t blame randomness for our entire failure, nor can we give it all the credit.It’s because of our different clashes of ideas and unpredictable actions that makes this world so interesting, full of surprises. And so random."
105,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45472407-julia,5,"The Drunkard's Walk is so much more than a book about statistics. Mlodinow takes each big concept and tells the histories that led up to its creation. Because in math and science it's all about building upon the last idea, this took the big concepts that were hard to wrap my mind around in statistics class and made them less scary and easier to comprehend how each mathematician came to the conclusions that they did. But Mlodinow doesn't stop there, He shows the real life applications of each statistical concept. This is more than just endless math problems about flipping coins and drawing playing cards. Each concept of randomness that he explores explains why we think the way that we do and how industries are shaped by randomness and it's effects. This is a book that everyone should read because when you understand where the flaws in your own thinking are, you can learn to exploit them. Mlodinow is my favorite science author and this is another one of his books I will end up reading again and again. "

While it presents statistical analysis and examples of perceptions of chance in day-to-day life in an easily consumable fashion, I still won’t really say it’s a finish-in-one-sitting kind of book. I did need to mull over a few things it went over. I particularly liked that it drove home the point that even random is actually ‘normal’. Outliers are part of what makes the entire distribution a normal one, which makes them not out of the ordinary either. Just less likely. This actually helped me apply these thoughts to my actual life and how I perceive negative and positive events (like one of the last few chapters goes into) and that in the grand scheme of things, a lot of your experiences are shaped out of luck. I tend to struggle with the notion of whether or not someone is completely in control of their destiny and understanding that they are only in control FOR THE MOST PART is humbling and oddly comforting because it feels like you have a partner, even though they may be a silent wildcard.

Also, it gets compounded by knowing that humans are not skilled to recognize the best outcome path in the wake of a situation.

121,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"Being a nerd, I love math. Years after my undergrad, I stool noodle around with new mathematics tools, like SageNB and Wolfram Alpha. But it takes a book like this to help an educated, well-read person like myself to see how these concepts apply to reality. This book does an admirable job of presenting both the history of and concepts behind probability and statistics.The only reason why it rates only 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found the coverage in the statistics part of the book lacking. Perhaps it suffers in comparison to the captivating way that probability was described. But, perhaps that is just due to the fact that statistics is, ultimately, a more difficult subject to describe conceptually.I also want to point to some other ""social science"" books that show similar rigor and have changed my attitude over the past few years.* The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives: A physicist walks the reader through both the history and application of probability and statistics to real-life scenarios. A bit theoretical, but fascinating. From a peer-reviewed PhD. * The Authoritarians: A look at ""Authoritarians,"" a statistically verifiable classification of human beings. Authoritarians, contrary to expectations due to the label,are blind followers. The tend to be closed minded and dogmatic, and fail to apply logic of their convictions to situation. Think of conservative Christians huddling behind certain economic principles, like lauding economic leaders and dismantling the social safety net, which run contrary to the scriptures (""It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven"" and ""the poor of spirit...shall inherit the kingdom of God...""). Also a chilling discussion of manipulative ""Authoritarian Leaders"" who exploit these masses by using catch phrases to gain and maintain power. From a peer-reviewed PhD. * Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets: Another interesting take on the role of chance (or ""luck"") in success. The author applies ""Monte Carlo"" logic to illustrate the it is very conceivable that chance alone will have some incompetent leaders rise to the top.* The Halo Effect: Applications of honest, peer reviewed science to the business press. From a peer-reviewed PhD. * Everything is Obvious: Once You Know the Answer: The most thorough discussion I have come across so far of applying disciplined mathematical/ disciplined logic to sociology and economic outcomes. From a peer-reviewed PhD. * Outliers: The Story of Success: Gladwell is an engaging writer who really makes you think and question long-held notions about luck, skill and practice in this book. But please bear this in mind when reading this: a lot of the statistical reasoning in this book is inaccurate. Still, I really enjoy the way that Gladwell raises intriguing questions.* Twenty-Three Things They Don't Tell You about Capitalism: Amazing, thought provoking book that takes clear aim at misleading ""free market"" claims. From a peer-reviewed PhD."
122,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394552-keith-akers,4,"This book is not really about randomness as such, but about what I would call statistics and probability. (O. K., a semantic distinction, but to me randomness has a connotation of ""why was I born?"" type of stuff.) It's actually a fairly sophisticated book with quite a bit of difficult concepts that I still don't quite understand. It's well written; you can keep reading even if you don't quite get one point or another. Also, there's essentially no math in it at all. Well, there's some math: you need to know about exponents, about fractions, that kind of thing, and there's even one reference to the ""chi squared"" test of statistical correlation. But he never explains what this chi squared test is, nor does he expect you to understand it, it's just a landmark along the way. I'm unfamiliar with statistics and so, quite honestly, I don't quite know how to rate the book. An expert on statistics would be a better choice, because they could tell you what the author covered and what they left out.So the first test that this book passes is that it is well written, and it is not sequential -- you can go to the next chapter, generally, even if you didn't completely understand the previous chapter. However, the weakness of the book is that you're never completely sure what you've covered. But if the author had addressed this weakness, it would be more of a textbook, and probably not nearly as interesting, so this ""weakness"" might be a ""strength"" depending on how you look at it. To really understand this book and its strengths and weaknesses, I'd need to read it a second time, looking for basic themes and making sure I understood everything before proceeding further. On the other hand, it was not just an episodic book with no underlying themes at all. There was a connection, and that connection was different people trying to understand what different results actually mean for the underlying reality. I liked the history of statistics in understanding errors in scientific measurement. A lot of statistics, evidently, just arose in the attempt to understand experimental error, but then it turned out to be a tool for understanding the unknown as well. In this case, the differing results were all the results of experimental error, there was a single underlying constant (and non-random) reality underneath. One concept I still don't understand is ""sample space"" and involves the celebrated case of choosing a prize from three doors which hide either something worthless (say, a goat) or very valuable (say, a new car). You choose randomly, but then the master of ceremonies then opens one of the unchosen doors, revealing a goat, and on top of that offers to let you change your choice to the third door if you wish. Acting strictly on probabilities, should you switch or not? I would have been among the many who would have said ""it doesn't matter, your chances are fifty-fifty either way."" Well, if that's what you think, you need to read this book. While I now understand the logic that it is actually a better strategy, on average, to switch, I still don't quite understand the concept of ""sample space."" (This particular example is easier to understand if you envision a million doors. You choose one door, figuring one in a million chance might still be possible, but then the master of ceremonies opens 999,998 other doors, revealing all goats. Should you switch? In this case, definitely, it's the difference between a one in a million chance and near-certainty of getting the car. The ""sample space"" has dramatically changed.) So, basically, I recommend this book for amateurs such as myself. If I ever get more deeply into statistics (as appears likely at some point) it will be a useful guide down the path. But if you need to know what the ""chi squared"" test is, you'll need to look elsewhere. "
123,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7896718-patrick,3,"In The Drunkard's Walk, Leonard Mlodinow writes in a very plain and cogent style, and his mathematical expertise is impeccable. He explains probability theory with unmatched clarity and accuracy. (He does gloss over a few technical points here and there, but one can hardly blame him for doing so in popular works.)	His vision of the world is very similar to Nassib Nicholas Taleb's (The Black Swan): Life is randomness, everything is chaos, so we might as well go with the flow. And unlike Taleb who scorns academia, Mlodinow has a keen grasp of the cutting edge in scholarship on probability. What's more, I think that this vision of the world may be a necessary corrective to an overly deterministic view that many people seem to hold, especially when they talk about “God's plan” (but even when they talk about the laws of nature). Ironically I think that people like Mlodinow and Taleb (and to a lesser extent Malcom Gladwell, Outliers) can only feel comfortable in their vision of a random world because they have been so very fortunate. For those of us who haven't (yet?) succeeded in our lives, the idea that there is nothing we can do to change our odds is nothing short of terrifying.But on the other hand, it's worth pointing out just how wrong this worldview really is, and how deeply unsettling it would be if it were true. The universe is not a teeming mass of random disorganized phenomena; if it were we wouldn't even exist, much less be able to study probability. If life really were completely random, it would be meaningless—indeed, it's not clear that we could coherently talk about “life” at all in such a world. 	To be fair, Mlodinow does not appear to really think that the world is completely random; but sometimes he speaks as if he does. The subtitle of the book is “How randomness rules our lives”—rules? Not affects, not influences, not changes, but rules? Why even bother writing a book, or going to college, or doing anything at all, if randomness really rules your life?	His main piece of advice is perseverance: Keep pushing toward your goals, even when they seem too far to reach. In general I would say this is good advice, and it's advice I wish I were better at following. All glory be to the Law of Large Numbers, our blind idiot god.	But notice that the idea of playing the odds in this way, persevering in the face of failure, taking smart risks, etc., only works on one very big condition: You must have some control over how you play. If life and death were just a drunkard's walk, we wouldn't satisfy that condition, and there would be literally nothing we could do to affect our lives for better or worse. 	In reality, I've noticed a rather disturbing asymmetry: There are a million ways to ruin your life (or end your life), but not nearly as many ways to improve it. Hence, even when you realize that there are a lot of random events outside your control that can affect what happens to you, you can't use that as license to be irresponsible. It would be easy to guarantee your own death. The trick is guaranteeing survival, which nobody has yet managed to do. 	Most people, indeed, are basically rational, and are doing most of what they ought to be doing. Not all—my career plan is to study the deviations from this trend—but most. If you are smarter or more careful, you can in fact do better. But only a little better, and with no guarantees. Yet this does not mean that your choices are irrelevant, for it's spectacularly easy to do spectacularly worse.	In other words, life is not a game of chess but it is not a game of craps. It's a game of blackjack: A lot of luck is involved, but strategy can make all the difference. The key, therefore, is to count cards: Understand what is random and what is predictable, and use strategy to improve your odds. "
124,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/534526-robert,4,"An interesting look at how human intuition, which is amazing at helping us learn and understand some situations, can fall very short in other situations.If we know that a family has two children and that one of the children is a girl, what is the probability that the other child is a girl? The quick, obvious answer of 50% is wrong. Very wrong.Mlodinow discusses this and other popular probability questions (Monty Hall problem of a prize behind one of three doors) as well as some less known probability issues.One example of misleading probability takes place in the O.J. Simpson trial. The prosecution argued that O.J. was a known abuser of his wife. Alan Dershowitz, the defense attorney, countered that of the 4 million women abused annually, only 1,432 of these women were murdered in 1992, so the chances that O.J. murdered his wife were only 1 in 2,500. The jury bought it, and for this an other reasons ruled him innocent. The prosecution should have countered with the correct statistical analysis that of all the women murdered in 1993, 90% of them were killed by their abuser.I loved his discussion of winning the lottery. He asks if anyone would be willing to play the lottery if it were set up such that a ""loser"" who had the same odds of winning would be condemned to die. And yet the odds of being killed in a car accident on the way to buy lottery tickets are twice as high as winning the lottery.We are very good at ascribing meaning to events and patterns we encounter in our life. This can be helpful at times, but can lead to great errors in judgement. Mlodinow lays out a number of these errors and misunderstandings in the sports and business worlds. He pulls a lot of history into the mix as well, describing how probability theory evolved over the years through gambling, mathematics and census taking.His arguments and well-documented research ring much more sound to me than a lot of popular books on economics and human psychology; he's not combative about it, but he does seem to throw down on the likes of Gladwell & Freakonomics.At one point in his life, Mlodinow tested positive for HIV. His doctor told him that since the test was 99.9% accurate, there was a very good chance he would be dead in a few years. I guess this is a common, but false, conclusion. For the sample set of heterosexual non-illegal drug taking men, of which Mlodinow was a member, the chances of contracting HIV is about 1 in 10,000. This means that if 10,000 men were randomly selected and tested for HIV, then 11 would test positive: 10 would be false positives (99.9% accuracy) and 1 would actually have HIV. So Mlodinow's chances of being dead from HIV were much closer to 1 in 11 (9.1%) rather than 999 in 1000 (99.9%) as his doctor led him to believe. It turns out he didn't have HIV.Although Mlodinow never speaks to this point, a lot of people take the arguments for randomness as arguments against God. I take them as the opposite. I believe that God has set up this world such that randomness and failure are simply part of life's experience. I believer God can work in that randomness to show us his love and tender mercies.The moral of this book is to not give up. Mlodinow gives multiple examples of how people who have made it big did so by chance and perseverance rather than strictly talent and ability. If so much of success is random, then the more we try, the more likely we are to succeed. We'll fail 100% of the times we don't try.""The cord that tethers ability to success is both loose and elastic."" (p216)Page Turner: 8/10Honest: 8/10Intelligent: 9/10Uplifting: 7/10"
125,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17709230-winston-jen,5,"The Power of PersistenceWe humans are notorious pattern-seeking creatures. In experiments where two lights are flashed with differing frequencies, human test subjects attempt to predict the pattern. Rats, however, will simply pick the light that appears more often. In so doing, they will outperform the most intelligent species on the planet.In a similar vein, even experts cannot predict the success of books or films submitted for publishing. JK Rowling suffered numerous setbacks before her Harry Potter series was finally adopted, earning very handsome sums for her, Bloomsbury and Warner Brothers pictures. So too for Bruce Willis and Bill Gates. Anne Frank's diary was initially treated with similar derision. While hindsight is often (claimed) to be 20/20, foresight is notoriously unreliable, as Mlodinow illustrates in the latter half, after describing statistical significance and the bell curve. Most people do not expect clusters; they think patterns will inevitably reveal themselves in any random distribution. This is, obviously, not the case. Random events, by definition, cannot be predicted (at least not with our current technology).The counter-intuitive and hard-to-grasp nature of probability doesn't stop there. Studies have shown that ordinary citizens not trained in probability are quite prone to simple errors. For example, if they are asked whether it is more likely that Jane, a woman in her 20s, is a feminist, or both a feminist and an elementary school teacher, most will answer that the latter is more likely. The latter, in fact, is a mathematical impossibility. It can only be equally likely, not more likely, than the former. Part of the difficulty lies in the sheer number of possibilities for any given situation, such as the risk of a single valve in a fission reactor leading to a meltdown. Since valves are open quite often, a single valve is likely to be considered par for the course. It is also why the phrase ""military intelligence"" is frequently treated with scorn. Although in hindsight the decision to leave Pearl Harbor be, due to its solid defensive emplacements, politics inevitably leads to finger-pointing and blame games.Trial by mathematics can lead to the innocent being convicted, especially since the wrong probabilities are often used (i.e. where the number of inter-racial couples in a city who own a certain car, vs. the number of total couples in that same city). Likewise, the Monte-Hall problem (using a gameshow where a contestant can win a goat or a car) had the world's top mathematicians making a simple blunder, unwilling to accept their error until seeing it demonstrated in a computer simulation (for more details, watch the film 21).Regression towards the mean is explained through genetics (shorter parents are more likely to have children who outgrow them, and vice versa. A recurring method for keeping things interesting is the continual use of brief biographies peppered throughout the book. Even the Greeks and Romans get a smattering of compliments and criticism (for instance, they had no concept of zero, and irrational numbers were thought to be too dangerous for the common populace). I especially enjoyed the tale of the mathematician who took Las Vegas casinos for a very costly ride, with some assistance from his students.This book is a great way to make complex mathematics fun, and you won't have to cramp your hands while you do it!"
126,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6865942-claire,3,"In this book, Mlodinow argues that in the majority of cases, successes and failures that have been attributed the clear causes are actually more likely to be influenced by chance. He gives us the anecdotal evidences of Bill Gates and Bruce Willis, both in the right place at the right time to launch their careers. I am one hundred percent with him on this. You can do certain things to put yourself in the right place at the right time, but such a lot of my own personal successes are down to luck rather than judgement, I cannot disagree with him.The first half of the book deals with various scholars from years gone by and their theories on probability. This dragged a little for me, I am much more interested in the theories than the theoriser's biographies, so I admit I skimmed a little here. Also, my work background has given me plenty of experience in calculating probabilities and making decisions under uncertainty so I am pretty familiar with the theory on this subject.There are some nice stories in this book that illustrate a lot of Mlodinow's points. There is one about a syndicate who calculated the return on an investment of buying every single lottery ticket in one US State in one week would be more than 300% so they attempted to do just that. There is another about a fifth century Greek philosopher called Zeno who said that if we want to travel anywhere we must traverse an infinite number of finite distances, which would take an infinite amount of time, therefore we never get anywhere. While I read this book I was also listening to Douglas Adams reading me his fabulous Restaurant at the End of the Universe (not at the exact same time, though, audio books are for walking the dogs to). Adams takes this a step further by saying that there are an infinite number of planets in the solar system with a finite number of beings on each one, therefore there population of the universe is zero. There is a mind-boggling point about false positives in medical testing, where he tells us of the time when he get a false positive result for an HIV test. As he points out, the test that will be 100% successful in finding all cases of a disease will simply produce a positive result in 100% of the tests. He then compares hedge funds with coin-tossing, which I have to take points from him for doing, as an ex-trading analyst who truly believe that there is at least some skill in all that stuff.So, this is the sort of popular science book that I like. There are new, challenging and thought-provoking ideas in here, told in a simple and clear way, with a few lovely anecdotes that I can steal.

128,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8178073-nettlesandburrs,4,"A very interesting book that explored chance and how randomness affects your life. Random chance has a much greater impact on our lives than we think. The mind is very poorly equipped to deal with uncertanity and randomness. Instead, our minds are hardwired to find patterns, often finding 'patterns' in random data when there can be none and leading us astray as a consequence. This gets so bad that rats outperform humans at dealing with random data.The section on interpreting medical data (chances of a treatment being successful, chances that you have HIV if a test comes back positive, etc.) is eye-opening. It took me a few reads to understand it but it seem almost everyone (and especially medical professionals) misinterpret what numbers actually mean.The book also sheds light on why experts are so often wrong - the causes of an event are very obvious in hindsight but it is impossible before an event occurs to interpret all causing factors and draw a conclusion, thus leading to signs of the attack on Pearl Harbour or the 9/11 attacks being ignored before they occurred while they seem obvious in hindsight. Many events are governed by random processes and are very unpredictable no matter what pundits may proclaim.While we like to think talented people rise to the top, it is likely that many (maybe even most) successful CEO's, sportspersons, actors, and politicians got to where they are simply through random chance (which is not the same as luck). It seems the best way to be successful is to be persistent till some proverbial coin toss lands in your favour.While we like to think of ourselves in control of our destiny, it is very likely that random events have had a much bigger role in shaping your life than your own actions. This was a very entertaining book and I recommend it to anyone trying to make sense of this crazy world."
129,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1656457-trip,4,"To get to its core idea, this book passes through basic probability theory, human cognitive shortcomings, the history of probability theory, biographical anecdotes of mathematicians, and the Monty Hall problem, but it does finally end up at ""The cord that tethers ability to success is both loose and elastic."" (p216). It's easy to see patterns in what has already happened, and construct narratives about how successes are due to personal virtues of those who succeeded and failures due to personal flaws, but in fact the amount of randomness in the world is so large and the small number of data points a person can gather in life so small that it's only to be expected that someone will turn out to have a long winning or losing streak.I suppose this could be seen as depressing, but on the other hand, HA! IN YOUR FACE divine right of kings social Darwinist Republicans!Er, sorry about that. Anyway, something else that Mlodinow points out is that if success is more random than one would like, the best way to get a success is to keep trying. This accords well with other information I've seen indicating that persistence is far more important than ""talent"" or ""intelligence"" (whatever those are).Recommended soundtrack: Roll the Bones, Rush."
130,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1661891-jeff,3,"Overall, I liked ""The Drunkard's Walk"" quite a bit, but I don't recommend it for everyone. If you liked ""The Tipping Point"" or ""Freakonomics"" you may like this book, but it was a little heavier on math and felt a little more like a textbook than those other two. It started well and ended well, but the middle was a little long on history and minutiae.What I did like about this book was how it delved into the existence of randomness in our daily lives, and the human difficulty in understanding probability and randomness. The human brain, through evolution, has not evolved in a way to make quick decisions on probability. The brain is more attuned to recognizing immediate threats and trying to identify new patterns. We are pretty good at the former, but not so much on the latter. We give too much weight to occurrences that are quite possibly, or even very likely, random.These issues have been of interest to me for quite a long time, as I often yell at the television when I hear meaningless statistics touted as meaningful, as well as arguing with aquaintances when they try to make a case for serendipity or horoscopes. I would highly recommend the book to anyone who thinks like this and has some interest in math, but not to many others."
131,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/763730-stewart,5,"Leonard Mlodinow is an unusual writer: He has a doctorate in physics from the University of California-Berkeley and he wrote for ""Star Trek: The Next Generation."" This combination of expertise and writing skills came in handy when he wrote ""The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives."" His assertions are well-documented (16 pages of notes) and made more interesting by examples from everyday life. Mlodinow is not saying we have NO control over our lives, but he cautions us that much of our success and failure in our lives can be attributed to causes beyond our control. ""And so the first step is to realize that success and failure sometimes arises neither from great skill nor from great incompetence but from, as the economist Armen Alchian wrote, 'from fortuitous circumstances.'"" Mlodinow looks at polls and wine ratings and shows that they are often of limited usefulness and sometimes meaningless. He also cites team and individual streaks in sports and investment advice and demonstrates that success is determined as much by chance as skill. The book should teach its readers to be humble about success and stoic about failure -- and to take polls and ratings with several grains of salt. "
132,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/674173-dave,5,"I think this book gave me a whole new perspective on life. I've always felt that if things were good, that meant that things were destined to be bad. So when things were good I got nervous that things were about to get bad. This is sort of proved in the example of regression to the mean, but what I confused myself into believing is that the mean is zero. The mean is not necessarily zero. However, more than likely life is just a series of events that are goverened by mostly random chance. What I take from this is that if something is good, it doesn't necessarily mean that something bad will happen. And if something bad does happen, it's more than likely to have been the result of something random, just as the good things are. In hindsight, it's easy to see how it turned out, but looking forward, there's no way to predict that.It also proves my point that our bosses and people in elevated positions are really just normal people. Just because someone makes a lot of money doesn't mean they are superior. Chances are, their random series of events led them to that position while mine or a homeless persons series of events led us to where we were. I've said to those around me that ""everyone is the same"", and essentially I'm right. I'm sure the buddhists would agree."
133,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10797234-ravi-warrier,4,"""In the scientific study of random processes the drunkard’s walk is the archetype. In our lives it also provides an apt model, for like the granules of pollen floating in the Brownian fluid, we’re continually nudged in this direction and then that one by random events. As a result, although statistical regularities can be found in social data, the future of particular individuals is impossible to predict, and for our particular achievements, our jobs, our friends, our finances, we all owe more to chance than many people realize."" Alongside Taleb's Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness, and books by Kahneman and other behavioral economists, The Drunkard's Walk succinctly puts for a very convincing argument that, as Max Born put it - “Chance is a more fundamental conception than causality.”No matter what you think or think you believe, there is so much randomness in everyday life to state with even small degrees of certainty that one can predict the outcome of a game, the stock market and even whether you'll get the best-employee-of-the-year award.The book makes things surprisingly clear by using probability theories and statistics to state that randomness governs our lives and we are more helpless in steering our paths than we'd like to believe."
134,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/353993-john,4,"This book on randomness and statistical probability came highly recommended by a quantitative analyst who is obsessed with numbers, algorithms, models and data. In one sense, it is an attempt to make sense of a very complex subject, dumbing it down to a level where a non-Geek like moi can comprehend it. Mlodinow can entertain. He writes with a very dry sense of irony, tossing off broadsides and absurdities. He cites examples of randomness and irregularity throughout history, highlighting flukes like Roger Maris' home run record in 1961 and Bill Gates founding of Microsoft. He tears down the value of highly subjective rating systems like beauty contests and wine rankings. He takes a nice jibe at Robert Parker and vodka manufacturers using blind taste tests and survey results. All witticisms aside, Mlodinow is still a quant at heart and can't resist diving into mathematical complexity. It reminded me of having a throughly engrossing, funny conversation with someone at a cocktail party that starts well but ultimately lapses into boring technical soliloquys after a few drinks. The Drunkard's Walk is a decent metaphor for market behavior, groping in the dark, stumbling towards a lampost which offers faint illumination and a conventient spot to deballast. "
135,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1116520-remo,4,"Good book, exploring how randomness affects our lives. It was cool reading this book while following the NBA finals - many elements in common, in particular reversion to the mean, and the habit of pundits to make too much out of random success in one game. The example where instructor pilots yelled at their students after a bad flight, and the student then ""got better"", reinforcing in the instructor's mind the need for that type of feedback, was a terrific example of how mean reversion is overlooked by most folk.The book is perhaps too focused on random events vs ability. At one point he says ""The cord that tethers ability to success is both loose and elastic...Ability does not guarantee achievement, nor is achievement proportional to ability."" True, luck does play into success, and he provides examples like Bruce Willis lucking into Moonlighting. Elsewhere, however, he addresses the role of ability and effort with these two quotes: Edison said ""Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they came to success when they gave up."" Another by IBM founder Thomas Watson, ""If you want to succeed, double your failure rate."" Bruce Willis kept plugging along, and eventually it paid off. This reminds me of Malcolm Gladwell's ""Outliers"""

That is, the strength is that you get a peak at lot of different studies put together by different intellectuals across the country.With the first Mlodinow book I read, SUBLIMINAL, I was of the opinion he was better than Gladwell, Pink and Economics pair working out of Chicago. That one did a really good job of looking at the power of the subliminal part of the brain.This one isn't as compelling. A good, solid effort, but not one I will run around and recommend to all of my friends. Similar in quality (and content) to the most recent Gladwell book, DAVID AND GOLIATH.With decimal grading, I would give it a 3.5. I've been having a problem recently with too many of my books winding up at 4 stars, so I will put this one a notch lower.Only other observation here is that the cover of this book is really cool. It looks better on a physical book than it shows electronically, with holes cut in the cover to show the colored letters that are inside circles. It's cool. And the other Mlodinow book I've read, SUBLIMINAL, also has a really catchy cover. I've graded about 300 books, and both of these covers are probably in my top 5 overall."

It not only describes how mathematically our world can be seen, but it also provides different moral views justified by math. The author explains his ideas and the theories of math that are used extremely well. Although I had to reread a few of them a few times, it was easier to understand that most math textbooks that I read for school that are meant to explain certain ideas. He provides backgrounds for many of the theories, including a brief history of the person or people who came up with the idea, and how he, she, or they discovered it. The author also provides many humorous and detailed anecdotes that keep the book from becoming too dry. These anecdotes can be found in the descriptions of the history, but he also provides present day stories, including stories in his own life. For example, a story in which a PhD in English receives a B for a middle school paper!The author's tone is full of dry sarcastic humor that keep the reader chuckling while reading a math book. The number of weird looks you'll get from people because you're laughing at statistics will astound you. "
138,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,4,"The Drunkward's Walk is a good pop-statistics book. Unlike, say, Nate Silver's Signal/Noise book, this is actually popular statistics at its root. This would be a good reader for an AP statistics class. He explains things like probability, the origin of the normal curve (among others) and generally combines narrative, explanation, and good hypotheticals to take us from the Greek idealism of geometric shapes to the chaotic world we live in (where hurricanes are predicted using multifaceted models that are, in general, random).He also (and this was boring for me, but probably super useful for everyone else) dips his foot in the well that is Daniel Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow."" At least one chapter is based in the ""look how stupid humans are"" category of writing, which is really what we need every once in a while.This is a good refresher and it tells you about the history of some of the most important ideas we have. For example, the concept of ""Expected Value"" was invented by Blaise Pascal. The idea essentially killed him, as it brought into existence (and was brought into existence by) Pascal's Wager, which turned his sinner's life into one of apparent piety that caused him to wither away.

The book made me think about things i did and how to see stuff differently that i and most people would.In the begin i was believed to see just some probabilities things, in the middle, impressed with so much information on few pages, near the end amazed with the examples and the amount of probability and statistics applications and how they can lead you to the wrong (or right) things, and when it ends, you simply have a completely different vision about the world that arounds you (at least in my case).As an aspiring mathematician, now questions like ""what mathematicians do without teaching"" can be answered by me with: ""Mathematicians can help in everything, from betting to helping doctors know how wrong they are in their diagnoses "".The book don't gave me just an elaborated answer to the most asked question for mathematicians students as well as turned me in a likely better person and maybe a career to follow.--------------------------------------------------------------08/01/2019"

The first half was kind of repetitive for me, but is a fairly concise treatment of the development of probability. So.....readable? Check. Personal stories included that add some human interest and give you a bit more than the same exact experiments that every other book in this genre mentions? Check. Some history? Check. Not too much technical jargon and with good pacing? Check check check check.....So, which out of this genre (probability/decision-making/history/theory) do you read? This one might be second-ish for me. I still iiked Jonah Lehrer's book, though this one is more geared towards the history of math and probability, while Lehrer's is more around psychology."
141,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/255425-bausertron,2,"Meh. This is a topic that is kind of near and dear to me, so I was pretty excited when I first read about it on a top 20 list in the New York Times or something like that. Actually got it at the library out in Palatine because all the copies in the city were checked out or on hold. Big disappointment. The author tried to interject cute anecdotal material into the middle of mathematical explanations to a very clumsy effect. Also, I often felt like these side bars were braggy and self praising. If this was his attempt to keep things accessible and not have his novel read like a textbook he failed. He's no good at balancing the shop talk with the lighter stuff.There were a few chapters that were good for my probability-challenged mind, but I'd say only about 1/7 of the book interested me. There was some nice information on the 'grandfathers of math' and it was fascinating to hear about crazy drunks that were hired by kings to create theorems that would give them an edge in games of chance. It almost prompted me to look into biographies of some of these early mathematicians.Overall I would not recommend this book to anyone, but I'm not upset that I read it."
142,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,3,"This is a decent book on the basics of probability which then segues into a minor rant on how everything is random. I recommend it for those not mathematically inclined or for those who have not thought about probability in awhile and need a refresher. It is reasonably well written in a breezy style that goes quickly with most concepts clearly explained (the one annoyance is author thinks he is being hip by making pop reference jokes, unfortunately they are dated and tiresome pop references. I mean Oprah Winfrey weight jokes went out in 1986, jeesh).If you have read other books on probability, there is no real new ground broken here, but the reading is light enough that it might be worth a quick skim.I did find the structure a bit odd in that first ~2/3 of the book were about probability and then the last ~1/3 was about the prevalence of random events in every day life with no great linkage between the two. The author is basically comparing the Gaussian normal world with The Black Swan’s “Extremistan” world without clearly making that link to the reader. It is weirdly disjointed, but if you ignore that, the two sections are interesting enough on their own."
143,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2316829-barry-morris,4,"I hate to say it, because this is a fine book which handles its subject matter effectively and creatively, but for most readers ""A Drunkard's Walk"" is going to have the same appeal as a drunkard's walk. It will be attention-arresting and enjoyable at first, but it will get old fast. Everybody watches a drunkard take his first few steps, but after that--unless one has a specific interest in the well-being of the drunkard--it gets old and we move on. The first couple of chapters are like the first few steps. They feature tricks and unusual twists--especially the discussion of the Let's Make a Deal example. After that, the author goes into more in-depth discussions of the contributions of great thinkers to the study of randomness. Most people will lose interest at this point. If you are interested, however, in how fresh insights are born or in the history of math (for instance why we could reason analytically for centuries before we could multiply) this book just gets better and better. If this stuff appeals to you then buy it and enjoy. If you just want to have a few good minutes watching the drunkard walk, borrow it from this other guy."
144,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5984517-ryan,3,"Pop culture nonfiction. Moderately entertaining, not all that enlightening. I guess I shouldn't watch ""Shark Week"" expecting to call myself a biologist afterward. The book provides only a cursory review of the mathematics of probability and statistics. I would have enjoyed an appendix with more in depth explanations of the math behind the topics the author discussed.I don't find personal stories of prominent scientists all that interesting. This book, unfortunately, features those type of stories as supplements to the main premise of the book.I found the book a mix of intriguing insight and complete bullshit. There are highlights, the discussion of Bayesian statistics, sample spaces and the tidbits of history on the study of the mathematics of gambling were particularly good. The books runs afoul when the author tries to add his personal take on the subject of randomness. He concludes that randomness is responsible for circumstance and life outcomes? Why not claim a higher power determines your fate and personal choice is impotent? It's a mode of thinking I find repulsive and detracted from my enjoyment of the book. "

I got a kick looking at some of the Goodreads comments when I was finished... ""I'm a mathematician and this book was drivel"", ""I'm a mathematician and this book was great"", ""I'm an English major and I liked it."" (All paraphrased, of course) One reviewer even carped that the title didn't show up until quite late in the book. Lighten up, Francis... background and setup are okay, right? Guess not.Chill out folks...the math is good, the stories entertaining, the history enlightening, and the flow very good. If you're a mathematician sneering at a physicist's treatment of your world, bring it down a notch or three - he made probability readable and was spot on in doing it. If you're an English teacher, don't be offended when Mlodinow points out arbitrary grading of papers. Like Nate Silver's The Signal and the Noise, complex subject matter made easy is something to be applauded. So...five stars."
146,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1176833-mark,4,"While there were moments in this book where the math and statistics got the better of me and sent me into a bit of a tail-spin, I quite enjoyed many of the anecdotes and examples laid out to illustrate the concept of random-ness.This book was on par with a Malcolm Gladwell style read, but done in far deeper detail. Gladwell tends to keep away from diving too deep (ie, the aforementioned issues I had digesting the hearty helpings of math and statistical analysis), but the end result is the same - it brings the reader to a better understanding and look at elements taking place right under our noses without really being thought all that much about.In particularly, the final chapter really brought home the essence of the book for me, as it uses ""modern"" and commonly understood examples of the huge factor that chance and luck play in a person's rise to success. It also, brilliantly, demonstrates that our perception of people based on previous success or achievements is FAR more powerful than we often recognize - that we fall prey to stereotyping and assumptions based not at all on a person's actual ability, but on what they might have already accomplished (or failed at)"
147,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/791780-prettytaz83,3,"My brother recommended this book --- I really like the concept, but I struggled to get through it. A lot of the chapters talked about different scientists/mathmeticians and their stories, and how they created different theories about various concepts regarding chance and random events. The book did build on itself, and build on the topics presented at first. I had a hard time retaining the stories, and remembering them for later. I'm not sure if that is because of how they were presented, or if I had a hard time retaining the info because math/science/stats have always been difficult topics for me. I did enjoy the parts where he spoke about the psychology of human nature, but struggled through areas of the book which were heavy on the details of math/science (math not being my strong subject anyways).Overall I'm glad I read it, but I did struggle to get through it at points.I would recommend it though, even though I only gave it 3 stars.

Thankfully, this book is self-help on jacket sleeve only, and in all other respects, it’s a light and enjoyable read for the mathematically-minded."

This is his field to the lay man, but when you look at his specific research, it doesn't have anything to do with the book, so any old stats student could have written in.However, it is still very well presented and can change your outlook on life and daily occurrences. Especially if you're a classic rational math science type. And even if you are reading this after anything by Nassim Taleb (it while pale in comparison) but some irrational human behaviours can't be explained enough. As much sense as irrational stats make within the confines of the book and Mlodinow's accompanying explanation, it takes a very long time to truly act on all of these probabilities like Mr. Spock."

So, this book was just a lot of fun to read.[return][return]I can't give it 5 stars for one reason. In one of the first chapters, the author describes a situation that is supposed to explain how even doctors make mistakes understanding probability. Looking up the actual article he references, he's right. But the way he words the problem in the book makes the doctors *possibly* correct. It bothered me enough to look up the article and to check with a friend of mine who's in the process of getting a math-related PhD.[return][return]It was really just sloppy wording, but I almost didn't bother reading the rest of the book because I was worried there'd be the same type of slip-up over and over again.

The chapter I just finished, Chapter 9, was definitely my favourite in the book. This chapter is about how humans need to feel like they have control over certain aspects of their lives and if they don't, the stress is overwhelming and can be deadly.Another point made in this chapter is our tendency to refuse to believe in randomness and to make our conclusions by reading what we want into the data or by drawing our boundaries.The other thing I liked about the book is the way the author describes the lives of famous mathematicians. I have a math degree so knew most of the names, but I didn't know about their lives or about the importance of their discovery until this book. I also think I would have done better in my statistics classes if I had read this book in university! My son's listened to part of the book and really liked the examples that were given. I hope he'll listen to the rest of it so that he has a better grasp of mathematics than I did :)"

I kind of envision this author to be like Charlie Epps, the math wizard on that show. and the book is kind of like those little vignettes that happen when Charlie is explaining various math theories and how they apply to what ever his current investigation is. The book was interesting: lots of little stories about various scientists and mathematicians who figured out various theories or used various mathematical formulae to solve their current problems. Some of it is difficult to believe, but Mlodinow does a good job of giving background and showing you why the theory is true. Like the story of how to figure which of three doors the big prize is behind and whether you should change your guess once the first door is opened... Yes? No? the answer is yes, but you'll have to read the book to find out why.Like most math to me, I understood it while he was explaining it, but can't seem to retain it. The more math minded you are, the more I think you'll like the book."
155,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1512530-dave,5,"Another one of my math books...the thesis of this book is that randomness (non-determinism) plays a significant role success or failure...plenty of examples are given to support the basis and the case for this thesis.I feel as if now that I've read it I can just start at the beginning and read it again. The reason being that..and one of the central points of the book...is that our minds are not wired for randomness. The Monty Hall Example, Medical False positives all challenge preconceived notions based on anecdote. A few data points from the past does not a prediction make in business, sports, or any real world situation. The butterfly effect is real.What's difficult for me to conceive is that CONTROL and preparation do not necessarily a good plan make. I like to be prepared. Mlodinow's conclusion is that perseverance gives more trials and thus more chances for success. This is also a similar argument as Malcom Gladwell's tipping point.I enjoyed this book. I want to read it again!"

I'm not brilliant whenever I have to deal with statistics (and I do have to work with random/non-random facts since I work with experimental data in a science laboratory) so this was definitely not a piece of cake for me. I had to think many chapters over and sometimes I even had to reread and try to solve the problems myself before accepting what the author was telling me. So you can imagine that reading through this book wasn't a simple task. Nevertheless it was pleasant because it made me understand why I always try to make sense of any random set of scientific data I get and, most important, why I should watch myself and just accept that I can't control everything...The main reason this book deserves a 5-star rating is that bringing science to the public is never an easy task and Leonard Mlodinow did a great job in doing that! I wish I could do the same in my area of expertise."

Many new and interesting ideas are presented in this book and the author frequently refers to one of my favorite books: thinking fast and slow. The book puts an emphasis on humans' inability to understand chance and that we rather to try and acredit certain other effects which could also be explained by looking at it as a random process. There are many useful and interesting aspects of this book that I will be able to take advantage of in the future and Ill be less prone to misunderstand chance effects. A lot of results follow the normal distribution and the book also highlights the inaccuracies of most statistic surveys due to the low number of participants. The book doesnt tell the whole truth for all its cases/eamples, but shows many useful and different ways of looking at problems. The negatives are that it ss a bit long-winding and wasnt really as catchy as some other similar type books I have read."
158,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17048283-edwin,4,"This book destroys terms like; hope, luck, misfortune, optimism and pessimism, preferring instead to supplant each of those with maths and probability. It's why I buy 2 lottery tickets (60 games) every time I play and most times get my $ back (I don't play often). Mlodinow talks about highly skilled mathematicians who, in the past, were able to win Lotto just by playing the numbers. In one case, winning several million was a simple matter of buying a few thousand lottery tickets. The only hurdle was time. Buying that many tickets before the deadline would be a herculean job. The group of mathematicians solicited the help of friends and family and, predictably, they won and split the money. The lottery commission complained, but consortium was deemed 100% legal.So now when someone asks me to, ""show them a wealthy fortune teller"", I shall point to the nearest probability statistics expert.Great book. Brings everything down to horrible basics. Nope. No luck. Just numbers - - - in everything."

I would always like more technical analysis of a discovery, even if it takes longer to read, than historical tales about how it was discovered.Also, how much do I like the feminist undertones in choosing 'she' as the neutral pronoun or little things like referring to two girls in a two-baby problem as being ""the desired result.""It seemed like too much space was given to the statistics (normal curve) discussion because so much space was devoted to something that must be familiar to many people. It seemed like filler to dilute the more difficult work of explaining randomness which has less precedent for being described to the lay person. But I guess the connection between the two became clearer to me in the end. Still, it's almost the main reason I would want the book to be longer."

While sometimes I got a little bored, this book has some fascinating ideas that are fairly disconcerting to the average person. Mlodinow is basically saying while there are patterns in the world, that many of the patterns we think we see are just randomness in the guise of a pattern. On a surface level, this is cool to think about how we make decisions based on information that doesn't really help determine future events, but when considered on a deeper level, undermines many of the beliefs that most people use to make meaning in daily life.Mlodinow asks that you do a little brainwork, but does not overtax you with college level equations or require a pen and paper at your side. But as statistics and probability are at the core of his ideas, he wants you to see for yourself with examples that sometimes use some basic math. Definitely worth it to shake your foundations a little."
161,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1542839-mike,4,"This book deals with probability and randomness, the rise of the modern fields of statistics and probability theory, and the philosophy of dealing with a world which is at heart full of chance. I especially enjoyed the chapters on Pascal and Bernoulli. Mlodinow also discusses the (now famous) Monty Hall question, the gambler's fallacy, and other mis-conceptions of how randomness works. Finally he comes to a conclusion similar to that of books such as Outliers: that success, or the outward appearance of success, is often a result not of underlying ability but simply of luck, and that failure comes from the same place. His treatment on unfairly hailed (and unfairly castigated) CEOs should be enough to make every shareholder stop and think a bit. This book is a good and important read. "
162,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/815199-chris,4,"I did an undergraduate degree in English, and you would not think that I would be taken in by a book about statistics. This was an excellent and insightful view of the logical inconsistencies and downright errors made by humans because we do not understand the nature of statistical anomalies. Mlodinow spends much of the book discussing how statistically improbably events happen all the time, yet we fail to understand the significance of given probabilities despite the fact that we interact with them every day. This book was funny, insightful and stimulating. It gets a bit thick at times, but Mlodinow is skilled enough to recognize when the math gets heavy and his prose helps to propel readers, even those like me who have a severe allergy to any sort of advanced math, through the difficult sections with aplomb. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for something to read which will make them laugh, think and reconsider their own perceptions of how the world works. "

I love this type of nonfiction--written by actual researcher who's working in the field, but in an approachable and straightforward manner for the layperson. A fascinating look at chance and randomness, and the traps we fall into when we see patterns that are actually random.For example:""The answer lies in a phenomenon called regression toward the mean. That is, in any series of random events an extraordinary event is more likely to be followed, due purely to chance, by a more ordinary one."" (8)""The nasty thing about the availability bias is that it insidiously distorts our view of the world by distorting our perception of past events and our environment. For example, people tend to overestimate the fraction of homeless people who are mentally ill because when they encounter a homeless person who is not behaving oddly, they don't take notice and tell all their friends about that unremarkable homeless person they ran into.""

What's not to love?This is the second time I have tried to read this as an ebook on my computer. I am not meant to finish this. It is just too inconvenient to read only at my computer. I need to find a hard copy of this because it looks so interesting. Well, the third time is clearly not the charm in this instance. I did finally get most of the way through this book, but there are only so many probability examples I can find interesting. There was much here to like, but after a while, it just wasn't interesting anymore. There was some information on how probability is not understood so people make poor choices based on incorrect assumptions, but there was also a lot of information of the lives of the early mathematicians who came up with probability theory going back to Euclid. Just conldn't sustain my interest after a while. I read this last time on my ereader and I do like that convenience. "

The Drunkard's Walk provided me with entertaining, not too taxing, informative bite-sized pieces of statistical theory. I love that. Inform me! Entertain me! It took me a very long time to finish this book, but I enjoyed all of it. Bravo!Each chapter builds a bit upon the base that Mlodinow builds up throughout the work.

In fact, my favourite part of this was seeing the timeline of how thinking about probability and similar ideas emerged over a few thousand years, because that was new to me, and Kahneman & Tversky and co is more familiar (though still worth rereading many more times, just to get it wedged better into one's head). The author has done a pretty good job of getting some complicated math into very simple terms that require no math training to understand, though it probably comes with a lot of awkward simplifications if you are more competent, so it might not be something to give your statistician friend. Definitely one to give that person who insists that corporate executives deserve all those huge salaries and bonuses though."

New to this one, however is a review of the history of the study of probability, featuring prominent historical thinkers we all know.Books that I enjoy the most provoke thought, and this one succeeds at that. The most obvious thought provocation is in the implications that the author directly suggests. Another thought the book provoked for me is that since the study of probability is still fairly new, with relatively recent discoveries, there are likely significant developments ahead for the field. What obvious discovery lingers around the corner that will provoke a future author to write about the blindspots of us silly 21st century thinkers?Fascinating content and an easy writing style make the Drunkard's Walk a quick and fun read."
168,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/787657-ben,4,"A very good look at the effects of randomness on our lives and how we often see patterns where none exist. The book is very much in the Malcolm Gladwell style of pop science--it takes difficult concepts and boils them down to the point where a reader with no background can understand them. The first eight (of ten) chapters are mostly about the history of statistical analysis, which is more interesting than it sounds. The last two chapters concern themselves primarily with examples of how some accomplishments and events that seem to be the product of ability may just be attributable to luck. The examples that are presented are excellent, and really show another way to look at events, but there just aren't enough of them throughout the book. At the beginning of the book, he throws out a few examples, and I thought that was going to be more the focus of the book. And if it had been, it would have made for an even better book."
169,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1218161-ken,4,"Another good book. The author puts random chance in context and helps to understand it. It is much more prevalent than we realize. He also did a great job of demonstrating how we have been calculating the odds wrong in many situations. I found it fascinating that something as big as the Simpson trial allowed the incorrect probabilities into the record. Alan Dershowitz derived from the 4 million or so battered women in the US that only 1,432 (1992) had been killed by their boyfriend/spouse, so there was only a 1 in 2500 chance that OJ did it, but the math was incorrect. The real stat should have been of the battered wives/girlfriend who had been murdered in the US, how many were at the hands of their abusers. The answer is 90%, much much higher than the 1 in 2500 odds. I also liked the part about our confirmation bias that we all have.It was a very enlightening book and I would recommend it to everyone."
170,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5777523-jami,4,"I enjoyed this book; it was very informative and practical. I particularly enjoyed the concept and application of the regression to the mean theory, as I can relate it to many real life situations. It was also fascinating to learn that the money we spend on paying experts for financial advice may not make a difference, as the results are often achieved by chance. If you are curious about the title, the Drunkard's Walk refers to random events that nudge us in various directions; how often have you thought you wouldn't ha e a certain job, mate, or friend if certain events had not happened? I also found the discussion of CEOs and coaches being fired for poor results, when that particular year was the rest of chance or regression to the mean .The only thing I would say is that if you are weak in statistics, the written book may be a better format. I listened to the audio version and while the explanations were good, there were a few times I wish I had the print version to refer to."

Admittedly, this started as a bit of an ego-trip to read a book about concepts I'm mostly familiar with, but ended up teaching me a lot.The historical perspective on probability and statistics that this book will give you is by far not complete and mostly anecdotal, but that's exactly what you need to interestingly talk about it to your friends or family. Many well-known problems are discussed in a new light and you are in for numerous great discussions about them with the people around you (I myself have started an ongoing argument about the Monty Hall problem with my mum just a couple of days ago). Finally, if you work in a field where statistics is what puts bread on your table, this books gives your loved ones outside the field a great opportunity to peek into what is it that you do every day!Forgiving some factualy shortcommings, this book is a great addition to your library, be it the toilet one or the general one!"

And it helped to have my first course in college taught by someone who put our lessons in the context of casino games at Las Vegas.So much of our lives are the product (or addition) of probabilities and I was hoping that this book would review and re-ignite my interest in randomness and chance. Well, it did a bit but reading the book was really a plod - way too much was about various historical characters who discovered this or that principle and promoted the ideas of probability and statistics. Here and there were good bits and I do thank Mlodinow for helping me to finally understand the Monte Hall problem. However, anyone really interested in chance and life problems would be better off to re-read ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman. That book is more readable and organized and more explicitly shows how randomness and probabilities affect our thinking and actions. "

We currently live in a society where people are paid millions (sometimes) billions of dollars to make decisions that we can mathematically prove rely way more on chance than any kind of predictive skill. The author does a very good job of talking to the reader in a way that makes the information accessible even though it's a pretty heady concept.Essentially, he demonstrates thru citing both actual experiments and thought experiments to show that randomness is not only something we as a species don't really understand, but also details how randomness affects us in nearly every situation we find ourselves in. There' s a lot of wisdom in this book. I highly recommend it.The narrator of the audiobook is also very good. Sometimes a bad narrator can hinder an otherwise great book, but Sean Pratt reads it really well."

It is challenging to make statistics and probabilities interesting and understandable, but Mlodinow does just this by using just the right mix of fascinating examples to illustrate his claims. ""It is human nature to look for patterns and to assign them meaning when we find them."" These patterns may be ""lucky streaks"" or players or stocks that are ""hot."" The human brain (at least in the western world- I would be fascinated to see someone look at other cultures and see if they have the same proclivity to search for and find pattern and reason) seems to have a hard time with randomness.

Their research has shown that when chance is involved, people's thought processes are often seriously flawed. The work draws from many disciplines, from mathematics and the traditional sciences as well as cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and modern neuroscience. But although such studies were legitimated by a recent Nobel Prize (in Economics), their lessons for the most part have not trickled down from academic circles to the popular psyche. his book is an attempt to remedy that.I got this out of the library and the first few pages really hooked me.

All are governed, to a large extent, and to an extent larger than we like to think about, by random chance. Can you believe the wine tasters reviews? Was Bill Gates' success due to Bill Gates? Was the head of the movie studio's business acumen really all that bad to deserve being fired? Like the academic he is, Mlodinow spells this out in a series of organized, sometimes humorous, and often quirky sections, all based on published studies.Very thought provoking - helps you laugh at these overly serious experts and their bombastic prognostications about the way ahead or the fruitiness of the 1998 Chateau Faux Franc or the strong buy recommendation on Lehman Brothers stock."

None, EVER! Coutrs and juries have believed odds of innocence quoted to be on the order of one in a billion and sent people to jail for life on little or no other evidence when, in fact, the true mathematical were as high as one in two.

In addition to making me realize that Laplace's work could be applied to probability spaces and not just areas, this book has the distinction of making me believe the probability on the Monty Hall problem. I have never really accepted the 2:3 favoring switching in that case. I still kind of want to write a computer model and prove it to myself, which is more than a little paranoid when presented with such quality proof.

The historical label was spot-on. Mlodinow does an excellent job tracking the pioneers of statistical thought. I would call this book about 60% math, 30% math history, 10% social science (there were slight traces of Malcolm Gladwell in some chapters). Unfortunately, it's 0% hysterical.

Some were complicated, but he did an amazing job breaking things down so they made sense. At one point I had to get a printed version (to see Pascal's triangle) but this worked even as an audio book. In fact, it might be because I like this narrator a lot that the book worked so well.Because I live my life guided by intuition, I like having this fact-based information about randomness to incorporate into my gut responses.I'll probably write more about this because there's so much it's got me thinking about, but this will be my review for this space."

You will get a good understanding of the chapter topic, along with history, examples, and the relationship of the chapter to the whole. The final two chapters really draw everything together and answers the question raised in the title.

It shows how your life if a result of random processes. You may have an illusion of control over it but this is just a mental construct. You had no control over where you are right now, the job you are doing or the people you are with. They are just a result or chance. A roll of the dice. Another interesting thing I got out of it is how we wrongly assign worth to people who have largely nothing much to do with their successes. We think if a person is successful that they are intelligent in all aspects of life. But given enough people, through chance alone there will be the wildly successful who were in the right place at the right time. And if you were to run the simulation again there would be different Bill Gates and Steven Kings so even you would be a legend in some of the possible universes. "

What I thought would be a guide to uncovering our biases and accepting and addressing randomness in our lives was instead a remedial overview of the basics of probability and a history of statistics. I kept waiting to get through the introductory stuff and to the meat of the material, and I finally did... ~80% of the way through the book.There was very little in this book that was not covered by my undergraduate Stats 101 class, including many of the common historical stories and classic examples. The end got more interesting as it discussed psychological biases and how they prevent us from recognizing randomness. Overall the book is clear, comprehensive and well written; it may be fine for someone absolutely no background in probability. But someone with even a lay interest may want to skip this book."

Mlodinow unpacks numerous common misconceptions of probably with his clever use of historical anecdotes, contemporary applications, and abundant easy-to-understand mathematics examples. Not being a math whiz, I appreciated the simplicity of his approach. Now I say simple, namely because this the fourth book I've read in a row that deals with information, logic, and its interpretation. Subsequently, the book is rife with similar names and stories of historical figures I've read about in other books. A couple of chapters (measurements and chaos) left me dry with boredom, but others made up for it. The finale chapter ""The Drunkard's Walk"" gave a pop send off with reflections on the perception of success and its achievement. It may look random, but there is a measurable approach that would satisfy the most hardened cynic. "

Think of this as a series of magazine articles chained together as chapters, and you'll be in the right frame of mind. None of them are *bad*, and I'd highly recommend this book as a breezy intro, but I was hoping for something a little deeper myself. I'm probably biased due to being a math major who has read some other books that dug into some of these issues a little more, so this shouldn't be seen as a major complaint!Anyway, the book brings up some solid points. I do like how the author takes special aim at the habit of most media to see ""patterns"" in what are really random dice rolls over a long period, and mentioning the downside to various events where the media is only inclined to see the upside. So some solid reminders there. Anyway, consider the book lightly recommended."

Mlodinow presents the development of the conceptualization of randomness - a history of statistics and probability - in terms that most people with a high school education can understand. His examples are interesting and relevant, especially his analysis of the performance of CEO's. Quoting Bernoulli, ""One should not appraise human action on the basis of its results."" There is only about a 1 in 3 chance that the CEO had any influence on the result which is more random that influenced. (p. 100) Also, the performance mutual funds managers is part of the same random process (p. 197-200)The discussion of False Positives and Positive Fallacies (Ch. 6) should be read by anyone who discusses diagnoses with their physician. And, it would not be a bad idea to have your physician read it, too.I recommend it. Pleasant and informative. "

The author explains some interesting statistical concepts like Browning motion (drunkard's walk), Grant life tables, normal distributions, etc. He also points out the difference between probability and statistics, and describes the two interpretations of randomness, frequency and subjective. I particularly enjoyed the history behind how each physicist or mathematician discovered different principles and how they can be applied to discrepancies between common misconceptions of the world and things as they really are. He also talks about confirmation bias and our underestimation of the role of randomness as a factor in our successes and failures (a chapter which largely reminded me of Gladwell's Outliers). ""Even a coin weighted toward failure will sometimes land on success."" Definitely want to write a blog post about my learnings. "

It shows through many examples how our notions about performance often can be accounted for by randomness. The example of the O. J. Simpson trial is great, showing how statistics were used in an improper way to find O. J. Simpson innocent. This book hints at how the two half's of our brains fight over decisions, one trying to impose rules and order on the world, the other half implicitly understanding the randomness around us.My view of financial markets is quite different after reading this, as they are far more random than they appear."

For each moment and every situation, we should be grateful and consider ourselves lucky if we could just grasp the infinite possibilities that didn’t happen and the chances of being somewhere completely different. Quoting Mlodinow, “… once we understand the nature of random processes, we can alter the way we perceive the events that happen around us.” So by reading this book, one cannot avoid a positive hindsight about life in general and learn to appreciate the absence of bad luck that could have lead us to a totally different life."

227,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15785230-paulo-glez-ogando,4,"Mlodinov has tried in this book «to present the basic concepts of randomness, to illustrate how they apply to human affairs, and to present his views that its effects are largely overlooked in our interpretations of events and in our expectations and decisions. It may come as an epiphany merely to recognize the ubiquitous role of random processes in our lives; the true power of the theory of random processes, however, lies in the fact that once we understand the nature of random processes, we can alter the way we perceive the events that happen around us».So this book is about probability and statistics. «No other branch of mathematics is so easy for experts to blunder as probability theory», said Martin Gardner.It is about the principles that govern chance, the development of these ideas and the manner in which they play out in several areas of human affairs. And it is also about the way we make choices and the processes that lead us to make mistaken judgements and poor decisions when confronted with randomness. We associate randomness with disorder, yet although the lives of 200 million drivers vary unforeseeably, in the aggreagate their behavior could hardly have proved more orderly. And analogous regularities can be found if we examine how people vote or buy stocks and if we measure the length of their legs or the size of their feet. Moreover, social data often follow the normal distribution. And events whose patterns appear to have a definite cause may actually be the product of chance. There is a fundamental clash between our need to feel we are in control and our ability to recognize randomness. When we assess the world, we tend to see what we expect to see. People systematically fail to see the role of chance in the success of ventures and in the success of people, and we unreasonably believe that the mistakes of the past must be consequences of ignorance or incompetence and could have been remedied by futher study and improved insight.To swim against human intuition is a difficult task, but people's intuition about randomness fails them in many situations. Besides, the connection between actions and results is not as direct as we might like to believe. We usually underestimate the effects of randomness. Extraordinary events can happen without extraordinary causes, even random events often look like non-random events.In complex systems (among which the author counts our lives) we should expect that minor factors we can usually ignore will by chance sometimes cause major incidents.Mlodinov deals with interesting topics like these: Hollywood (success or not in films), sports (the hot-hand fallacy), Roman law (which fell short of mathematical vadility mantaining that two half proofs constituted a complete proof) and modern law (use of probability and statistics in court), the Monty Hall problem, Benford's law, the law of large numbers, bayesian statistics (with many applications, for example the use of drugs in medinice), politics, elections, Brownian motion (from there the title, The Drunkard's Walk), the confirmation bias, the butterfly effect, etc.And he brings us the lives and works of several well known characters as Cicero, Cardano (his The Book on Games of Chance represents the first success in the human quest to understand the nature of uncertainty), Blaise Pascal (his famous triangle or the so known Pascal's wage to prove the existence of God), Galton or Michael Faraday (yes, one of the founders of electromagnetic theory did research in spiritual contact).I enjoyed this book very much. It is well written, with an agile and entertaining style. It deals with many topics, it doesn't delve into any of them but it explains them fairly. It's a complete look in the history of probability and statistics as well as a great summary of its applications."
228,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,4,"There is an entire category of books about human irrationality and cognitive biases, and I've been reading a lot of them: Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions, Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics, Thinking, Fast and Slow, and many many more. There are also a lot of books that are sort of adjacent to these books, work from Jonathan Haidt and Steven Pinker and Marcelo Gleiser and many more.For me, the common thread in all of these books is: epistemic / intellectual humility. We don't know as much as we think we do.Not all of these books are equally good or equally well-written, but The Drunkard's Walk holds its own. Some of the material is repetitive--there's the obligatory references to Kahnaman and Tversky, of course--but there was a lot of new material, too. I've read lots of split-brain experiments, but I'd never heard of the split-brain experiments with probability processing. It turns out that our right and left hemispheres have different ways of handling uncertainty, and you can isolate that in those patients who (from surgery or accident) have had the connection between the two hemispheres of their brain surgically severed. I also learned about the Rosenhan experiment, which tested psychiatric hospitals to see how long it would take for them to notice when perfectly sane patients were admitted. The answer? They never figured it out. They just interpreted all of the behaviors of the patients--mundane stuff like showing up for lunch early or writing in their journal--as more evidence of their psychiatric disorder. The patients were discharged in about 2 weeks, but the hospitals never realized that they hadn't been suffering from any kind of mental instability in the first place. So: new material. That's pretty important, and this book had plenty for me.I also want to read a book where the author has something to say: insights into the data and the science or lessons learned from it. And here, again, Mlodinow delivered. Here's one brief quote that I found particularly encouraging:What I’ve learned, above all, is to keep marching forward because the best news is that since chance does play a role, one important factor in success is under our control: the number of at bats, the number of chances taken, the number of opportunities seized.He also spoke poignantly of the lessons learned by him from his family members who had survived the Holocaust, and the role that chance and uncertainty and randomness played in such extreme circumstances.So, while I wouldn't recommend the book as being quite as vital as, say, The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion, I would certainly recommend it as a worthy addition to anyone interested in these kind of issues.

Told in an engaging and entertaining way? Check. Useful for your life? Yes, most of all.Some of the images here stay with you, especially the illusions of patterns that fool us. The sharp-shooter fallacy, where you draw a circle around a cluster of hits after the fact as if that was where you were aiming, like the clusters of hits during the blitz, or supposed cancer hot-spots--all generated by the same random process. Brownian motion. The graph (normal distribution) of fund manager success over time. There are so many places in everyday life where we see success or failure and tell ourselves stories about what it means without recognizing just how much random events intervene.In some non-fiction books of this type, reviewing the history of the discipline is tedious, but not here. I love how this author explained the basics of the discipline a bit at a time, introducing new layers of complexity in his survey by telling the stories of mathematicians and others who first figured these things out. (Sometimes, the details of where they got it wrong helped explain as much as what they got right.) And the stories of Bill Gates and Bruce Willis and others are instructive, reminding us of what we sometimes know but can't always hold on to--chance events bring such people to the fore. It's not that they don't deserve success, but that many similar people might also have been equally successful if things turned out just a little bit differently, if they had met with luck at just the right point. The discussion of a study using chapters from award-winning books--sent back out as if they were unpublished authors, and still getting turned down--looks at success the other way, showing how random success can be, how easily it might have been failure except for luck.This is not discouraging; it just puts things into perspective. I especially like the quote from IBM's Thomas Watson: ""If you want to succeed, double your failure rate."" Good ideas and good products and good art don't always catch on. But they still might. Keep going.This is probably worth reading more than once. In fact, this was my second time through, and more of the math penetrated my skull this time than the last time around. :) (None of it's hard math, but the non-intuitive probability stuff can mess with your head!) The information here can change how we make decisions. It really helps to see why firing that coach is probably a bad idea, why the margin of error in surveys needs to be understood better, why paying big bucks for someone to pick your stocks is probably costing you too much money, and why half the stuff you and I believe is probably based on faulty inferences we've long since rationalized into dogma.Now if he can help me figure out which half...Recommended.

Book #95 of 182, 252 pages, 9 hours 19 minutes, finished 7/9/2017.Rating: 3/5The Drunkard's Walk tells the history of probability, randomness, and chance - it's mostly a book of the heroes of statistics and math. This book is a bit of a liar. It intimates by it's title that it's going to be all about how randomness effects human affairs. In reality, that's only in the last two chapters of the book, barely 10% of the whole thing.Instead, we are laboriously shown the entire history of probability - from the guys who figured out the probability of dice, to the Monty Hall Problem, to the normal distribution.If I had known he was going to belabor history of mathematics so hard, I wouldn't have read it. Or, at least, I would have skipped around substantially.The final chapters are worth the read, though. The central idea of this book is that even with skill/ability factored in, excellent folks are going to have incredible losing streaks, and incompetent fellows are going to have incredible winning streaks. Worse off, we are instantly and irrevocably assuming those wins and losses are due to their skill, when it's entirely possible it was dumb luck.I'm not sure who I would recommend this book to. I think you'd have to really, really, really enjoy the study of the history of math to make it all the way through."
231,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3310060-jordan-mcpeek,4,"Who knew that a history of math could be so entertaining, insightful, and applicable to everyday life? Yes, little Johnny or Janie, math is good for something. The big lesson is that chance or luck have more to do with success than skill or ability. And luck has more to do with persistence and tenacity. But there's plenty of smaller everyday lessons to be learned here, from baseball stats to stock markets, wine ratings to murder convictions, school grades to terminal diagnoses. These aren't lessons on how to pick the winners and get rich or some such nonsense. They're more about the proper use of math, and how improperly it is used in so many routine ways, by all of us, even by experts. As he points out, there's a lot of psychological factors at play. The scary part is how the ways math can be misused or misunderstood can be so subtle. A slight turn of phrase that one might not even notice at first, or might sound like an inconsequential difference, can actually dramatically change the conclusion. He goes into the philosophical and historical underpinnings to introduce the various math concepts. It's not too deep or lengthy, stays interesting. But what always strikes me when I read history of ideas is how so many things that just seem like common sense to us today were, at one time, invented or discovered. Here, it's simple things like arithmetic, addition, subtraction, decimal point. A humbling thought. This guy would probably be one of those favourite profs who knows how to tell a story instead of lecture, who uses engaging and familiar examples from pop culture, and always has a witty aside to keep us smiling. The main drawback is that I listened to the audiobook. Even though it's written in a very accessible way, there's still plenty of spots where I didn't follow what he was saying. It takes me awhile to get these intellectual somersaults down pat, especially those subtleties I mentioned, so if I was reading the hardcopy book, I'd be rereading a lot of paragraphs before moving on. And I don't know, maybe the book has some illustrations that'd help too. Overall, an entertaining and accessible short book filled with lots of meaty things to think about on the power of uncertainty and chance in our lives. "
232,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7072727-jeff,5,"One of those rare books that has changed the way I think about things, as much as Carol Dweck's Mindset did a couple of years ago. I started reading this after my friend Mark mentioned it over lunch. I was telling him about reading Aristotle (back when I was an undergrad) writing about the truth-value of future statements - like is it true or false to say now that so-and-so will win the battle tomorrow? I said to Mark, I feel like the best way to handle that is with probability, but I don't understand why Aristotle didn't consider that, and Mark said that's because probability wasn't discovered yet. What?And then he said go read this book, and I did, and it explained so many things.So, you get a history of probability and randomness and why it took centuries for thinkers to gradually discover and accept these ideas. And then you catch up to recent research that shows you just how much more of our lives are explained by randomness than you would have ever thought, and why it's so hard for us, because of our psychology, to accept this or to think in this way.But we can try. And if you read this book, you will likely start to view the world differently. Shortly after reading this I listened to the episode of the podcast How I Built This that interviewed Michael Dell, and when Guy Raz asked Michael Dell how much luck played a role in his success, I found myself immediately imagining how many other young guys just like Michael would have been tinkering with building computers back in the early 80s, and how many of those people would have started to make some money, started to establish businesses, and just gradually they all fell away until there were a few left. And in another world, with a few different random events along the way, we wouldn't have Dell computers, we'd have some other company that started out of those early experiments. (Meanwhile Michael's answer was that he was lucky to be born in the US.)I wouldn't have thought anything like that before reading this book.That's just one of several insights that I've carried away from this. Highly recommended."

It is time for probability and statistics become household names and dinner table topics. How can we make sense of the world without them? The most valuable part of the book for me is where the author starts with some intriguing contemporary examples, be it counterintuitive scenarios, paradoxical situations, or seemingly unquantifiable cases, then, rather than hand over the solution sheets, he would travel back in time and give a mildly amusing lowdown of the original motivations, circumstances, and the people that begot those theories. However brief his little sketches of the people, their lives, and academic endeavors brought those brilliant albeit often flawed historical figures alive and made them relevant. The author also managed to make their thought process traceable and the solutions reproducible for those who are so inspired and wish to give it a go themselves. I just finished Chapter 6, and have to say this is one chapter that could benefit from some major rework. While the pure narrative style worked sufficiently in breaking down basics in previous chapters, maybe a conscientious effort to avoid any potential put offs from seeing formulas or tables, Bayesian theory and the examples could be much more effectively illustrated with diagrams and even contingency tables. Though normally obsessed with reading every word on a page, I had to skimp through the wordy parts, which is most parts of this chapter, often read like tongue twists in my mind. The explanation of common confusions in translating daily encounters into Bayes concepts could also be pumped up by a few notches.Suggest refer to Bayes’ Theorem Examples: A Visual Introduction for Beginners, by Dan Morris."

Most of us meticulously plan everything from grocery shopping to travel itineraries without realizing this isn't necessarily an optimal thing to do. This book explains, with a variety of vivid examples, how randomness affects our lives. It does this by examining the maths behind randomness in an easy and conversational manner. It makes us realize that an understanding of probabiltiy and statistics can help us overcome our cognitive biases. My main takeaway from this book is that successful people are lucky, but to be lucky one has to be successful one has to be unrelenting and flexibleThere are other books like Nicolas Taleb""s fooled by randomness that handles the topic more amusingly. Yet, I believe this book is a good read for gaining a simple and intuitive understanding of randomness. ""It is easy to believe that ideas that worked were good ideas, that plans that succeeded were well designed, and that ideas and plans that did not were ill-conceived. And it is easy to make heroes out of the most successful and to glance with disdain at the least. But ability does not guarantee achievement, nor is achievement proportional to ability. And so it is important to always keep in mind the other term in the equation—the role of chance…What I’ve learned, above all, is to keep marching forward because the best news is that since chance does play a role, one important factor in success is under our control: the number of at-bats, the number of chances taken, the number of opportunities seized.”"
236,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19718416-matt,0,"Assumes no prior knowledge, which is fine, but stays very shallow throughout, which was disappointing. (Perhaps the author or publisher took the 'each equation halves sales' dictum to heart, but the explanations could have gone a fair bit deeper even without any formalism.) I know this is a hard balancing act, but it is possible to start from the ground floor and build up to some satisfying explanations: Charles Petzold did it in Code, and Jordan Ellenberg did something similar in How Not to be Wrong -- his secret was to keep his ambitions modest, and genuinely explain some relatively simple concepts rather than give handwavy overviews of more advanced topics. The thing is, a lot of the concepts covered shallowly in this book are not particularly complicated, so I think Mlodinow could have done more to satisfy the curious reader without making things too daunting for the maths-averse.(I'm leaving this unrated for a few reasons: despite having no technical expertise or qualifications, I'm probably too much of a nerd to fit into the target audience; several of the examples would have been interesting to me had I not read about them several times before, and it may be unfair to blame the author for this lack of novelty, given that the book was published in 2008 and probably predates many of the other pop science books and articles that made it seem like a tired rehash in 2018; and it was actually kind of a fun read, despite everything. There are some historical anecdotes that were new to me, and the style is easy going.)"
237,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40486063-marco-loya,5,"This is my first review of a book here in Goodreads, so I’m a little nervous and excited, here I go. Let me tell you briefly what's inside this book: basically, probability concepts, details about our mind's perception of random events and some history of the concepts that are explained in each chapter.First, I want to answer a question you might have: is this book for me? You might be afraid of the math contents of the book. They’re not complicated and everyone can easily understand them, and if you feel the author isn’t explaining well, you can always watch a video online explaining the concept. However, you should at least like maths to certain amount to enjoy this book. Otherwise, you won’t like it, because it’s mostly maths.If you think this book will be too easy or simple for you... well, it might be. But, if this is true, I think you’re going to enjoy the book even more. It’s about the concepts you already know, but presented on a different perspective and you won’t have to spend time understanding them. You get to see how this concepts are present in every day life. Plus, the history facts that come with them are pretty fun and interesting. Now you get to know who really was Pascal, for example.I would argue that the only thing this book lacks is relevance in some of the concepts. Some concepts are explained and you can barely see how they matter in a normal day. Also, there’s no big idea that pulls everything together and makes sense of all of the concepts. However, there is a message at the end which is a pretty cool idea and is surprisingly deep and motivating."
238,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25181876-fardeem-munir,5,"To tout this book as absolutely amazing would be a gross understatement. The book begins with a premise that human beings, being creatures of control, does not fully understand the role of chance and randomness in our lives. This leads to all sorts of bad decision-making that the author beautifully highlights and exposes our flaws in reasoning.A lot of books have been writing on the issue of randomness. What the author gets right is this – understanding probability and the role of chance is not a walk in the park. A lot of books will say such and such logic is wrong due to the Laws of Probability, without explaining the underlying principles. Leonard Mlodinow has such a good grasp on the topic that he actually goes in and lifts the curtain on these so-called laws in a very easy to understand language.The book reads like a story. The author first begins with a question. Answers it and then challenges the assumptions made while answering the first question. The historical anecdotes about how many of the mathematical structures were invented were particularly amusing. Turns out, mathematical theorem does not only come out logic and pencil-scribbling but also due to ego, pride and other diseases pertaining to the human condition. The last chapter was an incredible, albeit philosophical, and to the entire discussion. They say, ""Any book worth reading should be read thrice"". This book certainly qualifies."
239,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50614697-sb,3,"As humans, we tend to search for the pattern in everything; seeing patterns and agreement, often when there is none. Randomness plays a far bigger role in our life than we realise; success, lucky discoveries and the most significant events of one's life are normally always down to chance or ""randomness"", which is seldom given the credit it deserves. Mlodinow takes the reader on a journey and reveals that everything from stock-picking to wine-tasting down to predictions for box office hits and commercial success, all mean nothing; no one is able to predict the success of something, which is always down to randomness. Other interesting points:-He talks about 'conditional probability' and he uses the OJ Simpson case as an example. The prosecution led with the fact that OJ was a violent man and was known to have physically abused his wife in the past; the defense then made the point that, four million women in the USA are battered annually (1992) and yet only 1 in 2,500 women end up being murdered by their partners. The defense argued that the probability of OJ having killed Nicole, was therefore, 1/2500. This is the incorrect way of looking at things though, ""the relevant number is not the probability that a man who batters his wife will go on to kill her (1 in 2500), but rather the probability that a battered wife who was murdered was murdered by her abuser."" This is conditional probability."
240,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10712060-saman,5,"The gist of the book is that humans move through life with a brownian motion (drunkard's walk) similar to particles suspended in a fluid. The author provide a history and introduction to probability and statistics concepts that applies to randomness and day to day life, and use that to show that there is order in randomness, but there is not always a pattern in randomness. Various parameters that are out of control of a person affect their life in various ways, and a person walks through life by bumping against various events and persons and this is how his life is shaped. As much as people like to attribute their success and failure to their endeavours, but according to math, all these are shaped by random events out of the control of that person. Therefore, idealising successful people and degrading unsuccessful people is not rational, the only difference most of the time is chance! Hence, trying to copy the ways of successful people does not necessarily translate to success. Success and failure in life is similar to tossing a coin and is very random. There can be streaks of success or failures where one person keeps failing or succeeding, but eventually the page will turn. So it's best to keep failing until one succeeds. Also this is a great summary of probability and statistics, I think another chapter (or part of a chapter) could be dedicated to explain the ""secretary problem"" and optimal stopping rule. "
241,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30883549-doug-kerwin,4,"A key takeaway was that while we often think we have good intuition on predicting the chances of a particular outcome, our natural grasp of probability is pretty bad. Our intuition fails us in a big way. I felt at several points that this book was making the mathematical argument for the Buddhists mantra of detachment from results. Because we are so poor at predicting results, and because chance plays a much larger role in the outcome than most of us want to admit, that there is no point in stressing over the results, and that we ought not praise or berate ourselves too much on account of where we're at today.This book reminded me to look at the qualities of the person, and not conflate worth with past results. That often the people we idolize are largely just luckier than we are. Ability and success are not nearly as correlated as luck and success. That's not to say that ability has nothing to do with it. As it has been said elsewhere, luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. It's helpful to remember that often the chief difference between ourselves and the people we idolize may be largely chance, or luck.I hope as a result of reading this book, I will as Mlodinow says when wrapping up the final chapter, ""appreciate the good luck that we have and recognize the random events that contribute to our success."""
242,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22225016-celia-ludwinski,4,"Leonard Mlodinow's book offers an introduction to statistics with a twist of a historic narrative in a quick bantering tone that is accessible the average Joe's attention. For someone who has studied statistics, this book will be entirely a review. However, it is a quick and a clever way to ingest both old and new examples ranging from basic statistical principals like Pascal's triangle to time series analysis. In the end, Mlodinow concludes that nothing is predictable — not stocks, not CEO skills, not movie successes, not weather, and more. However, his conclusions are drawn from examples based on observational data, not causal experiments. While it's a good reminder that correlation doesn't equal causation and that we should be wary about making predictions based on some types data, I'm not sure his conclusion holds for a well designed, causal experiment. While I enjoyed the book, and appreciate his cautionary conclusion regarding statistics as a whole, I'd caution you to be careful of falling too much into lockstep about rejecting all predictions outright. Statistics is a long-studied field for a reason and can provide a lot of useful information and even, yes, predictions. "
243,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30210549-adam-zabell,4,"tl;dr - people suck at probabilities because randomness doesn't align with intuitionCaveat: I read this as an audiobook, so what I gleaned is different than if I'd read it.Newtonian Physics feels right to humans not just because it's a very nearly perfect explanation of the world, but because it's deterministic: you hit the billiard ball with the cue and you can describe both where it goes and where it comes from. It's also wrong, because that ""very nearly"" caveat is a cover phrase for the disciplines of Probability and Statistics. This book introduces both fields with descriptive examples that don't rely on mathematic symbolism, making it the perfect first-principles book for folk who want to understand.And most folk should want to understand, because the human mind is an exquisite pattern making machine, and will insist on finding patterns even where the mathematics says there are none. Learning the underlying probabilities and statistics won't stop your brain from jumping to conclusions, but it should be the reminder not to base your actions on that jump.I have a bone to pick with the example used to explain Bayesian statistics, but it's not enough to discard the whole book.

It has numerous anecdotes many of which are brilliantly funny. Various concepts related to randomness are gradually introduced in each chapter and are all beautifully tied up in the last chapter, which shares its name with the title of the book.One of the concepts introduced in the book is that expectations influence outcome. This also applies to some reviewers who had picked the book thinking it to be some sophisticated mathematical treatment of the subject (which is not the case), and were verifiably dejected. In the final pages of the book, the author clearly tells the purpose of writing the book - which is to introduce randomness in the simplest of terms so that the greater audience may benefit from it.I'm an engineer by training. Still just like several professionals cited in the book, even I missed or at least underestimated the influence of chance events in all things that I read, write, or believe in. This book has given me a reason to question all that I know from the standpoint of chances and biases therein.The book also takes a lot from Daniel Kahneman's and Amos Taversky's experiments in psychology. I am happy that it does so. This has spurred me to begin reading Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow with the right expectation. And I'm sure I won't be disappointed."

I should have downloaded the sample of it on my iBook app and should have read more about the author and the reviews before proceeding and hitting the order button on my computer screen. The book is not my taste at all. It's for mathematics lovers since it describes randomness in situations using basic math ... the author is a physicist .. what you expect from his book?! Simply, the delivery of this book was very dry to my taste as I was expecting more psychological thoughts presented in rational and in an interesting presentation, yet rather, it was confusing and hard to follow up with the author's points. As many other reviewers here, after I completed a chapter, I was like "" I didn't get it"" so I had to re-read the chapter in order to understand his points. I would recommend this book for people who are interested in math, physics, and who loves this kind of books.

He acknowledges all the help he received, but the bear's portion Is the author's and the pages of notes at the end are remarkable. While I did enjoy many of the stories about scientists and mathematicians and others who contributed in some way to the idea of a random universe, and how chance comes into play in places where you least expect it (from financial markets to supermarkets), and while some of the information is fascinating (like Graunt's life table), I'm not a science or math person and so I found many of the ideas and examples in this book too lofty for me. I was expecting the book to be more like a Gladwell type book, but it's not. I'm rating the book four stars (I wish there was a no rating choice). I find these star ratings to be unfair and random(!) of course. I know that it's a good book irregardless of whether it's to my taste or not. The writing is good, and the structure also good with plenty of examples and anecdotes.

That’s what this book is about, and it’s both mind-blowing and a pleasure to read. Mlodinow writes with wit and simplicity, and also doesn’t dumb down or repeat too often his points. He tells great stories — how Hollywood fires its executives for reasons that are essentially random … how OJ Simpson’s defense team mis-used statistics to mislead the jury (the defense said that only one battered woman in 2500 is murdered by her partner — true, but the relevant statistic is that 90% of murdered battered women are killed by their abuser) … how Bayesian statistics revolutionized math … how medical tests that seem so reliable are in fact frequently wrong and much less reliable than even the doctors understand and much more. This is exactly the kind of science book that a non-scientist can fall in love with, and also one that every one of us dumb humans should read, as a nice counter-balance to both “alternative facts” and bad math in our everyday lives.Grade: A"
249,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67469232-kelly-novak,5,"Mlodinow's Drunkard's Walk is a refreshing look at statistics. It is humorous at times, too. I use statistics at work every day, and when someone says, ""Assume a Gaussian distribution,"" or ""My data is not 'normal'; what is wrong?!"" I sometimes bring up anecdotes from this book. Although Gaussian distributions can occur in reality, typical data sets do not, and instead of fretting over it, take a look at what the data are really telling us.Many people that use statistics do not have a real understanding of what the data are telling us, and have preconceived notions that can cause them to come to erroneous conclusions. We learn how to avoid common mistakes by reading his numerous anecdotes from real examples (often involving prominent people) stumbling into poor judgement. A favorite of mine is how the mathematician Henri Poincaré proved that a baker was dishonest and selling underweight loaves of bread, even though the baker always sold Poincaré a heavy loaf.This book is a great introduction on how not to be fooled."

In plain language Leonard Mlodinow explains the mathematics and philosophy behind randomness. His work overlaps with Daniel Kahnemen's Thinking, Fast and Slow and Michael Lewis' Undoing Project. It is not just a question of randomness as a mathematical concept, however, that he has to explain. The real confounding problem is that human minds do not perceive the world, random or not, in a logical or mathematical way. Our minds and our memories and our perception are clouded by assumptions, illusions and just plain errors of thought that lead us to misinterpret the world, sometimes to our own detriment. I am personally confounding this book with Daniel Kahneman's so I will wait to explore some of these ideas in both when I review Kahneman's book, which I will be finishing soon, but if you want an easier read with many of the same ideas, I recommend this entertaining and accessible look at randomness, logic and psychology in everyday life."

It is very comprehensive, covering a wide range of the subject in details. However, it is not a technical book. The author try to address explain the mathematics using simple examples in a narrative form. Being an engineer, I would like to say that probabilities and statistics are not easy subjects. As the author points throughout the book, part of the difficult is due to the fact that both sciences usually produce results that are very counterintuitive. The type of conclusions that clash directly to our expectations. The author did its best to try to address such complexity. But, it still is a difficult book. So, I recommend reading it with time and patience. But, at the end, it is a worth reading, in particular for anyone interested in history of science."

Our innate miscomprehensions of what the probabilities are in any given situation are eye-opening, since they depend more on underlying mathematical considerations that on what feels like our ""logical"" assumptions.I found his humor ham-fisted at first but later on saw it as friendly (the jacket photo gives you a good sense of how he views the world).The book lost a fifth star for his explication of psychological experiments that (at least as he explains them) overlook known responses in human psychology – the conclusions he cites ignore the order in which an experiment's questions are presented and the interactive influence the questions can have our assumptions.

I might’ve been more interested if I’d read it when I was first learning stats because most of the examples were the pretty standard ones (Monty Hall problem, false positives in HIV testing, the birthday problem, etc). There were lots of tongue in cheek asides that irritated me and just seemed unnecessary. In terms of the history, there were a couple (I counted 2) brief nods to non-European mathematics, but really brief ie “the concept of zero came from India. Now let’s talk about the Greeks for a long time.” “Chinese mathematicians actually found the patterns in Pascal’s triangle, but let me tell you about pascal.” Overall this felt like someone wanted to write a book that sounded like a Radio Lab episode. The benefit of a math book is that it can have non-text representations like graphs and tables to help you understand the content, but those were lacking. So it should’ve been a radio lab episode. "

And as scary as it sounds, this kind of mistake is quite common. How come many doctors got it wrong? Short answer: human mind is not wirted to understand probability and randomness. Long answer: read the book.In the book, you can find surprisingly many real-life situations where randomness and chance (or luck) play an important role. As Leonard Mlodinow put it: ""We habitually underestimate the effects of randomness"".My personal intake: failures, in many cases, have nothing to do with qualifications. People told me this on many occasions; I mostly regarded it as a sort of consolation. This book offered real stories, sometimes with mathematical proofs, in which failures and successes are just random. "

All that to say I really enjoyed what I understood. I read enough to enjoy it but not enough to say I actually read it from start to finish. I really just skimmed it, though I would have liked to read it. It was frankly over my head. What I liked about it was that it seems to say bullshit! to all those who believe in luck or heavenly intervention or intuition. It's all random and on top of that there are a million rules that guide the randomness and it goes back as far as the Greeks and Romans who incorporated random rules into mathematic principles.

The author un-picks numerous examples to reveal how we are often blind to the details which leads to success or failure. When reading it you often feel that if you could avoid the trap of thinking about good and bad luck / chance, you could hack the route to success and obviously, the person who read the book before me thought the same as they underlined huge passages of text. However, they also sold the book on ebay so I am unsure whether they gave the book up as a lost cause or had learnt the life lesson and hoped to spread the word. Either way, the book deserves to be read as it is filled with moments that make you rub your chin and think 'if only I could bottle the authors powers of deduction and reasoning I would have it made!'"
260,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3001534-john-hays-compton,3,"This book was a bit of task to slug through. The last chapter and title ""The Drunkard's Walk""was the most beneficial to me. My main take away is that we underestimate how much random chance plays a part in our lives. Therefor, we need to appreciate the good luck when it comes and understand the bad luck is not part of us or what makes us. This especially applies when evaluating others. There a lot of Bruce Willis' and Bill Gates out there that just missed their lucky chance or where blind to a good opportunity.""A pathway punctuated by random impacts and unintended consequences is the path of many successful people, not only in their careers but also in their loves, hobbies, and friendships. In fact, it is more the rule than the exception.""Keep moving forward, keep persevering, keep giving yourself chances!"
261,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58015559-pere-anton,4,"It opened my eyes to the randomness in out lives Do you think randomness only applies to games? Think twice, this book shows how randomness is everywhere and how are we tricked by it. It is a great read and it may open a new world for you if you read it with care. How we infer causes from outcomes and forget the how randomness could have played part is key.Love the idea on the asymetry between past and future and He explains it very clearIn summary this is a very good book, with clear ideas. The only downside I found is that could feel a bit repetitive (some points are made several times).I definitely recommend this book as an starting read on randomness in our lives."
262,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54012013-terence,4,"I think this is a great entry book for anyone who don't think about statistics in a day-to-day basis. It gives insight into our everyday phenomenon through the statistical perspective, to understand if certain events are truly rare or just the way it happens due to randomness. The author did a great job in interweaving between the history of statistical theories and anecdotes of statistical fallacies in the modern world.This book is probably not for you if you are looking to dive into deeper theories. It is meant to be a breeze read for the general audience, sort of like the author's other work ""A Briefer History of Time"" that is making abstract concepts more accessible to the public by providing relevant everyday phenomenon."
263,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47312383-adarsh-j,5,"Author begins with an elaborate history of probability theory and how randomized processes are analyzed and goes on to cover many of the important researchers/inventors/scientists who contributed to probability theory. At each new concept, he makes a very good introduction by applying the concept to a real-world situation or cites many of the anecdotes and explains in quite detail, how a specific probability theory concept can be applied to understand the event. The final chapter captures the whole essence of the book, and concludes by demonstrating with various experiments, how randomness rules our lives! A must read for anyone who thinks that 'fate' is predestined, for it will give you a new dimension to think about 'fate' itself!"
264,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38538651-steven,3,"An approachable, non mathematical history and discussion about randomness, probability, and a little bit about statistics--a topic that I almost failed in college and has recently renewed my interest. I found the premise and closing chapter to be the most interesting. Here it is in three sentences:We all know the Serenity prayer: ""Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."" Randomness and complexity make it hard to understand what we can and can't control in our lives. But, learning what random processes look like and how they can, oddly, present a few reliable features, provides some helpful wisdom. "
265,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/736720-sreedevi-viswambaran,5,"Took a hell lot of time to read this one, but enjoyed each and every second of reading the book. I would have missed out on many things, if I'd skipped this one. The books explores the concept of Randomness in a unique way and iterates the fact that it is not so frequent in the world as we think. (Even forced me to learn the Java Random Vs SecureRandom basics once again). Many a times, author forces the readers to think on a metaphysical level. He showed me a spot where Mathematics feuds with the divine, the probability. Why didn't the Greeks foray into Probability unlike many other civilizations? May be it clashed with their concept of Divinity? I loved the book and looking forward to reading many more from the author."
266,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16024637-gary-godefroy,5,"I gave this 5 stars, but partially because of subject matter. The randomness of good and bad luck is a concept I believe is very under appreciated. Of course, how we deal with random events is key to our success and happiness. I once was performing blood typing and typed 6 Rh negative patients in a row. At 20% of our population, the odds of that happening are less than one in 80,000. That’s randomness, a little understood but major factor in all of our lives. A thespian told me it’s very difficult to walk like a drunk on stage, because we are not programmed to behave randomly, or even accept the influence of randomness, thus the clever title. Mlochinow, a physicist by trade, explains its nuances with humor and interesting examples. A worthy read, at least for anyone like me."
267,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2608334-danny,3,"There was a lot I liked here. Interesting examples of the role of randomness in our lives abounded. But I wasn't a huge fan of how the author slowly introduced basic statistical concepts one by one, surrounded by historical and biographical information about the originator. The author tried to appeal to readers with no knowledge of math or statistics whatsoever, which made some sections feel like a waste of my time (~20 pages to explain ""law of large numbers,"" ""normal distribution,"" etc). Still, the good outweighed the bad. There were some examples of typical randomness that were so compelling you might even change the way you think."
268,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70192568-peeyush-tekriwal,4,Randomness is something so trivial in our lives that we don't realize it unless we have a proper mathematics background or enough statistical curiosity to give it a go. The Drunkard's Walk lays out the evolution of randomness and statistics as we know today right from the beginning. It brings out some very interesting points about the early French and Greek education culture and how it helped shape the subject in its various stages. I would recommend it to anyone who is somewhat historically inclined in the evolution of the subject or even those who are interested in knowing how the world is governed by numbers.
269,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11201108-neha,4,"I wish I was taught probability this way when I was a student. Loads of counter-intuitive examples and an array of applications without intimidating the reader with cryptic equations. Randomness is not one of those over-coffee topics unless you are a mathematician of course. This book might just give you something to talk about other than small talk. Even if you are familiar with the concepts, the book is still very entertaining. Do not expect extraordinary writing or seamless flow between topics. The book is chatty and at times delves into thick math terms. But overall I really enjoyed this book and wish I would have read it as an undergrad."
270,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6908737-rahul-phatak,4,"This is basically an intro to probability book without the equations and with a lot of history and stories about their applications. Reading this with a prob-stats background helped me enjoy these stories a bit more. This book covers the implications of probability in our lives (such as the rate of false positives in medical tests and is a hot-shot mutual fund manager really that talented? Or is his performance just a fluke?) The title of the book ""How Randomness Rules Our Lives"" is covered in the last chapters when he talks about random small events (butterfly effect) can make huge positive and/or negative changes in our lives."
271,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4489591-matt,3,"Some powerful ideas, very little math, and fun biographical sketches of mathematicians and scientists- what’s not to love? Well, it’s so concerned with entertainment and readability that it seems to save all of its real ideas for the last two or three chapters. The author seems gun-shy of taking his concept (“randomness rules our lives”) into the math and science (you know, “the how”). A good introduction, but I expected more meat on the bone. Also, I know way too little about the counter-intuitive aspects of statistics. Maybe that should be the next step into exploring chaos and probability..."
272,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19423367-heraa,4,"A great book if you have an interest in statistics and psychology. Along the lines of Thinking Fast and Slow, this book details the errors in human intuition when it comes to dealing with probability. It goes over the famous Monty Hall problem, a favorite of mine, and does its best to explain these complex topics — however, I do think some parts of the book would be tough without a math background. I also would’ve enjoyed it more without all of the history behind the famous mathematicians; I understand the need for historical context, but at times it grew boring and I wanted to get straight to the math!"
273,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92661242-pedro-miranda,3,"This is a book about randomness...well sort of!The author does a good job explaining what is randomness and how it affects our lives more than we imagine. However much of the book is spend in the historical way that humans have tried to cope with it, for many centuries unsuccessfully, until the advent of a somewhat new branch of mathematics called probability and it's twin sister statistics. The history on those two branches is interesting but it takes the main stage on the book, only on the last chapter does the author goes in more detail on how randomness (chance, luck, fate, ...) affects our lives much more than we think. Overall an interesting ready, albeit a bit dry at times."
274,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17794099-emily,5,"I read Mr. Mlodnow's book on Seducing the Subconcious years ago at the encouragement of a professor and really enjoyed it, so when I came across this book on my library's audiobook list, I knew I would enjoy it too, and I did. I'm quite familiar with several of the topics he spoke of in the book,having read extensively on Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky and those in the field of Behavioral Economics and also having read Nasim Taleb and The Black Swan and other books on the aubject of randomness and probability. That being said, there was enough new material and interesting anecdotes that I found myself more engaged than not. Definitely a brief, but worthwhile read."
275,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62239960-lara,4,"I cannot think of someone without a statistical background who would not benefit from reading this book. For statisticians, it might be a bit basic, but it gives interesting background information on many principles and even something as basic as the equals sign. This book made me reflect on the philosophical roots of probability and statistics as well as mathematics and logic.Fun and quick even if you are not a mathematically minded person. And if you are anything like me, you will see the world just a little differently at the end of the book."
276,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11650200-rita,4,"It took me 2 months to read this. 2 summer months when I usually read over 10 books, none of these non-fiction. This to say it is complex and I could not read it in every mood or situation because I needed the right mind set to learn all this. To understand. It is a wonderful, mind-bending, eye-opening book to the marvels of randomness in our world. Numerous tales of numerous people I have heard of or studied their works throughout my education but never met like this. It was fun and inspiring and I highly recommend it"
277,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11003362-david,3,"This book was surprisingly hard for me to read. Perhaps it is that I am fairly weak in math, but I was expecting something a bit easier. Overall, this was a pretty interesting book, but I don't believe everything is random. From the big picture, perhaps, but individually, I think talent and charisma, along with outside biases, have at least something to do with success. Never the less, this book did open my eyes to a different way of observing some things, so I think it was well worth reading."
278,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71873-katie,3,"This book is a very readable analysis of various research over the past several hundred years that looked at aspects of odds, chance, luck, statistical likelihood of certain events occurring, etc. The historical context and the way he relates chapters to one another as part of the development of statistics and related analysis as an independent field (and as an important component in many other fields) is fascinating. I don't have enough background in stats to call this an easy read, but it's definitely a worthwhile read."
279,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32966209-giu,4,"found this to be a great introduction to the topic of chance. it brought up relevant matters regarding our day to day life in an analytical/scientific manner (and yet understandable thanks to the use of analogies and real life examples). I was mostly glad by the last parts that really brought up the matter to our lives and how more than what is it that you do or what you are capable of, chance is a big player in the course of the future will be and how, in search of control over our lives, we create mechanisms that separate us from the actual randomness of our lives."

The author, although not explicit about his faith, is obviously writing from an atheistic worldview. He takes many underhanded shots at religion and God throughout which many readers might not be able to pick up on. He gives credit to randomness for far too much (hedge fund managers investments, CEO decisions that lead to improved/declining business, box office hits/fails etc.)."
281,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/199295-mike-moses,4,"Very enjoyable popular intro to probability. Clever and engaging stories that illustrate principles and raise good questions about how we see the world around us. The only change I would make is the term randomness. I would prefer uncertainty, because humanity may not be the measure for perceiving order in the universe. We are certainly limited and do not see factors and/or are unable to see them. So, the question may not be about whether the universe is random, but about our inability to see the order. "
282,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1824973-sharon,5,"A wonderful foray into our understanding of probability and statistics. I have degrees in Math, so I know the underlying math but Mlodinow presents it in its historical context (something you don’t usually get in a college math class). He also gives good examples to illustrate how the math is applied to modern relatable problems and questions. Many people don’t understand the role of chance in our lives. This delightful book shows how the analytical tools of math can explain the paradoxes and fallacies that come with this misunderstanding."
283,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28618122-nick-johnson,4,"Nothing random about choosing a quality readWhile this is a bit of a beast to read, it’s absolutely worth it. We make the mistakes every day assuming we are smarter than we really are, and that those we see as a success are deserving of that. But we fail to give randomness its credit for the things that happen. With great research and examples to prove the point, Mlodinow tells am incredible tale of how sheer luck is ,most often responsible for fortune or misfortune, and how our revisionist minds fool us into believing things were more under control than we thought. "
284,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2094490-sophiebird,4,"I’m no math wiz by any stretch of the imagination, but this book caught my eye while down-sizing some material possessions. I found it pretty interesting, most probably will be more so for those more into math and probabilities. But quite readable. Includes the old “Let’s make a Deal” door choice. Also Gerolamo Cardano’s interesting chaotic life.Personally the title didn’t grab me, and pique my interest, though the further explanation of “How Randomness Rules Our Lives” did. I guess it has more meaning for math minds."
285,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39211947-sarah,3,"Mlodinow takes a wide variety of mathematical truths and applies them to everyday life in a fascinating way, showing how our intuitive understandings of things like randomness and probability are often inherently flawed. Interwoven with the various applications are historical stories of the mathematics and how many of its theories and discoveries came to be. For anybody who enjoys math (or statistics) or wonders why it matters day to day, this book has more answers than one could imagine."
286,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2952513-brenna,3,Expected a lot more from someone who coauthored with Stephen Hawking. I would have much prefered the book if Mlodinow could have wove a cohesive story around chance and randomness as displayed through statistical theories. This book is more like a history book of different statistical theories and the theories' founders rather than the theories themselves. Didn't really keep my interest very well. Don't recommend if you are looking to further understand measurement error. 
287,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731907-andrea-patrick,2,"Not a great choice for an audiobook. It sounds like there are some diagrams or graphics that are essential to really understanding some of the points. I tried listening to it in the car during my work commute, but gave up. Maybe I didn't get far enough into the book, but this is less about randomness than it is about statistics. And no, those are not the same things at all. Instead, read some Nassim Nicholas Taleb."

As a math major, i found that revisiting the core concepts of probability and statistics in the first 9 chapters of this book really fun and illuminating. If I'm ever teaching a statistics course at a university level, I could see myself putting this book on the syllabus as supplemental reading. It's exciting, approachable, and hard to put down."
289,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69004600-vincent-keenan,5,"This is a very fascinating book that i couldn't put down. There is some history of the evolution of probability and statistics, which is an interesting topic historically due to the attitudes of the worlds mathematicians at the time. What is far more interesting are the sections on how we perceive randomness, and how we are actually very bad at it. I highly recommend reading this book as a means of an ego check, and a simultaneous confidence boost... (spoilers!) "

Sometimes the book was really boring to read and throughout the whole book simple sentences were very difficult to understand because of the abstruse style of writing. But in general, I liked this book for interesting examples of different researches. "

Includes much of the history of the development of statistical methods dealing with random events and chance. May take the ideas a little far in the end as it almost seems to discount entirely the impact of ability, talent and motivation. At the same time, it does point out the need to avoid being discouraged by some early results and be willing to persevere until the right opportunity comes along."

It has taught me, too, to accept the chance events that may cause us grief.

The book provides a great review of the concept of randomness and the forces that generate it, the people who have thought about it and studied it, quantified and proofed it. He also helps us understand the limitations to what the math can tell us and about the impacts beyond the classroom in our everyday lives. "
294,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65205392-ralph-martins,4,"In ""The Drunkard's Walk"", Leonard Mlodinow has produced a book that could serve as background reading for any introductory college statistics course. This is a thought-provoking, well-told, occasionally poignant history of probability and statistics that speaks of our ceaseless struggle to make sense of randomness and chance. In that regard, it seems we're doomed to failure -- but this book made me smile anyway."
295,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2465856-hannah,3,"The Drunkard's Walk was reasonably enjoyable, even for somebody with very little mathematic or statistical background. It was a little like the older cousin to Freakonomics, and I enjoyed reading the different scenarios Mlodinow presented. The idea of true randomness, and whether or not it can really exist, is fascinating to think about and try to wrap your head around, and Mlodinow presents the concept in an accessible way while not shying away from real numbers and hard data. "
296,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99282974-jared-garretti,5,"Jam packed with some very cool stories about the history of probability math, how to calculate said math, and some neat anecdotes. It's a bit of a lengthy read, reinforcing with a LOT of examples that often times things just happen and that we have a lot of superstitions (lucky shirt, etc.) that people feel gives them control that don't actually affect anything. My favorite about the stock picks of Leonard Koppett. Super cool read. "

Mlodinow argues that events we consider random are not so random as such and there is always a trail behind it that we humans usually find after that event is occurred. He gave the example of Pearl harbor attack. All in all it's a good book to read, especially for those have a bit of statistics background."

Interestingly, it also devotes a large portion on how randomness itself is not so random, and the marriage of probability with statistics is a fruitful one to see. This however, applies only to a descriptive study and not an interpretative or causative study. The tinge of behavioral psychology on confirmation bias, and rationalisation leads to a very well nuanced view."
299,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105937419-nancy-duclos,5,"As a mathematics teacher, I was intrigued by the title of the book. However, it really appealed to me in just an academic sense. This book delivers excellent examples to support the theory of randomness in our lives over the vision of determinism. You do not need to be a mathematician to read or enjoy this book. It really puts life into perspective encouraging one to never give up because today might me your lucky day by chance!"
