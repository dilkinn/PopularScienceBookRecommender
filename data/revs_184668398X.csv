0,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Unsurprising, as all these books go. As a serial reader of quite interesting facts (as well as a devoted fan of QI) I could wish there was less repetition -- both within a book when similar principles govern multiple answers to questions or several people have different but very closely related answers to a given question, and between books. Still, reading enough of these -- in my experience, anyway -- you quickly learn to identify the questions that will have quite interesting answers, and skip the rest. It's all loosely organised into broad categories, too, so if there's something you're really not interested in or which you're gonna be above the level of due to your job/degree/whatever, you can skip that."
1,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91978487-rachel-keane,3,Interesting book filled with very clever people! The sort of book that you'll probably end up repeatedly returning to.
2,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5422636-c-c-thomas,2,"This is the third book in a series by the editors at New Scientist magazine. The magazine is divided into sections and is answered by a variety of people--some questions have many answers and it's almost like following blog posts on the computer.It is unclear who is answering some of the questions---researchers, scientists or general readers. It seems more like random readers of their blog so I'm not sure how much credibility I can give to their answers and many answers seem to even contradict one another.Anyone who reads trivia bokks (and this is just one trivia tidbit after another) know the pitfalls and pleasures of reading this genre. It is a book to read over time, not one to read at one sitting. Pick it up and put it down at your leisure. Overall, interesting scientific questions; questionable answers. "
3,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/382536-kerry,4,"I like these books. They're fun and informative and pretty easy to read.Every time I read one I say I'll start following the Last Word website that a lot of these come from, but I never remember. Maybe this time I really will?I look forward to the next one when it comes out.And for the record, the consensus was that technically it depends on your definiton of ""jump"", but no, elephants can't really just because of the realtionship of their size to their mass."
4,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34650950-mohammed-ghoul,4,"One of my favorite book series, it is fun, informative, and in short wonderful. I found many questions that I asked myself and forget to lookup or simply was too lazy to. This series is amazing as a short read, and is structured in the such a way that you can just read little bits and pieces of it every time your bored or have some free time on your hand."
5,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21120734-dineshsanth,3,"An Interesting read.Refreshed some high school stuff and learned something new.Most of the questions have more than one answer and some of them are very long with additional facts.It would've been better if the editor compiled the answers into one and listed out additional facts, interesting observations and witty answers separately."
6,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13818808-thex,3,Learned new & interesting things. I got answers to questions I didn't even know I had.
7,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21140655-simon,3,"Definitely interesting, but probably should have read it when it was newer!"
8,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87827040-charlotte-cowley,1,The questions seemed to bore me and the fact that there were five or more answers for the same question seemed pointless.
9,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16401942-james-luck,1,"I'm not quite sure how this managed to be boring, but it somehow it was."
10,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9680412-alayne,4,I love these books - so much knowledge crammed into one book and fun to read too :) 
11,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267866-audrey,3,"Why Can't Elephants Jump? contains questions and answers submitted by readers of New Scientist magazine. Each submission is signed with the name and location of the person who wrote in, although there are times when the submission is anonymous. While this doesn't always give us an idea of the expertise of the author (some of the writers sign with their job title, and are indeed experts), it does give the reader the advantage of having many different answers from different angles.Some of the questions submitted are things that we might all have wondered at one time or another, like whether a martini really does taste different if shaken rather than stirred, and why. Some of the answers are very scientific and may not be easily parsed by the layperson. I would have appreciated it if the publisher would have given USA units in parentheses after metric measurements. I know that metric is what nearly the entire world uses, and is the more scientific and accepted system, but the fact remains that most Americans have trouble with the metric system and would have an easier time reading and understanding this book with both measurements given.Why Can't Elephants Jump? isn't the kind of book you can sit and read for long periods of time--I tried. Instead, I think it is much better as a coffee table, or even a bathroom book. The articles are short enough that you can flip through and pick one to take a few minutes to read, then walk away a little wiser and somewhat entertained. If you have an interest in learning some of the scientific reasons for basic questions, you may want to check out this book."
12,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5673063-laura,3,"Being a trivia buff, I'm always drawn to books with questions like these. This one is unique in that it is a compilation of questions from real readers of New Scientist magazine and the answers are given by readers as well (hopefully, ones who know something about the topic). I love the range of inquiries over everything from bodily functions. But, the informality (and sometimes incongruity) of the answers makes me lack confidence in their validity, and more than once I found myself questioning the purpose of even reading it because of that. I think I would have rather the editors had taken it one step further and instead of publishing the exact letters received for the answers, to sum up the best answers as they see them. It began to become tedious to read 2 or 3 answers to each question. It would have been nice to include imperial versions of the metric units given in the answers for all the American readers who aren't as familiar with meters and Celsius - I'm a scientist and I still had to pause and try to put things into perspective. Overall, an informative and sometimes entertaining book, but I prefer the more succinct style of the similar books such as Why Do Men Have Nipples? and When Do Fish Sleep?. "
13,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4473047-amy-lost-in-a-good-book,4,"What is good about this book, is yes it is sciency, but it is fun science that everyday people ask and everyday people, plus a few professionals try and answer. It is a quick read but very enjoyable. This is book four I think, it refers back occasionally as past questions are reexamined, or variations at least. There is some super science things in there, but a lot is very simply explained, especially about distance or swimming in jelly or mercury. A very fun read and to quote Pocahontas, ""you'll learn things you never knew you never knew'. Unfortunately there is nothing in there about Sycamore trees, maybe that's waiting for the next book."
14,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,3,"http://nwhyte.livejournal.com/1882711...Another great collection of New Scientist columns with readers asking questions and other readers answering them. Lots of interesting trivia; two different answers given for why we westerners tend to eat a sweet course at the end of the meal (not totally sure I believe either of them); the title question is answered somewhere in the middle; at the very end, a question about how Big Ben is kept on time is answered by someone who had actually had the job of keeping it on time. Entertaining stuff."
15,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954160-gonza,3,"As a Trivia lover, this funny books with many ""scientifical answers"" was easy to read and pretty interesting, is perfect to have in the bathroom.Come amante del trivial pursuit questo libro che risponde ad un sacco di domande strane ma scientifiche, Ã¨ stato facile da leggere e piuttosto interessante, come l'edipeo enciclopedico della settimana enigmistica. E' il volume perfetto da lasciare in bagno.THANKS TO NETGALLEY AND OPEN ROAD FOR THE PREVIEW"
16,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/921981-ria,5,Another in the bestselling science series that asks readers to submit questions for other readers to interact and attempt to answer.Sometimes with hilarious results but also with a serious side for a reader to learn more about science in general. Some answers by the nature of the reader responding to the question are rather high brow and scientific but to be fair this is a pretty accessible read for anyone whatever their knowledge of the subject. Well worth reading. 
17,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192290-shahrun,4,"Another throughly enjoyable book in the New Scientist's Last Word series. I was amazed, fascinated, educated and amused. I find that despite the small size of these books, they take me a while to read because of all the information I'm taking in. I most definitely will read any other books in this series I can get my hands on! "
18,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12989827-omar-h,5,"I love the little every day questions answered in this book that make you wonder about even the smallest of things. It shows the true potential of scientists because this book allowed its readers to send questions to the scientists who made this book, this allows your voice to be heard in the world of science. That is why it is a 5/5. "
19,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8470316,3,"i just realized that i spent 10 months reading this book LOL. its a lovely book actually, gives scientific answers to questions i never thought about. My biology teacher recommended it for me and im really grateful. I LOVE SCIENCE PEOPLE!!!"
20,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4600163-jeff-wetherington,0,Some interesting questions/answers...but a LOT of useless conjecture-style questions.
21,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4862102-don,2,"Has it's moments, but most explanations could be whittled way down and still get their point across."
22,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11045889-erica,3,Interesting read 
23,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4190999-paul-forbes,3,Interesting and fun!
24,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26911988-lisa,2,Just so-so
25,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7302305-evander-v,4,"I always enjoy these little books - sometimes it's the gratification of knowing the answer, or having some of my knowledge refreshed, or learning something new."
26,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4322945-richard-barnes,3,"Great fun - a light-hearted, yet big scienced look at a wide range of topics. Why is poo like it is? What about hills where water flows uphill?Many questions answered."
27,184668398X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7492611-14,3,Nice for bed-time reading
