0,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772528-ben,3,"Recommended highly, but with significant caveats (thus the three stars).The simple, brilliant insight of this book for me was as follows (vastly simplified from the author's full theory, of course):People do things effectively -- whether it is to work, to learn, or to cooperate in any social relationship -- when they are ""self-motivated"". This means they must be (1) technically capable of doing what they are doing, (2) understand, not just ""know"", why they are doing that they are doing, (3) feel confident about knowing what they need to do to accomplish the work, and (4) agree with the personal outcome of that work.The book does a good job of taking this ""well, I suppose that makes sense"" notion and grounding it in science and defining it more concretely. The brilliance of the book -- and why I'd recommend it -- is that it so clearly outlines how simple ""good"" versus ""bad"" work/teaching/cooperative environments can be identified (and thus hopefully fixed). The book delves into the refined distinctions (beyond my over-simplification above) that the need for a good personal outcome is not necessarily the same as good global outcome, nor is understanding why a task is being done necessarily the same as a task being pleasant.If only the book stopped there...ugh! Instead the author seems to feel the need to show how somehow this makes humans morally good ""by nature""...The downside is that the author does not stop with the clear definition and examples of self-motivation. He takes the well-grounded science and drifts off in broader conclusions that sound a lot more like witch-doctor, Freudian, pseudo-science than well-defined science. Enter anecdotes that support statements but hardly prove them. Enter corollaries that may be true but certainly don't follow from the original, well-defended premise. This drifting too far from the science was summed up for me in the author's notion of a people having a ""true spirit"" (to clarify: I'm not denying the existence of a ""true spirit"", I'm pegging down the author, who is a scientist, for basing his conclusions on the existence of a vague, never-scientifically-defined concept.)Here's a example of the drifiting-from-science, taken from the concluding chapters:""Being free does not mean doing your own thing at the expense of others, however. Rather, it involves concern for others and respect for the environment, because those are manifestations of human connectedness. Freedom involves being open to one's inner nature, and there one finds the tendencies for both relatedness and autonomy.""The above may be ""true"" in a poetic sense, but as soon as the word ""because"" in the above paragraph, we're no longer talking science here. Ultimately, the author is saying ""tendencies"" of humans' ""inner nature"" cause unselfish freedom. That's quite plainly not a scientific argument anymore than saying it is the inner nature of birds to want to fly, and therefore they have wings...Lastly, there's the annoyance that - especially in these extrapolation-heavy sections - the author repeats and repeats and repeats the same terms and concepts over and over really to the point where (in addition to hampering the readability of the work) it feels almost there's hope the repetition will bolster the truth of the questionably-scientific argument. (If you don't hate the words ""autonomy"" and ""introject"" by the time you're done with the book, I compliment your ability to endure.) It's too bad that pseudo-science muddies the very strong, positive core message of the book.All in all, I have say this is a highly recommended read -- just be ready to keenly discern the legitimate science from the logical fallacies. I recommend balancing Deci's need to ""prove"" that humans are morally good by nature with a more brutally logical approach of an author like Stephen Pinker."
1,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51095341-mani,3,"I have a few messages for all of you reading this book.don't waste your time on work that you don’t enjoy. It is obvious that you cannot succeed in something that you don’t like. Patience, passion, and dedication come easily only when you love what you do. IT IS stupid to be afraid of others’ opinions. Fear weakens and paralyzes you. If you let it, it can grow worse and worse every day until there is nothing left of you, but a shell of yourself. LiSten to your inner voice and go with it. Some people may call you crazy, but some may even think you‘re a legend. Take control of your life e.. Even if it's for studying gfor an exam like the usmle.. Take full responsibility for the things that happen to you. Limit bad habits and try to lead a healthier life. Find a sport that makes you happy. Most of all, don’t procrastinate. Let your life be shaped by decisions you made, not by the ones you didn’t.Appreciate the people around you.. Your wife/girlfriend, your friends and relatives will always be an infinite source of strength and love. That is why you shouldn’t take them for granted. It is difficult for me to fully express my feelings about the importance of these simple realizations, but I hope that you will listen to someone who has experienced how valuable time is. We care so much about the health and integrity of our body that until death, we don’t notice that the body is nothing more than a box - a parcel for delivering our personality, thoughts, beliefs and intentions to this world. If there is nothing in this box that can change the world, then it doesn’t matter if it disappears. I believe that we all have potential, but it also takes a lot of courage to realize it. You can float through a life created by circumstances, missing day after day, hour after hour. Or, you can fight for what you believe in and write the great story of your life. I hope you will make the right choice. Leave a mark in this world. Have a meaningful life, whatever definition it has for you. Go towards it. The place we are living in is a beautiful playground, where everything is possible. Yet, we are not here forever. Our life is a short spark in this beautiful little planet that flies with incredible speed to the endless darkness of the unknown universe. So, enjoy your time here with passion. Make it interesting. Make it count! And remember God is Great as He will always help you achieve all your dreams."
2,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82335-leit,3,"Hmmmm...well I suspect I suffer from the malady of wanting to read more 'textbook' like renditions of psychological/sociological material because I just can't get into the whole Daniel Pink era of (what feels like to me) really simplified extrapolations of scientific research. I prefer to read the 'drier' stuff and draw my own conclusions...With this one, the conclusions and recommendations drawn and made by Deci just seemed so very intuitive and common sense given the basic outcomes of the research, but also, frankly just from my everyday experience with family, friends, co-workers and my own human nature.Overall I I do believe this is a good formatting of an essential set of concepts centered around the nature of how extrinsic vs. intrinsic motivations interact with our systems of learning and working within our everyday world."
3,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5857342-don,5,"Why We Do What We Do is one of those books I wish I'd read years ago. It's essentially a primer on self-determination theory, which is a grand theory explaining, just as the book's title suggests, why we humans do what we do. The theory holds that in order to flourish we must have three basic psychological needs meet -- the needs to live with authenticity, to feel competent in our work, and to forge close connections with others. One Goodreads reviewer complains that Deci at times ""drifts off in broader conclusions that sound a lot more like witch-doctor, Freudian, pseudo-science than well-defined science."" I think that's a fair criticism, but it doesn't stop me from giving this a full five stars, as most of the book's claims are supported by solid research, and its implications are profound and truly life-changing. Moreover, unlike the fascinating but academic and difficult Self-Determination Theory, this book is eminently readable."
4,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64574702-irene-kaloyannis,5,"In the last 8 months or so, I've read a couple self-help-type books, books I'm naturally averse to so most were read for classes. I despised one (that book is The Art of Not Giving a F*ck please do not read it, one day I'll get around to writing a review for that kaki) and found the others okay. This one was not only of very high quality, but has now become one of my favorite books. I was enthralled beginning to end (I actually read the whole thing in one night). I learned so much about how to motivate myself and others, and generally about how people function. Sure, it's a little repetitive and at times a bit overly optimistic about human nature, but those are such minor issues when you consider the strengths of this book. Do you know how hard it is to find a self-help book backed by science (and LOTS of it)? One that is clear and contains real, concrete, easy-to-implement advice? Very. This book may honestly be the first."
5,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33305360-louis,3,Interesting but you get the point halfway through.
6,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6087831-wiebke-kuhn,4,"Based in decades of research about how people get motivated, the message of the book is quite clear: Develop an autonomous self that has resilience in the face of people wanting to control you, and you will live a better life.The ramifications for any profession that can be considered a service -- education, medical, government are that we need to treat people in ways that empower them to be their autonomous selves rather than try to control them.On a more granular, education-focused, level, his research may be troubling to some: grades and competition are control-based and thus instill fear and drop performance over the long run. The idea that we should teach so that our students learn autonomously, without the pressures of grades and exams must certainly be counterintuitive to many, but his point is very much that we live in a society that is controlling and manipulating, and education would be one way for us to counter such trends."

8,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3475211-basma,3,I am very interested in the idea behind this book. Parts of it are insightful and parts seemed to be a repetition of what was previously said.I am currently going through my own bout of de-motivation so some of what was in here rang true and offered a different way to look at it.But there’s something about the way the examples are written in this book to support their studies that I wasn’t a fan of at all. I skimmed over most of them which was hard considering how they’re in between paragraphs but I felt their analysis was self explanatory that the examples just made it dull. 
9,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51018132-steven-woloszyk---wa-lush-ick,4,"B. F. Skinner, who many believe to be the father of behavioral psychology, believed in consequences. If good behavior is rewarded, it will be repeated. If we punish bad behavior, it will cease. This has been a mainstay with parenting, teaching, coaching, and in the business world for the better part of the 20th century and continues to be a prevailing thought today.Then we have Edward L. Deci and his band of psychologists that say, “Wait, hold up everybody!”Deci says that motivation is derived from “intrinsic” factors, not “extrinsic” ones. In other words, the carrots and sticks only go so far. In this book, he gives us countless studies that prove his point.Deci says that rewards and punishments make us feel controlled. He says that we may see some temporary bump in motivation with rewards, such as giving money for good grades on a report card, but that this motivation will be fleeting and when the reward is removed, the drive is gone.Deci says we want choices. We desire autonomy. We do not wish to feel controlled. He says that when we parents, teachers, coaches, and leaders provide clear communication with the outcomes of certain behaviors and combine that will offering choices, then we will see motivation that comes from inside which is far more sustainable than external factors.I learned of Deci from Daniel Pink’s book Drive. Pink’s Drive, published in 2012, is an updated and more modern version of Deci’s, published in 1995. They’re both great books and rebuff the previous thoughts of Skinner and show that to really motivate we need to go beyond the carrots and sticks.This book receives 4.4 stars on Amazon after 60 reviews. Goodreads gives it 3.95 stars after 833 ratings and 62 reviews. I gave it 4 stars. It is a great read for just about anyone, since we all have some responsibility for helping others find drive and motivation.#FridaysFind #MIAGD #Deci #Drive #Motivation #WhyWeDoWhatWeDo #CarrotsAndSticks #Pink"
10,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/883794-parcoast,3,"Again, I was assigned this book for reading for a class, and I have a mixed opinion. The content, meaning the ideas, concepts and implications of the author's message, is probably in the 4-5 star range. Deci's research showed very interesting things about what motivates us, and more importantly what doesn't. A few key points: rewarding someone for an activity they would have intrinsically enjoyed, results in them engaging in that activity less when the rewards are removed, even though they naturally enjoyed the activity. Parents, especially mothers, influence the level of materialism in children through the amount and type of attention they give, and as adults the materialism is expressed as undue attention on aspirations such as wealth. Finally, our relationships with our health care providers can be affected by the attitude and level of autonomy supported by the provider.So on to the bad news. I don't know what editor signed off on this book, but they weren't thinking about the audience. With such interesting content to share, why did it have to be so blasted boring? Most of it read like a research paper. I understand that it was written by academics, and they can't help but include a heavy dose of ""boring"" into anything they write, but that is why I blame the editor. Just like a computer program that isn't user friendly isn't tolerated in the marketplace, no matter is usefulness, books should not be allowed on the printing press that haven't been checked for delivery. There are so many things that could have been done to get this message across, the presentation here is a one-star effort at best.So, with all of this said, I will average this out to a cool 3 stars."

This was a very well researched and interesting study of the importance of letting individuals be ""autonomy-supportive"" or in other words making choices because of their own internal motivation. There are so many applications in this book from parenting to teaching and government. The importance of not being controlled and the responsibility that come with it are what lead us as humans to become most actualized. Definitely recommended for anyone in a leadership position. "

13,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1575371-stacy,2,"Good information, but could have been a lot more concise. I've read textbooks that are more interesting to read. I forced myself to read most of it because it was recommended reading for work. "
14,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/735855-karson,4,"The title of this book doesn't tell the whole story. If I didn't know any background about the author it is not something I would have picked up. Some background: Edward Deci and Richard Ryan are the founders of Self Determination Theory. I became interested in SDT in graduate school (Special Education) and wrote a paper on the theory and its relevance in alternative educational settings. The theory has really shifted the way I look at education.The theory states: All people have 3 basic psychological needs; competence, autonomy and social connection. Competence is the need to feel good at something - like there is at least one area where you could be the teacher. Autonomy is the need to feel like you have some control in your daily activities and your life in general. Social connection is a positive rapport with at least a few other human beings.People in ""one-up"" positions (teachers, bosses, politicians) can either thwart or nurture the fulfillment of these needs in people in ""one-down"" positions (students, employees, voters) that are in their care. A person in a ""one-up"" position has the power to create a climate where all three psychological needs are considered. When an autonomy supportive community that allows opportunity for people to gain competence is achieved it's members will experience more internal motivation, fulfillment, curiosity and vitality. That's basically the gist of the theory. The author goes into several intriguing forays throughout the book. A couple of the most interesting are 1)people with high ego involvement and what I will call 2)toxic internalizations. An example of a person with a high ego involvement is someone whose identity is easily threatened by others because they have rigidly internalized values like strength, intelligence and courage for example. Their self esteem is threatened whenever they are around other people with high levels of the three qualities. They will therefore get into pissing contests (sorry) with other people with those qualities because they are threatened by them.An example of a ""toxic internalization"" is a message that gets implanted into your brain as you develop for example, ""i will only have a positive rapport with you if you are good at sports."" If a 5 year old gets this message from a caregiver it is really threatening because it limits their autonomy and freedom. If they want to have a whole host of important needs met, then they need to be an athlete and the kid might not have an athletic bend. As the kid develops into adulthood they internalize this message and might shame themselves if they are not good at a physical challenge. Basically the adult creates a slave/master relationship within themselves so it becomes very difficult for them to participate in activities that genuinely nurture their true selves because their true selves are buried under a bunch of ""toxic internalizations.""There are a lot more interesting asides. The power in this theory for me is how transformative it can be when it is applied. People who have never felt like their voice has been heard will really blossom in an autonomy supportive setting. Reading about this theory really highlights how constrictive our society really is for some people. I have found that it is a pretty productive and meaningful lens in which to view humans. If you really want to respect other people in a deep way, I think applying this theory is a good way to start trying to do that. "
15,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23823689-grace,3,"In fairly simple writing, Why We Do What We Do: Understanding Self-Motivation by Edward L. Deci and Richard Flaste explains that humans perform best when they are totally “autonomous” with themselves and free from extrinsic motivations such as fame, money, and external pressures. The process of reading not only served as a valuable learning experience but also triggered moments of thoughtful self-reflection. The book's reasoning of how ""people can be controlling with themselves to satisfy their introjects...pressure (one)self, to force (one)self to act, or to feel as if (one may) have to do something is to undermine (one's) own autonomy,"" can allow one to identify how emulations of role models, aim for perfection and attempts to meet societal ideals can lead to the development of a false sense of self and attrition of a sense of self-worth, because self-satisfaction is contingent on whether introjects have been satisfied (or not). A downside to the book is that arguments or theories are corroborated with generalizations and numerous personal anecdotes instead of verifiable, concrete experimental data. A lack of discussion on the nature of the experiments (such as sample size of tested subjects or the controlled variables of an experiment) makes it difficult to affirm the reliability of experimental data and the authors' theories. Some of the anecdotal evidence even appear to be contrived to fit the “world of psychology.” On one occasion, the author reflects on an encounter with “a flight attendant who had a rubber band around his right wrist,"" and wonders “if he was using it as a behaviour modification technique where if you feel a particular rage or have a certain obsessive thought, you snap the rubber band” (193). Apparently, “the pain breaks up the thought pattern...by associating it with an unpleasant stimulation.” Why must the author automatically connect such a trivial item (a rubber band) to psychology? One who observes the world with a lens devoid of psychological views would merely assume that the rubber band had been worn hastily after untying a plastic container of airplane food for a passenger.Nevertheless, the book will provide to be an insightful read and opportunity for self-analysis.    "
16,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8853269-erik,4,"Deci challenges much of the conventional wisdom of teachers, managers, medical doctors and others in authority on how to get students, employees, and patients to do what is supposedly best for them.Carrots and sticks are usually less effective than the authorities seem to think. On small tasks threats and incentives can make a difference. For example, if you pay employees by the piece to produce items, then you'll probably encourage those employees to make more items. But if you want students to learn and remember knowledge beyond the test, if you want employees to do better and more creative work for your company, and if you want patients to commit to a course of treatment needed to get healthy, then outside motivation is not enough. In fact, external rewards and punishments may backfire, sapping any real motivation, which must come from inside a person herself.Deci thinks that we should support the autonomy of the people we're responsible for managing or directing. We can and should still have goals and we should still correct mistakes. But it's better to involve your employees in creating your goals and to let your students diagnose their own mistakes, as long as they have the knowledge to do so. If not, then a teacher can act as a coach, offering students the resources they need to achieve their own success.In the end, Deci is writing not just about performance or even fulfillment, but about freedom. What does it mean to live as a free person? Autonomy, which is not about just doing your own thing, but also about relating to others. Duty turns out to be the greatest satisfaction, which is an optimistic message indeed."

36,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5893960-shannah,5,"I checked out this book from the local library based on a book I recently listened to on CD, _Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us_ by Daniel Pink (which reminds me, I still have to put that book on my read list!). At the end of the book (as in many of this type) there is a list of books to read for more information about the topic of motivation.Why We Do What We Do is the second book I have read from that list (the first, Born Standing Up, was also really great), and I am so glad I did! So much of why I do what I do makes sense to me now, and I feel like I am in a much better position to effect real, permanent change in how I deal with life.For instance, this gem near the end is something I will strive to use from now on:When feeling overwhelmed by an emotion (anger, fear, humiliation) stop and ask these two questions to figure out what is really happening:1. What am I not getting?2. Do I really need it?Then, I can react to the situation as it really is, rather than getting carried away by my feelings.Deci explains why it is important to both feel/experience emotions fully, yet still be able to make a choice about how to express these feelings (see pp. 192-193 for the full explanation of these ideas).Deci also does an amazing job pointing out the differences between autonomy and independence, and describing how to help people feel autonomous, especially in situations where they normally feel controlled. The examples (like doctor/patient relationships, and parent/child or teacher/child interactions) are instructive and serve to further clarify the useful nature of autonomy support.This is a must-read for any adult (and perhaps even the precocious teen living with you), but is especially important for teachers, parents, bosses and employees."
37,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1323053-corey,3,"A good overview of the author's research on the psychology of motivation. The first half of the book examines how deadlines, pressure, threats, and even rewards have the paradoxical effect of reducing intrinsic motivation on many tasks. This happens because people shift their attention to external incentives and penalties. However, when people feel that they are choosing to do something because they want to do it, they tend to persist longer and learn better. Their feelings of autonomy and competence are enhanced, and this boosts intrinsic motivation. The implications of this research for parenting and business management are obvious, but it's less obvious how to enhance feelings of ""autonomy and competence"" when people really, intrinsically don't want to do something. One doesn't want to be controlling, but it's just as bad to be permissive. I'd recommend nurturing intrinsic motivation as much as possible, and then shifting to rewards and punishments if that's not working.The second half of the book was weaker, with an emphasis on psychoanalytic and humanistic concepts of personal growth rather than ""why we do what we do."" The book is still worth reading though, especially as a counterweight to the standard reinforcement explanations of human behavior."

It's fairly short (211 pages plus notes), and I read it in short segments, sometimes only a few pages a night, so that I could absorb it better. I'm following it up with other books that build on the premises established by Edward L. Deci and his coworkers over the past few decades. More recent books seem to amplify, apply, and illustrate the research Deci conducted. The compound word in the sub-title, ""Self-Motivation,"" might require a whole new word, yet it is truly the core concept of the book. Parents, teachers, employers, supervisors, coaches, and friends often try to motivate children, students, workers, athletes, and other friends, and almost invariably, such efforts are counter-productive. This book explains the difference between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, between authentic autonomy and submissive compliance or rebellious defiance. It shows why academic testing does more harm than good in the learning process. It challenges many widely held beliefs and assumptions. It's not always highly entertaining and can seem a bit dry in places, but I gave it five stars because it's a paradigm-shifting book that will change the way a reader looks at the world."
39,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47766728-ashleigh,5,"There were so many helpful insights in this book, but a few that really stood out for me were:* a better understanding of how to build autonomy supportive environments (not permissive ones). And what it means to actually support autonomy, Deci's whole take on the dynamics of one-up/one-down relationships was illuminating.* the importance of reflecting on one's own reactivity. I had never seen reactivity described as a manifestation of ego-involvement before. On the dangers of getting what you ask for. This reminded me of the classic ""do rewards work? Sure! They motivate people to get rewards"".They needed the numbers, so they directed their creativity and resourcefulness toward getting those numbers, rather than toward effective performance. This reminded me of the dangers of ad-hoc planning in a growing company:Social contexts that are extremely inconsistent and chaotic, that make it impossible for them to figure out what is expected of them and how to behave competently so as to achieve intrinsic or extrinsic outcomes, will lead to a thwarting of the human spirit. It will leave people with little or no motivation."

41,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2797583-hilary-roberts,4,"The message of this book was fascinating. It talks about what really motivates people to behave in certain ways and how to gain autonomy in our actions. It is very applicable to raising children, being a good leader, and just being a better person. The only problem with the book is that it required my absolute attention to understand. I sometimes had to re-read to get what the author was saying. It was worth it, though! It also helped that the book wasn't too long. When you are able to focus mentally, this is a fascinating book to read!P.S. I had this book recommended to me by someone who is getting a degree in this type of thing. Apparently Edward L. Deci is an expert with several different books."
42,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/967716-ethan,4,"This book was hard for me to get into, as it was far more academic than I expected. However, the content makes it more than worth the effort to adjust to the tone and scope of the book.One of the central ideas in the book is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and the far different results (short and long term) you get get from each. He spends a lot of time discussing studies and examples involving children, comparing traditional extrinsic motivators (e.g. rewards for obedience) to ways you can help children gain intrinsic motivation, even for tasks they initially dislike.However, he also transitions the ideas to management in the workplace, to give tools to managers struggling with the perennial issue of employee motivation."
43,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45144-penny,3,"This is a more or less popular press summary of the many years of research Deci did with his colleague Richard Ryan and others. It's kind of an oddly placed book, as it's a bit techy for a popular audience but at times too basic for an academic audience. For me, it was a good quick summary to get up to speed before taking a class on motivation.In fact, I only finished about 2/3 of the book, because the semester is starting and it's time to put the ""pleasure"" reading aside, but what I read was helpful for getting me into the topic without having to dig up all the individual journal articles."
44,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8152022-ahmed-afzaal,5,"Edward Deco summarizes four decades of research on human motivation for a lay audience. Should be required reading for parents, teachers, and managers. It's sad that even though these findings have been around since the late sixties (see ""Personal Causation"" by Christopher deCharms), most of us are still functioning in a behaviorist carrots-and-sticks model. Much unnecessary suffering can be avoided by taking seriously the practical implications of these findings. For those wanting to see the original research, dozens of scientific papers are available at Dr. Deci's website on Self-Determination Theory.  "
45,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6283235-christina-macapagal,4,"A very good read. I enjoyed all the scientific evidence that was able to back-up the practice of self-knowledge, autonomy, and autonomy support; in the book I have been using the term self-awareness side by side with self-knowledge because it seemed very relevant. I also could not help but think about eastern philosophy and practices while reading Deci's book. It brought back memories of Buddha, Osho, and Atisha as I compare awareness with Deci's definitions and descriptions of intrinsic motivation."
46,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10403232-tony,3,"Some good stuff here. Deci argues convincingly that rewards and bonuses, far from doing good, actually demotivate people in the long run. He distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation; intrinsic is when people do things because they have chosen to; because they have internalised the values and take pride in their work. He argues that the best way to motivate people is to give them as much responsibility as you can, to involve them in the decision making wherever possible, basically treat them as adults and you'll be amazed at the results. Refreshing to read."
47,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2662643-john-stepper,3,"This book lacked the substance and gravity of either Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" or Mcgonigal's ""Willpower Instinct"". It felt more like a grandfather's meander through life's lessons supplemented with personal anecdotes about children he's met along the way. Deci's points coincide nicely with the research published elsewhere, much of which he pioneered, but the presentation of it in this book limits it's usefulness. "
48,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33163117-slaim96,5,"This is my first read even in psychology. The book started boring (or I thought so),with the motif repeating too often. Then half way through the book I started to getthe author's view point on self-autonomy.This book speaks to me, exactly what I am looking for.I am lucky enough to have read it right after Fooled By Randomness, the two authors have many similarities in the writing style.Going to re-read it in few days."
49,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8634229-danielle,3,"Book #1 of the 14 I will have to read for my Managerial Psychology class over the next few months. The content was reasonably interesting, but the book does still fall into the dry academic category in my opinion. Learned some interesting things about autonomy-supportive vs controlling leadership/parenting/teaching/etc styles and a lot about choice. Wouldn't have picked it up on my own, but worthwhile read."
50,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30721486-tjen-wellens,5,"My key takeaways from this book:- autonomous vs controlled (compliance and defiance both being aspects of control)- autonomy-supportive vs permissive (setting limits)- balance autonomy and interpersonal connected- autonomy-supportive is always better for the development of the person, regardless of their circumstances - integrated vs introjected rules & values (introjection leads to stress and pressure (cf control))"
51,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7524721-tim,4,"Easy read to understanding our motivations - and why records and punishments are not successful. I would recommend this book if you are new to the topic. I have read a lot on motivations and behavioral economics over the last 5 years, so a lot of this I hasd read in other places. However, Deci is a leader in this area, so it was great to go back to the source. "
52,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020047-larry-hansen,5,"I read this in 1999 and, not sure why, decided to reread it.It really has interesting concepts and makes you look at how authentically your life is as compared to a life that is just a reaction to social controls and marketing bait.It is also excellent for teachers, parents, and employers who want their underlings to develope into autonomous beings rather than social robots."
53,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31490841-aaron,4,"This is a great read into the different forms of motivation that we have in our life. It is not a self-help book, yet its content has clear application in the realm of parenthood, leadership, personal autonomy, etc. The author argued his points convincingly, and the research behind it was fascinating. A great read for anyone looking to understand the psychology of decision making more."
54,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38018101-gregory-susinger,5,"I enjoyed this book, obviously by my rating. It's a good read with the core focused on authenticity of the self with an ability to act in a manner of respect to society, yet freeing to the individual. You wonder if you are the introjected or rebellious spirit. The conclusion is the strongest part of the book, more passion from the author."
55,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51032586-katerina,4,"A very good, concise and clear piece. Offers some inspiration on how to provide feedback, teach and motivate people without pushing them too much in your direction. Theoretical background and assertions are supported by examples, which also make the reading easier, entertaining and more animated. I would definitely recommend to anybody, from teachers and parents to business people and bosses."

232,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8146846-satyabrata-mishra,4,Simply loved it. Maybe a bit more academic in its style but still it was one of the most delightful piece of theoretical studies I've ever read. Especially the chapters on fear and sex. 
233,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12073673-lizzie-bray,4,Research here is being used to support many more investigations into the importance of self-motivation.
234,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/187472-jenn,3,"This book has a lot of valuable information, it's just not that easy to read! I look forward to a good discussion and some time to think about and implement the tools suggested in this book. "
235,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12628924-kristi-huettl,4,"I read this through my ""teacher"" eyes. I gained a better insight in to how to motivate students and what they need to feel autonomous. Recommend."
236,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115158-danielle,0,I'm reading this book for a class that I'm taking but it would be worthwhile even if it wasn't required.
237,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1280578-sherri,3,"Interesting book, though sometimes overly repetitive on reporting the research results. Could have been shorter and more concise still had the same impact. "
238,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/696679-mark-fallon,4,The never ending search for creating the best environment to bring out the maximum performance of individuals and the team.
239,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6467830-jaime,3,"Nothing hugely insightful, but worth it for the length as a good reminder of being an effective manager. "
240,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036930-alex-linschoten,3,First half is better than the second half (which seems a little dated).
241,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296432-ruth-hunter,4,This is a really good book and can give you some interesting facts about self-motivation.
242,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25483901-joel-wakefield,3,"Interesting concepts on self vs. external motivation, including very good insights on how external motivations, including both rewards and punishment, can lead to reduced motivation to participate in the underlying activity. But despite much discussion of how motivation needs to be internal to be effective, there is then not nearly enough of a look at how to develop that internal motivation, either in self or others. Bottom line - interesting analysis, but not enough prescription to be tremendously useful."
243,0140255265,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35598584-jonathan-hardy,5,I think this is a must read. There are more consumable books on the topic but not nearly as convincing or well thought out.
