1,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton,3,"Rather than really being a 3 star book, this is one of those annoying hybrids: at times a good 4 star read, at others a rather poorly edited 2 star book. If you are interested in the state of brain research and brain theory a worthwhile read for the information, but one I found at times quite irritating. Swaab's claim that we are our brains does not sound like anything particularly controversial when you start - it would be the same claim of many modern thinkers and scientists. Where Swaab differs is in his arguments for quite how much of us is not only our brain, but how that has an unalterable state determined by genetics and what happens in the womb. He is very much firmly on the nature side of the nature versus nuture argument. The science in this book is aimed at the intelligent lay reader rather than the real specialist. It is accessible, if at times a little dry. Like most books on the brain it describes the wonders of the brain through the problems that occur when it goes wrong. Occasionally, it would be nice to see more positive examples. Swaab lays some of the old tales to rest - we do not use just 10% of our brains, we use 100%. We do not lose millions of brain cells every time we drink, brains are more robust than that. And so on. It paints a very clear picture of the state of modern brain science and understanding of the brain. This is the good part. Where the book is less successful is juggling between short whimsical autobiographical sections, the hard science bits, and then opinion pieces. It is the latter I found particularly irritating. In the section on the effects of various drugs on the brain, there is a section talking about how many politicians are alcoholics or drug addicts. Interesting in its own right - I'm not clear what its relevance to this book is. The chapter on the brain's impact on religious belief is the worst - there is relatively little on the brain, but plenty of a Dawkins like critique of religion. Now I have no fundamental problem with this, and am comfortable with much of what Swaab writes, but it does not fit within a book that is about the brain - not on the challenges of religion. A more detailed discussion of the impact of religious belief on the brain or vice-versa would have been much more interesting. It seems to me Swaab lacked a sufficiently strong editor, who could point out the irrelevance of this sort of material. It also seems poor writing for a scientist to veer between evidence based science of which he is an expert in, and opinion pieces on subjects his opinion is just one amongst millions, without making clear which is which. To be fair, it is pretty obvious which is which, but I should not have to think about this in what purports to be a science book. And again, I stress this is not because I disagree with his opinion, but I'd wanted opinion pieces I would have read another book.One other observation. Swaab spends the whole book saying we are our brains. Then in the chapter on free-will he says we have none, because most decisions are made by our unconscious brain. The point he seems to miss on this, is that this seems to be saying we are not our brains - or at least we are not all of our brains. He seems to be saying ""we"" are our conscious self only. The unconscious parts of our brains are not really us. It would seem to me, as a non-specialist, that my unconscious brain is just as much part of me as my conscious one, albeit one I am not aware of. If what he is saying is that our unconscious brain is predetermined in its decisions then that is quite a different point - but it is not one he ever makes. "
2,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,1,"I don’t particularly argue with the premise of this, but the constant emphasis on how everything is pre-determined for us before we’re even born… I prefer to live my life as if I have free choices, as if I’m a unique person formed by all sorts of circumstances over time, not just by stress chemicals my mother released while I was gestating. As if I’m responsible for, if not what I am, then what I do with what I am. Swaab’s research removes even that responsibility, if you follow it logically: if paedophilia is caused by something in the brain, and successfully inhibited in some people by their amygdala, that leaves people with the defence, “Oh, my amygdala is too small to inhibit these urges, it’s not my fault.”You can extend that argument forever, and then what’s the point in living? We don’t experience it as just a series of chemical processes.I also noted that Swaab avoids addressing some things. I looked in the index for any mention of asexuality, for example — surely he must have considered studying people who don’t feel sexual attraction, in all of this? Apparently not. You can’t check up on any of his results and conclusions, because there are no references. He claims that socialisation has nothing to do with gender-based preferences in toys and later, by extension, professions. Tomboyish girls are, in his book, girls gone wrong: they just have too much testosterone, so they don’t prefer the things that biologically (he says) they should.I don’t like the way this book tackles the subject, even where I know that other research backs him up. I don’t like his attitude to other experts, to people who question his results, or… well, any of it. I’ve read most of this stuff before, but presented with much more care and consideration. I find something about Swaab’s whole attitude distasteful.Original post with some discussion here!"
3,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392101-scarlett-sims,2,"Brain science is a fascinating topic, and as I started reading this book I was thinking it would be a four-star. The first few chapters read like a slightly more technical Oliver Sacks, where the author describes various strange brain conditions. Swaab's worldview is materialist/reductionist, which becomes increasingly obvious as the book moves forward. The chapter on sexual orientation was particularly interesting; I liked learning about how much and what parts of the brain develop still in the womb. As I kept reading, though, I started to like the author less and less.I disagree with his fundamental worldview, but that wasn't a problem because I could still get behind the science. But eventually, his statements of opinion rather than fact started to overshadow the text and actually diminish his credibility in my eyes. My other minor complaint is that I don't think the translation was done particularly well. There were some awkwardly worded sentences and odd repetition. There is probably a lot of good information here for people who are interested, but the author's agenda-driven rhetoric undermines the research. For how technical this gets, you could probably find a more fact-centered and unbiased work."
4,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5772316-jenny-boyce,4,"http://bookreviewsbyme2.wordpress.com...My overall impression of this book was that I truly enjoyed it, yet when I pick things apart I discover that this book isn’t as great as I thought it was.There are many fantastic facts presented in this book. I found myself constantly highlighting information that I wanted to remember at a later date. I also found myself sharing the facts I had highlighted with my family and friends (much to their annoyance as there were a lot of facts to share).Yet although there were a lot of facts, some of them didn’t seem very believable. I found myself yearning to look up some of the facts in this book for a second opinion. For example, one of the facts that I highlighted was that “Recent studies have shown that girls who suffer from the eating disorders anorexia and bulimia nervosa often had problems at birth, including low birth weight. The more numerous such problems are, the earlier eating disorders manifest themselves in young adults.” I couldn’t quite bring myself to believe that as the author makes it sound as if all girls who are suffering from these disorders experienced problems at birth. There were a couple of facts like that which I had a hard time believing.Although there are a lot of facts, the story as a whole is somewhat disjointed. The book did seem more like a collection of brain facts as opposed to an education book providing a clear message on the brain. I also noticed that there was a good amount of repetition throughout the book. Sometimes repetition can be a good thing, reinforcing points from previous chapters, but with this book I found myself getting somewhat exasperated. The author references other chapters many times within a chapter, which rather than aiding in understanding, just served to make things confusing and repetitive.The writing in this book is really appealing. The book is written in an approachable manner, which makes it easy for anyone to read regardless of prior knowledge of the brain. The author also writes in a style that is really easy to read. The book just flies by because the author writes in such a simple manner.Bottom Line: I would give this book 8/10 stars. While my overall impression was one of enjoyment, when I went back to think about the book there were a couple of things that could have been improved.I received this book for review purposes via NetGalley."

I thoroughly enjoyed the panoply of facts and interesting research findings that the author describes then puts into a series of contexts (parental behaviour, education and crime to name just a few). If you are interested in finding out what the brain is used for, how it develops into a fully formed organ and what happens when it goes wrong, you'll enjoy this well-written and very entertaining book!

A book for those who like to understand medicine but are not doctors.
 This was an easy read of many technical, medical issues that plague our body, through the brain. All the chapters all sorted and the author has a way with words. The technical parts are explained without boring details. The author has full command of his writing. This book is written in a very approachable manner, which makes it easy for anyone to read regardless of prior knowledge of any medical school, even less neurology or psychiatry, the parts of medicine that studies the brain focused by this book. The book just flies by because the author writes in such a simple manner.BUT, and that's a big but, I don't like his opinions about our contemporary world. They are rather his statements than facts, and when it started to mingle with technical facts, it started to overshadow the text. It seemed that he had an agenda, it was to promote himself and his philosophical point of views. I started to check a few statements he made and that is more than annoying and actually, to me, that diminish his credibility as a doctor and teacher. That's my reason for taking out two stars.Otherwise, it's an easy, good book.I have to thank Penguin for sending me this book won in a Goodreads giveaway in exchange for an honest review."

I would've liked more background info. Also he tends to repeat a lot of example and that gets kind of annoying. Great book for the average reader, but if you're looking for more depth and science this isn't the book for you. "
8,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"We Are Our Brains: A Neurobiography of the Brain, from the Womb to Alzheimer’s by D.F. Swaab""We Are Our Brains"" is a fantastic biography of the human brain. Dutch physician and neuroscientist D.F. Swaab takes the readers on a tour of the brain’s design and functionality. With a great grasp of this captivating topic and direct frankness the author proceeds to cover a wide spectrum of interesting topics pertaining to the brain. This fascinating 448-page book includes the following twenty-one chapters: 1. Development, Birth and Parental Care, 2. Threats to the Fetal Brain in the “Safety” of the Womb, 3. Sexual Differentiation of the Brain in the Womb, 4. Puberty, Love, and Sexual Behavior, 5. Hypothalmus: Survival, Hormones, and Emotions, 6. Addictive Substances, 7. The Brain and Consciousness, 8. Aggression, 9. Autism, 1o. Schizophrenia and other Reasons for Hallucinations, 11. Repair and Electric Stimulation, 12. The Brain and Sports, 13. Moral Behavior, 14. Memory, 15. Neurotheology: The Brain and Religion, 16. There Isn’t More Between Heaven and Earth, 17. Free Will, A Pleasant Illusion, 18. Alzheimer’s Disease, 19. Death, 20. Evolution, and 21. Conclusions.Positives:1.	Well researched, well written and a much more engaging book than is the norm for this genre.2.	Neuroscience is one the most fascinating topics out there and this book is in the hands of a master. Brain candy.3.	Covers a lot of great topics within neuroscience and it does so very well. 4.	The main theme of this book is how the brain works. From the author, “That’s a conundrum that has yet to be fully solved, and this book can of course provide only a partial answer. It shows how our brains differentiate into male and female brains, what goes on in the adolescent mind, how the brain preserves the individual and the species, how we age, how we suffer from dementia and die, as well as how the brain evolved, how memory works, and how moral behavior developed. But the book also shows how things can go wrong. It looks at disorders of consciousness, brain damage caused by boxing, and diseases of the brain like addiction, autism, and schizophrenia, as well as the latest medical advances and possibilities for recovery. Finally, it looks at the relationship between the brain and religion, the soul, the mind, and free will.”5.	Through out the book, makes a great case that we are in fact our brains. “Everything we think, do, and refrain from doing is determined by the brain. The construction of this fantastic machine determines our potential, our limitations, and our characters; we are our brains.”6.	The importance of a the process that leads up to birth. “The conclusion of Boer’s PhD thesis was that smooth childbirth requires good interaction between the brains of mother and child.” “In one-third of cases, brain disorders that manifest themselves as a child develops are wrongly ascribed to a difficult birth. In fact, the brain defects that cause such conditions as learning disabilities and spasticity often come into being long before birth.”7.	The role oxytocin plays. “Different social contexts prompt the release of oxytocin in specific parts of the brain, triggering different types of behavior. It has been identified as the messenger of affection, generosity, tranquility, trust, and attachment. Oxytocin has also been found to suppress fear by affecting the amygdala, the center of fear and aggression. When affectionate social interaction like hugging takes place, not only do oxytocin levels in the blood rise but more oxytocin is also released in the brain.”8.	The importance of a stimulating environment for early brain development. “Studies have shown that orphans adopted before the age of two go on to develop normal IQs (averaging 100), while children who are not adopted until between the ages of two and six attain average IQs of 80.”9.	There is a great section on brain disorders. “Conclusions Addictive substances, medication, and environmental substances can permanently disrupt fetal brain development, leading to learning and behavioral disorders in later life. Congenital defects of this kind are known as functional or behavioral-teratological defects.”10.	I can’t stress enough all the great topics covered in this book including topics of which is still in its infancy. Sexual differentiation in the womb. “Hormones and other chemical substances importantly affect the development of our sexual orientation. Girls with the adrenal gland disorder CAH who are exposed to high testosterone levels in the womb are more likely to become bisexual or homosexual.” “In other words, sexual orientation is determined by many structural and functional differences in the brain, all of which develop in the womb during the second half of pregnancy.”11.	The hot-button issue of homosexuality from a scientific point of view. “Homosexual behavior has now been observed in around 1,500 animal species, from insects to mammals.”12.	 Discusses popular topics such as the causes of depression. “So depression is basically a developmental disorder of the hypothalamus.”13.	 A look at addictions. “Adult males who smoke marijuana daily for a period of years have been found not only to have a smaller hippocampus (important for memory), a smaller amygdala (affecting fear, aggression, and sexual behavior), and damage to the fiber tracts of the corpus callosum (left-right connections) but also to be more likely to develop a psychosis. Again, though, these characteristics may have been present before using cannabis.”14.	 Fascinating observations. “In the case of locked-in syndrome, families tend to be aware of consciousness before the doctors, but in the case of a coma families are more likely than doctors to be mistaken in thinking that consciousness exists.”15.	The two aspects of consciousness. “All recent research suggests that the joint activity of enormous numbers of neurons in communication with a number of brain areas provides the foundation for consciousness.”16.	A great chapter on aggression! “So our genetic background can contribute significantly to our aggressive and criminal behavior later.” “We’re born with different propensities for aggressive behavior depending on our gender, our genetic background, the amount of nourishment we received from the placenta, and our mother’s consumption of nicotine, alcohol, and medication during pregnancy.”17.	 A look at schizophrenia. “Schizophrenia is a developmental brain disorder that is caused by a combination of factors and is present at a very early stage—indeed, the main foundation is laid at conception. Studies of families and twins show that the genetic component of schizophrenia is around 80 percent.”18.	How current science is addressing some of these neuroscientific problems. “Many laboratories are now working on gene therapy for a wide range of diseases.”19.	Cognitive-inducing look at sports and the brain. 20.	A fascinating look at moral behavior. Great stuff!21.	 So much good stuff including a look at religion and the brain. I would need another thirty positives. Read the book!Negatives:1.	Overall, Dr. Swaab does a great job of in narrative terms explain what we do versus what we do not know. However, I would have liked a stronger emphasis on the consensus among neuroscientists. What does the subject matter experts say on each of these great individual topics?2.	No notes or formal bibliography. A shame because it complicates further research on my part.3.	Some of the findings are speculative and the author recognizes that.4.	Some hot-button issues and are assured to cause controversy and may in fact go against preconceived notions. Issues such as handling crime and punishment are very touchy and significant implications. Not to mention gender differences and the roles they play. Not everyone will find the kind of answers they desire but that is science for you. Science does not care what you desire it only strives to model reality.5.	Some redundancy. In summary, wow what can I say I really enjoyed this book. It was an intellectual and thought-provoking treat. Neuroscience is a fascinating topic and this book was loaded with a lot of great research and thought-provoking insights. A high recommendation!

9,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8571135-anna,2," A book about brains sounded like an interesting idea in the shops. It is always good to educate ourselves a bit more about things happening inside us (outside us, too, but that has less to do with this particular book) and why exactly all that happens. And this was a good book for that.It explained a lot of how our sexuality is formed, how at birth a lot of us is already defined and some issues are already present, even if we only recognize them later. And how our brain ages, and what that actually means. Rather interesting all in all, isn't it?The thing I mostly had a problem with was the style. A lot of repetition and this feeling of your granddad telling you his (and his parents') lifestory in the middle of all the science. Which, don't get me wrong, can be sometimes interesting and nice. Just that it is also rather easy to overdo, and now thinking about what I remember from the book... well, his mother was a nurse at a war and our sexuality is determined at birth. That's the two most obvious things. And I'm quite sure the first one is not the stuff I'm supposed to get out of this book.A very interesting read, but not as ground-breaking as I was hoping it to be. Definitely worth it if you are interested in the inner workings of the brain, and especially so if you know next to nothing about the subject. Easy to approach, but also felt to me like a lot of things were kinda skipped over or just mentioned in passing that might have warranted more attention. A good beginners' course kind of a book."
10,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,This book on the brain covers its development from womb to tomb and explains almost everything that can go wrong. The fact that mental dysfunction can cause bizarre and sometimes tragic behavior is unsettling especially the fact that any one of us could succumb to one or more of the many ways brain function can go wrong. In addition brain science according to the author doesn't give us much hope beyond the grave. The author delivers the bad news in a fascinating way that elucidates how this marvelous organ works. He often says contrarian things which I tend to like. I always want to hear something new. He says physical exercise is probably detrimental and if one can eat healthy and avoid obesity it is probably better to avoid exercise. The book has other heresies in it but that one is probably the biggest. The author goes on hot topics like the brain and spirituality and religion. He takes a new Atheist stance on these topics so the religiously inclined have fair warning here. The book is packed with wonderful tidbits on the brain and it is well written. I liked it a lot.
11,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174365-kurtbg,4,"This book is a great a fascinating read on the most important part of you - the brain. Everything you do is based on your brain's biology. Perception, understanding, response, emotion is all up to your noodle. The structures, the chemicals, and their damaged working are reviewed to provide a good understanding of what the brain does, how it does it, how the environment is perceived, and how we respond and are conditioned to response. Cultural/religious subjects are touched on, but sparingly. For instance, freewill and out of body experiences are discussed based on knowledge of the brain. What is freewill if your brain is damages or has a chemical imbalance which makes you angry, aggressive, or depressed and despondent? A light at the end of the tunnel? Is that just vision being constricted as you pass out."

Additionally multiple errors or problematic issues leading to brain diseases and disorders (Alzheimer, etc.) are explained in detail, amazing real examples are provided. Very useful overview of present knowledge about the functionality of the brain."
13,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55917699-atefeh-eghbali,5,The book is full of useful information. It is written by a brain professional so it has scientific words but it educates one in the way that we should look towards all people around us. I loved it and I think everyone should read it..
14,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93636016-mustafa-refaee,3,Every chapter is differently edited. Some of them are reallybgood and fun to read and some are just poorly written and edited
15,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8264810-chris-torretta,4,"This is a seriously intense but magnificent read! There's so much in here but honestly most of it is pretty easy to understand. There were some terms that I had to look up (yay for reading this on my Kindle!) but other than that it was relatively easy. “Take the myth that we use only 10 percent of our brains. You might well be forgiven for thinking this in the case of certain people, but I haven’t the faintest idea what prompted this crazy theory” This is also one of the longest books I've read in a while. That said it's daunting enough by itself but being non-fiction just added to the stress so I took this in smaller doses, reading one or maybe two chapters at a time depending on my ability to understand each chapter!And while this was easy for the most part, I did feel like there was a lot in here that I haven't read before. A lot of information about what happens while a child is still in the womb and how that affects their lives later. I didn't realize, although it makes complete sense, that so much depended on the communication between the mother's brain and the child's. But again, after reading it makes total sense. “When a pregnant woman experiences stress, the brain of a female fetus will become more male and vice versa” Some of this, however, just didn't want to stick to my brain! I think I will have to give this another read or two to be able to soak up all of the fabulous information!Definitely going to read more from D.F. Swaab! "
16,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20067259-nanette-tredoux,3,"A fascinating book, written by an important neuroscientist. The book is reasonably accessible for those with some background and an interest in psychology and neuroscience. A thought-provoking read, with the emphasis on the provocative.The style is peculiar, and I wonder if the work was originally planned as a book, or whether it was assembled post-hoc from existing articles and presentations. Some case studies and opinions are mentioned several times throughout the book. There would be nothing wrong with citing the same case study several times, but Dr Swaab repeats himself almost word for word, and this is jarring to the reader. A book on such a profound subject that makes such far-reaching claims and challenges people's fondly held beliefs in such an opinionated and controversial manner, needs to be written with the utmost care, and its scientific claims needs to be substantiated very carefully. A preponderance of Dutch studies are cited - nothing wrong with that, but the book ends up appearing less objective than it should be. This may be because the author was trying to reach a wider audience, but as a book aimed at a general audience, I do not believe it succeeds.Read it for the information it offers and refrain from engaging in mental debate with the very opinionated author."
17,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9512361-andrew-langridge,1,"This book is a useful collection of scientific information, but as with most neuroscience when stepping out of the realm of pure science, betrays enormous conceptual confusion. Take the title as an illustration: ""You are your brain"". This is a statement that is supposed to tell us something about the world, but how does the statement refer to the world, except by someone, who must be more than just a brain, referring to it?To make this clear, let's take a simpler statement like: ""Dick is a scientist"". If Dick really is a scientist in the world then the statement is true, otherwise it is false. But what connects the statement to the world? Where does this relation come from? The brain is just a collection of electrochemical processes, which patently do not have anything to do with Dick and whether he is a scientist or not. The truth is that a mind, not a brain, is required to refer to the world and give it meaning. Of course the brain makes a difference to how I refer to the world. If I developed lesion in the wrong place in my brain, I wouldn't be able to say anything at all, but this doesn't explain what it means to speak the truth about the world in the first place."
18,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1975296-evanston-public-library,0,"The premise of D.F. Swaab’s book We Are Our Brains is perfectly reflected in its title: thanks to inherited genes and hormones washing over our fetal brains, our future characteristics, talents and limitations are largely established by the time we’re born. By adulthood, there is little about our brains that can be modified. Swaab, an internationally renowned neuroscientist, explains how mother and unborn child ‘work together’ for a successful birth; if they don’t, the child’s development may be thwarted. Swaab shows how gender identity and sexual orientation are predetermined by hormones in the womb. He delves into adolescent and adult brains; how brain damage alters personalities and creates fascinating illusions for the afflicted (schizophrenia, autism, and a host of unusual conditions). Lastly, Swaab explores human morality (it’s an animal thing), religiosity (determined by genes and the brain); and the ‘Near Death Experience’ (just the brain shutting down). We Are Our Brains is an excellent read; highly recommended. (Russ K., Ref.)"
19,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,3,"This book starts out much stronger than it ends. I don't think I've seen a book quite peter out like this before. The front chapters are quite well written, rich in info, easy to follow, and possess a strong thesis. I love how he explains the brain and how the develop relates to various behaviors. He's quite specific in what can enhance or harm child brain development.The later chapters start to mix in holistic treatments, but only half-heartedly. It's almost as if this book is a mirror of what we know of the brain, i.e. we know what we know and stuff we don't know we aren't going to take a stand on, but we will acknowledge with no suggested conclusion that might be more ideal for a book with chapters.If you're new on the brain and want to get a general overview across various different pathologies, great stuff. If you're interested in a specific segment of brain research (e.g. alzheimers), I'd go with something more directed toward this, although I'm not certain such a book exists that is also formatted for the laymen. "
20,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15709343-ellen,4,"This controversial Dutch doctor says that everything about human beings can be explained by the biology of our brains. It was interesting, for example, to read that natural labor is triggered by the baby's brain communicating with the mother's brain, when the mother can no longer provide enough nutrition to sustain the baby. He is also quite matter-of-fact about gender orientation being determined in the brain before birth. He condemns boxing, which is quite popular in where I live, as a form on inflicting deliberate neurological damage on one another and says that all religious experiences can be explained as hallucinations. He also explains the biology of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. It is a very readable book, even funny toward the end of many chapters."

25,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101666715-d-e-m-i,4,"During the process of reading the first quarter of this book, I've read some of its reviews. Of course not all of those reviews were positive and now that I've finished reading it, I'd very much like to spread my own personal opinion about these types of comments. What piqued my interest is that the majority of the negative comments that reviewers posted, had something to do with the following two points: 1. Swaab presents some of his personal conclusions as scientific facts.  This is definitely true, although for me personally it did not ruin the experience of reading this book. Throughout the first quarter of the book it became clear to me that it is also written to be entertaining to the public, and therefore I read it as such. If you keep in mind that you are not reading a scientific article, you will most likely not be disappointed in the end. The effortless way in which Swaab explains the extremely complicated functions of the brain really is an eye-opener for those who are interested in the subject, which should not be underappreciated.  2. The human race does not have a free will, because the brain is fixed from the moment we are born.  Swaab does kind of state this, but I'd like to add that the term free will is defined in his book as a choice that does not have any type of influence from the out- or inside. Of course, if you define it that way, it is not that hard not to be able to have a so called free will. Furthermore, it is very important not to forget the other views that Swaab has around the subject. In the last chapter of his book he concludes that it is your personality that is fixed at the beginning of your life, not your behaviour. From the moment you are born you have to learn how to deal with who you are, because that is something you can't change. But you can in fact learn and decide how to behave, even though your default tells you otherwise. Although this might not be a comfortable situation for the individual, it does mean that in a way we do actually have a free will. Just not the one defined in this book. In the end I did really enjoy reading this book. A lot of the things that Swaab writes about are from his own experience, which results in a fascination for his dedication to research. On the other hand he does tend to turn down the beliefs of some other scientists, which bothered me at first. However the extremely sassy manner in which he does this makes him seem less serious, which works really well for the entertainment that this book offers. "
26,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3074982-keith,3,"The first 1/4 of the book covered sexuality, variations on sexuality, and sexual disorders.The next 1/4 of the book (or more) covered other disorders related to brain function. One of the strangest is where a person does not want a part of their body (such as a hand or arm), and wants it amputated.The book gradually moved into more general issues with occasional relapses into describing disorders. The latter parts of the book were perhaps less interesting than the first half because it was less densely packed. It very clearly describes the negative impact on brain size of various drugs, specifically tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana, both prenatal and as a teenager. It encourages caution in medicating pregnant women.Dementia was addressed along with willful termination of life before it becomes advanced. (Voluntarily ending one’s life is legal in the Netherlands.)It is very Netherlands specific because the author lives and works there. Fortunately, the translation did not seem to affect the readability. The author is very heavily into the belief that our preferences are largely determined by what happens before and immediately after we come out of the birth canal. He discusses the social issues associated with us having only the illusion of free will. Along with that, the origin of morality, and of the value or harm of trying to change others (such as sexual orientation.) Also: What is the value/effectiveness/effect of trying to change those who exhibit socially undesirable behavior.Especially the first half of the book is full of authoritative factoids. However, I was disappointed that in a work of this kind, there are few references, no footnotes, no endnotes, no bibliography, and nothing at the back of the book suggesting sources for further study. Since the book has a heavy dose of the author’s own research, perhaps that is understandable to some extent. Also, it would be difficult to document such a huge number of assertions. There were occasionally places where another work was cited, sometime a book with a dissenting viewpoint. Still, I was disappointed that the cited works were not listed at the end where they can be easily found at a later time.The book was interesting. I almost felt like reading some of the works of one of his opponents, Mario Beauregard."
27,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38835862-sylvia-snowe,4,"A very interesting book that will change your mind about your brain and yourself. The author uses real science to link your personality, mental health, and abilities to your brain. He also shows how genetics and epigenetics affects your brain and your mental and physical health. The book's weaknesses comes from the author's desire to fight it out with religious fundamentalists about our sexuality and other issues. Skip through that part. Another weakness is that the author constantly states that our lives are pretty much established by the brains we are born with. Dr. Swaab is an older man, and a Netherlander, a country with its own unique history and culture. But, compared to the US, small and not very diverse. In the US, you can move to another state or different region, and you can be someone else. Maybe we have certain limitations with our brains, but our society is so profoundly complex and ethnically variable, we are all a bunch of strangers to each other. I'm a German-Norwegian who spent much of my life around Italians and African Americans. Then I moved to New England, and I feel like I moved to another country. And we all change our minds: behavior modification therapy is the best thing that ever happened to a lot of autism spectrum kids, and other neurologically challenged folks. My niece had all sorts of physical and mental limitations, but because of therapy and the dedication of her parents and teachers, she was a cheerful and outgoing kid, even though she could barely talk. Dr. Swaab perhaps suffers from tunnel vision, after spending so many years devoted to brain science. He never lived in five different states in the US, where so many of us rewrite our lives, despite the limitations of our brains' legacies. But I highly recommend the book, as you will definitely learn so much from it."
28,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15024040-jenn,4,"This is an interesting tour of the human mind from birth to death (taking in Alzheimers along the way). As I become older, I realise more and more that we are controlled by our brain, not that we are independent minds with a free will. Swaab even argues that paedophilia is a mental health condition like any other; or that psychopaths have an undeveloped amygdala compared to normal people; or that alcoholics, drug addicts and gamblers all have an predisposition towards addiction which was written into their brain from birth (albeit influenced by environment). It throws on its head current punishments for criminals and raises many interesting questions. Such as, if we treated criminals as sick people and gave them the appropriate therapy would they be cured of re-offending? And would it in the long run be cheaper to society? And are current punishments - solitary confinement etc - making the criminals worse instead of better?I can hear people saying this the woolly headed brigade, but even if you are acting out of rational logic rather than compassion, there is something to be said for it.Neuroscience is a very interesting field, and one that is barely understood I think. It seems to me it is like understanding a city, scientists know the location of the buildings - the cortex, the cerebellum etc - but they don't know much about the people inside them.The book is not perfect, he wonders off on too many tangents for one thing and brings his own prejudices into play. But still, very interesting concepts. I found the chapter on Alzheimer's disturbing due to personal experience, and almost had to skip over that bit. Particularly the photo which I found upsetting."
29,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10935009-michelle,2,"The book includes interesting facts about the human brain. But, you will have to check these facts for yourself and all of them might not be as absolute as Swaab tries to make them out to be.I found the book philosophically very deterministic and it can certainly induce a fatalistic attitude on the reader's part. I find the extent to which Swaab seems to think everything is predetermined by our brains' development independent of our personal input, societal influence and our current environment (he lengthily discusses the environment of pregnant women and the possible effects on fetuses) exaggerated, and this permeates the text. This may leave the reader thinking that they do not have the capacity to change themselves or their lives for the better at all, or even those of their children who may have passed a developmental phase already or suffers from a mental, cognitive or neurological disability. While, in fact, there is much one can do to improve oneself - and if we are our brains, our brains - well into old age. Swaab is not completely oblivious to this, but the resigned overtone might have you miss the glimpses of it - which is at times incongruous with the rest of the text.I do not agree with Swaab's philosophical standpoints, or his inadequate definition of free-will. I believe that despite the impulses we may have as result of our brain chemistry, we very much still have control over what we do about it or how we act upon it. In that lies our free-will and our responsibility."
30,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78736419-stephanie-fang,4,"Swaab’s account of the development and deterioration of the brain and its role in influencing human behaviour is detailed and supported by numerous case studies and evidence. This enjoyable read propelled me towards learning more about neuroscience and had taught me a lot about the brain anatomy and its relevance to human reactions and emotions. He had also given interesting arguments on abortion by providing interesting insights on how the brain is developed in the womb. “The wiring to conduct pain stimuli from the foetus’ cerebral cortex is in place by the twenty-sixth week”, hence suggesting that is “seems unlikely that premature babies can consciously feel pain before the twenty-ninth or thirtieth week”. He introduced many parts of the brain that I have never encountered before, such as Broca’s area (crucial for language), and extensively described the various roles of the hypothalamus and amygdala, which was very interesting to me. He also described the link between the propensity of obesity and the condition of the mother’s pregnancy through evolution and the body’s way of developing defensive mechanisms so that the human being will cope better in the future under the same conditions, such as facing long bouts of famine.In conclusion, “We are Our Brains” is a truly remarkable book and although it is a strong supporter of the nature argument, he still gave counter-arguments occasionally and did not disregard the nurture argument completely. "
31,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61034279-yanthe,2,"Disappointing read. I can't help but feel like Swaab presents a lot of his opinions / personal conclusions as scientific facts in this book.One example of the things that made this book lose credibility for me, was that he presents an anecdote about his children choosing toys that fit their stereotypical gender roles, even though he gave them all kinds of toys, as some kind of evidence that children are not socially conditioned to behave a certain way. Let's not forget children are not only raised in their own home, but get impressions *everywhere* they go. He then describes an experiment with monkeys, female monkeys choosing dolls and male monkeys choosing toy cars and a ball. This still does not *prove* anything to me. How old were these monkeys? Had they already been observing other monkeys of the same sex, doing certain "" gender related activities"" their whole life? I mean if a male monkey observes every other male monkey in his life doing ""technical"" stuff, he might take that on. I mean sure, hormones possibly play a role, but I still see no proof whatsoever that this completely debunks the social conditioning theory. I am sure Swaab is very knowledgeable on physical matters of the brain, but this does not make him an expert on the complexity of gender identity. "
32,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29542455-vaish,5,"4.5 stars! This book was a big chunk of fascinating information about the brain, something I'm deeply interested in, so even before I started this, I already knew I would love it.This book is told so anyone who has got a slight interest in the brains or other medical topics as well (literally anything honestly- from birth to anorexia to religion) could read it, because it is not told in fancy medical terms but in rather 'normal' language. It really makes it easier for people who want to know more, but feel like they aren't smart enough to understand difficult shit like this. Believe me, you can. The reason why I did not rate this five stars is because of the lack of sources. I trust a famous neurobiologist, but with sources listed it would have been more impressive and reliable. Also, because this book is about dozens of topics, the author could not dive deeper into some very interesting stuff or this would have been 10.000 pages long. I don't say this book should be longer, but some things I had liked to be better explained. Perhaps it will be in the sequel - I can't wait to start it. "
33,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63656163-joseph-knecht,3,"The author gives a good overview on the inner workings of our brain. It seems that the behavior of the mother during pregnancy can influence the personality of the child to a great extent. This could influence his sexuality, aggressiveness level, stress levels, etc. Furthermore, his claims correctly that we don't have free will; too much exercise could be bad for you; placebos are as effective as most drugs, religion and prayer have a calming effect on the brain comparable to meditation; transgender could be linked to body integrity disorder (thinking part of your body doesn't belong to you).His research is mostly based in the Netherlands and gives a lot of examples of studies conducted in the Netherlands.There is no doubt that our brain development and genetics has an influence on who we become, but I think the environment plays a more significant role than the author describes. "
34,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110246805-tosca,4,"Although not a sitting-on-the-edge-of-your-seat read like Harry Potter for instance, I thoroughly enjoyed it! It gives in amazing insight into what has been discovered in the field of neuroscience, Dick Swaab sometimes giving his own views on how he believes society has not yet conformed to an optimal state based on these recent discoveries.His way of writing, with the use of jargon and subtle hint of sarcasm, allow us regular folk to follow and yet enables us to understand complex processes, making us (me) feel intelligent! It makes it an enjoyable and incredibly interesting book to read.The book is solely based on neuroscience, and the effect our brain has on who we are, so if that’s something you’re interested in, I definitely recommend it! However, if it’s not really your thing, I think the book will be quite a struggle to get through."
35,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87165204-david-solis,4,"Swaab did a great job at writing this book and condensing a lot of very important information when taking into consideration how our brains and minds operate. This book is heavy into physiology and the connection between the mind and the body. Both are interrelated and both depend on the other, from the womb to the tomb! There is no such thing as coincidence for ailments of the mind, and Swaab wrote the book in a manner that connects circumstance with biology. Nurture and nature have their separate conditions, yet they are more often than not very codependent on each other and Swaab shows that in various examples and research. Four stars, only because the book is VERY 'dense', in the sense that it doesn't take a breather. "
36,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64969714-jill-deschuytter,3,"Phew, glad this one is done. It was interesting but also draining. When you read it from start to finish you start to notice the repetition of things. It was said in the beginning that this would happen but it did irritate me near the end. It wouldn't be a big deal if you just went to the subjects you were interested in most. I also think the author may have pissed off some people. In some cases he comes of very strong, almost rude and not without judgement. Still, I found some things I can use for my fanfic writing and I enjoyed the chapters on dementia, brains and religion, addiction and autism. "
37,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70062983-vyoma-patel,4,"This book was well written and explained many phenomena. I found certain chapters more interesting than others because of my personal curiosity in certain subjects. When I was not so interested in the topic, I felt overwhelmed by the amount of technical details explained. This is definitely not a light read, it is a LOT of information but it helped me understand certain behavioural tendencies of humans and their origins. In my view we can never know enough about the human condition. So after reading this, you will definitely approach certain psychological conditions with more empathy and patience. Which is why everyone should read this book, because compassion in regards to human differences is too scarce in our world. Still. "

There's no index or references to any of the studies Swaab references, which makes the book seem very conversational, and also highly repetitive at points. I wasn't entirely convinced of everything Mr. Swaab was suggesting in the book. Certainly the discussions of the moral implications of our genetic heritage and how it affects our day-to-day lives. Overall, not too bad."
39,902543522X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103767979-sam,4,"I really enjoyed this book and it was not too difficult to read. The book was long but I really enjoyed the structure and how topics were set up. It never got too overly specific or complicated with medical terms and I genuinely do feel as though I have a better grasp on how the brain works. I also appreciate that I don’t have to read the book cover to cover, if I want to read a more specific section I don’t have to read whatever was written before that to be able to u sweat and what was written. Overall I enjoyed reading this book."

A great read which sheds more light on how we operate as humans and a page-turner for people who like to read about brains. Shame though, that mr. Swaab can't resist negatively mentioning other people, sometimes even embarking on a page-long rant about a certain researcher. Nonetheless a book with great value and interesting perspectives.

I didn't realize it had originally been written in 2010 - maybe because I grabbed it from the ""recently checked out"" section at work, and it was in relatively good condition. I found a few good ideas, and some interesting things to think about. Swaab knows his stuff, but also has strong opinions, which in some cases had me cheering and in others had me frowning."
