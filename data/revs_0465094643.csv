It so horrified them that 100 true copies were printed for the scientists and a highly abridged version for everyone else. The research was not confirmed for another 60 years.What was so horrifying? Male Adelies mate with anything, baby penguins, dead frozen corpses, other males, they don't care, they just want to stick it in and fuck, and damn the consequences. The females, apart from chimpanzees and humans, are, it seems the only animals to go in for transactional sex. The males collect stones for nests and present them to the females and then they mate. But some females go and take the stones and then hop off, leaving the male frustrated! One female was seen to do this 62 times in an hour :-) Presumably these were the males desperate for a real live female rather than going in for abusing babies or necrophilia. Well they got their rocks off, didn't they? :-)Bats. Male bats have big, dangly penises. Scientists have said that the more promiscuous a female of the species is, the bigger the willie of the male. Really? Does this apply to just bats? (What about human cultures? Do men have tiny willies in cultures where women aren't allowed any sexual freedom?) Bats also like oral sex. Researchers are investigating if the male not only licks the female but also inserts his tongue into her vagina to scoop out rival male's sperm. Fair enough, but there is no investigation or evolutionary justification given as to why the females enjoy giving blow jobs.Vultures. The reason they can eat rotting flesh is that they have the strongest stomach acids imaginable. Their poo is so strong it can kill germs ('kills 99% of all known germs' like Dettol. Do you think it could be advertised as natural product?) and the author was told she could use it to 'wash' her hands. She declined, understandably. But if you see vultures standing around with shitty legs, they aren't dirty, it's their very effective way of cleaning them. Disgusting.Turkey vultures defend themselves by projectile vomiting, up to 10 feet, their stinking stomach contents which are so acid they can burn the object of its displeasure. Turkey vultures do not make good pets. Since they only eat rotting meat, not good for eating either.It was always hard to think of any of the vulture family with any kind of affection or even real interest in their lives. It's even less so now.Sloths. Their fur is specially designed to trap water to feed the fungi, algae, moths and insects that live in it so it can 'make like a tree' and not attract predators who can't see it.They have the slowest moving digestion in the mammal world. One shit a month. Just as well as it would take them all day to climb down the tree and then back up again. Since they eat plant material and do not shit, the gasses build up inside them. This has the effect of making them very buoyant and they are good swimmers, doggy paddle and even back stroke, at three times the speed that they can move in trees. ,One of the sloths, the so-called two-toed sloth which has three toes but only two fingers is very bad tempered. If annoyed it will hiss and bare its two big front teeth and then swipe at the enemy with its huge clawed hands. Since this is done in slow motion, escape is not a problem.________________The book was really about debunking myths and changing popularly-held feelings about the animals featured. It is easy to debunk myths. No one nowadays would believe that beavers are capable of organising and controlling a construction gang, But changing feelings, that's harder. It is difficult to see vultures as 'pure' and 'noble' as eagles although (old world) both are in the same family. It is just as difficult to think of hyenas with the admiration and fascination granted to the animals they most resemble, the big cats and wolves.I enjoyed the book. It has the cheery irreverence of Mary Roach, but is considerably deeper and with more scientific research than her books. A five-star read. I would say I would like to read other books by this author, but she seems to only write about Sloths and I'm not sure that there's that much more to say about them that I'd want to know."
1,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33359750-lisa,5,"Beware:After reading this book you may walk around spouting mostly useless but absofreakinglutely fascinating knowledge! Seriously, I believe my squat, hairy man was getting a wee bit sick of me! I adored this book. If it's an animal and its wild, then I'm gonna love it. From bats that are hung like a horse, to legends of beavers chewing off their 'nads to save themselves. Sloths, hippos, hyenas ""I've always loved hyenas."" Many, many more. I liked hearing about the old beliefs about animals daily doings. Just made me wonder how many misconceptions we still have today. This book also had me on my computer looking up everything I could of Glass Eels. I've never eaten eel, and now after discovering their life and death journey, I'm pretty sure I'll never eat one. Remarkable creatures. Yeah, this is definitely a book I'd recommend. I enjoyed everything about it. My thanks to the publishers, and Netgalley."
2,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,4,"I just love how Lucy Cooke assembles and presents her information. Always interesting reads, and such a clarity of prose. In this book she traces the beginning thoughts of thirteen different species, and some of these facts were dingers.To give just a little preview, I will share a few tidbits from the book. Eels, which I find creepy and slimy, were thought to arrive out of the mud. To this day no one has figured out how they procreate. Japan is now the biggest consumer of eels, though Italy had its share.Beavers, almost extinct in Europe, so they decided to import some American Beavers, hoping they might all get along and have beaver babies. Turns out the American beaver is much more aggressive than the European model. Go figure!!Bats, shver me timbers, blood suckers of lore. I love them because they eat tons of bugs. Also as far as sexual parts go, the male bat is very well endowed, in relation to size of course. Also, theirs is the sex life that is the closest to our own.Frogs, during the middle ages, they foolishly believed that if the woman held a frog in her mouth during sexual relations, she would not conceive. Birth control by frog, can you believe it?Stork, well we all know that storks bring babies, don't we? A young married couple in Germany believed this so strongly, and when the story was not forthcoming with said child, they were shocked to find out they had to have sex first.The hippo, if one had flase teeth many years ago they were likely made from hippo teeth. Also there are now Randy hippos in Co!umbia. How did they get there, ask Escobar.Penguins, their sex life was kept secret for many years. Think I'm going to keep it secret too. Read the book. The sex life of penguins is rather shocking."

Photo by Ontley, on Wikimedia Commons)I knew I was going to love this book when, on the very first page, I learned that sloths shit only once a week. How could you not love a book that teaches you such things?? And on the very first page?? OK, maybe the lackadaisical manner in which a sloth's intestines push things along is not the most important thing to know.... but it's still interesting. Sloths' metabolism is so slow that it takes 14 days to fully digest their food. Imagine having to wait 2 full weeks to get rid of that holiday meal you couldn't stop eating.Other interesting tidbits found within these pages include:•Some fruit bats have colour vision that's 3 times as good as a human's.•Hippos secrete a slime that looks like blood but is actually an insect repellant, sunscreen, and antibiotic all rolled into one bright red super-goo.•Secretions from beavers' anal glands are commonly used as ""natural vanilla flavouring"" in foods and cosmetics. Yeh, you know you've been thinking about becoming vegan for a reason!•The highest a bird has been recorded flying is 36,000 feet or 7 miles (11 kilometers)!•Some species of frogs can fly. •Vulture excrement is an excellent disinfectant. (I'll take the author's word for that and continue using Lysol.)Lucy Cooke takes us on a wild ride through the animal kingdom, sharing many such facts. She explores ways in which several animal species have been misunderstood, and shows us how each of them is actually very well adapted to their environment. Sloths are not lazy; they have evolved optimum ways in which to survive the rainforests of South and Central America. Bats are not greedy blood-sucking vampires but help keep insect populations under control and pollinate flowers. Vultures are not disgusting creatures to be obliterated -- they help prevent the spread of disease by bacteria like botulism and anthrax. We humans have long compared other animals to ourselves, seeking to judge them by human standards. This is a mistake, as each animal has evolved the physical traits, habits, and appetites that are best suited for its unique environment. This book is fascinating and fun to read. My only complaint is that the author includes examples of horrid animal experiments. We are all no doubt aware of how many horrific things have been done to animals in the past; indeed, we are STILL doing horrific things to them. I could have done without reading about it and actually had to skip over a couple of pages. Was it really necessary to include that in the book? I think not. I don't see any purpose served in that, unlike talking about things humans still do to animals. Those things should be talked about, people should be aware of the immense suffering we heap upon millions of animals every single day. That aside, and a somewhat boring chapter on eels, I highly recommend this book. It's important to learn about other animals so that we are more likely to appreciate their intelligence and inner lives. The more we learn about them, hopefully the less complacent we become over the unnecessary suffering we heap upon them. Also, books like this are fun! Evolution by natural selection is one of the most beautiful and fascinating things I've ever learned and books depicting the evolution of life are such a joy to read! There are so many other interesting and thrilling facts I learned in this book that I had to often pause my reading to share them with my partner. Thankfully she is very patient and indulges me, and also loves to learn new things. I'm not sure many people would want to be around me when I'm devouring a book like this one! Since I can't possibly share everything in this review, I will instead suggest you read the book for yourself. Prepare to be wowed!

I read a lot of nature books and I want a few things from a book. I want a book that shows that an author really loves animals, that I learn something new, and that I am not bored while learning. Well this did all three and then some! It is obvious that the author loves animals, it is nearly palpable! I giggled and laughed through out this book! The things I learned, well, I wouldn't find in any other book!When the author started talking about sloths, well, I was smiling already. They are so adorable but then the way it is written makes it even more hilarious. I really started giggling when the description came up of making them move fast. Then on to the female hyena penis delivery of babies or the sex act. Bat orgies or vampire bat blood spewing and so much more! I was hysterical with laughter! There are myths in there too, they had me laughing as well. I hadn't heard them before. Wait til you find out what they put beaver gonad ass juice in that we use today, so gross! This is certainly a book that covers my three MUSTS for a nature book. It is a must read for anyone!"
5,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"This is a book filled with very interesting information about a select set of animals including sloths, bats, penguins, hippos, frogs, eels, pandas, chimpanzees, hyenas and others. Lot of the information is lesser known, and makes for engrossing reading. For instance, hippos genetic makeup shows a closer match with whales rather than any land animal. How do vultures promptly appear when animals die? And so many other interesting bits of information.Lucy Cooke closes the book with some excellent passages about how in our thinking we have distanced ourselves so much from animals. We think of them as things which exist for our use, and have license to perform cruel experiments on. The passages in the book on the cruel experiments performed on bats to satisfy our curiosity on how they navigate and using frogs for pregnancy tests is sad to read. Pandas for their cute appearance have become a political industry where they are artificially birthed in captivity and don’t lead very satisfying lives.While the book for the large part makes for excellent and very engrossing reading, it would have benefited from some more material on what motivates the behavior of each of these animals. I received a free ecopy from NetGalley to provide an honest review."
6,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,4,"In The Truth About Animals, Cooke takes us on a tour of the animal kingdom and peels back the layers of mystery surrounding all of these animals. She explores the history of our understanding (or misunderstanding) of each animal, along with the latest science on how they really are. Thirteen animals are covered in here, and every one gets its own chapter, so each is fairly short and snappy. My favorite chapters are the ones on hyena, hippo, and panda, but I enjoyed almost every one.This reads a lot like the Planet Earth documentaries, but with more focus on the historical misconceptions of the animals and how those myths were propagated. It's a fun book filled with lots of interesting tidbits. If you ever wondered about why sloths are so slow, how pandas became sex-shy, and whether bats really drink blood (and so many other questions!), this would be a good book to check out."
7,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56146790-whitney,4,"Overall: This is a very fun and interesting read about many different species of animals. Each chapter is focused on a different animal and there is lots of great information. The author discusses myths and legends and proceeds to debunk most of them through meticulous research and an engaging voice. There is also lots of history and information on different research projects that have been conducted over time 7/10The Good: This book is so interesting!! The author does a fabulous job at presenting lots of information in a fun and constantly interesting way. Below are some of my favorite facts presented throughout the book:Sloths only poop once a weekMale adelie penguins are one of the most horny creatures on earth and have been known to mate with frozen corpsesVultures have such extremely acidic stomachs that it enables them to ear carrion and this is actually a huge defensive benefit to us because it helps to prevent the spread of many horrible diseasesFemale hyena have the largest clitoris of all animals and are extremely dominant and intelligent animalsMoose have been known to gorge on “drunken fruit” and get quite happy themselvesTo this day, nobody has been able to figure out how eels reproduceWayyyy back people believed that if a woman held a frog in her mouth during sexual intercourse she would not become pregnantThe Bad: Some sections seemed to drag on a bit, especially the chapter on eels. There is quite a bit of discussion of different research projects that are quite grisly… I understand the benefit and need to know about them but I really didn’t want to read about all the horrible things people have done to animals. Wish there was more on aquatic creatures and just longer in general!"
8,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,5,"A book about animals and their odd behaviours? Count me in! ""The Truth About Animals"" by Lucy Cooke takes us on a worldwide journey to meet everyone from a Colombian hippo castrator to a Chinese panda porn peddler, all to lay bare the secret--and often hilarious--habits of the animal kingdom. Charming and at times downright weird, this modern bestiary is perfect for anyone who has ever suspected that virtue might be unnatural (from synopsis).This is such a unique and fascinating read, full of interesting information that I haven't come across in any other books. Perfect for those who enjoy learning about animals, fact lovers and those seeking a lighthearted and super-funny read. Some of the facts could be considered crude, so it isn't something to purchase if you are prudish. Cooke maintains that we have many misconceptions about animals and makes a conscious effort to correct these within this title. I feel that once people know some of these stories that they will want to know more. I sincerely hope Cooke writes another similar book, she has certainly found a niche. There is noone else I know making such excellent books, full of the oddities that exist in the animal kingdom. Although this is non-fiction, I feel strongly that a vast swathe of fiction-only readers would appreciate it too. The reason people usually give for not wanting to venture back into non-fiction is that the genre is dull. ""The Truth About Animals"" will change your mind! It is far from boring! I adored it! Highly recommended.Many thanks to Perseus Books, Basic Books for an ARC. I was not required to post a review and all thoughts and opinions expressed are my own."
9,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,4,"This book is the myth buster for the animal kingdom focusing mostly on those animals that cause revulsion like eels, bats, hyenas, vultures but also includes the cuties of the animal world such as hippos, chimps, penguins and pandas.For me the book started off on the wrong foot, (or is it animal?) as I don’t find eels all that fascinating but I very quickly realised that this is a meticulously researched yet accessible book with just enough humour to make this fun as well as education.From perverted penguins, beaver testicle tax, the moon migration of birds, the link between hippos and Pablo Escobar, frogs as pregnancy tests and so much more, the book is filled to the brim with interesting facts and myths.We should not laugh at the early explorers’ misconceptions as our society is still full of misunderstandings and fake news. What we can laugh at are the drawings of these early explorers. Some of these looked like 5-year olds letting loose with crayons (I am specifically referring to the sloth picture here)Also, hats off to the author for trying out some fantastical things while writing this book. From parasailing with vultures to trying frog smoothies.Absolutely recommended"
10,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2970379-manybooks,5,"With The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife trained zoologist, award-winning documentary film producer and now author Lucy Cooke introduces and showcases thirteen diverse animal species (from freshwater eels to chimpanzees) to not only give readers detailed and informative (engagingly recounted) portraits of the latter, but to also and equally demonstrate how our own actions and behaviours, how mankind's approaches to wildlife (and how human superstition and our tendencies to anthropomorphise and impose our often restrictive moral and ethical codes on other animal species) have often lead to major misunderstandings regarding the lives, the purposes and the general roles in a given ecosystem for animal species such as sloths, bats, hyenas, vultures etc. (that we are very quick to both condemn and even sometimes strive to actively annihilate animal species that we consider to be imbued with such negative human personality traits as cruelty, laziness, even the potential for evil, although in the majority of cases, these animal groups are both perfectly suited and adapted to and for their habitats and yes, like for example with bats, hyenas and vultures actually do play important general roles keeping vermin in check by devouring billions of insects or preventing the spread of disease by scavenging, by consuming mostly or primarily flesh from the deceased, from animal and yes, if unburied, even human corpses). Now while I was reading The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife, it also became rather painfully obvious that in particular natural philosophers and scientists have sadly and frustratingly over the millennia, over the centuries been some of the absolutely worst offenders and villains with regard to imposing human characteristics, human superstitions, fears and animosities on animal species other than ourselves (claiming, for example, that beavers were socially organised construction companies and that bats supposedly were sexually deviant, even though their sexual practices are actually very much like our own, for bats as a species are in fact more closely related to primates and thus also to us, to humans, than to ANY other mammal species), not to mention the already alluded to above vehement and silly opposition to and often active hatred of scavengers (even though they provide such an important and essential general global service). But even more problematic is the sad and true fact that for ""science"" for ""discovery"" both amateurs and professionals have repeatedly both then and also still sometimes even now often viciously and cruelly tortured the very same animals they have been studying. And yes, I was rather unpleasantly surprised and disgusted at and by this (although in retrospect, I probably should not have been) when I read about the multiple instances of ""scientists"" actively and very much deliberately maiming, blinding, deafening bats in order to study how they hear and how they fly at night, or that before we figured out that many birds migrate in the fall to warmer climates, there was for example the idea floated around that swallows submerged themselves in water to wait out the winter, and of course this was then tested by deliberately drowning the poor birds and then trying to (and of course unsuccessfully) revive them (and while I have indeed found all of this presented factual information most interesting and enlightening, it has also proved infuriating, and even though I do very highly recommend The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife I do leave a caveat that many of the human ""mistakes"" and misunderstandings regarding animals will make those of you who love animals and want to protect and help animals at best a trifle upset, although I still do absolutely and highly commend Lucy Cooke for both detailing these experiments of what I can only call terrorism towards animals and that she is also always both ready and willing to vociferously condemn and disparage even those scientists and natural philosophers whom many of us seem to somehow consider heroic and proverbial sacred cows and thus above and beyond criticism, such as Carl Linnaeus, Charles Darwin, Georges Cuvier, Aristotle just to name a few). Highly recommended, and yes, a fun, engaging, informative (and also never tedious, never dragging or monotonous reading experience) The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife has been (with the detailed footnotes/endnotes and bibliography at the back and that the latter is in fact divided into specific sections corresponding to Lucy Cooke's presented chapters being both appreciated and very much an added bonus). But truth be told, I did kind of already expect there to be an included bibliography in The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife (just because of the subject matter at hand and that Lucy Cooke is obviously not just presenting her personal observations but also her own secondary research), but from my own academic point of departure, especially this here particular bibliography really does totally shine, and mostly because of the way it is organised, as I have always found that bibliographies based on a book's chapters or sections considerably easier and much more user-friendly to consult for especially supplemental research purposes than those bibliographies that just appear as one large and all encompassing list."
11,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,4,"Dear Lucy Cooke (and other popular science writers),I am enjoying your book enormously, as I did The Little Book of Sloth, thanks very much. You're not a USian, so this is an easier-to-explain mistake, but ""Fox News"" is not a news channel, it is an entertainment channel, which means you should be skeptical of anything ""reported"" by them on air. If it's an amusing anecdotes about how stupid someone is, a popular theme, then it's sure to be bogus, maybe entirely, but certainly in all important details. I mention this to you, because you probably care about the credibility of your book, which clearly is less of an issue for your US publisher, Basic Books.Less than five minutes with Google will get you to Snopes and a brief but thorough account of how the only truth in your two sentences is that a German couple attended a fertility clinic. Storks are a later embellishment to the story.Please fix this before the next addition, because your book really is a fun demonstration of science as a process, chock full of bizarre theories and stranger facts. The stories of credulous writers in the past repeating outrageous claims made by other writers is sure to inspire a feeling of smugness in your readers that you probably don't want them to feel towards you (although it is an accurate demonstration: you probably had a fact-checker who confirmed that Fox had repeated the story but didn't check out Fox's source nor sought out evidence that it was an urban legend).More later: I haven't even gotten to the pandas yet.***That is both an upper and a downer. Cooke has chosen to focus on species that challenge both the conventional wisdom and the science reporting on animals, and it is fascinating. The Comte de Buffon is a treasure trove of strong opinions which are hideously misguided, good solid eye-rolling fun. But it's not just 18th century natural philosophers who are wrong, oh no, bubble-boy. There's a parade of wrongness since the earliest writers to the folks in the field right this minute. Certainly there's lots I thought I knew that ain't necessarily so. There's errors in the field, assuming one population of a species is interchangeable with all, there are errors born of insufficient observation, and errors in reporting, and so very many errors in assumptions. As I mentioned before, the world needs more science writing that shows how theories evolve (or fail to).Tl,dnr: humans aren't special in any of the ways we've ever thought, except our (so far as we currently know) unique ability to eradicate other species.

When you see photos or videos of animals doing human type things we tend to put human personalities and our morals on animals and it really doesn't work. They have their own tales to tell us and in a lot of cases the truth is much much stranger than the fiction.Cooke is the founder of the Sloth Appreciation Society and they make an appearance in here as she dispels the myths about them being lazy and explains the crucial part they play in the ecosystems in the forests that they live in. We will learn why vultures crap on their own legs, which animals partake in prostitution and necrophilia. How pandas are not as sex adverse as we think that they are and what happens when they stop being cute. Lots of animals were considered to appear from out of the mud at the bottom of ponds, including frogs and eels and swallows were though to stay at the bottom of ponds over winter and appear each spring. Migration was only properly discovered when a stork turned up with a spear from an African warrior in its neck. If you want to know why an African Hippo is making itself at home in Columbia and what they are actually closely related to and also to find out if moose are actually drunken reprobates then this is a good place to start.I am not sure that science books are meant to make to laugh out loud and chuckle away to yourself, but this did. Cooke dispels lots of myths and uncovers secrets about her selected animals so of which have been suppressed for almost 100 years. It is an enjoyable popular science book that still has its foundations in serious research in seeking to understand just what makes animals do what they do. 3.5 Stars"

That’s what this book is all about. Lucy Cooke mows down all the absurd beliefs about animals we have held all our lives, as well as the preposterous beliefs shared in years past, but also shares all the equally ridiculous, but true, facts about animals.

This is not a book for prudes! Cooke makes a conscious effort to correct sanitized, Disneyfied views on animals by bluntly discussing penguin orgies, bat penises, the allure of sloth poo, and the intriguing nature of hyena anatomy. This is also not a book for people who are triggered by animal abuse. Cooke elaborates on the mythology around animals and how scientists in recent centuries (and decades, sadly) conducted cruel, almost senseless experimentation in the name of science. It used to be a great mystery as to where European birds went in the winter. Some believed they transformed into other winter birds, or hibernated in deep ponds (cue many horrible bird drownings to test this theory), or even migrated to the moon.I requested this book largely because I have a deep love for sloths and wanted to read that chapter, but I ended up learning something new on about every page. Some of that information was a bit on the disturbing side--I never expected to learn of a chimpanzee's cocktail-swilling and self-pleasuring ways--but it was consistently fascinating."

I’d have to say that my favorites were the sloth, hyena, hippo, and panda, although all of them had interesting tidbits. Cooke’s extensive knowledge, research, and travels creates a book full of detailed information and anecdotes. And while I absolutely loved delving into all of these interesting creatures lives and habits, I have to say that Cooke’s conclusion will stay with me the longest. Her keen observation about how humans view their relationship to animals was incredibly well said and, in my opinion, very accurate. "

Think you know a lot about the sex lives of penguins, the antibacterial qualities of vulture poo or the just how well-endowed bats are? Well, think again, my friend! Cooke brings readers into the private lives of thirteen animals and shows just how misguided (and often downright wrong) we've been about animals over the centuries. While the research side got a little heavy in places, overall, she successfully balances the information (both ancient texts and more modern beliefs) with a healthy dose of humour and it is clear that she truly loves and respects the beasties she studies. This is an informative read but it's also peppered with truly hilarious anecdotes that will have readers giggling out loud. You can't NOT laugh about myths involving beavers pelting hunters with 'unique' missiles, chimpanzee farts, or be in awe of hippo suntan lotion or shocked by the special ingredient in some vanilla extract! (Yikes!) But I know my husband was thankful when I finally finished this book because after reading each chapter I'd regale him with funny tidbits about sloths, moose (my fav!!), pandas, eels etc. The man can only take so much of my giggle-filled updates of all things animal, apparently.Human arrogance, rampant anthropomorphism and ignorance has proven to be detrimental and downright lethal to many animal species. From hippos to pandas, to hyenas and the slooooowww moving sloth, Cooke's knowledge, respect and love for animals is evident and hopefully readers will become more informed about the unique and fascinating creatures in this bestiary so that we can better appreciate and understand them before it's too late."
19,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"The Truth About Animals is a collection of history and latest scientific findings of 13 amazing animals that have been largely misunderstood. To name a few: sloth is not the nature's misfit but a strong survivor and a perfect result of the natural selection; The cuteness of pandas in our eyes severely distorted our understanding of the animal (sex-shy? no); Live African clawed frogs were used in the first reliable pregnancy test, and this frog species, brought by humans to the rest of the world, may be responsible for the deadly amphibian chytrid fungus that is wiping out other amphibians species all over the world.Humans have been looking for meanings and drawing moral lessons from animals since ancient Greece. In this book, Lucy Cooke discusses that in medieval Christian literature, religious views heavily influenced the early western understanding of many animals, from the drunken moose to the penguins thought to resemble the conservative Christian family values. Anthropomorphism is the consequence of the human psych, as it reflects our false belief that we are the center of the natural world. The author criticizes China's panda conservation--the inadequacy of protecting the animals natural habitat, the focus on AI-based breeding program only, and the re-wilding of these animals has a long way to go."
20,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42788125-rosie,2,"This book did not give me what I expected and the reason is because I think this book was aimed at people who are looking for an unusual insight to the animal kingdom, which I already have since I'm on my second degree in an animal science-based degree. Nevertheless, there were some really good facts in here - I won't say what because, spoilers! The animals covered included some of my favourites; freshwater eels, pandas and frogs. The writing seemed largely anecdotal and some parts read like they were setting the scene for a fictional story - something I wouldn't want in a non-fiction book. The main issue for me was the disparaging remarks about significant figures like Charles Darwin and Carl Linnaeus, implying that their work contained too many errors; if like Carl Linnaeus you devise an entire classification system for cataloguing the entire world's living creatures, there's bound to be the odd error here and there - hell, scientists continue to rearrange and reclassify species following major research but that doesn't make the work by Linnaeus wrong!There were some references to additional reading that I definitely intend to have a look into, because that is one of the things I love about non-fiction books on animals - the reference list! For those looking for a fun 'Did You Know' read about animals, with a fair amount of history thrown in, this is excellent. For me, this felt like an opportunity to showcase the animals the author has an affinity for in a very positive light but the chapters covering some other species were littered with derogatory remarks regarding the species' worth. This was the best quote in this book: ""science is not going to save biodiversity; a shift in human behaviour is the only thing that is going to save it"" - unfortunately, this hits the nail on the head."
21,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4714060-ron-s,5,"Oxford educated zoologist and documentary filmmaker Lucy Cooke offers a wildly entertaining random miscellany of thirteen animals, debunking myths and offering unusual insights for each. The new millennium was ripe for a new David Attenborough, and it's hard to imagine a more perfect one than Ms Cooke, a zoological cross between Mary Roach, Bill Bryson, and Richard Dawkins. Funnier than any HBO comedy special I've ever seen, this is the sort of book that could easily inspire a teenager's career path. The animals profiled aren't the Disney versions. Equally fascinating and perverse are the accounts of those that studied them in the past. With any luck, this book will sell well enough to bring forth a sequel: there's a lot more of the wild kingdom to explore and I can't imagine a more entertaining guide. "
22,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1498412-katy,4,"Don’t let the absurd turn-off subtitle citing stoned sloths and lovelorn hippos stand in your way: there is a lot of impressive (and accessibly referenced) research presented pithily in this book. Each animal gets a capsule chapter. The creature selection criteria seems diverse: are you misunderstood (sloth, panda)? Unfairly vilified (hyena, bat, vulture)? Humans think you can do cool things that animals definitely can’t do (beaver)? Have centuries of hilarious pseudo-science chronicling your reproduction and gustatory preferences (eel)? The author's frolicsome addiction to assonance, alliteration, and language puns can wear on a person after a few consecutive chapters but there’s no denying that her zest for getting to know the real animal behind the myths is contagious. "
23,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32420578-alina,4,"***Note: I received a copy curtesy of Netgalley and Perseus Books, Basic Books in exchange for an honest review.I got rather slow into the book, as I didn’t find the first chapter, about eels, very interesting, and the humor at first seemed rather dull, but it made up afterwards and I found out a lot of interesting facts and hilarious myths about different animals, and the humor grew on me.Unfortunately, I must mention the horrible formatting of the review copy, with no upper case lettering, page numbers mixed in the text, pictures with explaining text disrupting the lecture - all these affected my reading experience in a bad way.Eels: apparently, to this day we don’t know how they reproduce..Beavers were believed to chew off their testicles to escape capture, because “castoreum was a revered medicine in the ancient world on account of its unusually pungent nature. This was a time when smells were considered to be particularly potent as treatments—the more overpowering, the better chances of being healed. Feces, for this reason, were a firm favorite with doctors, if not their patients. A trip to the doctor might involve inhaling a heady cocktail of up to thirty different medicinal turds (such as mouse and even human), which could only have made the sick feel even sicker. Sniffing beaver “testicles” would have been a bed of roses in comparison.”Sloths: “it appears sex is the only thing sloths do quickly.”Hyenas: Not all hyenas are scavengers, some of them hunt >90% of their pray. “Unlike most mammals, hyena cubs emerge with eyes open, muscles coordinated and teeth already pierced through their gums and eager to bite. These belligerent newborns frequently fight to the death over dinner, and siblicide is commonplace.[…]The fact that it fails to get sick after gorging on a putrid carcass riddled with anthrax may explain why many cultures believe the hyena possesses magical powers.”Bats have huge (for their size) and dangling penises.Adelie penguins fuck anything: females, males, babies, corpses, even rocks.Vultures: “if we were to feast on rotting flesh, we’d likely get very sick very quickly. Vultures survive by obliterating disease-bearing bacteria, including some very unforgiving ones, like botulism or anthrax, with some of the strongest stomach acids in the animal kingdom, with a ph similar to that of battery acid.“Frogs: “The sixty-seven hundred or so known species of frog include those that secrete their own sunscreen, others that make their own antifreeze and some that can even fly.”“What makes this frog [Darwin’s frog] so extraordinary is that it has eschewed conventional pond-based metamorphosis for something more sci-fi: after mating the male guards the fertilized eggs until they are close to hatching, then gobbles them up. Six weeks later, like a scene out of Alien, he barfs up baby frogs. He is the only male animal other than the seahorse to give birth, albeit through his mouth.”Moose frequently wander off in people’s gardens and eat apples. Not sure though if the getting drunk/high on fermented apples is true or not really.Hippos myth: “When the animal has become too bulky by continued over-feeding, it goes down to the banks of the river, and examines the reeds which have been newly cut; as soon as it has found a stump that is very sharp, it presses its body against it, and so wounds one of the veins in the thigh; and, by the flow of blood thus produced, the body, which would otherwise have fallen into a morbid state, is relieved; after which, it covers up the wound with mud. What reads as a tragic tale of a self-harming hippo with weight issues was in fact a portrayal of the ancient art of bloodletting—a procedure used in the treatment of an array of ailments for almost three thousand years.” 😊“Escobar was shot by military police in the early 1990s. His empire fell and his entire menagerie was rehoused in zoos across south America—except for the hippos. Transporting an animal that weighs up to four and a half tons is an all too hefty challenge for even the most ardent wannabe hippo owner. So for the next two decades, the hippos wallowed in their pond as their master’s massive ranch was looted to the point of dereliction, and then transformed by the government into the unlikely combination of Pablo escobar theme park (open to escobar fans and complete with waterslides) and high-security prison (open to escobar wannabes and without waterslides).”Wild panda “is a secret stud, fond of threesomes and rough sex, with a taste for flesh and a fearsome bite. But it inhabits an impenetrable forest in a cryptic country, which has allowed an imposter to take center stage and ensured that one of the most recognizable animal brands is nothing but a fraud.”P.S. I loved and recommend Petra's review."
24,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"This was much better than The Inner Lives of Animals, which I listened to earlier this year, though I kept thinking about one of the little takeaways from that book: why is it we insist that animals learn our language for us to communicate and we don't bother learning theirs? Cooke takes this one throughout the book, exploring how humans have conceived of animal behavior and framed it through human understand and beliefs, rather than the ones of the animals themselves. It's hilarious to read about the sex lives of penguins (no monogamy) and pandas (male pandas have peeing contests to win a mate) and sloths (no one really knows), but, we judge those things based on what we as humans see as normal. And Cooke isn't afraid to look at this both historically and through contemporary lenses.A really great read, with tons of funny stories, and a clear love for animals throughout. My favorite sections were on the sloth -- particularly the drawings and ways that they were rendered in the past -- as well as the section on frogs and hippos. I found the chimpanzee one to be the weakest, but then again, it might be what really hooks other readers. The chimp-human connection isn't a thing that fascinates me the way it does many others.Worth noting that for readers sensitive to depictions of animal abuse in the laboratory, this might be tough to read. Early science wasn't exactly kind to animals in the quest for ""knowledge."" "
25,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19133785-brandon-forsyth,5,"This book filled a Bill Bryson-sized hole in my heart. Lucy Cooke has written an incredibly charming, hilarious, and educational modern bestiary that will have you more engaged with the animal kingdom than an episode of PLANET EARTH. From reevaluating your assumptions about sloths to challenging your love for beavers (tough for a Canadian), Cooke will show you the way our need to anthropomorphize these fascinating creatures has led us astray for hundreds of years, and will have you cackling along the way. One of the best books I've read this year."
26,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153756-jeffrey,5,"Just the right mix of lighthearted tone, amusing anecdotes, and scientific information. Great to have a look into some of our past misconceptions about animals, and how those misconceptions have evolved over time."
27,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34895792-stacie,4,"If you like animals and cheesy humor, this is an interesting read. There is a large focus on myths that stemmed from the embarrassing depths of early zoology, which was entertaining for the most part. I think that the author was more interested in clowning on certain historical figures than anything else, so it did get a tad repetitive at times. Overall though, when the text was gearing more towards animal facts, I found this to be a pretty decent read. "
28,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/657110-beth,5,"Animals are glorious - there is such variety among us all, and yet sometimes, that variety is not seen as a positive. As Lucy Cooke points out in her book - creatures like the sloth and the bat, and even the panda are not what we assume them to be. And in every case, they are better.This book is a wild ride. Cooke gets into the past studies of these animals, and includes drawings that are...hideous? Weird? Crazy? In most cases, all of the above. So little understanding, and so much myth has accompanied the hippo and the penguin. There are crazy sex tales (penguins are not generally monogamous), strange facts (the hippo's closest relative is...the whale), and bizarre stories of competitions between early scientists (who would be the first to create a humanzee). Yet Cooke also gives us plenty of actual facts about these amazing creatures, and shows how each is special and unique and deserves its place. She makes a valid point that we cannot afford to continue making mistakes with our wildlife - or we will no longer have them.Overall, this was simply a fascinating book. There were parts that had me laughing, and others where I'm pretty sure my eyes about popped out of my sockets. Parts where I wanted to slap some of those old scientists, and others where I was just in awe about the amazing creatures we have on this earth. Those same creatures that we take for granted or ridicule based on our own perspective - without realizing just how perfect they are for *what* they are. Cooke has shown them for what they are - amazing, bizarre, and special - and worthy of our time and our respect."

Cooke explore these animals from a zoological perspective and historical perspective, particularly how naturalists and biologists of the past misunderstood these animals or infused their attempts to understand them with anthromorphism or religious underpinnings. Cooke’s point is that these animals aren’t here for our entertainment or even for us to study and the only way we can truly understand nature is to try to view the animals that comprise the world from their perspective and not ours. But the book isn’t all deep thoughts but contain fascinating glimpses at amazing animals. Who knew that the genitalia of hyenas could be so enthralling."

The book often felt like a natural history book, with sections often giving a history of ecological thought, which is something I'd never encountered before. I learned new things about animals, and valued the new perspectives presented to me in regards to how certain animals are used or viewed by the world. I'd recommend this to a nature lover who is already familiar with and well read in basic ecology"

Read by the author in this audio version, you can’t help but be caught up in the author's obvious enthusiasm about her subjects. While some of the information imparted is interesting, especially details about their habitats and habits, there is an abundant amount of information about their mating habits, especially the peculiar aspects of them. It may be the truth, but I wish the author emphasized other things. "
34,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94080442-katelynn,5,"With suggestive humor and a bit of orneriness, Cooke clears up crazy misconceptions about some of the world’s more mysterious and underappreciated species. Throughout, she dissects these past theories for signs of human superiority, a binary physical understanding, and a little too much of the woodsy musk from a beaver's “gonads.” What’s left: Hyenas are avid feminists, Eels keep their coitus quiet, and Sloths are pretty much the ultimate survivalists. You can devour this all at once or savor each chapter as an individual essay, but you will be amazed by the truth (and bestiary sketches) either way."

This book is for you!"
36,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40159364-moses-hetfield,3,"This book was informative, enjoyable, and easy to get through. The book is basically a history of zoology and misconceptions about certain animals, some of which were pretty wild. Cooke cites a number of sources that sound absolutely fascinating, from medieval bestiaries to 
Lucy: Growing Up Human: A Chimpanzee Daughter in a Psychotherapist's Family
, the memoir of a psychotherapist who decided to raise a chimpanzee as his daughter, which apparently includes some raunchy scenes with a vacuum cleaner.However, Cooke's sense of humor doesn't match up perfectly with mine, and I often found myself cringing at her jokes, which were largely unnecessary as the subject matter was already interesting, bizarre, and funny enough without them. She tries too hard to be cute, and on occasion misses the mark in problematic ways in her efforts to make a cheap joke. Her description of female hyenas as ""the original chicks with dicks,"" which also uses the phrase ""trans trickery,"" play into the misconception that trans people are trying to deceive others through their gender presentation (73). The phrasing is entirely inappropriate, using transphobic tropes to convey a misleading message about female hyenas, who are also not attempting to trick anyone, all for the sake of a rhyme and an alliterative phrase that Cooke evidently thought would be a cute way to spice up her writing. It's not cute.Still, certainly an interesting book overall with plenty of positive features."

But even if they do have the cuteness overload, like pandas do, maybe we need to understand why contributing to the viral videos that seem so sweet and funny might actually not be doing them a world of good.

46,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author, who studied under Richard Dawkins, focuses her expertise on a handful of animals, among them the hyena, hippo, sloth (her favorite), panda, penguin, chimp, and bat. Her premise is that the wild misconceptions about animals from ancient and medieval times, however erroneous they may be, are no more fantastical than the truth. For example, one early solution to the question of where birds go in certain seasons was the suggestion that they fly to the moon. But that's no crazier an idea (in terms of distance) than the actual routes some birds fly in their migratory commute. Another theme is that our interpretations and misconceptions of animals are based on our own ideas. Thus, for example, in the middle ages people wanted moral instructions, so they found moral and immoral animals. As Cooke says, a good religious allegory trumps the truth every time. In terms of misinformation, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, is the villain of the book, with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of erroneous information, apparently made up out of whole cloth and presented with confident, pompous authority. The truth, however, as Cooke presents it, is much more eye-opening than moral allegory. There's the millennia-long search for the eel's gonads (which Sigmund Freud tried looking for early in his career). The debunking of the myth that the beaver throws his testicles at pursuing predators. Sloths and their poop problem (when do they do it). The reverse sexual dimorphism of the hyena, their bizarre birth canals, and their intelligence. Oh, and the bats. There is a lot of torturing bats in the name of science. Also talk about bat penises, and did you know vampires used to be rumored to be able to turn into watermelons? There's the French scientist who created and fitted tiny pants and suspenders on frogs in order to find out what roles the males and females played in reproduction.As you can see, there's a wealth of conversational material here, and I didn't even mention the program to castrate hippos in Colombia. However, as titillating all this is, the book is not without some flaws. Despite correctly tut-tutting at the anthropomorphism of past naturalists, she is guilty of over dramatizing and anthropomorphizing when trying to shock us with lurid tales of ""panda orgies"" and ""penguin prostitution."" What she goes on to describe is not prostitution at all, but an adaptation in which females steal pebbles after distracting less fit males. She also hints at thrilling, sensationalized terms like necrophilia and homosexuality. While some same-sex partnership has been documented, a lot of what she talks about is no more than the unfettered and thoughtless mating instinct of a dog humping a human leg or the shoulder of a male dog. So while she is right to say that anthropomorphism is ""our major undoing"" in trying to study animals, her own less than subdued chapter hooks are misleading."
47,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636165-wolf,4,"Lucy Cooke’s book is designed as a light hearted read but with a serious purpose. Along the way, it not only entertains but informs. I challenge anyone not to find the biology of the creatures here - and the stories about them - both fascinating and compelling. She has a lovely way of telling her stories - about both animal and the humans who theorised about them, misjudged them, at times horrendously abused them and, sometimes, studied them - with wit and verve. At her best, this recalls the writing of Bill Bryson or Stephen Jay Gould’s popular science. The book would be a great present for anyone who likes their work or enjoys QI.Why not a full five stars, then? Well, I have an advance proof copy - and it is possible that there has been further correction made - but a certain sloppiness has left the book marred by some odd mistakes and slips. For example, the chapter on Eels appears to confuse the First and Second World Wars; at another point we are told that humans have a brain ‘seven times bigger than that of any animal’ (which would be remarkable if true but I suspect the crucial words ‘relative to body size’ have been missed off); the Magaliesberg mountains are said to be 100 years older than Everest (I think 100 times older is what was meant) and so on. I do hope these mistakes have been spotted and corrected. They might not be always the most significant but if as a non expert one can spot them it leads one to question other facts put forward in the book.Otherwise, thoroughly recommended."

Eels, beavers, sloths, hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks, hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees are covered.Each chapter includes notes about what people thought about the animal in the past, what kinds of behaviors are in question, and what we know about the animal currently as compared to the past. There are plenty of facts both historical and scientific. Humor is sprinkled throughout.Even though there is humor, I didn't find it quite as funny as I expected it to be when the blurb compared the book to Mary Roach and Bill Bryson. I enjoyed the facts and most of the chapters, but I was almost lost in the first chapter about eels and their sex lives and origins. Things picked up from there for me, thankfully. The chapters I enjoyed the most were the ones on sloths, hippos, pandas, and penguins.Just a note, a lot of the book has to do with reproduction. And some of the historical facts involve less than humane treatment of the animals in the past.I give this book 4 out of 5 stars.

Sort of a ""can you believe what we used to believe?"", along with a dose of ""can you believe this isn't science fiction?"" romp through different strange and wonderful animals, each with their own chapter.Ever wonder how sloths actually evolved to be so... slothful? Curious about eel gonads? Want to know if that rumour about beavers self-castrating (even the females) in order to evade capture has any whiff of truth? Sometimes the only thing stranger than what animals are capable of is what we thought they were capable of, and Lucy Cooke has a hearty chuckle on both sides. As well as being entertainingly written, it is chock full of fun tidbits of information about maligned, or just plain misunderstood critters that'll be great to throw out randomly in conversation just to see what people's faces look like when you tell them Hippos are most closely related to whales.I heartily recommend this book if you love animals, love facts about them, or want a good laugh."
50,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3771119-julie,4,"This book’s goal is to set the record straight about animals that have been mythologized or misunderstood throughout history. As Cooke states in her conclusion, “The urge to anthropomorphize trips us up and obscures the truth.” Each chapter features a different animal and there are fascinating tidbits throughout. I most enjoyed the anthropological aspects, like why humans are historically hostile towards hyenas. Here are some fascinating things I learned… Hyenas are surprisingly intelligent and have highly developed social structures. A hippo’s closest relative is a whale. Though hippos are indigenous to Africa, there is a burgeoning population of them in South America thanks to Pablo Escobar. A vulture tagged by Israeli scientists was detained is Saudi Arabia for suspicion of being a Mossad spy.My only qualm was that Cooke incorporated some long-winded diatribes of historical naturalists who were so far off the mark, they came off as a bit ridiculous. Overall, it was an interesting read, and I appreciate books like this that give me cocktail party topics that I will put to good use.I received a complimentary copy of this book via the Amazon Vine program."

Turns out, this is the book I should have been reading. Written with passion and humour, Lucy Cooke picks her favourite animals and looks back at how scientific thinking has shifted over time – and how humans have spent a lot of time killing animals in the name of education and science while successfully managing to learn absolutely nothing. Sloths caused a lot of confusion back in the day, we've been wrong about pandas forever, and mooseseses actually have knees. All of the truths revealed here are actual revelations given what the “experts” from wayback claimed. Aristotle, it turns out, was a bit of an idiot. Especially where eels were concerned. And I now know things about penguins I wish I didn't. You also have to marvel at the brain that came up with the idea of strapping bombs to bats. While the past is grisly and at times barbaric, Cooke treads gently through the blood and corpses and guides us to the warm, funny places in each tale. (Yes, I was going to spell it the other way for LOLs...)In doing so, she has created a book packed full of fascinating insights and giggles, written in such an engaging way it's impossible to put down once you've started a new chapter. Science-based books can be dry and dull, but Lucy Cooke has dusted off that preconception and crafted a piece of work that will appeal to everyone. Even those of us who used to like penguins."
60,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7973110-lin,5,"Very interesting book that sets the record straight on some of our persistent misconceptions about animals. You will be astonished and will literally laugh out loud at some of the things you will learn in this book. It's well-written and hard to put down, not dry at all. "
61,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1273285-andrew,5,"Completely enjoyed this book which describes the strangeness of the animal kingdom and certain animals, including eels, moose, pandas, and chimps. Cooke explore these animals from a zoological perspective and historical perspective, particularly how naturalists and biologists of the past misunderstood these animals or infused their attempts to understand them with anthromorphism or religious underpinnings. Cooke’s point is that these animals aren’t here for our entertainment or even for us to study and the only way we can truly understand nature is to try to view the animals that comprise the world from their perspective and not ours. But the book isn’t all deep thoughts but contain fascinating glimpses at amazing animals. Who knew that the genitalia of hyenas could be so enthralling."
62,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25870001-lizzy,4,"*This is an ARC Goodreads Giveaway*I appreciated how this book was organized into sections of specific animals and the animals selected. The book often felt like a natural history book, with sections often giving a history of ecological thought, which is something I'd never encountered before. I learned new things about animals, and valued the new perspectives presented to me in regards to how certain animals are used or viewed by the world. I'd recommend this to a nature lover who is already familiar with and well read in basic ecology"
63,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5054798-mayda,3,"Everything you ever wanted to know about animals and a lot you didn’t can be found in this extensively researched book. Read by the author in this audio version, you can’t help but be caught up in the author's obvious enthusiasm about her subjects. While some of the information imparted is interesting, especially details about their habitats and habits, there is an abundant amount of information about their mating habits, especially the peculiar aspects of them. It may be the truth, but I wish the author emphasized other things. "
64,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94080442-katelynn,5,"With suggestive humor and a bit of orneriness, Cooke clears up crazy misconceptions about some of the world’s more mysterious and underappreciated species. Throughout, she dissects these past theories for signs of human superiority, a binary physical understanding, and a little too much of the woodsy musk from a beaver's “gonads.” What’s left: Hyenas are avid feminists, Eels keep their coitus quiet, and Sloths are pretty much the ultimate survivalists. You can devour this all at once or savor each chapter as an individual essay, but you will be amazed by the truth (and bestiary sketches) either way."
65,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10596086-kristy,0,"**Thank you to NetGalley for an e-copy of The Truth About Animals in exchange for an honest review.**Lucy Cooke tackles typically vilified creatures (bats, hyenas, vultures, eels) and shows how they are actually very interesting animals. She also discusses the cuties of the animal kingdom like pandas, sloths and penguins. Want to know all sorts of odd (and sometimes hilarious) animal facts for your next dinner party? This book is for you!"
66,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40159364-moses-hetfield,3,"This book was informative, enjoyable, and easy to get through. The book is basically a history of zoology and misconceptions about certain animals, some of which were pretty wild. Cooke cites a number of sources that sound absolutely fascinating, from medieval bestiaries to 
Lucy: Growing Up Human: A Chimpanzee Daughter in a Psychotherapist's Family
, the memoir of a psychotherapist who decided to raise a chimpanzee as his daughter, which apparently includes some raunchy scenes with a vacuum cleaner.However, Cooke's sense of humor doesn't match up perfectly with mine, and I often found myself cringing at her jokes, which were largely unnecessary as the subject matter was already interesting, bizarre, and funny enough without them. She tries too hard to be cute, and on occasion misses the mark in problematic ways in her efforts to make a cheap joke. Her description of female hyenas as ""the original chicks with dicks,"" which also uses the phrase ""trans trickery,"" play into the misconception that trans people are trying to deceive others through their gender presentation (73). The phrasing is entirely inappropriate, using transphobic tropes to convey a misleading message about female hyenas, who are also not attempting to trick anyone, all for the sake of a rhyme and an alliterative phrase that Cooke evidently thought would be a cute way to spice up her writing. It's not cute.Still, certainly an interesting book overall with plenty of positive features."

If only my university classes had been so entertaining I wouldn't have skipped so many and I might have had better results.I recommend this book to everyone who likes to know real facts about real animals, especially the ones that tend not to have so much cuteness factor, like vultures and toads. But even if they do have the cuteness overload, like pandas do, maybe we need to understand why contributing to the viral videos that seem so sweet and funny might actually not be doing them a world of good. It was a really great read, and I will be looking forward for more books from this author. "
75,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35671475-matthew-blee,5,Relentlessly interesting and very enjoyable. I'm already looking forward to reading this again
76,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author, who studied under Richard Dawkins, focuses her expertise on a handful of animals, among them the hyena, hippo, sloth (her favorite), panda, penguin, chimp, and bat. Her premise is that the wild misconceptions about animals from ancient and medieval times, however erroneous they may be, are no more fantastical than the truth. For example, one early solution to the question of where birds go in certain seasons was the suggestion that they fly to the moon. But that's no crazier an idea (in terms of distance) than the actual routes some birds fly in their migratory commute. Another theme is that our interpretations and misconceptions of animals are based on our own ideas. Thus, for example, in the middle ages people wanted moral instructions, so they found moral and immoral animals. As Cooke says, a good religious allegory trumps the truth every time. In terms of misinformation, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, is the villain of the book, with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of erroneous information, apparently made up out of whole cloth and presented with confident, pompous authority. The truth, however, as Cooke presents it, is much more eye-opening than moral allegory. There's the millennia-long search for the eel's gonads (which Sigmund Freud tried looking for early in his career). The debunking of the myth that the beaver throws his testicles at pursuing predators. Sloths and their poop problem (when do they do it). The reverse sexual dimorphism of the hyena, their bizarre birth canals, and their intelligence. Oh, and the bats. There is a lot of torturing bats in the name of science. Also talk about bat penises, and did you know vampires used to be rumored to be able to turn into watermelons? There's the French scientist who created and fitted tiny pants and suspenders on frogs in order to find out what roles the males and females played in reproduction.As you can see, there's a wealth of conversational material here, and I didn't even mention the program to castrate hippos in Colombia. However, as titillating all this is, the book is not without some flaws. Despite correctly tut-tutting at the anthropomorphism of past naturalists, she is guilty of over dramatizing and anthropomorphizing when trying to shock us with lurid tales of ""panda orgies"" and ""penguin prostitution."" What she goes on to describe is not prostitution at all, but an adaptation in which females steal pebbles after distracting less fit males. She also hints at thrilling, sensationalized terms like necrophilia and homosexuality. While some same-sex partnership has been documented, a lot of what she talks about is no more than the unfettered and thoughtless mating instinct of a dog humping a human leg or the shoulder of a male dog. So while she is right to say that anthropomorphism is ""our major undoing"" in trying to study animals, her own less than subdued chapter hooks are misleading."
77,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636165-wolf,4,"Lucy Cooke’s book is designed as a light hearted read but with a serious purpose. Along the way, it not only entertains but informs. I challenge anyone not to find the biology of the creatures here - and the stories about them - both fascinating and compelling. She has a lovely way of telling her stories - about both animal and the humans who theorised about them, misjudged them, at times horrendously abused them and, sometimes, studied them - with wit and verve. At her best, this recalls the writing of Bill Bryson or Stephen Jay Gould’s popular science. The book would be a great present for anyone who likes their work or enjoys QI.Why not a full five stars, then? Well, I have an advance proof copy - and it is possible that there has been further correction made - but a certain sloppiness has left the book marred by some odd mistakes and slips. For example, the chapter on Eels appears to confuse the First and Second World Wars; at another point we are told that humans have a brain ‘seven times bigger than that of any animal’ (which would be remarkable if true but I suspect the crucial words ‘relative to body size’ have been missed off); the Magaliesberg mountains are said to be 100 years older than Everest (I think 100 times older is what was meant) and so on. I do hope these mistakes have been spotted and corrected. They might not be always the most significant but if as a non expert one can spot them it leads one to question other facts put forward in the book.Otherwise, thoroughly recommended."
78,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2509330-laura,4,"The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife by Lucy Cooke is an impressive selection of information on 13 different animals. Eels, beavers, sloths, hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks, hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees are covered.Each chapter includes notes about what people thought about the animal in the past, what kinds of behaviors are in question, and what we know about the animal currently as compared to the past. There are plenty of facts both historical and scientific. Humor is sprinkled throughout.Even though there is humor, I didn't find it quite as funny as I expected it to be when the blurb compared the book to Mary Roach and Bill Bryson. I enjoyed the facts and most of the chapters, but I was almost lost in the first chapter about eels and their sex lives and origins. Things picked up from there for me, thankfully. The chapters I enjoyed the most were the ones on sloths, hippos, pandas, and penguins.Just a note, a lot of the book has to do with reproduction. And some of the historical facts involve less than humane treatment of the animals in the past.I give this book 4 out of 5 stars. Overall. it's well-written and has interesting facts.The Truth About Animals by Lucy Cooke was released April 17th, 2018 from Basic Books part of the Hachette Book Group.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.

79,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60938831-kevin-m,4,"This book is great!A fun trip through the lives of some of our stranger relatives in the Kingdom Animalia, and through the history of science. Sort of a ""can you believe what we used to believe?"", along with a dose of ""can you believe this isn't science fiction?"" romp through different strange and wonderful animals, each with their own chapter.Ever wonder how sloths actually evolved to be so... slothful? Curious about eel gonads? Want to know if that rumour about beavers self-castrating (even the females) in order to evade capture has any whiff of truth? Sometimes the only thing stranger than what animals are capable of is what we thought they were capable of, and Lucy Cooke has a hearty chuckle on both sides. As well as being entertainingly written, it is chock full of fun tidbits of information about maligned, or just plain misunderstood critters that'll be great to throw out randomly in conversation just to see what people's faces look like when you tell them Hippos are most closely related to whales.I heartily recommend this book if you love animals, love facts about them, or want a good laugh."
80,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3771119-julie,4,"This book’s goal is to set the record straight about animals that have been mythologized or misunderstood throughout history. As Cooke states in her conclusion, “The urge to anthropomorphize trips us up and obscures the truth.” Each chapter features a different animal and there are fascinating tidbits throughout. I most enjoyed the anthropological aspects, like why humans are historically hostile towards hyenas. Here are some fascinating things I learned… Hyenas are surprisingly intelligent and have highly developed social structures. A hippo’s closest relative is a whale. Though hippos are indigenous to Africa, there is a burgeoning population of them in South America thanks to Pablo Escobar. A vulture tagged by Israeli scientists was detained is Saudi Arabia for suspicion of being a Mossad spy.My only qualm was that Cooke incorporated some long-winded diatribes of historical naturalists who were so far off the mark, they came off as a bit ridiculous. Overall, it was an interesting read, and I appreciate books like this that give me cocktail party topics that I will put to good use.I received a complimentary copy of this book via the Amazon Vine program."

106,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author, who studied under Richard Dawkins, focuses her expertise on a handful of animals, among them the hyena, hippo, sloth (her favorite), panda, penguin, chimp, and bat. Her premise is that the wild misconceptions about animals from ancient and medieval times, however erroneous they may be, are no more fantastical than the truth. For example, one early solution to the question of where birds go in certain seasons was the suggestion that they fly to the moon. But that's no crazier an idea (in terms of distance) than the actual routes some birds fly in their migratory commute. Another theme is that our interpretations and misconceptions of animals are based on our own ideas. Thus, for example, in the middle ages people wanted moral instructions, so they found moral and immoral animals. As Cooke says, a good religious allegory trumps the truth every time. In terms of misinformation, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, is the villain of the book, with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of erroneous information, apparently made up out of whole cloth and presented with confident, pompous authority. The truth, however, as Cooke presents it, is much more eye-opening than moral allegory. There's the millennia-long search for the eel's gonads (which Sigmund Freud tried looking for early in his career). The debunking of the myth that the beaver throws his testicles at pursuing predators. Sloths and their poop problem (when do they do it). The reverse sexual dimorphism of the hyena, their bizarre birth canals, and their intelligence. Oh, and the bats. There is a lot of torturing bats in the name of science. Also talk about bat penises, and did you know vampires used to be rumored to be able to turn into watermelons? There's the French scientist who created and fitted tiny pants and suspenders on frogs in order to find out what roles the males and females played in reproduction.As you can see, there's a wealth of conversational material here, and I didn't even mention the program to castrate hippos in Colombia. However, as titillating all this is, the book is not without some flaws. Despite correctly tut-tutting at the anthropomorphism of past naturalists, she is guilty of over dramatizing and anthropomorphizing when trying to shock us with lurid tales of ""panda orgies"" and ""penguin prostitution."" What she goes on to describe is not prostitution at all, but an adaptation in which females steal pebbles after distracting less fit males. She also hints at thrilling, sensationalized terms like necrophilia and homosexuality. While some same-sex partnership has been documented, a lot of what she talks about is no more than the unfettered and thoughtless mating instinct of a dog humping a human leg or the shoulder of a male dog. So while she is right to say that anthropomorphism is ""our major undoing"" in trying to study animals, her own less than subdued chapter hooks are misleading."
107,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636165-wolf,4,"Lucy Cooke’s book is designed as a light hearted read but with a serious purpose. Along the way, it not only entertains but informs. I challenge anyone not to find the biology of the creatures here - and the stories about them - both fascinating and compelling. She has a lovely way of telling her stories - about both animal and the humans who theorised about them, misjudged them, at times horrendously abused them and, sometimes, studied them - with wit and verve. At her best, this recalls the writing of Bill Bryson or Stephen Jay Gould’s popular science. The book would be a great present for anyone who likes their work or enjoys QI.Why not a full five stars, then? Well, I have an advance proof copy - and it is possible that there has been further correction made - but a certain sloppiness has left the book marred by some odd mistakes and slips. For example, the chapter on Eels appears to confuse the First and Second World Wars; at another point we are told that humans have a brain ‘seven times bigger than that of any animal’ (which would be remarkable if true but I suspect the crucial words ‘relative to body size’ have been missed off); the Magaliesberg mountains are said to be 100 years older than Everest (I think 100 times older is what was meant) and so on. I do hope these mistakes have been spotted and corrected. They might not be always the most significant but if as a non expert one can spot them it leads one to question other facts put forward in the book.Otherwise, thoroughly recommended."
108,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2509330-laura,4,"The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife by Lucy Cooke is an impressive selection of information on 13 different animals. Eels, beavers, sloths, hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks, hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees are covered.Each chapter includes notes about what people thought about the animal in the past, what kinds of behaviors are in question, and what we know about the animal currently as compared to the past. There are plenty of facts both historical and scientific. Humor is sprinkled throughout.Even though there is humor, I didn't find it quite as funny as I expected it to be when the blurb compared the book to Mary Roach and Bill Bryson. I enjoyed the facts and most of the chapters, but I was almost lost in the first chapter about eels and their sex lives and origins. Things picked up from there for me, thankfully. The chapters I enjoyed the most were the ones on sloths, hippos, pandas, and penguins.Just a note, a lot of the book has to do with reproduction. And some of the historical facts involve less than humane treatment of the animals in the past.I give this book 4 out of 5 stars. Overall. it's well-written and has interesting facts.The Truth About Animals by Lucy Cooke was released April 17th, 2018 from Basic Books part of the Hachette Book Group.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley.

109,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60938831-kevin-m,4,"This book is great!A fun trip through the lives of some of our stranger relatives in the Kingdom Animalia, and through the history of science. Sort of a ""can you believe what we used to believe?"", along with a dose of ""can you believe this isn't science fiction?"" romp through different strange and wonderful animals, each with their own chapter.Ever wonder how sloths actually evolved to be so... slothful? Curious about eel gonads? Want to know if that rumour about beavers self-castrating (even the females) in order to evade capture has any whiff of truth? Sometimes the only thing stranger than what animals are capable of is what we thought they were capable of, and Lucy Cooke has a hearty chuckle on both sides. As well as being entertainingly written, it is chock full of fun tidbits of information about maligned, or just plain misunderstood critters that'll be great to throw out randomly in conversation just to see what people's faces look like when you tell them Hippos are most closely related to whales.I heartily recommend this book if you love animals, love facts about them, or want a good laugh."
110,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3771119-julie,4,"This book’s goal is to set the record straight about animals that have been mythologized or misunderstood throughout history. As Cooke states in her conclusion, “The urge to anthropomorphize trips us up and obscures the truth.” Each chapter features a different animal and there are fascinating tidbits throughout. I most enjoyed the anthropological aspects, like why humans are historically hostile towards hyenas. Here are some fascinating things I learned… Hyenas are surprisingly intelligent and have highly developed social structures. A hippo’s closest relative is a whale. Though hippos are indigenous to Africa, there is a burgeoning population of them in South America thanks to Pablo Escobar. A vulture tagged by Israeli scientists was detained is Saudi Arabia for suspicion of being a Mossad spy.My only qualm was that Cooke incorporated some long-winded diatribes of historical naturalists who were so far off the mark, they came off as a bit ridiculous. Overall, it was an interesting read, and I appreciate books like this that give me cocktail party topics that I will put to good use.I received a complimentary copy of this book via the Amazon Vine program."

112,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"Since ancient times people have tried to understand the nature of animals, often reaching bizarre and inaccurate conclusions. Beaver's testicles were said to cure toothaches and other ills. The unfairly maligned sloth was said to be stupid and lazy, rather than brilliantly designed for its environment. Swallows were believed to hibernate in a state of suspended animation at the bottom of a lake. It's amusing to consider these outlandish theories but Lucy Cooke also tells us about cruel experiments conducted upon animals in an attempt to prove them. The true nature of animals is endlessly fascinating and this book also unveils some little known facts and explodes old myths in a captivating fashion."

Really, it’s taking a hard look at the way humans have misunderstood and misrepresented animals over the ages, from Aristotle to the Age of Enlightenment and through to today. Despite the sometimes-sobering details, it reads like a casual, humorous dinner conversation with someone who really knows their stuff.

Each chapter is about a different animal (eels, beavers, sloths,hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees), which makes it a perfect read for times when you want something informative, and entertaining in a small dose (usually 20+ pages).I would love to recommend it to a young person interested in science or animals BUT with the caveat that there is a fair amount of detail about interesting mating habits and anatomy."

Some subjects included for your edification are: the link between pregnancy and toads, stories about storks and their journeys, and tales of necrophilia in penguin communities. These subjects are woven together in a dialogue filled with irony and humor.The author’s style of writing reminds me of Gerard Durrell, author of My Family and Other Animals. If you enjoy well written prose, that are comprehensively researched, and delivered in an irreverent manner, then this could be your next favorite read.What is the Book About?The Truth About Animals is a collection of short stories about various creatures, and the different scientific approaches to the study of animals. Throughout the book your views may be challenged, concepts you had may be reversed or revised, as intricate details of the life of various creatures are revealed. You can expect to be introduced to the Sloth Appreciation Society, discover why Hippos leak, how slippery eels really are, and how bats aren’t as bad as you think. On the journey you will also meet the crazy scientists that used questionable methods to investigate animal senses, the scientist that took the elephant phallus to the face, and the men who believed that swifts sleep the entire winter under water.The genuine love and affection that Lucy has for all animal kind is replete throughout the book and, at times, is almost palpable. The message is simple and clear, we must protect habitats and the animals will do the rest. This position is made clear when she discusses the plight of the Chinese Pandas.I enjoyed the book because it was humorous and with each turn of a page, I learned something new. This book is immensely funny at times and subtly so at other times.In Conclusion>/b>You will enjoy this book if you are looking for fun and learning. Very few authors can write in the way that Lucy Cooke writes. Whilst she isn’t unique, she is a huge talent. This book is: well written, intelligently delivered, beautifully researched, and infinitely humorous. The Truth About Animals is a must have for anyone who loves nature."
119,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5962819-kahn,0,"Back in 2017 I started reading Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? – a book that answered this question (no) in the opening chapter, rendering the rest of the book moot. Turns out, this is the book I should have been reading. Written with passion and humour, Lucy Cooke picks her favourite animals and looks back at how scientific thinking has shifted over time – and how humans have spent a lot of time killing animals in the name of education and science while successfully managing to learn absolutely nothing. Sloths caused a lot of confusion back in the day, we've been wrong about pandas forever, and mooseseses actually have knees. All of the truths revealed here are actual revelations given what the “experts” from wayback claimed. Aristotle, it turns out, was a bit of an idiot. Especially where eels were concerned. And I now know things about penguins I wish I didn't. You also have to marvel at the brain that came up with the idea of strapping bombs to bats. While the past is grisly and at times barbaric, Cooke treads gently through the blood and corpses and guides us to the warm, funny places in each tale.

136,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author, who studied under Richard Dawkins, focuses her expertise on a handful of animals, among them the hyena, hippo, sloth (her favorite), panda, penguin, chimp, and bat. Her premise is that the wild misconceptions about animals from ancient and medieval times, however erroneous they may be, are no more fantastical than the truth. For example, one early solution to the question of where birds go in certain seasons was the suggestion that they fly to the moon. But that's no crazier an idea (in terms of distance) than the actual routes some birds fly in their migratory commute. Another theme is that our interpretations and misconceptions of animals are based on our own ideas. Thus, for example, in the middle ages people wanted moral instructions, so they found moral and immoral animals. As Cooke says, a good religious allegory trumps the truth every time. In terms of misinformation, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, is the villain of the book, with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of erroneous information, apparently made up out of whole cloth and presented with confident, pompous authority. The truth, however, as Cooke presents it, is much more eye-opening than moral allegory. There's the millennia-long search for the eel's gonads (which Sigmund Freud tried looking for early in his career). The debunking of the myth that the beaver throws his testicles at pursuing predators. Sloths and their poop problem (when do they do it). The reverse sexual dimorphism of the hyena, their bizarre birth canals, and their intelligence. Oh, and the bats. There is a lot of torturing bats in the name of science. Also talk about bat penises, and did you know vampires used to be rumored to be able to turn into watermelons? There's the French scientist who created and fitted tiny pants and suspenders on frogs in order to find out what roles the males and females played in reproduction.As you can see, there's a wealth of conversational material here, and I didn't even mention the program to castrate hippos in Colombia. However, as titillating all this is, the book is not without some flaws. Despite correctly tut-tutting at the anthropomorphism of past naturalists, she is guilty of over dramatizing and anthropomorphizing when trying to shock us with lurid tales of ""panda orgies"" and ""penguin prostitution."" What she goes on to describe is not prostitution at all, but an adaptation in which females steal pebbles after distracting less fit males. She also hints at thrilling, sensationalized terms like necrophilia and homosexuality. While some same-sex partnership has been documented, a lot of what she talks about is no more than the unfettered and thoughtless mating instinct of a dog humping a human leg or the shoulder of a male dog. So while she is right to say that anthropomorphism is ""our major undoing"" in trying to study animals, her own less than subdued chapter hooks are misleading."

Sort of a ""can you believe what we used to believe?"", along with a dose of ""can you believe this isn't science fiction?"" romp through different strange and wonderful animals, each with their own chapter.Ever wonder how sloths actually evolved to be so... slothful? Curious about eel gonads? Want to know if that rumour about beavers self-castrating (even the females) in order to evade capture has any whiff of truth? Sometimes the only thing stranger than what animals are capable of is what we thought they were capable of, and Lucy Cooke has a hearty chuckle on both sides. As well as being entertainingly written, it is chock full of fun tidbits of information about maligned, or just plain misunderstood critters that'll be great to throw out randomly in conversation just to see what people's faces look like when you tell them Hippos are most closely related to whales.I heartily recommend this book if you love animals, love facts about them, or want a good laugh."
140,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3771119-julie,4,"This book’s goal is to set the record straight about animals that have been mythologized or misunderstood throughout history. As Cooke states in her conclusion, “The urge to anthropomorphize trips us up and obscures the truth.” Each chapter features a different animal and there are fascinating tidbits throughout. I most enjoyed the anthropological aspects, like why humans are historically hostile towards hyenas. Here are some fascinating things I learned… Hyenas are surprisingly intelligent and have highly developed social structures. A hippo’s closest relative is a whale. Though hippos are indigenous to Africa, there is a burgeoning population of them in South America thanks to Pablo Escobar. A vulture tagged by Israeli scientists was detained is Saudi Arabia for suspicion of being a Mossad spy.My only qualm was that Cooke incorporated some long-winded diatribes of historical naturalists who were so far off the mark, they came off as a bit ridiculous. Overall, it was an interesting read, and I appreciate books like this that give me cocktail party topics that I will put to good use.I received a complimentary copy of this book via the Amazon Vine program."

I learned so many cool things about animals, and loved the humour of the author as well. A fabulous listen! (Read for the Book Riot 2018 Read Harder Challenge - Read a book about nature)"
142,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"Since ancient times people have tried to understand the nature of animals, often reaching bizarre and inaccurate conclusions. Beaver's testicles were said to cure toothaches and other ills. The unfairly maligned sloth was said to be stupid and lazy, rather than brilliantly designed for its environment. Swallows were believed to hibernate in a state of suspended animation at the bottom of a lake. It's amusing to consider these outlandish theories but Lucy Cooke also tells us about cruel experiments conducted upon animals in an attempt to prove them. The true nature of animals is endlessly fascinating and this book also unveils some little known facts and explodes old myths in a captivating fashion."
143,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13814355-a,4,"I really enjoyed this book. Although I probably wouldn’t have picked it off the shelf unprompted (I received an uncorrected proof), it’s not another book simply listing weird and interesting animal facts. Really, it’s taking a hard look at the way humans have misunderstood and misrepresented animals over the ages, from Aristotle to the Age of Enlightenment and through to today. Despite the sometimes-sobering details, it reads like a casual, humorous dinner conversation with someone who really knows their stuff. It is also brimming with curious animal facts, but presented in a way to make you think as well as to amuse."

Each chapter is about a different animal (eels, beavers, sloths,hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees), which makes it a perfect read for times when you want something informative, and entertaining in a small dose (usually 20+ pages).I would love to recommend it to a young person interested in science or animals BUT with the caveat that there is a fair amount of detail about interesting mating habits and anatomy."

She specializes in animal behavior and evolution. Among Lucy’s professors at Oxford was Richard Dawkins, who is a world-renowned Zoologist and author. Lucy is passionate about conservation as well as her love of all sloth kind. She is referred to as the next David Attenborough in some circles.Her Curriculum Vitae includes a diverse range of skills including: television producer, director, award- winning documentary presenter, and filmmaker. Lucy has lecture at TED talks, was a New York Times best-selling author, and founded the Sloth Appreciation Society.In May, 2015 at the age of 45, Lucy was diagnosed with breast cancer. She changed her lifestyle as a result of the diagnosis and has an increased appreciation of life and love.Who is the Target Audience for The Truth About Animals?Any adult would enjoy this funny sojourn into the private and strange lives of animals, reptiles, and birds. Some subjects included for your edification are: the link between pregnancy and toads, stories about storks and their journeys, and tales of necrophilia in penguin communities. These subjects are woven together in a dialogue filled with irony and humor.The author’s style of writing reminds me of Gerard Durrell, author of My Family and Other Animals. If you enjoy well written prose, that are comprehensively researched, and delivered in an irreverent manner, then this could be your next favorite read.What is the Book About?The Truth About Animals is a collection of short stories about various creatures, and the different scientific approaches to the study of animals. Throughout the book your views may be challenged, concepts you had may be reversed or revised, as intricate details of the life of various creatures are revealed. You can expect to be introduced to the Sloth Appreciation Society, discover why Hippos leak, how slippery eels really are, and how bats aren’t as bad as you think. On the journey you will also meet the crazy scientists that used questionable methods to investigate animal senses, the scientist that took the elephant phallus to the face, and the men who believed that swifts sleep the entire winter under water.The genuine love and affection that Lucy has for all animal kind is replete throughout the book and, at times, is almost palpable. The message is simple and clear, we must protect habitats and the animals will do the rest. This position is made clear when she discusses the plight of the Chinese Pandas.I enjoyed the book because it was humorous and with each turn of a page, I learned something new. This book is immensely funny at times and subtly so at other times.In Conclusion>/b>You will enjoy this book if you are looking for fun and learning. Very few authors can write in the way that Lucy Cooke writes. Whilst she isn’t unique, she is a huge talent. This book is: well written, intelligently delivered, beautifully researched, and infinitely humorous. The Truth About Animals is a must have for anyone who loves nature."
149,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5962819-kahn,0,"Back in 2017 I started reading Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? – a book that answered this question (no) in the opening chapter, rendering the rest of the book moot. Turns out, this is the book I should have been reading. Written with passion and humour, Lucy Cooke picks her favourite animals and looks back at how scientific thinking has shifted over time – and how humans have spent a lot of time killing animals in the name of education and science while successfully managing to learn absolutely nothing. Sloths caused a lot of confusion back in the day, we've been wrong about pandas forever, and mooseseses actually have knees. All of the truths revealed here are actual revelations given what the “experts” from wayback claimed. Aristotle, it turns out, was a bit of an idiot. Especially where eels were concerned. And I now know things about penguins I wish I didn't. You also have to marvel at the brain that came up with the idea of strapping bombs to bats. While the past is grisly and at times barbaric, Cooke treads gently through the blood and corpses and guides us to the warm, funny places in each tale. (Yes, I was going to spell it the other way for LOLs...)In doing so, she has created a book packed full of fascinating insights and giggles, written in such an engaging way it's impossible to put down once you've started a new chapter. Science-based books can be dry and dull, but Lucy Cooke has dusted off that preconception and crafted a piece of work that will appeal to everyone. Even those of us who used to like penguins."

151,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1273285-andrew,5,"Completely enjoyed this book which describes the strangeness of the animal kingdom and certain animals, including eels, moose, pandas, and chimps. Cooke explore these animals from a zoological perspective and historical perspective, particularly how naturalists and biologists of the past misunderstood these animals or infused their attempts to understand them with anthromorphism or religious underpinnings. Cooke’s point is that these animals aren’t here for our entertainment or even for us to study and the only way we can truly understand nature is to try to view the animals that comprise the world from their perspective and not ours. But the book isn’t all deep thoughts but contain fascinating glimpses at amazing animals. Who knew that the genitalia of hyenas could be so enthralling."
152,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25870001-lizzy,4,"*This is an ARC Goodreads Giveaway*I appreciated how this book was organized into sections of specific animals and the animals selected. The book often felt like a natural history book, with sections often giving a history of ecological thought, which is something I'd never encountered before. I learned new things about animals, and valued the new perspectives presented to me in regards to how certain animals are used or viewed by the world. I'd recommend this to a nature lover who is already familiar with and well read in basic ecology"
153,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5054798-mayda,3,"Everything you ever wanted to know about animals and a lot you didn’t can be found in this extensively researched book. Read by the author in this audio version, you can’t help but be caught up in the author's obvious enthusiasm about her subjects. While some of the information imparted is interesting, especially details about their habitats and habits, there is an abundant amount of information about their mating habits, especially the peculiar aspects of them. It may be the truth, but I wish the author emphasized other things. "
154,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94080442-katelynn,5,"With suggestive humor and a bit of orneriness, Cooke clears up crazy misconceptions about some of the world’s more mysterious and underappreciated species. Throughout, she dissects these past theories for signs of human superiority, a binary physical understanding, and a little too much of the woodsy musk from a beaver's “gonads.” What’s left: Hyenas are avid feminists, Eels keep their coitus quiet, and Sloths are pretty much the ultimate survivalists. You can devour this all at once or savor each chapter as an individual essay, but you will be amazed by the truth (and bestiary sketches) either way."

She also discusses the cuties of the animal kingdom like pandas, sloths and penguins. Want to know all sorts of odd (and sometimes hilarious) animal facts for your next dinner party? This book is for you!"
156,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40159364-moses-hetfield,3,"This book was informative, enjoyable, and easy to get through. The book is basically a history of zoology and misconceptions about certain animals, some of which were pretty wild. Cooke cites a number of sources that sound absolutely fascinating, from medieval bestiaries to 
Lucy: Growing Up Human: A Chimpanzee Daughter in a Psychotherapist's Family
, the memoir of a psychotherapist who decided to raise a chimpanzee as his daughter, which apparently includes some raunchy scenes with a vacuum cleaner.However, Cooke's sense of humor doesn't match up perfectly with mine, and I often found myself cringing at her jokes, which were largely unnecessary as the subject matter was already interesting, bizarre, and funny enough without them. She tries too hard to be cute, and on occasion misses the mark in problematic ways in her efforts to make a cheap joke. Her description of female hyenas as ""the original chicks with dicks,"" which also uses the phrase ""trans trickery,"" play into the misconception that trans people are trying to deceive others through their gender presentation (73). The phrasing is entirely inappropriate, using transphobic tropes to convey a misleading message about female hyenas, who are also not attempting to trick anyone, all for the sake of a rhyme and an alliterative phrase that Cooke evidently thought would be a cute way to spice up her writing. It's not cute.Still, certainly an interesting book overall with plenty of positive features."

Some subjects included for your edification are: the link between pregnancy and toads, stories about storks and their journeys, and tales of necrophilia in penguin communities. These subjects are woven together in a dialogue filled with irony and humor.The author’s style of writing reminds me of Gerard Durrell, author of My Family and Other Animals.

The message is simple and clear, we must protect habitats and the animals will do the rest. This position is made clear when she discusses the plight of the Chinese Pandas.I enjoyed the book because it was humorous and with each turn of a page, I learned something new. This book is immensely funny at times and subtly so at other times.In Conclusion>/b>You will enjoy this book if you are looking for fun and learning.

179,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5962819-kahn,0,"Back in 2017 I started reading Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? – a book that answered this question (no) in the opening chapter, rendering the rest of the book moot. Turns out, this is the book I should have been reading. Written with passion and humour, Lucy Cooke picks her favourite animals and looks back at how scientific thinking has shifted over time – and how humans have spent a lot of time killing animals in the name of education and science while successfully managing to learn absolutely nothing. Sloths caused a lot of confusion back in the day, we've been wrong about pandas forever, and mooseseses actually have knees. All of the truths revealed here are actual revelations given what the “experts” from wayback claimed. Aristotle, it turns out, was a bit of an idiot. Especially where eels were concerned. And I now know things about penguins I wish I didn't. You also have to marvel at the brain that came up with the idea of strapping bombs to bats. While the past is grisly and at times barbaric, Cooke treads gently through the blood and corpses and guides us to the warm, funny places in each tale. (Yes, I was going to spell it the other way for LOLs...)In doing so, she has created a book packed full of fascinating insights and giggles, written in such an engaging way it's impossible to put down once you've started a new chapter. Science-based books can be dry and dull, but Lucy Cooke has dusted off that preconception and crafted a piece of work that will appeal to everyone. Even those of us who used to like penguins."
180,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7973110-lin,5,"Very interesting book that sets the record straight on some of our persistent misconceptions about animals. You will be astonished and will literally laugh out loud at some of the things you will learn in this book. It's well-written and hard to put down, not dry at all. "
181,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1273285-andrew,5,"Completely enjoyed this book which describes the strangeness of the animal kingdom and certain animals, including eels, moose, pandas, and chimps. Cooke explore these animals from a zoological perspective and historical perspective, particularly how naturalists and biologists of the past misunderstood these animals or infused their attempts to understand them with anthromorphism or religious underpinnings. Cooke’s point is that these animals aren’t here for our entertainment or even for us to study and the only way we can truly understand nature is to try to view the animals that comprise the world from their perspective and not ours. But the book isn’t all deep thoughts but contain fascinating glimpses at amazing animals. Who knew that the genitalia of hyenas could be so enthralling."
182,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25870001-lizzy,4,"*This is an ARC Goodreads Giveaway*I appreciated how this book was organized into sections of specific animals and the animals selected. The book often felt like a natural history book, with sections often giving a history of ecological thought, which is something I'd never encountered before. I learned new things about animals, and valued the new perspectives presented to me in regards to how certain animals are used or viewed by the world. I'd recommend this to a nature lover who is already familiar with and well read in basic ecology"
183,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5054798-mayda,3,"Everything you ever wanted to know about animals and a lot you didn’t can be found in this extensively researched book. Read by the author in this audio version, you can’t help but be caught up in the author's obvious enthusiasm about her subjects. While some of the information imparted is interesting, especially details about their habitats and habits, there is an abundant amount of information about their mating habits, especially the peculiar aspects of them. It may be the truth, but I wish the author emphasized other things. "
184,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94080442-katelynn,5,"With suggestive humor and a bit of orneriness, Cooke clears up crazy misconceptions about some of the world’s more mysterious and underappreciated species. Throughout, she dissects these past theories for signs of human superiority, a binary physical understanding, and a little too much of the woodsy musk from a beaver's “gonads.” What’s left: Hyenas are avid feminists, Eels keep their coitus quiet, and Sloths are pretty much the ultimate survivalists. You can devour this all at once or savor each chapter as an individual essay, but you will be amazed by the truth (and bestiary sketches) either way."
185,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10596086-kristy,0,"**Thank you to NetGalley for an e-copy of The Truth About Animals in exchange for an honest review.**Lucy Cooke tackles typically vilified creatures (bats, hyenas, vultures, eels) and shows how they are actually very interesting animals. She also discusses the cuties of the animal kingdom like pandas, sloths and penguins. Want to know all sorts of odd (and sometimes hilarious) animal facts for your next dinner party? This book is for you!"
186,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40159364-moses-hetfield,3,"This book was informative, enjoyable, and easy to get through. The book is basically a history of zoology and misconceptions about certain animals, some of which were pretty wild. Cooke cites a number of sources that sound absolutely fascinating, from medieval bestiaries to 
Lucy: Growing Up Human: A Chimpanzee Daughter in a Psychotherapist's Family
, the memoir of a psychotherapist who decided to raise a chimpanzee as his daughter, which apparently includes some raunchy scenes with a vacuum cleaner.However, Cooke's sense of humor doesn't match up perfectly with mine, and I often found myself cringing at her jokes, which were largely unnecessary as the subject matter was already interesting, bizarre, and funny enough without them. She tries too hard to be cute, and on occasion misses the mark in problematic ways in her efforts to make a cheap joke. Her description of female hyenas as ""the original chicks with dicks,"" which also uses the phrase ""trans trickery,"" play into the misconception that trans people are trying to deceive others through their gender presentation (73). The phrasing is entirely inappropriate, using transphobic tropes to convey a misleading message about female hyenas, who are also not attempting to trick anyone, all for the sake of a rhyme and an alliterative phrase that Cooke evidently thought would be a cute way to spice up her writing. It's not cute.Still, certainly an interesting book overall with plenty of positive features."

And this one joined both topics, but also combined them with Natural History and humour. If only my university classes had been so entertaining I wouldn't have skipped so many and I might have had better results.I recommend this book to everyone who likes to know real facts about real animals, especially the ones that tend not to have so much cuteness factor, like vultures and toads. But even if they do have the cuteness overload, like pandas do, maybe we need to understand why contributing to the viral videos that seem so sweet and funny might actually not be doing them a world of good. It was a really great read, and I will be looking forward for more books from this author. "
195,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35671475-matthew-blee,5,Relentlessly interesting and very enjoyable. I'm already looking forward to reading this again
196,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author, who studied under Richard Dawkins, focuses her expertise on a handful of animals, among them the hyena, hippo, sloth (her favorite), panda, penguin, chimp, and bat. Her premise is that the wild misconceptions about animals from ancient and medieval times, however erroneous they may be, are no more fantastical than the truth. For example, one early solution to the question of where birds go in certain seasons was the suggestion that they fly to the moon. But that's no crazier an idea (in terms of distance) than the actual routes some birds fly in their migratory commute. Another theme is that our interpretations and misconceptions of animals are based on our own ideas. Thus, for example, in the middle ages people wanted moral instructions, so they found moral and immoral animals. As Cooke says, a good religious allegory trumps the truth every time. In terms of misinformation, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, is the villain of the book, with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of erroneous information, apparently made up out of whole cloth and presented with confident, pompous authority. The truth, however, as Cooke presents it, is much more eye-opening than moral allegory. There's the millennia-long search for the eel's gonads (which Sigmund Freud tried looking for early in his career). The debunking of the myth that the beaver throws his testicles at pursuing predators. Sloths and their poop problem (when do they do it). The reverse sexual dimorphism of the hyena, their bizarre birth canals, and their intelligence. Oh, and the bats. There is a lot of torturing bats in the name of science. Also talk about bat penises, and did you know vampires used to be rumored to be able to turn into watermelons? There's the French scientist who created and fitted tiny pants and suspenders on frogs in order to find out what roles the males and females played in reproduction.As you can see, there's a wealth of conversational material here, and I didn't even mention the program to castrate hippos in Colombia. However, as titillating all this is, the book is not without some flaws. Despite correctly tut-tutting at the anthropomorphism of past naturalists, she is guilty of over dramatizing and anthropomorphizing when trying to shock us with lurid tales of ""panda orgies"" and ""penguin prostitution."" What she goes on to describe is not prostitution at all, but an adaptation in which females steal pebbles after distracting less fit males. She also hints at thrilling, sensationalized terms like necrophilia and homosexuality. While some same-sex partnership has been documented, a lot of what she talks about is no more than the unfettered and thoughtless mating instinct of a dog humping a human leg or the shoulder of a male dog. So while she is right to say that anthropomorphism is ""our major undoing"" in trying to study animals, her own less than subdued chapter hooks are misleading."
197,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636165-wolf,4,"Lucy Cooke’s book is designed as a light hearted read but with a serious purpose. Along the way, it not only entertains but informs. I challenge anyone not to find the biology of the creatures here - and the stories about them - both fascinating and compelling. She has a lovely way of telling her stories - about both animal and the humans who theorised about them, misjudged them, at times horrendously abused them and, sometimes, studied them - with wit and verve. At her best, this recalls the writing of Bill Bryson or Stephen Jay Gould’s popular science. The book would be a great present for anyone who likes their work or enjoys QI.Why not a full five stars, then? Well, I have an advance proof copy - and it is possible that there has been further correction made - but a certain sloppiness has left the book marred by some odd mistakes and slips. For example, the chapter on Eels appears to confuse the First and Second World Wars; at another point we are told that humans have a brain ‘seven times bigger than that of any animal’ (which would be remarkable if true but I suspect the crucial words ‘relative to body size’ have been missed off); the Magaliesberg mountains are said to be 100 years older than Everest (I think 100 times older is what was meant) and so on. I do hope these mistakes have been spotted and corrected. They might not be always the most significant but if as a non expert one can spot them it leads one to question other facts put forward in the book.Otherwise, thoroughly recommended."

Eels, beavers, sloths, hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks, hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees are covered.Each chapter includes notes about what people thought about the animal in the past, what kinds of behaviors are in question, and what we know about the animal currently as compared to the past. There are plenty of facts both historical and scientific. Humor is sprinkled throughout.Even though there is humor, I didn't find it quite as funny as I expected it to be when the blurb compared the book to Mary Roach and Bill Bryson. I enjoyed the facts and most of the chapters, but I was almost lost in the first chapter about eels and their sex lives and origins. Things picked up from there for me, thankfully. The chapters I enjoyed the most were the ones on sloths, hippos, pandas, and penguins.Just a note, a lot of the book has to do with reproduction. And some of the historical facts involve less than humane treatment of the animals in the past.I give this book 4 out of 5 stars.

Turns out, this is the book I should have been reading. Written with passion and humour, Lucy Cooke picks her favourite animals and looks back at how scientific thinking has shifted over time – and how humans have spent a lot of time killing animals in the name of education and science while successfully managing to learn absolutely nothing. Sloths caused a lot of confusion back in the day, we've been wrong about pandas forever, and mooseseses actually have knees. All of the truths revealed here are actual revelations given what the “experts” from wayback claimed. Aristotle, it turns out, was a bit of an idiot. Especially where eels were concerned. And I now know things about penguins I wish I didn't. You also have to marvel at the brain that came up with the idea of strapping bombs to bats. While the past is grisly and at times barbaric, Cooke treads gently through the blood and corpses and guides us to the warm, funny places in each tale. (Yes, I was going to spell it the other way for LOLs...)In doing so, she has created a book packed full of fascinating insights and giggles, written in such an engaging way it's impossible to put down once you've started a new chapter.

, the memoir of a psychotherapist who decided to raise a chimpanzee as his daughter, which apparently includes some raunchy scenes with a vacuum cleaner.However, Cooke's sense of humor doesn't match up perfectly with mine, and I often found myself cringing at her jokes, which were largely unnecessary as the subject matter was already interesting, bizarre, and funny enough without them. She tries too hard to be cute, and on occasion misses the mark in problematic ways in her efforts to make a cheap joke. Her description of female hyenas as ""the original chicks with dicks,"" which also uses the phrase ""trans trickery,"" play into the misconception that trans people are trying to deceive others through their gender presentation (73). The phrasing is entirely inappropriate, using transphobic tropes to convey a misleading message about female hyenas, who are also not attempting to trick anyone, all for the sake of a rhyme and an alliterative phrase that Cooke evidently thought would be a cute way to spice up her writing. It's not cute.Still, certainly an interesting book overall with plenty of positive features."

226,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author, who studied under Richard Dawkins, focuses her expertise on a handful of animals, among them the hyena, hippo, sloth (her favorite), panda, penguin, chimp, and bat. Her premise is that the wild misconceptions about animals from ancient and medieval times, however erroneous they may be, are no more fantastical than the truth. For example, one early solution to the question of where birds go in certain seasons was the suggestion that they fly to the moon. But that's no crazier an idea (in terms of distance) than the actual routes some birds fly in their migratory commute. Another theme is that our interpretations and misconceptions of animals are based on our own ideas. Thus, for example, in the middle ages people wanted moral instructions, so they found moral and immoral animals. As Cooke says, a good religious allegory trumps the truth every time. In terms of misinformation, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, is the villain of the book, with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of erroneous information, apparently made up out of whole cloth and presented with confident, pompous authority. The truth, however, as Cooke presents it, is much more eye-opening than moral allegory. There's the millennia-long search for the eel's gonads (which Sigmund Freud tried looking for early in his career). The debunking of the myth that the beaver throws his testicles at pursuing predators. Sloths and their poop problem (when do they do it). The reverse sexual dimorphism of the hyena, their bizarre birth canals, and their intelligence. Oh, and the bats. There is a lot of torturing bats in the name of science. Also talk about bat penises, and did you know vampires used to be rumored to be able to turn into watermelons? There's the French scientist who created and fitted tiny pants and suspenders on frogs in order to find out what roles the males and females played in reproduction.As you can see, there's a wealth of conversational material here, and I didn't even mention the program to castrate hippos in Colombia. However, as titillating all this is, the book is not without some flaws. Despite correctly tut-tutting at the anthropomorphism of past naturalists, she is guilty of over dramatizing and anthropomorphizing when trying to shock us with lurid tales of ""panda orgies"" and ""penguin prostitution."" What she goes on to describe is not prostitution at all, but an adaptation in which females steal pebbles after distracting less fit males. She also hints at thrilling, sensationalized terms like necrophilia and homosexuality. While some same-sex partnership has been documented, a lot of what she talks about is no more than the unfettered and thoughtless mating instinct of a dog humping a human leg or the shoulder of a male dog. So while she is right to say that anthropomorphism is ""our major undoing"" in trying to study animals, her own less than subdued chapter hooks are misleading."
227,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636165-wolf,4,"Lucy Cooke’s book is designed as a light hearted read but with a serious purpose. Along the way, it not only entertains but informs. I challenge anyone not to find the biology of the creatures here - and the stories about them - both fascinating and compelling. She has a lovely way of telling her stories - about both animal and the humans who theorised about them, misjudged them, at times horrendously abused them and, sometimes, studied them - with wit and verve. At her best, this recalls the writing of Bill Bryson or Stephen Jay Gould’s popular science. The book would be a great present for anyone who likes their work or enjoys QI.Why not a full five stars, then? Well, I have an advance proof copy - and it is possible that there has been further correction made - but a certain sloppiness has left the book marred by some odd mistakes and slips. For example, the chapter on Eels appears to confuse the First and Second World Wars; at another point we are told that humans have a brain ‘seven times bigger than that of any animal’ (which would be remarkable if true but I suspect the crucial words ‘relative to body size’ have been missed off); the Magaliesberg mountains are said to be 100 years older than Everest (I think 100 times older is what was meant) and so on. I do hope these mistakes have been spotted and corrected. They might not be always the most significant but if as a non expert one can spot them it leads one to question other facts put forward in the book.Otherwise, thoroughly recommended."
228,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2509330-laura,4,"The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife by Lucy Cooke is an impressive selection of information on 13 different animals. Eels, beavers, sloths, hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks, hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees are covered.Each chapter includes notes about what people thought about the animal in the past, what kinds of behaviors are in question, and what we know about the animal currently as compared to the past. There are plenty of facts both historical and scientific. Humor is sprinkled throughout.Even though there is humor, I didn't find it quite as funny as I expected it to be when the blurb compared the book to Mary Roach and Bill Bryson. I enjoyed the facts and most of the chapters, but I was almost lost in the first chapter about eels and their sex lives and origins. Things picked up from there for me, thankfully. The chapters I enjoyed the most were the ones on sloths, hippos, pandas, and penguins.Just a note, a lot of the book has to do with reproduction. And some of the historical facts involve less than humane treatment of the animals in the past.I give this book 4 out of 5 stars. Overall. it's well-written and has interesting facts.The Truth About Animals by Lucy Cooke was released April 17th, 2018 from Basic Books part of the Hachette Book Group.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley. My review is freely given and all my own opinions."
229,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60938831-kevin-m,4,"This book is great!A fun trip through the lives of some of our stranger relatives in the Kingdom Animalia, and through the history of science. Sort of a ""can you believe what we used to believe?"", along with a dose of ""can you believe this isn't science fiction?"" romp through different strange and wonderful animals, each with their own chapter.Ever wonder how sloths actually evolved to be so... slothful? Curious about eel gonads? Want to know if that rumour about beavers self-castrating (even the females) in order to evade capture has any whiff of truth? Sometimes the only thing stranger than what animals are capable of is what we thought they were capable of, and Lucy Cooke has a hearty chuckle on both sides. As well as being entertainingly written, it is chock full of fun tidbits of information about maligned, or just plain misunderstood critters that'll be great to throw out randomly in conversation just to see what people's faces look like when you tell them Hippos are most closely related to whales.I heartily recommend this book if you love animals, love facts about them, or want a good laugh."
230,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3771119-julie,4,"This book’s goal is to set the record straight about animals that have been mythologized or misunderstood throughout history. As Cooke states in her conclusion, “The urge to anthropomorphize trips us up and obscures the truth.” Each chapter features a different animal and there are fascinating tidbits throughout. I most enjoyed the anthropological aspects, like why humans are historically hostile towards hyenas. Here are some fascinating things I learned… Hyenas are surprisingly intelligent and have highly developed social structures. A hippo’s closest relative is a whale. Though hippos are indigenous to Africa, there is a burgeoning population of them in South America thanks to Pablo Escobar. A vulture tagged by Israeli scientists was detained is Saudi Arabia for suspicion of being a Mossad spy.My only qualm was that Cooke incorporated some long-winded diatribes of historical naturalists who were so far off the mark, they came off as a bit ridiculous. Overall, it was an interesting read, and I appreciate books like this that give me cocktail party topics that I will put to good use.I received a complimentary copy of this book via the Amazon Vine program."

232,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"Since ancient times people have tried to understand the nature of animals, often reaching bizarre and inaccurate conclusions. Beaver's testicles were said to cure toothaches and other ills. The unfairly maligned sloth was said to be stupid and lazy, rather than brilliantly designed for its environment. Swallows were believed to hibernate in a state of suspended animation at the bottom of a lake. It's amusing to consider these outlandish theories but Lucy Cooke also tells us about cruel experiments conducted upon animals in an attempt to prove them. The true nature of animals is endlessly fascinating and this book also unveils some little known facts and explodes old myths in a captivating fashion."

Although I probably wouldn’t have picked it off the shelf unprompted (I received an uncorrected proof), it’s not another book simply listing weird and interesting animal facts. Really, it’s taking a hard look at the way humans have misunderstood and misrepresented animals over the ages, from Aristotle to the Age of Enlightenment and through to today. Despite the sometimes-sobering details, it reads like a casual, humorous dinner conversation with someone who really knows their stuff. It is also brimming with curious animal facts, but presented in a way to make you think as well as to amuse."

Each chapter is about a different animal (eels, beavers, sloths,hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees), which makes it a perfect read for times when you want something informative, and entertaining in a small dose (usually 20+ pages).I would love to recommend it to a young person interested in science or animals BUT with the caveat that there is a fair amount of detail about interesting mating habits and anatomy."

256,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,4,"The author, who studied under Richard Dawkins, focuses her expertise on a handful of animals, among them the hyena, hippo, sloth (her favorite), panda, penguin, chimp, and bat. Her premise is that the wild misconceptions about animals from ancient and medieval times, however erroneous they may be, are no more fantastical than the truth. For example, one early solution to the question of where birds go in certain seasons was the suggestion that they fly to the moon. But that's no crazier an idea (in terms of distance) than the actual routes some birds fly in their migratory commute. Another theme is that our interpretations and misconceptions of animals are based on our own ideas. Thus, for example, in the middle ages people wanted moral instructions, so they found moral and immoral animals. As Cooke says, a good religious allegory trumps the truth every time. In terms of misinformation, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, is the villain of the book, with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of erroneous information, apparently made up out of whole cloth and presented with confident, pompous authority. The truth, however, as Cooke presents it, is much more eye-opening than moral allegory. There's the millennia-long search for the eel's gonads (which Sigmund Freud tried looking for early in his career). The debunking of the myth that the beaver throws his testicles at pursuing predators. Sloths and their poop problem (when do they do it). The reverse sexual dimorphism of the hyena, their bizarre birth canals, and their intelligence. Oh, and the bats. There is a lot of torturing bats in the name of science. Also talk about bat penises, and did you know vampires used to be rumored to be able to turn into watermelons? There's the French scientist who created and fitted tiny pants and suspenders on frogs in order to find out what roles the males and females played in reproduction.As you can see, there's a wealth of conversational material here, and I didn't even mention the program to castrate hippos in Colombia. However, as titillating all this is, the book is not without some flaws. Despite correctly tut-tutting at the anthropomorphism of past naturalists, she is guilty of over dramatizing and anthropomorphizing when trying to shock us with lurid tales of ""panda orgies"" and ""penguin prostitution."" What she goes on to describe is not prostitution at all, but an adaptation in which females steal pebbles after distracting less fit males. She also hints at thrilling, sensationalized terms like necrophilia and homosexuality. While some same-sex partnership has been documented, a lot of what she talks about is no more than the unfettered and thoughtless mating instinct of a dog humping a human leg or the shoulder of a male dog. So while she is right to say that anthropomorphism is ""our major undoing"" in trying to study animals, her own less than subdued chapter hooks are misleading."
257,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636165-wolf,4,"Lucy Cooke’s book is designed as a light hearted read but with a serious purpose. Along the way, it not only entertains but informs. I challenge anyone not to find the biology of the creatures here - and the stories about them - both fascinating and compelling. She has a lovely way of telling her stories - about both animal and the humans who theorised about them, misjudged them, at times horrendously abused them and, sometimes, studied them - with wit and verve. At her best, this recalls the writing of Bill Bryson or Stephen Jay Gould’s popular science. The book would be a great present for anyone who likes their work or enjoys QI.Why not a full five stars, then? Well, I have an advance proof copy - and it is possible that there has been further correction made - but a certain sloppiness has left the book marred by some odd mistakes and slips. For example, the chapter on Eels appears to confuse the First and Second World Wars; at another point we are told that humans have a brain ‘seven times bigger than that of any animal’ (which would be remarkable if true but I suspect the crucial words ‘relative to body size’ have been missed off); the Magaliesberg mountains are said to be 100 years older than Everest (I think 100 times older is what was meant) and so on. I do hope these mistakes have been spotted and corrected. They might not be always the most significant but if as a non expert one can spot them it leads one to question other facts put forward in the book.Otherwise, thoroughly recommended."
258,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2509330-laura,4,"The Truth About Animals: Stoned Sloths, Lovelorn Hippos, and Other Tales from the Wild Side of Wildlife by Lucy Cooke is an impressive selection of information on 13 different animals. Eels, beavers, sloths, hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks, hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees are covered.Each chapter includes notes about what people thought about the animal in the past, what kinds of behaviors are in question, and what we know about the animal currently as compared to the past. There are plenty of facts both historical and scientific. Humor is sprinkled throughout.Even though there is humor, I didn't find it quite as funny as I expected it to be when the blurb compared the book to Mary Roach and Bill Bryson. I enjoyed the facts and most of the chapters, but I was almost lost in the first chapter about eels and their sex lives and origins. Things picked up from there for me, thankfully. The chapters I enjoyed the most were the ones on sloths, hippos, pandas, and penguins.Just a note, a lot of the book has to do with reproduction. And some of the historical facts involve less than humane treatment of the animals in the past.I give this book 4 out of 5 stars. Overall. it's well-written and has interesting facts.The Truth About Animals by Lucy Cooke was released April 17th, 2018 from Basic Books part of the Hachette Book Group.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley. My review is freely given and all my own opinions."
259,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60938831-kevin-m,4,"This book is great!A fun trip through the lives of some of our stranger relatives in the Kingdom Animalia, and through the history of science. Sort of a ""can you believe what we used to believe?"", along with a dose of ""can you believe this isn't science fiction?"" romp through different strange and wonderful animals, each with their own chapter.Ever wonder how sloths actually evolved to be so... slothful? Curious about eel gonads? Want to know if that rumour about beavers self-castrating (even the females) in order to evade capture has any whiff of truth? Sometimes the only thing stranger than what animals are capable of is what we thought they were capable of, and Lucy Cooke has a hearty chuckle on both sides. As well as being entertainingly written, it is chock full of fun tidbits of information about maligned, or just plain misunderstood critters that'll be great to throw out randomly in conversation just to see what people's faces look like when you tell them Hippos are most closely related to whales.I heartily recommend this book if you love animals, love facts about them, or want a good laugh."
260,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3771119-julie,4,"This book’s goal is to set the record straight about animals that have been mythologized or misunderstood throughout history. As Cooke states in her conclusion, “The urge to anthropomorphize trips us up and obscures the truth.” Each chapter features a different animal and there are fascinating tidbits throughout. I most enjoyed the anthropological aspects, like why humans are historically hostile towards hyenas. Here are some fascinating things I learned… Hyenas are surprisingly intelligent and have highly developed social structures. A hippo’s closest relative is a whale. Though hippos are indigenous to Africa, there is a burgeoning population of them in South America thanks to Pablo Escobar. A vulture tagged by Israeli scientists was detained is Saudi Arabia for suspicion of being a Mossad spy.My only qualm was that Cooke incorporated some long-winded diatribes of historical naturalists who were so far off the mark, they came off as a bit ridiculous. Overall, it was an interesting read, and I appreciate books like this that give me cocktail party topics that I will put to good use.I received a complimentary copy of this book via the Amazon Vine program."

I learned so many cool things about animals, and loved the humour of the author as well. A fabulous listen! (Read for the Book Riot 2018 Read Harder Challenge - Read a book about nature)"
262,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"Since ancient times people have tried to understand the nature of animals, often reaching bizarre and inaccurate conclusions. Beaver's testicles were said to cure toothaches and other ills. The unfairly maligned sloth was said to be stupid and lazy, rather than brilliantly designed for its environment. Swallows were believed to hibernate in a state of suspended animation at the bottom of a lake. It's amusing to consider these outlandish theories but Lucy Cooke also tells us about cruel experiments conducted upon animals in an attempt to prove them. The true nature of animals is endlessly fascinating and this book also unveils some little known facts and explodes old myths in a captivating fashion."
263,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13814355-a,4,"I really enjoyed this book. Although I probably wouldn’t have picked it off the shelf unprompted (I received an uncorrected proof), it’s not another book simply listing weird and interesting animal facts. Really, it’s taking a hard look at the way humans have misunderstood and misrepresented animals over the ages, from Aristotle to the Age of Enlightenment and through to today. Despite the sometimes-sobering details, it reads like a casual, humorous dinner conversation with someone who really knows their stuff. It is also brimming with curious animal facts, but presented in a way to make you think as well as to amuse."

Each chapter is about a different animal (eels, beavers, sloths,hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees), which makes it a perfect read for times when you want something informative, and entertaining in a small dose (usually 20+ pages).I would love to recommend it to a young person interested in science or animals BUT with the caveat that there is a fair amount of detail about interesting mating habits and anatomy."

She specializes in animal behavior and evolution. Among Lucy’s professors at Oxford was Richard Dawkins, who is a world-renowned Zoologist and author. Lucy is passionate about conservation as well as her love of all sloth kind. She is referred to as the next David Attenborough in some circles.Her Curriculum Vitae includes a diverse range of skills including: television producer, director, award- winning documentary presenter, and filmmaker. Lucy has lecture at TED talks, was a New York Times best-selling author, and founded the Sloth Appreciation Society.In May, 2015 at the age of 45, Lucy was diagnosed with breast cancer. She changed her lifestyle as a result of the diagnosis and has an increased appreciation of life and love.Who is the Target Audience for The Truth About Animals?Any adult would enjoy this funny sojourn into the private and strange lives of animals, reptiles, and birds. Some subjects included for your edification are: the link between pregnancy and toads, stories about storks and their journeys, and tales of necrophilia in penguin communities. These subjects are woven together in a dialogue filled with irony and humor.The author’s style of writing reminds me of Gerard Durrell, author of My Family and Other Animals. If you enjoy well written prose, that are comprehensively researched, and delivered in an irreverent manner, then this could be your next favorite read.What is the Book About?The Truth About Animals is a collection of short stories about various creatures, and the different scientific approaches to the study of animals. Throughout the book your views may be challenged, concepts you had may be reversed or revised, as intricate details of the life of various creatures are revealed. You can expect to be introduced to the Sloth Appreciation Society, discover why Hippos leak, how slippery eels really are, and how bats aren’t as bad as you think. On the journey you will also meet the crazy scientists that used questionable methods to investigate animal senses, the scientist that took the elephant phallus to the face, and the men who believed that swifts sleep the entire winter under water.The genuine love and affection that Lucy has for all animal kind is replete throughout the book and, at times, is almost palpable. The message is simple and clear, we must protect habitats and the animals will do the rest. This position is made clear when she discusses the plight of the Chinese Pandas.I enjoyed the book because it was humorous and with each turn of a page, I learned something new. This book is immensely funny at times and subtly so at other times.In Conclusion>/b>You will enjoy this book if you are looking for fun and learning. Very few authors can write in the way that Lucy Cooke writes. Whilst she isn’t unique, she is a huge talent. This book is: well written, intelligently delivered, beautifully researched, and infinitely humorous. The Truth About Animals is a must have for anyone who loves nature."
269,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5962819-kahn,0,"Back in 2017 I started reading Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? – a book that answered this question (no) in the opening chapter, rendering the rest of the book moot. Turns out, this is the book I should have been reading. Written with passion and humour, Lucy Cooke picks her favourite animals and looks back at how scientific thinking has shifted over time – and how humans have spent a lot of time killing animals in the name of education and science while successfully managing to learn absolutely nothing. Sloths caused a lot of confusion back in the day, we've been wrong about pandas forever, and mooseseses actually have knees. All of the truths revealed here are actual revelations given what the “experts” from wayback claimed. Aristotle, it turns out, was a bit of an idiot. Especially where eels were concerned. And I now know things about penguins I wish I didn't. You also have to marvel at the brain that came up with the idea of strapping bombs to bats. While the past is grisly and at times barbaric, Cooke treads gently through the blood and corpses and guides us to the warm, funny places in each tale. (Yes, I was going to spell it the other way for LOLs...)In doing so, she has created a book packed full of fascinating insights and giggles, written in such an engaging way it's impossible to put down once you've started a new chapter. Science-based books can be dry and dull, but Lucy Cooke has dusted off that preconception and crafted a piece of work that will appeal to everyone. Even those of us who used to like penguins."
270,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7973110-lin,5,"Very interesting book that sets the record straight on some of our persistent misconceptions about animals.

271,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1273285-andrew,5,"Completely enjoyed this book which describes the strangeness of the animal kingdom and certain animals, including eels, moose, pandas, and chimps. Cooke explore these animals from a zoological perspective and historical perspective, particularly how naturalists and biologists of the past misunderstood these animals or infused their attempts to understand them with anthromorphism or religious underpinnings. Cooke’s point is that these animals aren’t here for our entertainment or even for us to study and the only way we can truly understand nature is to try to view the animals that comprise the world from their perspective and not ours. But the book isn’t all deep thoughts but contain fascinating glimpses at amazing animals. Who knew that the genitalia of hyenas could be so enthralling."
272,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25870001-lizzy,4,"*This is an ARC Goodreads Giveaway*I appreciated how this book was organized into sections of specific animals and the animals selected. The book often felt like a natural history book, with sections often giving a history of ecological thought, which is something I'd never encountered before. I learned new things about animals, and valued the new perspectives presented to me in regards to how certain animals are used or viewed by the world. I'd recommend this to a nature lover who is already familiar with and well read in basic ecology"
273,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5054798-mayda,3,"Everything you ever wanted to know about animals and a lot you didn’t can be found in this extensively researched book. Read by the author in this audio version, you can’t help but be caught up in the author's obvious enthusiasm about her subjects. While some of the information imparted is interesting, especially details about their habitats and habits, there is an abundant amount of information about their mating habits, especially the peculiar aspects of them. It may be the truth, but I wish the author emphasized other things. "
274,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94080442-katelynn,5,"With suggestive humor and a bit of orneriness, Cooke clears up crazy misconceptions about some of the world’s more mysterious and underappreciated species. Throughout, she dissects these past theories for signs of human superiority, a binary physical understanding, and a little too much of the woodsy musk from a beaver's “gonads.” What’s left: Hyenas are avid feminists, Eels keep their coitus quiet, and Sloths are pretty much the ultimate survivalists. You can devour this all at once or savor each chapter as an individual essay, but you will be amazed by the truth (and bestiary sketches) either way."

276,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40159364-moses-hetfield,3,"This book was informative, enjoyable, and easy to get through. The book is basically a history of zoology and misconceptions about certain animals, some of which were pretty wild. Cooke cites a number of sources that sound absolutely fascinating, from medieval bestiaries to 
Lucy: Growing Up Human: A Chimpanzee Daughter in a Psychotherapist's Family
, the memoir of a psychotherapist who decided to raise a chimpanzee as his daughter, which apparently includes some raunchy scenes with a vacuum cleaner.However, Cooke's sense of humor doesn't match up perfectly with mine, and I often found myself cringing at her jokes, which were largely unnecessary as the subject matter was already interesting, bizarre, and funny enough without them. She tries too hard to be cute, and on occasion misses the mark in problematic ways in her efforts to make a cheap joke. Her description of female hyenas as ""the original chicks with dicks,"" which also uses the phrase ""trans trickery,"" play into the misconception that trans people are trying to deceive others through their gender presentation (73).

For example, the chapter on Eels appears to confuse the First and Second World Wars; at another point we are told that humans have a brain ‘seven times bigger than that of any animal’ (which would be remarkable if true but I suspect the crucial words ‘relative to body size’ have been missed off); the Magaliesberg mountains are said to be 100 years older than Everest (I think 100 times older is what was meant) and so on. I do hope these mistakes have been spotted and corrected. They might not be always the most significant but if as a non expert one can spot them it leads one to question other facts put forward in the book.Otherwise, thoroughly recommended."

Eels, beavers, sloths, hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks, hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees are covered.Each chapter includes notes about what people thought about the animal in the past, what kinds of behaviors are in question, and what we know about the animal currently as compared to the past. There are plenty of facts both historical and scientific. Humor is sprinkled throughout.Even though there is humor, I didn't find it quite as funny as I expected it to be when the blurb compared the book to Mary Roach and Bill Bryson. I enjoyed the facts and most of the chapters, but I was almost lost in the first chapter about eels and their sex lives and origins. Things picked up from there for me, thankfully. The chapters I enjoyed the most were the ones on sloths, hippos, pandas, and penguins.Just a note, a lot of the book has to do with reproduction. And some of the historical facts involve less than humane treatment of the animals in the past.I give this book 4 out of 5 stars. Overall. it's well-written and has interesting facts.The Truth About Animals by Lucy Cooke was released April 17th, 2018 from Basic Books part of the Hachette Book Group.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley. My review is freely given and all my own opinions."

Sort of a ""can you believe what we used to believe?"", along with a dose of ""can you believe this isn't science fiction?"" romp through different strange and wonderful animals, each with their own chapter.Ever wonder how sloths actually evolved to be so... slothful? Curious about eel gonads? Want to know if that rumour about beavers self-castrating (even the females) in order to evade capture has any whiff of truth? Sometimes the only thing stranger than what animals are capable of is what we thought they were capable of, and Lucy Cooke has a hearty chuckle on both sides. As well as being entertainingly written, it is chock full of fun tidbits of information about maligned, or just plain misunderstood critters that'll be great to throw out randomly in conversation just to see what people's faces look like when you tell them Hippos are most closely related to whales.I heartily recommend this book if you love animals, love facts about them, or want a good laugh."
290,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3771119-julie,4,"This book’s goal is to set the record straight about animals that have been mythologized or misunderstood throughout history. As Cooke states in her conclusion, “The urge to anthropomorphize trips us up and obscures the truth.” Each chapter features a different animal and there are fascinating tidbits throughout. I most enjoyed the anthropological aspects, like why humans are historically hostile towards hyenas. Here are some fascinating things I learned… Hyenas are surprisingly intelligent and have highly developed social structures. A hippo’s closest relative is a whale. Though hippos are indigenous to Africa, there is a burgeoning population of them in South America thanks to Pablo Escobar. A vulture tagged by Israeli scientists was detained is Saudi Arabia for suspicion of being a Mossad spy.My only qualm was that Cooke incorporated some long-winded diatribes of historical naturalists who were so far off the mark, they came off as a bit ridiculous. Overall, it was an interesting read, and I appreciate books like this that give me cocktail party topics that I will put to good use.I received a complimentary copy of this book via the Amazon Vine program."
291,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41387144-kari,5,"This book was perhaps the most delightful I’ve read this year! I learned so many cool things about animals, and loved the humour of the author as well. A fabulous listen! (Read for the Book Riot 2018 Read Harder Challenge - Read a book about nature)"
292,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence,4,"Since ancient times people have tried to understand the nature of animals, often reaching bizarre and inaccurate conclusions. Beaver's testicles were said to cure toothaches and other ills. The unfairly maligned sloth was said to be stupid and lazy, rather than brilliantly designed for its environment. Swallows were believed to hibernate in a state of suspended animation at the bottom of a lake. It's amusing to consider these outlandish theories but Lucy Cooke also tells us about cruel experiments conducted upon animals in an attempt to prove them. The true nature of animals is endlessly fascinating and this book also unveils some little known facts and explodes old myths in a captivating fashion."
293,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13814355-a,4,"I really enjoyed this book. Although I probably wouldn’t have picked it off the shelf unprompted (I received an uncorrected proof), it’s not another book simply listing weird and interesting animal facts. Really, it’s taking a hard look at the way humans have misunderstood and misrepresented animals over the ages, from Aristotle to the Age of Enlightenment and through to today. Despite the sometimes-sobering details, it reads like a casual, humorous dinner conversation with someone who really knows their stuff. It is also brimming with curious animal facts, but presented in a way to make you think as well as to amuse."
294,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,4,"Somewhere between a 4 and a 5. This is a really fun and fascinating exploration of animals. Each chapter is about a different animal (eels, beavers, sloths,hyenas, vultures, bats, frogs, storks hippos, moose, pandas, penguins, and chimpanzees), which makes it a perfect read for times when you want something informative, and entertaining in a small dose (usually 20+ pages).I would love to recommend it to a young person interested in science or animals BUT with the caveat that there is a fair amount of detail about interesting mating habits and anatomy."
295,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829466-sara,5,"Lived up to its expectations. Agree that she’s a bit Mary Roach- Sam Kean in her approach. A fun page turner that has many tails about famous species.Among my favorites were: tales of the sloth’s bad rap, the panda’s overblown infertility, and the daring penguin adventure. All the chapters are fairly succinct, engaging, and at times surprising. Hope she continues to write more!! "
296,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/851311-mackie-welch,5,"This was so good! So funny, I never thought I'd laugh out loud at an animal book that didn't feature talking animals. It's seriously bananas some of the stuff we used to think about animals, and the sheer volume of things we have yet to learn. Let's just hope we can turn our environment around so we have time to learn everything there is to know. "

The message is simple and clear, we must protect habitats and the animals will do the rest.

This book is immensely funny at times and subtly so at other times.In Conclusion>/b>You will enjoy this book if you are looking for fun and learning.

299,0465094643,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5962819-kahn,0,"Back in 2017 I started reading Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? – a book that answered this question (no) in the opening chapter, rendering the rest of the book moot. Turns out, this is the book I should have been reading. Written with passion and humour, Lucy Cooke picks her favourite animals and looks back at how scientific thinking has shifted over time – and how humans have spent a lot of time killing animals in the name of education and science while successfully managing to learn absolutely nothing. Sloths caused a lot of confusion back in the day, we've been wrong about pandas forever, and mooseseses actually have knees. All of the truths revealed here are actual revelations given what the “experts” from wayback claimed. Aristotle, it turns out, was a bit of an idiot. Especially where eels were concerned. And I now know things about penguins I wish I didn't. You also have to marvel at the brain that came up with the idea of strapping bombs to bats. While the past is grisly and at times barbaric, Cooke treads gently through the blood and corpses and guides us to the warm, funny places in each tale. (Yes, I was going to spell it the other way for LOLs...)In doing so, she has created a book packed full of fascinating insights and giggles, written in such an engaging way it's impossible to put down once you've started a new chapter. Science-based books can be dry and dull, but Lucy Cooke has dusted off that preconception and crafted a piece of work that will appeal to everyone. Even those of us who used to like penguins."
