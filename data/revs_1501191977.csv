0,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,2,"Oh boy, I just finished this and I'm incredibly annoyed. I want to start off by saying that I didn't pay for this and I'm glad I didn't. I had credits on Amazon to get a kindle book so this was one of the ones I bought because I had heard Sinclair on Peter Attia's podcast and I had thought that this book would be more research and science heavy. The last almost hundred pages of this book of 300-ish pages is what put me in such a bad mood. Personally I have zero patience for self styled thought leaders of any kind and people who want to spend all my time telling me about some inevitable future. The last third of this book is about the future and supposedly is grappling with the ethics of extending human life, which it doesnt do convincingly. There was no mention of research really and Sinclair uses random studies to try to justify his idea that living forever will actually be good for us. What was the point of using that study on people who stopped to help other people to try and say that people living longer might feel less rushed and imply it would make us kinder and then to proceed to acknowledge what an idiotic thing that was to say because of the leap being made. Like just leave it out man. Also I don't care about his politics, even if a lot of it aligns with my own, like why are you telling me this. It just felt annoying and self important for him to tell me these things I dont care about. I dont want to know about Sinclair's hopes and dreams and positions on high profile issues. The best part of this book was just the middle part where he actually discussed the research and science and interesting ideas of what may be happening. I wish it had been more of that and less of this exposition of himself and his life. Also this is going to be hypocritical but it was so annoying how it didn't have as much of a cohesive structure or flow through out the book and how he jumped from thing to thing without building on it and going into depth and detail about it. I know my reviews are chaotic but I'm not charging money or styling myself as some expert in something and branding myself as giving you the secrets understanding that thing. I feel like the whole purpose of this book is for Sinclair to expand on his on feelings and issues and experiences of the issue of aging. It serves the purpose of persuasion to push for viewing aging in the framework he thinks it should be viewed in and to thus allow for more attention/funding towards the issue. None of that is wrong per se but it could have been done much better and concisely if he didn't jump around trying to predict the future and cover technologies that he's clearly not working on first hand and thus creating weaker sections in the book. I probably would've given it a higher rating regardless of my own expectations for a book heavier on the science side and work being done in his lab if it hadn't felt so grating to have it jump around so much, have him pushing himself as some predictor of the future, and having him only superficially address concerns with what he wants to do. I also would probably have given this a better rating if it weren't filled with so many anecdotes and name dropping so many people who I also don't care about. I think its great that people are accomplished and they're very impressive people and etc etc but just giving me names and one sentence descriptions of what people are working on is useless for my own purposes. Anyway this is 2.5 stars from me, this might be a good read for someone else but as someone with more of a science background who wants to read science books on research that are rigorous and more heavily focused on the research and actually goes over things like limitations of said research in a more thorough fashion this didn't appeal to me at all. I don't enjoy anything about people's predicting the future either, regardless of how much merit those predictions have and how often that person is right, because the future isn't set and is shaped by decisions we make today and I'd much rather here how people themselves are working to shape it and why they think we should work to shape it that way. Just people espousing what is and isn't possible isn't really appealing to me because I already am open to trying things out and I would much rather they saving their persuasion for others. Also I wanted Sinclair to talk about the science, if I wanted to political theory I would go to other sources, nothing is worse than high profile people, especially thought leaders, worrying about things like the far right and left and polarization. Like everyone's entitled to their opinions on it but write a separate book or something. You don't see me begrudging Pinker for being annoying because i simply choose not to pick up his book because I know it'll annoy me with its framing. I know I should just stop but also this isn't the reason I rated it 2.5 stars because halfway through when he was talking about research I was probably at 3.5-4 stars rating wise but man as someone with a fundamentally surly temperament there's nothing more annoying than people who insist we need to be optimistic. Like yeah things are getting better but who cares, how is it useful to focus on that instead of problems and addressing them. Like maybe I just dont care enough about feeling good about things and so this just wouldn't appeal to me anyway.Also Sinclair said he isn't afraid to die at the end of the book but insists through out the book that death is painful and horrible. Sinclair needs to read about Montaigne's experience with death and how it changed his fears of death by showing him actually its not bad sometimes. I also have almost died and can also attest that when it's happening it isn't painful at all, it just happens and in fact at points you can feel euphoria even. I'm going to leave it at that because my own feelings of death weren't really relevant to how I felt about the book in generalAnyways TL;DR: this was 2.5 stars because I was expecting a book that was heavier on covering the science in this area and because the last 100 pages pissed me off. Others may enjoy it if they go in knowing what to expect and have less curmudgeonly personalities."

It is well written and the illustrations are lovely, but the information on extending healthspan could be summarized in a paragraph. I was also disappointed in how shallow some of the explanations were. I was hoping for an substantive monograph written for the lay person (like Zimmer’s work) but this is not that.So then what is taking up the bulk of these 400+ pages?Anecdotes, personal background, topics related to government budgeting, why health span research is important, and other things I did not buy this book for.

2,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Immortality sounds... nice. Too utopic, still, but prolonging life for spans that seem unimaginable at the moment may be a standard procedure in a not so far future.Sinclair, a professor of genetics and expert in the field of the science of aging from the Harvard medical school, summarizes the status quo of how to stay young and healthy as long as possible.At the moment, the way to a longer life is a pretty hard one, focussing on some elemental and prooven elements:Workout for both strength and endurance.Have a happy relationship and a social network of few, close, real, true friends. Tricky.Rarely eat until you are replete, calory restriction, fasting, detoxication, time-restricted eating, and a healthy diet are some of the most important factors because they can slow the aging process. Other factors are nice too, but those are the ones that don´t just boost your happiness and immune system, but really let you get old slower. Not just each cigarette shortens your life, but each extra snack too.Pets aren´t a bad idea.Find fulfillment in work, but a work-life balance too.Perfect sleeping cycle between 7 and 9 hours with or without power naps, but one between 15 to 30 minutes might be recommended.No orgies, drugs, very small doses of alcohol and sugar, no getting fat and untrained.Curiosity, trying new things, always searching for something new and different, brain training, puzzles, foreign languages, self-reflection, life-long learning.Mindfulness.Be happy and resistant to stress, be conscious, meditate. Control of emotions and thoughtsEtc.There is a huge and completely unnecessary exposition and anecdote problem in Sinclair´s writing, a prime example of very clever and competent people who don´t take the time to invest in creative writing and science communication skills, not to speak of show, don´t tell. Instead of driveling about the organization, unimportant parts of research, himself, and even some completely irrelevant things, he could have used these dry, boring knowledge as exposition by including it in stories, not making it an appendix one asks why it´s there, because readers want the science of aging, not the boredom of bureaucracy that let´s one feel immortal by slowing time to zero. That´s especially a missed chance because there are so many sciences and knowledge around this topic of, well, dying later, that dozens of books could be written about it from the perspectives of different fields. By simply avoiding this inflation with the help of a professional science writer, cutting aways at least half of the redundancy and empty narrative calories and pimping the rest, as many of the leading science nonfiction writers use to do, he could have made a solid 5 star and presented his knowledge in a much more appealing way. When people write autobiographies, they should name, and not camouflage, their mindchild. The hard truth is, until a probable wonder cure may make one immortal, the only way to possibly live until this point is to live the very hard life of an always hungry, happy, curious, positive, etc., ascetic. Good genes might be helpful too and in understanding those might lie one of the first medical applications, first in adding them in vitro fertilization processes to create long-living humans and later possibly in adult ones too or even create new longevity genes. To pimp telomeres so much that they last forever and youth never goes is more of a long-term perspective. A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejuven...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_ex..."
3,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54898322-michael,3,"Being part of the health enhancement community for my entire career I was familiar with the topics and theories on aging as presented by Havard Med School staffer Dr. David Sinclair. Many of Dr. Sinclair's recommendations such as calorie restriction (CR), exercise, sleep and moderate to low protein intake are well vetted. Other suggestions including the intake of NAD, Metformin, and Rapamycin MAY have anti-aging effects but are less well known and have potential downsides.Since living long sounds dreadful with a broken body and mind I tend to focus more on healthspan. My personal recommendations did not change as a result of reading this book. -Sleep 7-9 hours each night. Find your sweet spot. -Strength Train 2-3 times per week-Do 3 conditioning sessions per week mixing sessions that are long and easy to short and challenging. Murdering yourself with three ten minute WODS leaves a lot to be desired. -Eat when the sun comes up and stop when the sunsets. Time-Restricted Eating (TRE) On occasion skip a meal.-Don't get fat. Limit your sugar and alcohol. -Read, play word games, Lumosity and meditate-Find someone to love-Get a dog, walk them, pet them. Never forget, Your DNA loads the gun, but your lifestyle pulls the trigger. "
4,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"Coming from a perspective of someone who studies evidence-based nutrition, exercise, and healthy lifestyle factors for over a decade now, this book is a must-read.Solving aging is one of the final frontiers for humankind, and the information David has provided here is a big step in the right direction. It has the power to bring more awareness to solving aging as well as shift strong limiting beliefs that have been deeply rooted in public as well as the scientific community.We've come very far in research, but sadly the mainstream still hasn't caught up as many of the theories often mentioned have already been invalidated. Big thanks to David and his team for putting together all the most up-to-date longevity research in one place.Having read this book I'm even more excited about future research and grateful to be alive in this time where such research is taken seriously."
5,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75277809-g,2,"The book consists of 1) a history of aging and longevity related science, 2) a a handwavey survey of some interesting metabolic pathways and genetic/epigenetic programming techniques that Prof. Sinclair and friends have pursued, 3.) philosophical, aesthetic, and moral arguments on why pursuing lifespan extension is good.It's well-written and I enjoyed Prof. Sinclair's distinctive writing style and purview. I learned a bit on what papers and authors I should read more deeply for Parts (1) and (2), but I was disappointed in the overall depth and lack of systematic, holistic discussion of how the individual research streams came together. I thought (3) was finely articulated, but no conceptual new grounds were covered. The main thesis that Sinclair builds up is his ""Information Theory of Aging."" He's inspired by Claude Shannon's seminal work and the TCP/IP protocol, but the analogy is not very well-fleshed out and feels like a forced analogy. Essentially, Prof. Sinclair believes that epigenetic 'debris' accrues on DNA and aging cells lose differentiation. Sinclair believes this can be reversed because each cell has a stored copy of 'youthful' epigenetic state that can re-programmed towards. It's an intriguing idea but he unfortunately doesn't provide much evidence or even a mechanism of how this actually works in practice. Recommended for novice longevity enthusiasts, but there's not much new insight for the serious reader unfortunately."
6,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,5,"This is an intriguing book written by the renowned Harvard researcher, David Sinclair.Sinclair believes that our attitudes about the inevitability of aging may be somewhat flawed. In fact, based on his research, he believes that not only will we be able to slow aging down, we may someday be able to reverse it. He discusses the shortcomings of aging research that is partly a function of the fact that we don't currently classify aging as a chronic disease, thereby making its research ineligible for government funding. He also argues, and strongly so, that aging is by far the biggest threat we face, pointing out that most other chronic diseases are secondary to the aging process. The last fourth of the book explores the social, cultural, and ethical implications of extending life significantly. This, for me, was wasted space as it's all supposition and didn't really do the topic justice. Definitely worth a read for anyone who is interested in cutting edge anti-aging science. According to Sinclair, understanding why we age (something that is becoming more clear) is the first step in stopping and maybe reversing the process. Some things that might slow aging...fasting, short exposure to temperature extremes (hot or cold), the diabetes medication metformin. According to Sinclair, it's an issue of when and not an issue of if we will be able to slow/reverse aging. The cure for aging is on the horizon. And, he's probably right."
7,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59748187-elise,4,"I read this for work and while the science/DNA-level detail in the front part is pretty dense, the book really opens up when he writes about the possibility for treating aging as a disease and all the things that currently kill us (heart disease, cancers) as its symptoms. And then the social impacts of society living much, much longer than we currently do. I am now operating as if I will live to 100, and we're talking GOOD years, not wasting away. So this book has really changed the way I think about aging, which I used to just accept as something inevitable."
8,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63028700-henry,5,"Highly recommended. There is a lot of complicated science in this book (at least to me), but there are ideas and views that cannot be ignored. You may not agree with everything the author espouses, particularly some of his political views, but this book provides a lot of important things to think about and, if you are so inclined, to discuss with others. Providing thought provoking ideas is always good."
9,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56609924-flaviu-vescan,5,"I have a feeling this will be a long review, so if you're just looking for some cliff-notes then mine are: ""This book has the potential to change the way you live your life. You might not enjoy reading it (*1), but the topic it addresses will definitely affect you personally. Whether it's right after reading it (*2), or at a societal level in the years to come, that's up to you."" Now for the long version...My previous knowledge of David Sinclair was from his visits to JRE podcast, where I found him to be an insightful and smart fella' (*3). This also comes across throughout the book, which was nice to see. I'm not denying that I went into this with a bias towards liking it, but like everything I read, I try to correct for it. The way I see it, books can serve many purposes. Whether it's as simple as keeping you from having your own thoughts for a few dead minutes (*4), entertaining you with a well-written prose, engaging you in an action-twisted plot or changing your entire world-view by completely removing a deep-rooted assumption you've previously held since you were 4 years old, I'll have to say this book very much does the latter. I'm not a slob to begin with. Ever since high-school my views were that your body should not be mistreated. That is if you plan on it being there for you in the long run. You either routinely take care of it as a force of habit, or you eventually try to patch it up in a very painful, costly and potentially mentally debilitating way at some point in the future (which personally, I see the loss of mental faculties as the highest price you can pay for neglect). This lead me to always try my best at being up to date on the latest medical discoveries and trying to fine tune my mental model of how my body works in hopes of better maintaining it. That being said, I always started off by assuming that I have somewhere around 40-ish healthy adult years ahead of me (if I'm lucky), and that I should try and work around that when it came to setting goals and thinking what long-term choices are best for me to take. This book challenges that assumption to it's core. What if my previous goal of having a decently healthy standard lifespan are me setting a low bar? Of course, I'll be lucky to have that in any case, but what if I could set the bar at actually increasing the limit of those 40 years instead? My previous goal of keeping a good health is already on the table and is pretty much included in the new goal, so what would it cost me to raise my health-span (*5)? This book did a decent job at answering that question for me and I found the answer shocking. I think the reason I found it shocking is because of a life-long aversion to anything that advertises *rejuvenation* or *making you young again* gained from the bombardment of marketing buzzwords and a tradition of snake-oil salesmen humanity has had for millennia. It might be a case of boy-cry-wolf at a grand scale. We've been burned by bad/fake science & marketing for many years, so now when actual hard science tells us that ""hey... you know this crazy idea we've had about stopping aging, well it seems it might actually be doable.""(*6), our knee-jerk reaction is to ignore it.David is not promising that, but what he does is show you just how close we might be to achieving it soon. That to me is mind-blowing out of the box. The book details how different discoveries clicked together in recent years to get us from seeing it as a crazy idea to a technology problem?! And as far as it goes, we're pretty good at solving technology issues when they get enough time and funding.There's a great deal of things you can do now that are natural and proven to at least postpone some aspects of aging, but the review is long already and I want you to do the work of reading it to actually find out.*1 - you might not enjoy the style, length, analogies, etc.*2 - by curving your calorie intake, taking better care of yourself etc.*3 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOTS0...*4 - that's not something we allow anymore as a society.*5 - health-span = % of lifespan lived in good health*6 - scientific shrug ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
10,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1985566-marios,5,"Absolutely fascinating read about the past (what we know), present (what we are learning) and future (where we are going) of the anti-aging science research. Along with “Why we Sleep” of Matthew Walker this is another of those fundamental books one should read. Actually I can’t help but imagine future generations looking back in our times and wondering how were people going about their lives without learning about or caring to understand longevity factors such as nutrition, exercise, sleep, mental health, preventive health checks, body monitoring etc. Returning to the book, apart from providing a general background of how our bodies work on the molecular (DNA, RNA, proteins) and cellular level, the author proposes the hypothesis that aging is a result of a loss of information. This theory suggests that over time our cells loose the ability to accurately “read” the genetic information which remains always intactly stored into our DNA (this genetic information is what tells the cell what to be and how to behave), resulting in malfunction, loss of cellular identity or death, which manifests as the symptoms and diseases we all associate with aging. If this hypothesis proves correct (and there are many experiments that support it), if we could eventually prevent, slow or even reverse this information loss, it follows that could directly target the origins and cure all symptoms and diseases of aging at once, instead of trying to find treatments for each individual disease (ie. cardiovascular, dementia etc) as scientists have been trying to do until now. It is plausible that in the future we could regenerate and reverse the age in tissue (this works already in mice), or restore our overall health and vitality to the levels of a 20 or 30 year old on demand. How could that happen? Without giving out more fascinating research and experiments referenced in the book, this is one of the best talks of the author I found online summarizing his theory: https://youtu.be/9nXop2lLDa4Then, what could you do today to help your body slow the aging process? The author takes 1g of NMN every morning + 0,5-1 g of resveratrol powder with yoghurt to raise his NAD levels. These can be found over the counter. He also takes 1 g of metformin in the night (needs prescription).He checks his blood regularly and supplements with vitamin D, K2 and 83mg of aspirin.Eats as few carbohydrates (sugar, pasta, breads) as possible.Usually skips one meal per day or makes a meal smaller.Tries to walk, go to gym, sauna, ice cold pool and keep a low BMI.Doesn’t smoke, avoids toxins, excessive radiation and other common sense damaging factors.And what should you do?If you are under 30 or even maybe 40, I would probably avoid the supplements. There are no long term studies of the effects of the NMN and no human studies. On the other hand, in short term or animal studies no toxicity or side effects have been demonstrated and many anti-aging researchers allegedly take it. If I was older I would probably give it a shot and I actually intend to experiment with my parents with NR (similar to NMN and tested in human trials).Of course science has the annoying habit of regularly disproving theories and crashing dreams, but until that happens I look forward to a future of scientific revolutions and increased lifespan and healthspan."
11,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/828633-linda,5,"I've been following David Sinclair's research into aging for many years, and this book is a great summary of his work and that of others, where the field of aging research is headed, and what we can expect. Dr. Sinclair is and has always been an optimist. I'm an optimist too, so that's fine by me. While he isn't a medical doctor and can't give medical advice, he discusses supplements he takes and lifestyle choices he makes that he feels are helping him and his own family too, including his 80-year-old father who has returned to work and is enjoying vibrant good health. My own disclaimer, I have been taking an NAD booster for almost five years. I do believe it makes a difference. At 56, I have far more energy than same-aged friends, and I haven't been sick since I started taking it, something Dr. Sinclair mentions too. Because I have inherited a copy of the APOE4 gene for Alzheimer's, I'm always interested in learning about anything I can do (exercise) or take (supplements) that will help prevent that gene from turning on. Toward the final quarter of the book, Dr. Sinclair turns to the ethics of slowing or even preventing aging. What would a world look like in which people might start a new career in their seventies, or enjoy spending time with their great-great-grandchildren, still vital and engaged? How would it impact global overpopulation and use of resources? These are all important questions, and he presents various scenarios in a balanced way. Overall, a fabulous read. I'm going to get the PDF as well so I can look at the charts and images references (recommended by the author as well). I do truly feel that we're on the brink of longevity escape velocity, and I couldn't be more excited!"
12,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6470582-jackie,5,The authors have written an excellent book on a subject that affects everyone. It's not too technical and has personal stories to make you really think about treating aging as a disease. It was a very enjoyable read. 
13,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11926763-cain-s,5,"Within our lifetimes many will be able to live longer than 120 years, while enjoying at age 80-90 the health of 30-40 year olds.Gene therapies that can reverse organ damage, like macular degeneration, and get rid of senescent cells, which increase with age and cause the various illnesses of old age, are already proving to be successful in the lab. We will be able to program genes in a way that makes humans immune to most fatal diseases. A Chinese doctor has already gene edited a girl who is immune to AIDS. One of Sinclair's students has been able to grow nerves connecting the eyes to the brain in mice, and there is confidence among researchers that the same could be done for humans. Aging has been reversed in 12month old mice, the equivalent of 60 year old humans; treated 12month old mice (who've practically reached ripe old age) were able to run more than 3kilometers, which greatly exceeds the running capacity of even young mice over their lifetime. Similar effects can be induced in humans using similar enzymes and gene editing technologies in the near term future which Sinclair places at a maximum of 30 years from now.Also, pointers on how to live longer:Fasting so you are sort of hungry as frequently as possible, and generally consuming 25% fewer calories than currently recommended for your Body Mass Index is ideal.Exposing yourself to lower temperatures than you're most comfortable at, where your body needs to do some work to keep you warm, triggers the survival circuit and slows down cellular aging and so the process of aging itself.Regular exercise, at an intensity where you can't complete sentences and are short of breath, also slows down aging.Read this interview where Sinclair touches on most of the topics in the book: https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2..."

David wrote it in a way a layman like myself could easily understand. The book lays down the existing science. Past (what we know) and moves to where we are now. Present. (what we are learning). Then moves through to where we are going (future - breakthrough science) and this is where it starts to get really existing. The future looks bright.

From a science point of view, there is no huge discovery, the recommendations are basically metformin, NMN and a couple of other things. The book is impregnated with Sinclairs optimism and, more precesily, life satisfaction. He is a really nice person, beyond with intellect. What he says still sounds science fiction, and probably not all what he claims will happen, but still he brings hope that our lives will be longer and more healthy. "

17,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14551209-dan-connors,5," How would you feel about living an extra thirty years? And how about if those years were relatively disease-free and healthy ones? If everybody lived that extra thirty or more years, would that necessarily be a good thing? What would happen to families, work, and society with double the elderly population as today?  These questions and more are examined in this fascinating book by Dr. David Sinclair, one of the leading experts on aging and founder of a prestigious laboratory at Harvard University. Dr. Sinclair gives a detailed description of the research that's going on today related to aging and how it affects the human body.  The author spends a good amount of time advocating for a new type of healthcare, one that looks at aging as a treatable disease and not something that's inevitable. He compares our current system to a whack-a-mole game where different diseases pop up and are treated, only for new ones to keep coming. The focus on individual diseases like cancer and heart disease overlook the big picture of what's going on with the march of time.  According to Dr. Sinclair, aging is really a loss of information, as our DNA gets corrupted by contaminants, diseases, and stressors. If you can find a way to repair the DNA through time, you can slow and even reverse aging. He theorizes a prehistoric survival circuit in our genes that turns this repair system on in times of stress and hardship. When the cells are healthier, the system is dormant and aging progresses. The trick, therefore is to fool the cells into thinking they need to switch into repair mode while the body is still in good shape.  Some of the best ways to accomplish this anti-aging rejuvenation is through behavioral changes. Intermittent fasting is supposed to help with longevity, as are calorie restricted diets, because the body has to struggle just a bit more to operate. (This doesn't work if the body gets to the starvation point and lacks required nutrients) Exercise is also a great rejuvenator, as even brief periods of strenuous exercise wakes can wake up repair circuits. Spending time in cold environments helps as well, as long as it's not too cold to risk hypothermia or serious damage.  Of course one of the biggies that I've heard from several books, that may or may not be related to the repair system, is proper diet, including mostly fruits, nuts, beans, and vegetables with little amounts of starches, sugars, or meats. This goes against the standard American diet, but I see more and more research pointing to the Mediterranean diet as the best way to head off diseases before they hit.  In addition to the behavioral changes there are some pills and supplements that the author recommends. I won't mention them here (read the book if you want to know), but I'll be looking into them in the future. If the leading expert in the country is taking them, they might just work.  Several chapters of the book detail current research in medicine that almost looks like science fiction. There may soon be vaccines that we can take that can remain dormant and activated when we get older to help stall the aging process. Cells that we thought could never be regrown, like spinal cord cells and optic cells are being manufactured that give new hope to the blind and paralyzed. Wearable biosensors are available today that can monitor your vitals while you exercise, sleep, or work, collecting vital information that can help you find diseases before symptoms ever show up.  The most amazing process that is becoming easier and cheaper is DNA sequencing. Your entire genome in the future could become a part of your medical records, letting doctors prescribe drugs with laser like efficiency and giving diagnostic tests critical information for the best diagnoses and treatment plans. The impact on life-expectancy for all these innovations is substantial. We will live longer and have less disease, which sounds awesome. This is all apparently just ten years away or less.  In the final part of the book, Dr. Sinclair looks at the possible ramifications to society if all of this comes to pass. He predicts that humans could live to 150 years of age in the not too distant future, with average life expectancy rising from around 80 now to 110 or higher. He addresses the current problems of environmental destruction and climate change that the current population of 7.5 billion creates. Some scientists believe we are already at the carrying capacity of the planet, and more people will only lead to a gradual decline in food, energy and raw materials as too many people chase too few resources.  Using the city of London as an example, the author disputes those claims in an optimistic leap saying that human innovation over the next century can solve a lot of the problems that we see today, making the maximum sustainable population much higher. Not only is earth's population growing, but people in third world countries are improving their lives and expecting to consume more resources like the Americans and Europeans have been doing for so long.  While I don't necessarily agree with the author's unbridled optimism about the future, he opens up a lot of fascinating questions. What happens to retirement if and when people live past 100. Our current system is already struggling under life expectancy predictions from the 20th century that proved wrong, and will become bankrupt if over half the nation wants to live in retirement. People will be healthier and more will want to work, but will we have enough jobs for them? Already there are concerns that artificial intelligence and outsourcing will strip most of the good jobs in the 21st century. Will family reunions now include great-grandparents and great-great grandbabies?  People in positions of power cling to it as long as possible, and it's reasonable to predict that we would have hundred year old politicians, judges and CEO's calling the shots for decades. The problem with that is that the older you get, the less you're willing to look at the world in different ways and progress would take twice as long. The wealthiest of the wealthy could amass even more money and let it sit idly while the world gets starved of capital for new projects. How on earth would we choose where to celebrate family holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving if four sets of parents and grandparents all in good health want to host them?  In a way, death is a blessing. It clears the way for new ideas and new approaches, and without it we would feel no urgency to do something with our lives. What would society look without death and disease? Healthier? More crowded? Would inequality get worse and bigotry more entrenched? The approaches mentioned by Dr. Sinclair don't conquer death- just push the inevitable off a bit. Still, most of us would love to have some extra healthy years and the train has already left the station. This book is a real thought-provoker and anyone in the medical field, business, or government needs to start thinking about these ideas.  As I write this, life expectancy is actually getting shorter. Problems with drug abuse and suicide are claiming more of the young, and American food and drink over-consumption is taking years off of lives. Hopefully some of the items in this book will come to pass before I kick the bucket. But before science gives us the means to live longer lives, we have to find a better meaning of life. Why are we here and what were we each put on earth to accomplish? Thirty more years won't necessarily answer that question. And we still will all die. Whether you live 10 years or 150, make each one the best you can. "
18,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33757126-david-jones,5,"Kindle tells me I made 281 highlights, there is many, many gems and aha-moments here. I had a soft spot for the book because he begins and ends the book with an emotional connection to Garigal National Park of which I spent a lot of time in and around - I definitely also have an admiration bias of ""local boy done good"". Despite being at Harvard (down the corridor from legend George Church) he appears to retain connection to labs in Australia - which is great.For me, there 3 main 3 thesis:1. Aging is not defined as a disease just because >50% people have it. This is wrong view.2. Aging is epigenetic and can be modified. Genetics also will soon also be modifiable too.3. People will soon meet their grandchildren's grandchildrenThis has huge ramifications on society preset biases to old people and economics. If someone retires at 60 (paying taxes for 40 years) and then collects a social security pension for 60 years - how does a society support that monetarily. More importantly how does such a person sustain purpose? The book touches on these things but it's a huge topic (many books will be written on this).Sinclair reset my thinking that ""life extension is for narcissists"" - the big epiphany is that his studies show that mice who live longer die quick at the end. For humans this potentially means elimination of months or years in public health systems at high expense to family or society. The old joke about ""digging your own grave and falling in it"" sound very attractive.Its a highly educational read, designed for mortals and muggles** to read, so it's not intimidating. Recommended much as this will definitely happen - if you are under 50 now, its extremely likely you will live to 120, so better plan that in!Major quibble: Similar to my review of the Diamandis book, I don't agree that tech-is-the-solution-to-all-the world's-problems without some moral or wisdom framework to protect the commons. There is a vignette where the author bemoans: Page 288: ""The text of the ruling makes it clear that it was not a decision to protect consumers from the dangers of GMO; it was part of a global trade war to prevent US-patented products from entering the European Union.""and Page 288: ""It’s ultimately hurtful to everyone on the planet to use the cover of “dangerous science” to justify trade restrictions, especially to those who need the new technology most.""Sinclair (being an inventor) would side with patent holders, but the damaging impact of patents (a key GameA tool) would hold those EU farmers to ransom for generations to come. Change that and innovation can deployed in a manner that serves planetary wellbeing.** Minor quibble: Being an old engineer his analogy of Shannon's law is opportunistic but could be achieved by other metaphors (such as environmental corrosion)."
19,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7569698,5,"Almost done reading ""Lifespan: Why we age and why we don't have to"" by David Sinclair and I am pleased with what I read. This might contain spoilers.At first glance one would look at the book cover and say it is a tall order. Not knowing who is David Sinclair, one would assume that this best selling book is another hocus self-help or motivational book. But once you start reading, you'd get to realize that this is the real thing. David has a Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics and is a researcher at Harvard Medical School. He has been working on genetic researches related to aging for many years and is well aware of the scientific advancements in that regards on almost all fronts.The book starts with a focus on biochemistry and an outline of recent medical achievements in prolonging the lives of other living things along with researches results on human beings. The first chapters are tough to read for non medical readers but it gets better in the following chapters when David outlines his recommendations for everyone on what to do to slow down aging and potentially halt/reverse it. He goes on later in the book into addressing some societal and philosophical concerns on the effects of longer human lifespans on the way we carry on and perceive our lives. Towards the end, he goes back to his lab at Harvard medical school, mentions many of his colleagues who are working on aging researches at different fronts. Some of whom are prominent scientists and Nobel prize winners. He lists many breakthroughs that happened in recent years and highlights the fact that all the incredible achievements he mentions in this chapter have only happened in one lab, whereas there are many of other labs, researchers and scientists working on tackling this issue all over the world.I loved that he uses the word ""army"" where he says that there is an army of thousands of researchers all over the world working on understanding aging and potentially expanding healthy human lifespan to levels we have never imagined before.The question today is not about ""can we defeat aging?"", it is more about ""how we do it? "" and ""when will it happen?"". It is like having a million pieces jigsaw puzzle with a 100K people trying to put pieces together. We will do it, and hopefully sooner than we expect.Loving it!"
20,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25056631-liene,3,"This was an interesting book that should have been an article. It was repetitive in some places and some parts seemed completely unnecessary – do we really need a science book telling us that we could live longer by eating healthy and exercising? The most memorable part – the author is disappointed and surprised by the fact that the younger generation feels pessimistic about the future; on this he quoted his teenage son who said that allowing people to live longer would only give them more opportunities to harm the planet. Strangely enough, this was followed by chapters on overpopulation and global warming. This part seemed totally opposite to the first part of the book and its message – how can you so optimistically advertise people living longer and then list all the reasons why they shouldn’t. It read like a completely different book. Perhaps his son hijacked the book and added a few chapters from his point of view?"

23,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56398216-pap-l-rinc,4,"Many studies focus on the so-called blue zones, i.e. where people live longer than average.Most people associated it with their eating habits - this book attributes the lifespan (and healthspan) to what (and when) they're *NOT* eating (via negativa).This is a prime example for all the confusion we're bombarded about nutrition: every ""study"" has an equal, opposite ""study"" (mostly observational ones, obviously), and we didn't even care to look for what's missing (since it's always easier to just check for presence of anything).Aging is a disease - the book claims -, it's not something pre-programmed in your genes, it's something that can be induced, stabilized and sometimes even reversed.It's a loss of information in our epigenome which makes our cellular repair mechanisms perform worse over time - cells starting to lose their identity.While we're waiting for the fountain of youth to go on the market (the book claims we may already have some of these drugs OTC), there may be something we can already do today to allow autophagy to lessen cellular senescence.Unlike what pop culture dictates, it's not less stress, it's actually more and different kind of adversity (the stoics rejoice) that enables cleanup and repair:• be hungry more often - skip breakfast, fast periodically for longer periods, get lean;• avoid excessive carbs (sugar, pasta, breads) and processed oils and -foods in general;• do resistance training - lift weights, get some muscles;• experience cold, warm and other stressors regularly.Many of these claims have been based on animal studies, they had measurable effects on their health and lifespan, and there's some anecdotal evidence in humans - in a few decades we may have proper human trials and gene sequencing that will tell us specifically what makes us tick, but I for one want to start acting NOW.While reading the book I found myself wondering how an average lifespan of 120 or 150 would affect society - luckily the book also details these in dedicated chapters.Whenever we think the Earth cannot support more people we underestimate the ingenuity of people - haven't we been expanding that limit for centuries? Historically population growth has always eventually been associated with improved life conditions.Prolonged life would probably result in people caring more about the future, not less.Just like in Factfulness, the author doesn't rely on fear-mongering (a tactic I profoundly despise) as a means to achieving a better world, rather an optimistic one, gathering historical precedence for times when we collectively overcame the limitations of our surroundings - finding solutions instead of excuses."
24,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30363107-mike-lisanke,2,"This book could have been excellent... I am a true fan of life extension and the author Dr. Sinclair as an obvious insight in the current state of art in the biochemistry of life extension. He gave an excellent introduction to many detailed topics in this biochemistry: sirtuins, NMN, mTOR, and DNA mods to test repair effect on ageing... mention of Metformin, Resveratrol and the search for other potential triggers of sirtuins repair... potential for a genetic reset button and adding this to our DNA with a one time CRISPR change (and tiny flu)... All this and many more stories of the biology of life extension. Then, starting near the middle of the book, a constant drone of libidiotic SJC PC that came to pervade the entire story, building to an almost overwhelming crescendo in part 3 of the book... where he launches into an almost inexplicable exercise in Why we shouldn't extend human longevity. OK, it's a rational part of any life extension story to answer the Malthusian, limits of growth, constraints of Earthly resources... in the end, like myself, the author Believes technology will achieve the necessary changes to sustain humanity (as I do)... but along way, preaches at US about how Australia and the EU's socialism is the answer And how humanity Will Have to Be Taught how to live within our Earthly resources.... yes, folks another affluent Communist in the making. Along with the usual references to ""well-known"" anthropocene extinction, man-made climate alarmism, and negativity to animal based foods was a wide-assortment of liberal+progressive agenda including identity politics. In all, this author Had an Opportunity to do some Solid informing about Longevity Research. It could have been a 300 page tome on the intricacies of these longevity mechanism of our human bodies (something he's an expert on)... instead, we were treated to half a book full of #MSM platitude from our current overlords on how will need to Sacrifice to Save our Planet... Clearly, this will become another popular possibly Best Seller for hitting all of the Politically Correct buttons all good little unthinking members of humanity have been told to believe!

Instead this book goes deeply into the biological and genetic processes of aging and the research that has been done on aging. I am a nutritionist and so am somewhat familiar with human physiology. This book was too complex for me and I think would be too complex for the average lay person interested in health. There are no ""how to"" steps in the book other than a small paragraph at the end in which Sinclair shares some of his personal lifestyle and nutrition strategies. The last section in the book was somewhat rambling when talking about the future in terms of technologies, how to provide food for the population, how much the population would grow with a longer lifespan, social security, taxes, hurry, government investment, the right to die, over consumption, and many other topics that are not strictly related to the theme of the book.

Maybe our health span and lifespan can be extended significantly.

I certainly do and can say the same about all the people whom I know closely. But is it possible? Before we get into that we have to accept that we have been made to believe that aging and a certain human lifespan is normal. Is it? If you think about it, nothing around us is normal. From the super computers we carry in our pockets to the complex machines that take us from one point to another to the variety of food options that we have access to on demand, nothing will seem normal to a home sapien even from a few centuries ago. Human beings have evolved over millennia and we have adapted the environment around us to suit us better. Could the same be done for aging? To answer that we must first understand why we age and in that answer would be the insights for why we don’t have to. This brings me to this exceptional book - Lifespan. It answers all the questions posted above and speaks about “The Information Theory of Aging” which sheds light onto what causes aging and how it can be reversed / slowed down. I am very thankful to the author Dr David Sinclair and his team to not only do this highly impactful research but also to share it with the world in such an easy to understand manner. According to this theory, again simply is a loss of information. But unlike as believed historically it is not the loss of genetic information (digital), but the loss of epigenetic information (analog). The genetic information is stored as DNA, whereas the epigenetic information is stored in structures called chromatin. It is the epigenetic information which plays the role of providing specialized identities to cells (with the same genetic information), resulting in our liver cells being different from our skin cells say. As we grow old, the digital information is preserved but the analog information is lost and this can be reversed. Also with the loss of this analog information, the cells start losing their identities and functions causing pain / discomfort / diseases as we age. Within each of the organisms, whether it be simple organisms such as yeast or complex mammals like us, there are survival circuits at play. These survival circuits effectively play the dual role of a) ensuring cellular division during good times and b) ensuring cell repair while stopping cellular division during times of stress. The information theory of aging relies on this survival circuit which has been at play since the origination of life itself. The survival circuits rely on longevity enzymes such as Sirtuins, mTOR (target of rapamycin), AMPK (a metabolic control enzyme). These enzymes are responsible for maintaining DNA stability, addressing DNA repair, ensuring cell survivability, metabolism and cell to cell communication. All of this is good but what has aging got to do with these enzymes? As we age, for example, we lose NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) which is essential for sirtuin. The resulting decline in sirtuin activity makes it susceptible to various diseases as we age. These longevity enzymes are activated via biological stresses (such as those that happen during intermittent fasting, certain types of exercise, low protein diet, exposure to hot/cold temperatures) - a process called hormesis. This little stress prompts the rest of the system to preserve, to conserve and to survive a little longer - the start of longevity. In addition, there are hormesis-mimicking molecules as well. In the book one learns about the Waddington landscape - effectively comprising of valleys wherein specialized cells reside. Over time, with exposure to several factors there are adjustments to the epigenome - the landscape changes and cells move toward other valleys. This leads to cells becoming ex-differentiated and unable to do the function which they ought to for a healthy living. One interesting point that we come to learn from the book is that ageing is not categorized as a disease even though it may be source behind all life threatening physical / mental conditions because it impacted more than half of the population. Only recently has WHO categorized it as a medical condition. The question that arises is what can we do activate these longevity genes?Eat less: Eating less does not mean to get into a state of malnutrition or starvation. But to fast, that is to let our bodies be in a state of want, is unquestionably good for our health and longevity. This engages the survival circuit, telling the longevity genes to keep deterioration at bay, reduce the epigenetic changes and slow down aging. This has been time and again proven in human beings as well as other mammals. Right amount of amino acids: Consumption in excess of meat especially red meat is highly dangerous. Red meat has been found to contain both carcinogenic and cardiovascular causing chemicals. Research proves that exchanging animal protein with plant protein in our diets causes all-cause mortality to fall drastically. Exercise: Only dietary modifications are not sufficient to get the maximum out of our longevity genes. One important point to note is that to get the desired engagement of our longevity genes, intensity of the exercise does matter. The longevity genes that are turned on by exercise are responsible for the health benefits of exercise such as extending telomeres, growing new microvessels that deliver oxygen to cells and boosting mitochondrial activity. Living outside the thermonuclear zone: Exposing our body to less than comfortable temperatures is another effective way to turn on the longevity genes. Whereas exposing oneself to heat baths with a higher frequency has shown to result in a two fold drop in all-cause mortality events. Fasting, exercise, reducing animal protein and exposing oneself extreme temperatures activates AMPK, turns down mTOR (inhibition of mTOR is essential for survival), boosts NAD levels and activates the sirtuins - all leading to a slowdown of aging. Rapamycin: Rapamycin helps in extending lifespan by stimulating the production of NAD. Metformin: Metformin, apart from being instrumental in tackling diabetes, reduced the likelihood of dementia, cardiovascular disease, cancer, frailty, and depression. It achieved this by the power of AMPK activation, making more NAD and turning on sirtuins and other defenses against aging as a whole. The book also explains about the ongoing research and development in areas such as a) Development of senolytics: Drugs to kill senescent cells i.e. zombie cells - this has shown to improve lifespan in mice by 20-30%. b) Cellular reprogramming: Research on mice shows that using specific genes ceps can be reprogrammed to regain a youthful epigenome. In one experiment researchers were able to regrow damaged optic nerves in mice using cellular reprogramming (these nerves till date were not supposed to grow after damage)The last third of the book highlights where the future of healthcare is headed - with more personalized biotracking enabling us to detect changes within our bodies before they manifest as diseases and to take preventive actions. It also speaks about precision medicine wherein we can treat these adverse changes at a cellular level. Towards the end, the book touches upon the implications of what it will mean to have extended lifespan both as an individual and as a society and puts forward convincing arguments as to why living healthier extended lives by the global population overall will not be a burden on mankind. A highly recommended read!"

36,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,5,"Finished reading “Lifespan: Why We Age—and Why We Don't Have To” by David A. Sinclair, a Professor in the Department of Genetics and co-Director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School. Without exaggeration, this is one of the most intriguing books I’ve read this year. It starts rather grimly, depicting a picture of our gradual demise and eventual death. Punches you straight in the gut reminding the reader of the unavoidable. Then the tone of the book changes with Sinclair shedding light on the research he and other biologists and geneticists lead and which treatments seem to be working on mice and in some case on humans. The science of aging is still underresearched and underfunded. This is largely due to our current approach to healthcare. Many doctors treat specific illnesses, as if nothing else in the organism matters. Sinclair argues for a more holistic approach. He offers that aging, which is considered as something natural, needs to be seen as a treatable condition, a disease. The most interesting parts of this books are closer to the middle where we can peek into the cutting edge of senescence science and get some hints at what can be done today to slow down aging. Was also interesting to read what Sinclair and his father take (hint: NMN, metformin and some other stuff).In the latter parts, this book becomes increasingly futuristic and at times philosophical. It is hard to imagine a world without UBI if what is claimed in this book becomes a reality. It is also unthinkable how anything else can be more important than the research Sinclair and other scientists in this field are doing. I don’t think there is a field which needs more funding than this. How about cutting military spending to a minimum and funding something good for a change, huh?"
37,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43214090-joyce-stahmann,5,"Wow! Don't miss this information that will totally change your ideas about aging!!!This book is full of groundbreaking information about why aging has always been synonymous with physical (and sometimes mental) deterioration. From this genetics researcher, we discover that aging is a disease of DNA deterioration, and that deterioration can be stopped and reversed with the new discoveries in cell science. He gives a few basic lifestyle changes that can help, such as a plant- based diet with little animal protein, vigorous exercise ( or at least interval- type training, with short bursts of vigorous exercise), some form of intermittent fasting, exposure to cold ( not to the point of hypothermia-- like the other suggestions, this type of stressor revs up DNA repair), and allowing yourself to get hungry before eating anything.There is also one supplement so promising that the author and his whole family take it. His father, in his 80s, was rejuvenated by this supplement several years ago and took up a new career and a very active life that includes lots of hiking and international travel.The above information is just the beginning of what will be coming down the research pipeline very soon, and part of the book is a fascinating look at the near future and the end of aging as we know it, along with so many of the diseases and disabi!ity that are currently associated with it.This is a realistic and scientific look at what is possible now and in the near future, and it has comp!early altered my depressing ideas of how aging unfolds. Read it ( the earlier in life the better) and start developing the cellular resilience that will allow you to be a much happier a d healthier elder."
38,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54845913-bumbu,4,"The book starts off by explaining a theory how DNA/cell repair mechanisms came to exist. Day by day cells run in 2 modes: either reproduce or repair. Reproduce during good times (when there're enough nutrients) and go into repair mode when times are bad. And apparently this mechanism (in more advanced form) is present in most (all?) living creatures. And this will be the basis of why putting your body through mild stress is beneficial to you. Some of these stresses are: Intermitent fasting, cold exposure, high intensity training, limiting animal protein intake.The book keeps reiterating how aging is not seen as a disease, but it's the primary cause for most recognized diseases. And if we'd solve aging, we'd handle most of the diseases. Or put it in simple words - imagine leaving to 80 years old, but instead of having a fragile body, feel the same way you felt when you were 20 - young, energetic, strong... You'd still die, but instead of suffering for the last 30 years of your life, you'd just do whatever you want, and then have a quick death. This is what the book is claiming - we're moving towards. The book takes it even further - people leaving into their 100s, 150s or even forever (until the bus hits you) which is a possibility in not so distant future. It tries to explain some of the existing learnings based on research, and how we can achieve that goal. This is already happening, but at a super-slow rate. And if this rate accelerates as the author predicts, then there are many things to be figured out: * will pension/age retirement even make sense if people would be healthy up until their death?* how to make sure that everyone gets access to healthy lifespans?* how do we use planet resources?"
39,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31798064-sirene,5,"The first half of this book is exciting as much as it disconcerting. It could be paraphrased, a million times less scientifically, as “You can be young, healthy, and live forever... and so can everyone else! By the way, it’s inevitable!”How can a world like this be viable when we can’t even get our current one to work? If you’re aware of much history, you know it’s not unusual for civilizations to collapse under the weight of depleted resources and environmental destruction. And if you’ve gotten this far in reading this review, you’re likely aware of how fragile we are to this at this time.That’s what the second half of the book makes a case for to a satisfactory degree given the small amount of existing evidence—that a world like this could not only work, but be better than it is now, a win win win for everyone. This is contingent on changing our ways of life drastically, but it doesn’t seem impossible because much of our ways include massive overconsumption and inefficient strategies. Also, many technologies exist even today that aren’t fully realized in their potential to solve resource problems. If we don't adapt, however, well... I'm sure you can imagine what will happen. There is also much more to the story I promise I haven’t spoiled.Apparently there are people in the comments who want this only to be about the science, but this is a book not a research paper. And even in a research paper, if you are going to talk about science this game-changing and convince people to support it, you need to discuss the potential consequences. If you are interested in health, policy, reducing suffering, cool science, mice, the environment, or the future at all, I recommend this book!"
40,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57151275-rohit-gavirni,4,"The book focuses on the fresh-out-of-the-lab developments in a field of research that aims to improve (or solve) longevity using genetic science and technologies. The book claims that we are finally beginning to understand the real cause(s) of ageing, and how with the rising technologies in genetics we can significantly increase our lifespans and healthspans by tinkering with our code- the genome (and epigenome).The author convincingly argues that ageing (and all diseases it brings with it) can be neatly tied to one theory which he calls the The Information Theory of Ageing (I wish he had named it something else!) which claims that all cells inevitably lose their epigenetic information due to various external factors or due to chance, which in turn degenerates them into less specialised cells. The book also discusses various lifestyle choices like intermittent fasting, eating meat and dairy foods, physical exercise, etc, and the ways they contribute to the gain or loss of this epigenetic information and thus impact our lifespans. It then discusses about the upcoming medicines and technologies that can help recover from the degeneracy without having to practice any less-pleasant lifestyle choices.The book probably could be cut short by a 100 pages, but if you are completely new to the science, the repetitions in the book can be helpful. I personally put it down early, picked up ""The Gene: An Intimate History"" (Siddharth Mukherjee) to get familiar with the science, and then picked up this once again. Overall, it in an important book for making the stories of recent developments of such literally life-altering technologies accessible."

Scientists know for some time - that there is no law of physics, chemistry or biology that ordains it to be so.Billions of dollars are spent on researching cancer and heart diseases - but the truth is, even solving them forever, will increase average human lifespan just barely by an year. 'Ageing' by far is far more potent killer 'disease', but is accepted in society as 'untreatable' and 'inevitable'.Solving ageing will perhaps be by far the biggest jump our species will take towards alleviating suffering & pain.This author himself heads Harvard lab working on understanding & solving aging. He brings together the latest research which absolutely points to one conclusion - it will soon be possible to program human cells and bodies to be remain young forever. Diverse range of approaches have already identified the key biochemical clocks and at-least few ways to hack it.The book rightly spends some time exploring social, political, cultural and ethical concerns of living till the ages of 150-200 years and eventually forever. These issues are great thought experiments to ponder over as well.No wonder this space is getting hotter amongst thinkers, entrepreneurs and VCs."
42,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8107883-gary,5,"I have read many, many books on aging and life extension, all the way back to 1982's ""Life Extension"" by Durk Pierson and Sandy Shaw. These kind of books can be divided, like most things, into the good, the bad and the indifferent. The bad and the indifferent are mostly diet and exercise books with clever marketing. What I consider the ""good"" contain not only info on the latest research, but food for thought, not just talk of literal food for your body and brain. There are three that I currently would rank as ""good"" — Bill Gifford's ""Spring Chicken"", Mittledorf and Sagan's ""Cracking the Aging Code' and this one, ""Lifespan"". Spring Chicken probably has the most entertainment value; Cracking the Aging Code the deepest dive into the evolution of aging and death. But Lifespan is the most information-dense. It is concerned both with recent findings in aging research, as well as ideas that are currently being developed and tested in labs around the world. He also gets to speculate a little bit about what's around the next bend. He even talks a little about climate change and overpopulation, and how life extension would impact those other issues. And, to lend further credence to the book as a whole, Sinclair is a world-famous geneticist, not an MD or dietician. Will you agree with everything in this book? Certainly not. Will you be bored? Not likely. "

The science behind the author's main premise, that aging is a disease and will someday be the subject of many treatments that delay the aging process and biological failings that go with it in today's world. While the premise may seem far-reaching (it is) and beyond logical medical understanding as we know it today, he presents scientific research breakthroughs that are occurring in labs around the world even as we read this book.Definitely a hopeful forecast for what may be possible in the decades to come based on today's scientific findings in animals (mice, pigs, even yeast!) where life is extended by manipulation at the cellular level, techniques he forecasts as available to the average person with a pill in the future (at minimal cost). He cites other species where regeneration and amazing longevity exists today, applying some of those underlying facets of living organisms to research that will eventually offer similar effects in the human species seems a stretch for our current imaginations, but those forecasts are supported by insights into what scientists are learning today.Definitely an interesting and hopeful read that I enjoyed and hope others will too with these insights."

The fundamental theory of aging behind this book is that cells and DNA have two ""modes"" of working: ""growth and reproduction"" is one, and ""self-repair"" is another. Self-repair mechanics, typically mediated by sirtuin1 to 7, are diminished as we age. Lack of mTOR stimulation is one of the ways self-repair is activated. In turn, hormesis (micro stressors) is one of the main ways to inhibit mTOR and activate AMPK. Fasting, exercise, and cold exposure are natural ways to inhibit mTOR. Certain molecules activate this process as well: rapamycin (Immuno suppressor, also known as sirolimus) metformin (blood sugar control) resveratrol (polyphenol and antioxidant) and NAND boosters such as NMN and NR. For instance, activating SIR1 with a NAD boosting molecule, made blood transport oxygen more effectively and increase endurance. Metformin and rapamycin mimic calorie restriction. Rapa via MTOR inhibition. Metformin via limiting metabolic reactions in the mitochondria, which results in the activation of AMPK."

If I do not live to at least 150, I hereby instruct the executor of my will to retroactively downgrade this rating to two stars.Seriously, this is mind-blowing stuff. It also seems a lot more believable and science-based than the transhumanist Singularity stuff that, while fun and intriguing, is also much less grounded in actual data.I absolutely loved the patient explanations of the biomechanics of aging, and the analogies really made a very difficult subject comprehensible.Note for audiobook listeners (I listened to this one): it is pretty hard science in places, but the pdf that coms with the audiobook is extremely useful in keeping you grounded in the topic at hand. Also, I would probably dock a half a star for the cringeworthy, cheesy, corny as hell “intermission” chapters where the authors read a script at each other telling each how great they both are. They are as stilted as any Academy Awards-presenter dialogue, and contain nothing of value. Just skip over them."

There is a lot of data given and while some of it is technical and a layman like me has to read it twice or thrice to fully absorb it, I didn't mind that. Ageing is one of my favourite topics and I enjoyed every minute of reading this book, as much as I would enjoy a thriller! Some of the ideas that David Sinclair puts forward are mind-boggling but I found myself agreeing with him most of the time. He paints a picture of a Utopia I would like to see actually happen. At least my children should be able to see it. I am not sure why this book has been criticised for giving too much background information. This information is valuable as a context to the ideas the author puts forward. If one wanted some tips on how to live longer then there are hundreds of articles on the internet, most of them quite superficial. This book, on the other hand, provides an in-depth look into ageing, and all that has been done so far in this field and all that can be done in the future. "
47,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2603816-martina,5,"This book unflinchingly tackles many highly controversial and even taboo subjects. I, for one, remain staunchly opposed to the ""brave new world"" visions championed by the author. Nevertheless, the book deserves five stars for attempting to open minds to the much needed debate of what is possible for the good of the individual and the planet. It is an important conversation to have, regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with the author's philosophy of popping pills to prolong a healthy lifespan. As for me, I'll stick with the recommendation to eat a plant based diet; avoid the ravages caused by animal products; and make physical exercise a priority. I'm also gratified and privileged that I was allowed to contribute to the lifespan of another fellow human by donating a kidney last month. Lifetime, after all, should not be measured by years lived, but by years loved and having been loved. Hopefully, those who read this book won't loose sight of this important, self-evident, and magical truth."

I have nothing but respect for Dr. Sinclair and the high impact research he's conducting, but I can't help but feel underwhelmed. The first hundred pages or so were great, with Dr. Sinclair providing an outline of a novel approach to aging and longevity known as the ""Information Theory of Aging."" He provides a very convincing argument for his model and does a phenomenal job of summarizing the current state of understanding regarding the ubiquitous disease known as aging.Almost all of my complaints stem from the latter half of the book. In place of the novel ideas that made the first part of the book so enticing, the later chapters seemed to be overrun by anecdotes and personal reflections. Not to completely discount the book, as I found certain sections to be both informative and entertaining, but I found myself quite disappointed at the end and feel that the central tenets of this book could be summed up in less than 100 pages."
49,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72944824-amy-lou,5,"A fascinating read. This book completely blew my mind. The author is a professor at Harvard Medical School. If it weren't for his impeccable credentials, I would think he was crazy based on the information he shares in this book.He explains that lifespans as we know it will change drastically in the very near future. Instead of people living into their 80s or 90s, people will regularly live into their 120s and possibly beyond. We currently think of aging as part of the natural progression of life. He says many of the symptoms of aging are treatable signs of disease. Growing older no longer has to mean having trouble getting around, being forgetful or needing assistance with everyday tasks. He explains the medical innovations that will bring about the change.He also explains a innovations that will bring about a paradigm shift in medicine once the medical establishment accepts a completely new way of diagnosing and treating people."
50,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/313082-bruin-mccon,5,"Aging is a disease that can be treated. This is the hypothesis of Lifespan, a new book that not only details how humans can expect to start living to 150 if aging begins to be treated as the cause of most other diseases, but also discusses whether our planet can handle people living so long.Scientist David Sinclair teams with author Matthew LaPlante to delve into topics that seem straight out of science fiction. Yet this is no jump for Sinclair—he’s not only seen evidence that aging is a disease in his lab, but seen the life changing “cure” working in his father. He also makes a pitch for many causes that seem tangential but are deeply related to his work—universal health care, genetically modified produce, faux meat made in a lab, going vegan, vaccines and addressing climate change.A remarkable book for living better and being a better society."
51,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53441261-riccardo,5,"The book is really good, well structured, filled with optimism without naivety and all around a great primer on current aging research. It’s structured in 3 main parts: the past (what we know), the present (what we are leaning) and the future (what are the possibilities). It also addresses the challenges that will come with extending lifespan, not necessarily by giving answers but even just by prompting to ask the right questions; I really appreciated the openness with which these subjects are treated. Finally David describes its own anti-aging regiment, a good reference for the _current_ state of the art. Of course research in the field is moving at great speed, so I don’t think the book will... age particularly well (that was too easy). "

Sinclair is at the forefront of research, and I am grateful that he took some time away from writing scientific papers to write a book for the general public. He distills the last 20 years or so of anti-aging research into an easy to read book. Sinclair's theory of aging is elegant. Simple enough to explain with an evolutionary argument going all the way back to the primordial soup, but powerful enough to explain all sorts of observations, for example, hormesis. Have you ever wondered why stresses to the body like exercise, fasting, sauna, and cold exposure all work to keep you young? His theory explains why, and this book explains his theory in an accessible form. "
53,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92668416-live-forever-or-die-trying,5,"This book earns 5 stars alone for Sinclair's Information Theory of Aging. However, the theory is proposed in full in the first 70 pages of the book. If you are looking for a more thorough breakdown on the specific sciences that have lead Sinclair to this theory you may leave wanting more after the 300+ page book concludes. However as someone who has read 3 books on the topic of aging prior to this book I was relieved that the Theory was isolated from a majority of citations to studies.The second and third sections of the book are important but isolated from Sinclair's Theory of Aging. I personally love when a scientist speculates on the future based off of their work but I know some people will despise this aspect, especially since it takes up the majority of the book."

Although many things mentioned in the book are out of reach for general public or haven’t been invented yet , but there are things we can control right now to make our lives bit more healthy. For me , fasting , exercise and being a bit more conscious of what I eat has helped. I am still not 100% sold on the idea of using medicine and chemicals or supplements, and think it still requires lot more research before we should start using them.

It was informative, yet not over complicated. I would pretty much recommend this book to anyone who interested in improving their life and that for the long run. I will for sure apply several of his concepts to my life. The book was structured well, kept me interested though 99% of the time and was truly enjoyable to read.He wrote the book in a way that also a non-science person could read and understand it. Furthermore, there were several chapters in the book where he describes his journey as a soon to be scientist, which I thought was also very interesting, especially because I myself dream to once work in the research sector. Possibly in the field of ageing.The reason why I'm not giving Lifespan the full 5 stars, is because there are a couple of passages where he starts to repeat himself too often. But as a counter argument he even acknowledged that he has already mention couple of sentences over and over, because most humans still accept death as inevitable. Moreover, I didn't agree with his world view on population size and quality of life. He wrote the passages out of a human and anthropocentric point of view and not so much from a nature and biodiversity perspective. Sure, our world can increase the amount of human occupants, but somehow only by spoiling and occupying more and more areas of natural habitat. He did mention climate change and that we have to adapt our industries and push for sustainable agendas. Yet when talking about the possible negative impacts it could have on our planet if we increase the population size of humans here on earth, he didn't give any truly satisfying solutions to these issues, but simply mentioned that he has good faith in the future. Optimistic, which is great and lovely but doesn't solely get us to places.Though, all in all I really enjoyed this book."
66,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54320432-ieva-gr,5,"Why I read it: I’ve been interested in ageing research for a while now. Was looking for a source that would give a good overview on the topic. What I liked about it:How easy to follow it was. I always wince a little when an audiobook has an accompanying pdf, but this one mostly had pretty scientific illustrations. The content itself was super engaging, a very good mix of scientific knowledge and personal stories. I liked that it gave a brief history of ageing research, thorough explanation of the processes that are now known to influence ageing. It was interesting how ageing was explained it in terms of information theory, which is something I’m a little familiar with.That it contained practical advice on how to live a longer, healthier life. Both based on the research and also the tips what author does himself.That it contained anecdotes from lab life along with stories of long hours at work and even sleeping at the lab. I sometimes day dream of doing a PhD in this area and understanding the level of dedication needed is really sobering.That it contained speculations about the future a prolonged lifespan could lead to. What I disliked: It made me think about disease and death more than I usually do. So in a way it was a bit of a gloomy read. Also I’m not sure if I appreciated author going into some political topics at the end. Those are really important but just giving them few sentences at the outro doesn’t do them justice. "

The more practical facts and recommendations begin in chapter seven. Sinclair’s passion can cause him to be repetitious. The reader can learn from what sounds reasonable and discard what seems somewhat whacko (even to his friends and scientific peers).

Had some interesting ideas and exciting research. But the way the information was presented was a bit misleading. It's a lot of optimism and hope, but mostly ideas and animal studies. The first half of the book was a lot of stories. A lot of living forever, yadda. But not much evidence. The second half was a lot more interesting. Less living forever, and more living 100+ years but quality years. That's what I cared about more. Quality life. Quality ""old age"". I am not a fan of acting or aging older than I am. Easing the progression sounds good to me. I don't know how quickly his process will go in my lifetime. But still some interesting stuff. Though also some stuff I'm not thrilled about. He's a scientist and a researcher. I'm a clinical dietitian. He kinda lost me when he started touting GMO's. But overall some interesting talking points and research potential."

Slightly hypocritical that a man in an evidence based career relies on so many anecdotes to get his point across though. The last 1/3 was pure political and futuristic conjecture I could've done without. But my view on the ageing process and potential ways around it was fundamentally changed for the better
71,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,3,"This book is eye opening. Why do we age? Not inflammation, not oxidation, not merely mitochondrial depletion, not merely telomere shortening. Those are the symptoms and not the sickness. The reason we age is loss of genetic information. Normally our genes are coiled up with histone proteins and only small parts are allowed to be exposed. This differentiate our cells into different organs, like the liver and kidney. With Aging, the DNA gets untangled and so the cells lose their distinctiveness. Sinclair sincerely believe that Aging can be stopped and we can be young and healthy for a very very Long time. Some evidence based approaches he proposed:1. Exercise. Just get up and move already. 2. Calorie restriction. Works in worms and mice. 3. Metformin. However not yet approved for anti-aging as there has been no randomised controlled trials. 4. Rapamycin: works in nice but highly toxic to humans. Hmm. 5. Nicotinamide mononucleotide. Works in animals but the first safety study in humans was just published by the Japanese as of End 2019 (it seems safe). We don’t know whether it works until the randomised controlled trial. Sinclair then spent a large part of the book on pushing the agenda that researchers should spend more time researching methods to slow aging. He thinks that if we can reverse aging, all diseases will go away and we will live much longer. He also proposed many ways that society should change when we live much longer, and he suggested that physician-assisted suicide should be legalised. What he did not explain was why drugs that worked in animals did not seem to work in humans too well by being toxic. Overall a 3 because the science could have been more. "

This book will surely help with this goal, but it could have done so much more. It certainly had ample opportunity to keep the reader immersed in the science content, but the author derails himself continually with social policy proclamations. Any person who picks up a book like this to read in their spare time — something so evidently NOT a beach read — does not need the author to talk about which governments do the best job and what the world’s most important issues ought to be, and what governments really need to do. Readers of books like this seek the science. This book was a little short on science but rather long on virtue-signaling implications of the science. I think the readers of books like this are perfectly capable of extrapolating their very own ideas about the future and the potential outcomes and what should or should not be done. I enjoyed Part 1 and Part 2. I found Part 3 unnecessary. I am not interested in being told how to think about this - I simply want to understand the science. Take out all the public policy and political admonishing, and take out all the USA trashing, and throw in another unit on the actual lab studies and I would have found this a far better read."

Part 3 would be best excised from the book in my opinion - with the exception of a single page in the conclusion where he outlines what he takes himself.I'd have preferred the third section focused more on that - perhaps detailing the regimen of others in his lab, and more outlining of the available biotech people can use to get their own feedback. That would have been a five-star book - as the first two sections were - but instead, it reduced my overall score to three stars.Also worth noting, at least 25% of the book are notes, references, etc. That's not a bad thing (in fact, it's arguably good), but it's worth noting when reading on Kindle. You think you're only 30% through the book, when you're halfway there, etc. (I only mention this as something worth noting - it didn't change my scoring of the book)."

The timing coincided with my mom's surgery recovery. The interview piqued my interest - I wanted to learn how to improve my aging family members' health so I picked up the book.Really interesting stuff on where scientific advancement could take us. Beyond the Science, I love the chapter on overpopulation. I love that David presents arguments for and against prolonging human life. It talks about social issues and offered some interesting anecdotes and perspectives. I thought the Science portion of the book got a little long-winded, but the social science portion was on-point.Really enjoyed the book."

Then the author makes a case for calorie restriction diet, exposure to heat like sauna and to cold like cold showers, cold weather or sleep in a cool room, explaining why this works. And this is where it gets somewhat difficult, with a fair degree of detail and technical explanations that the good doctor makes good effort to make them understandable to the lay people. The new information that I found is the existence of supplements, like NMN, NR, resvetatrol, metformin and several others with age enlargement properties with explanations also why it could work in humans, although not clinically tested. All interesting, if hard to follow at times, but the writing is engaging. "

77,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52406617-brad-revell,4,"My review is here: https://www.bradrevell.com/2019/10/li...Three key takeaways from the book:1. There is a difference between extending life and prolonging vitality (i.e. just not more years of life but more active, healthy and happy ones)2. After 25 years of researching ageing and reading thousands of scientific papers, Sinclair’s one piece of advice for staying healthy longer and maximising lifespan is to eat less!3. People are overly preoccupied with the number of humans on Earth while ignoring the fact that consumption “bears twice as much responsibility for pressure on resources and ecosystems as population growth.”"
78,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66086616-fanie-oosthuysen,4,All the stars for the first part of the book and 0 for the second part where David shows how he has been infected by the social liberal pathology of our time. But since he is working at a university in the United States and is a born Australian that infection is inevitable. It is however great to see that it did not drive him from his work and his moderate sense is driving him to solve the aging problem. Definitely worth the read. Now to find a way to produce massive amounts of NMN and maybe I should restart taking resveratrol.

It is definitely an exciting topic and the book contains some interesting information for someone who has never thought about aging as about 'disease'.Author tries to stay neutral, not pushy, but his blunt criticism of European regulations regarding GMOs turned my suspicion alert on.Either way I would like to see human lifespan to be expanded."
80,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132860-zhuo-zhang,4,"It is a good read and very eye-opening. The structure of the book is really clear thus it is easy for the reader to digest the context from past to present and the future. Even though I feel the present and the future is a little bit overlapping. Take the supplement, exercises, no or very less sugar/carb intake, plant based diet, intermittent fasting and most important, having a belief that aging is not unavailable. The book instills a lot of hope to longevity. "
81,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52098686-matthew,4,"A bit technical at times, but an enjoyable recapitulation of the Harvard geneticist's research and other science in the field of how to slow aging, and how by activating our epigenetic profile -- and perhaps in the not to distant future even reverse aging it by rewriting it. Advancements that would not just extend human life but health into later years. Definitely worth a read! "
82,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5389939-pamela,3,"Warning! This book is very sciency. Much of it I simply didn't have the background to understand, although it was easy to get excited by the author's passion for the topic as he was the reader of the audible text. There were a few takeaways for lifestyle moves conducive to better aging/longer life, which I found interesting. A summary of this book would have been nicer for my purposes."
83,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10380735-simon-hohenadl,4,"I've been looking for a book like this for some time: an understandable summary of the current state of ageing and longevity science and what you can do to benefit from it.I liked the style, the explanations and the accompanying illustrations a lot, although in several instances Sinclair trails off in accounts from his personal life, other researchers' lives or a bit of ranting."
84,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5600753-mirek-jasinski,4,"Interesting. Walking and exercise, a proper diet (eating less, fasting intermittently and converting to plant based diet), winter swimming (and reducing room temperature for the night) and a few pills can dramatically extend your lifespan. But is it enough to keep the same life quality at the old age? Requires some more research into the subject."
85,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75839499-matthew-p-e,5,Wow...This book really made me rethink what it meant to age. Understanding that deterioration with aging was not a physical law of nature that could not be treated. This was an interesting book that really peaked my interest on the topic. Who doesn't want to live a longer and HEALTHIER life?
86,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1585572-sharon,3,"The author provides cogent evidence regarding the possibility of extending our current lifespan. However, I think that he glosses over the impact that extended lives will have on the global population, resource depletion and climate change. "
87,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086229-susie-stangland,4,An interesting read on how we can challenge what we are told about hitting old age and when our time is up. Looking at our body as a group of molecules and treating it in ways you might not currently utilizing. It’s something to think about and consider.
88,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104402026-ayu-wardojo,4,"Quite interesting to read, specially for me who have zero interest into science whatsoever. But this book made me keep read and educated me in a unique way. Lilbit surprise and proud that I could finished it less then a month :) "
89,1501191977,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58251005,4,"Interesting book in general. Stress like exercise, cold, extreme heat, fasting and some plants compounds slows aging.I would prefer more technical details and less philosophy of aging and old population. "
