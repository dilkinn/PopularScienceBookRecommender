0,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,4,"Roach is the author of Stiff, a raucous romp through the wonderful land of death. It is only natural that she might continue that escapade with a look past the curtain. Are there ghosts? Is there life after death? She examines a host of topics under her conceptual umbrella, looking at reincarnation, the hunt for the seat of the soul, the notion that the soul weighs 21 grams, ectoplasm, the effectiveness of mediums, including her stint in medium school, (she outgrew small but was not yet advanced enough for large school?) EVP, and more. As with Stiff, it is a bit hazardous reading this in public as one is apt to burst out into laughter every now and then, victimized by the snide commentary that makes this book great fun to read. I particularly enjoyed the section on the possibility that infrasound, that is, sound at or about 18-20 decibels, might account for a wide range of supposedly psychic experience. Spook has enough payload to justify the trip and the humor makes it a very spirited ride.Other Mary Roach works -----Stiff-----Packing for Mars-----Gulp-----Grunt"
1,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,3,"I learned a number of interesting things reading Mary Roach's survey of the historical and scientific efforts to prove the existence of a soul. Her discussion of the scientific inquiries into stories of reincarnated children provides an excellent example of the difficulties of trying to objectively prove something when your main resource is the shaky memories of those who are already convinced of whatever it is you're trying to prove.Though I was already familiar with the theory that infrasound (sound at a frequency too low for humans to hear) can cause the experience of ghostly phenomenon, I was intrigued to learn that a tiger's roar contains infrasound and some theorize that the fear we feel in the presence of infrasound is left over from days when escaping tigers was a high evolutionary priority.I also learned more than I ever wanted to know about the various ways spiritualist mediums faked the extrusion of ectoplasm. Despite the interesting nature of the topic, however, I didn't love this book as much as I hoped. There were moments in which the narrative got bogged down as the author detailed a few too many historical efforts to prove the existence of the soul. In addition, I struggled with the tone of the book. Roach admits to being a skeptic, but she said her goal was to explore this topic with an open mind. In this I don't think she really succeeded. Though she does acknowledge some inexplicable events, she spends more time poking cheap fun at many of her subjects. In some circumstances, I can imagine the temptation was hard to resist, but this semi-snarky tone felt a little too easy. A few moments of genuine humor combined with her generally readable style, however, made me want to seek out her first book, which I've heard is much better. "
2,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/143942-simeon-berry,3,"Not bad, but Roach reveals her limitations in this book; namely, she writes mostly to entertain. She spends most of her time making fun of mediums from the spiritualism craze in the 20's (which, let's face it, is like shooting fish in a barrel).But you can also sense the places where her unspoken thesis (i.e. that the idea of a soul, and any attendant special effects, is bunk) runs into problems.She hurriedly scurries past it (as in the case of Kirlian photography, or a scientific experiment which seemed to validate the presence of an astrally projected body form). This is not to say that either of these is ""true"" or ""valid."" Just that the clumsy and hostile way she handles stuff she can't turn into a modest punch-line is in sharp contrast to her deliberate and even-handed approach to the other (more easily debunked) examples. Which I find insulting as a reader. I don't mind being entertained, but I do mind someone pretending that I won't notice flaws in her argument."
3,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2089479-laura,2,"This is a book that tries too hard to be cutesy. From page one, we're dumped with tons of cute little footnoted anecdotes about quaint pseudo-scientific afterlife-related topics (many of her anecdotes tend to veer far off topic), but nothing meaningful or even slightly memorable. Furthermore, Roach's humor comes across not as funny but as smug, even mean-spirited (and, as a firm non-believer, I was predisposed to agree with her point of view anyway).Her research and organization were both terrible. She seemed to jump into topics haphazardly, with no segues between them, and with no reason except to poke gleeful fun at the topic she's investigating: ""Look at me! I managed to get into the highly-exclusive Cambridge Library Manuscript Room! First, I'll make a joke about all the nerds doing research in the room, and what mind-numbingly boring topics they're studying! Then, I'll discuss at length how embarrassed I am to be studying such a silly subject! Then, after summarizing the articles I read in boring detail, I'll have a good long laugh about the ridiculous shenanigans people got up to in olden times, and how funny their beliefs sound today!"" Long story short, her ""investigations"" into phenomena are cursory at best. This is a book that claims to speak for science...but true scientific research is never this shallow. The only chapter that I really found interesting was the one on ghosts/ghost sightings. However, I was put off by Roach's presentation: for example, she investigates in some detail a case in which a farmer claimed to see the ghost of his deceased father; the ghost directed the farmer to a hidden copy of his will, a will which just so happened to give the farmer a greater share in his late father's estate. No surprise here: First, Roach ""investigates"" the ghost-sighting claim, then feels the (surely noble) need to tell the farmer's grandchildren that their ancestor was likely involved in some sort of scam (even though they previously had held no doubts about their grandfather's story, and didn't seem to want to hear any of her arguments). Blah blah blah. Nearly none of this book is clever or particularly engaging. When it's not trying to be humorous, it just feels like a long list of names and dates and titles of research studies. Most inexcusable: this book is boring. I'm one who actually watches those terrifically bad Discovery Channel shows about hauntings (the ones with dramatic re-enactments, complete with computer-generated ""ghosts"" and spooky noises soundtrack). I shouldn't have found this book boring. I should have devoured it. Instead, I was bored out of my mind and desperately wished each page was the last. "
4,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,5,"All of Mary Roach's book have a few things in common:(1) They are brilliantly and exhaustively researched.(2) They are incredibly engaging.(3) They are hilarious without ever being silly.Spook is not the exception. Roach take on the afterlife is a fresh one, aimed at explaining the many similar phenomena reported by every culture around the world in a compelling way, one that doesn't alienate but widens our view of the world. Whatever the reader's background--religiously, culturally--this book offers answers (and, as all good books, also creates more questions) to soothe our fears and make us feel a little bit more at ease with that last stage in every life: death."
5,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,5,"Mary Roach's book has two great strengths. The first is that she's damnably funny; she brings humor to any place of uncertainty and any place of anyone's absolute certainty. The second strength is that she's humble and friendly; her prose is downright gregarious, so that reading often comes off as chatting with a well-versed (but not know-it-all) friend. She is less interested with one person being right and more interested in finding every available source of information, which often means transcending two sides of an argument and finding bystanders. In her opening she casts doubt on both religion and science, doubting and chiding them paragraph-for-paragraph, setting us up for the spirited search of spirits she's about to embark on. Spook provides neither New Age pseudo-support for every little possibility of the supernatural, nor mean-spirited skepticism. The aforementioned two classes seem to dominate far too much of these subjects, making much of the discourse unbearable. If you need her to seriously lean towards orthodoxy or the scientific method, don't bother reading Spook. She will not bow to your paradigm, and really, if you're so certain that you cannot stand anything but confirmation of your belief or disbelief, why do you even bother reading about these matters? You're done. Get a less parasitic hobby than arguing with people over their interests. Roach is wise enough to observe interests and report them in detail, even when they run as absurdly as a court case over the existence (and desires) of a ghost, or a real life sample of ectoplasm. It's wonderful to read someone who can be funny about this sensitive matter without ever coming across as hating one of the embattled sides. It allows me to forgive her naive definitions of ""proof,"" ""evidence,"" ""belief,"" and ""knowledge,"" because by the end you aren't reading Plato. You're reading the observations of a friend, from whom you have much to learn and much to laugh about.In short - this is a book titled ""Spook"" and only subtitled ""Science Tackles the Afterlife,"" and the photo of the author on the dustjacket shows her laughing hysterically. If you pick up and carry it all the way to the checkout desk, you know what you're in for. You're only lucky that she went through such a thorough journey of research and observation of other people's research.--Written 2008; edited for typos, 2014."
6,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon,3,"Want to know what happens when we die? You and everyone else apparently. Many people believe in some sort of continuation be it an afterlife, reincarnation or maybe that your soul sticks around and haunts old, abandoned mansions? Unfortunately, no one really knows for sure. With Spook, Mary Roach isn’t going to provide you with a concrete answer but rather an exploration of several beliefs and possibilities.I didn’t enjoy this one nearly as much as Stiff. It’s not to say it’s a poorly written book, I just found my interest waning at certain points. That being said, there are some interesting chapters detailing EVP (electronic voice phenomenon) reincarnation, ectoplasm and the ongoing search for the human soul but they felt long winded and repetitive. With Stiff, Roach’s research is scientific and factual whereas with Spook, it’s a lot of interviews with folks who are speaking about belief systems and faith. I’m not trying to knock organized religion or anything, it just didn’t hold my attention as much as Stiff, or even Packing for Mars.If anything, seek out the chapters about her enrollment and experience in medium school. I’m not the biggest fan of that “profession” and while she goes on record in detailing her personal skepticism, I found that she provided a fair and balanced approach regarding the students and professors.I’d be interested to hear thoughts from someone who carries a firm belief in the afterlife and what, if anything, this book did for them. I consider it a fault of mine to be unable to shut off the voice in my head screaming, “You’re lying! None of this is possible!” when Mary is interviewing someone. If I could, I’m sure I would have enjoyed it a lot more."
7,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"This would have been a much better book if I had read it, rather than listened to it as an audio book. The problem was that the person reading it had been told Roach is funny, in much the same way bad actors spend too much time remembering Shakespeare wrote his plays as ‘poetry’ – so she read this almost with a laugh-track playing throughout. Nothing kills a joke quite so stone-dead as telegraphing it in your voice two sentences ahead of the punch-line. Given that the humour in this one had been sent ‘to the other side’ for me the only interest left was in the subject matter itself. But let’s face it, the subject matter is inherently interesting. Our feeble hold on existence, which is both fleeting and precarious, outrages our sense of, well, of fairness. Why raise us as this quintessence of dust only to scatter us again all so quickly back to the winds? What kind of divine joke is that, exactly? Whatever did make fatuous sunbeams toil only to cast us once again down into eternal the darkness? Why must our first screaming inhalation foretell all too predictably, even in its repetition, our final, sighing exhalation? If anything confirms Stendhal’s quip that ‘God’s only excuse is that he doesn’t exist’ then surely our infinitely insignificant three-score and ten standing as it does divided by 13 billion years quickly takes most of the humour out of just about everything.Vanity spurs our ‘reason’ to snatch at, grasp and cling to the hope that this is not, nor can be, all. There must be more. And if there is more, then surely there must also be a two-way desire – both from us in the here and now and from those we love wherever they have gone from the here and now – to somehow communicate. Unfortunately, I start from the premise that those who believe in an afterlife cover a rather unappealing spectrum – that is, from the deluded to the charlatan. And although I can understand the motivations of self-interest that motivate both ends of this spectrum (even if I can only view one end with any compassion), I generally turn away from this all too bright light as a pitiful kind of wish fulfilment. Better by far the cold realisation of eternal non-existence that is awaiting us, than the infinite horrors eternal salvation seem to invariably impose on the vast majority of those not saved.It is difficult to get the tone right in a topic like this, particularly if you are going to also try to be humorous about it. It is hard to avoid pointing and laughing at all of the clearly self-serving beliefs you don’t share, even while remaining completely blind to your own and probably equally self-serving beliefs. I couldn’t help feeling there was so much more she could have spoken about – at one point she mentions William James, but then says nothing at all about his extensive work on the continuation of our ‘souls’ after our need for our worldly solid form goes away. Other books http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... cover this topic in much more detail and probably are better in many ways. James’ own work http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... makes it clear that he expected Spiritualism to have come into its own long before this.If I must make a snide remark it is to wonder why people who believe in the afterlife don't seem to be appropriately concerned about senility. This is something she mentions in this book too and is something I’ve often wondered about. I’m sure most people who believe in an afterlife assume dying somehow restores their faculties back to mid-season form (as Wodehouse might have put it). But just why this might be the case is never made all that clear. The idea of eternal mental decay, or worse, being endlessly fixed in a part way decayed stage, seems as good a definition of hell as I can think of.This wasn’t a bad book, in fact, some of it, particularly at the end with the stuff about the ghost and his second will, was really fascinating – but the book could so easily have been a much better one."
8,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"Now this was fun! I've never read Mary Roach before, but I enjoyed her exploration of possible evidences for life after death very much. She's a skeptic, but not a debunker – she would like to see solid evidence that some sort of consciousness continues after the body dies, but for the most part what she finds is that even where scientists and other investigators are trying to be rigorous in their experiments, squishiness often intrudes. Results can be interpreted in various ways, and the ways subjects and investigators perceive occurrences are influenced by their beliefs. Still, some of the researchers Roach visits are surprisingly objective, and on a few occasions Roach allows that the paranormal explanation of events might have something to it. And, as she points out, choosing to believe that the more mystical answer might be right might just be more fun!”Has my year among the evidence-gatherers left me believing in anything I didn't believe in a year ago? It has. It has left me believing something Bruce Greyson believes. I had asked him whether he believes that near-death experiences provide evidence of a life after death. He answered that what he believed was simply that they were evidence of something we can't explain with our current knowledge. I guess I believe that not everything we humans encounter in our lives can be neatly and convincingly tucked away inside the orderly cabinetry of science. Certainly most things can – including the vast majority of what people ascribe to fate, ghosts, ESP, Jupiter rising – but not all. I believe in the possibility of something more – rather than in any existing something more (reincarnation, say, or dead folks who communicate through mediums). It's not much, but it's more than I believed a year ago.”Roach reminds me of Bill Bryson or Sam Kean – a fine storyteller. She includes some personal information and responses, but she doesn't overshare. Her description of her efforts to unobtrusively examine the “ectoplasm” she has borrowed from the Cambridge University library archive, while sharing a library table with other library visitors, is entertaining, and certainly conveys the repulsiveness of the stuff. Tales of her participation in other experiments, such as when she sits in a soundproofed room at Laurentian University to find out if exposure to EMF's will make her sense presences and see and hear ghosts, and in investigations, such as when she brings in a forensic handwriting expert to determine the authenticity of a “ghostly” will, are engaging and told with sympathetic, if sometimes flippant and earthy, humor. Her footnotes are also amusing.This was particularly interesting in conjunction with The Witch of Lime Street: Séance, Seduction, and Houdini in the Spirit World (also better than that one, btw) in that Roach includes a couple chapters which overlap the subject of that one – Harry Houdini and the Scientific American “medium challenge.” Roach actually gives a better context for understanding how serious scientists could have been taken in, at least temporarily, by mediums who appear now to be so obviously fakes. The table tipping and cheesecloth ectoplasm still looks pretty blatantly phony from where I sit, but at the time, when photography was in its early years and X-rays, radio waves, etc. were newly discovered and poorly understood I can imagine how things might have looked different, and open-minded people might more plausibly have imagined disembodied personalities zipping about in the ether.So, lots of fun, and recommended for those with an interest in the subject. 4 stars."
9,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90746-clidston,2,"A trip through various scientific and not-so-scientific attempts to ascertain whether or not the human soul, consciousness, personality, or whatever survives the death of the body. Looks at reincarnation, mediums, ectoplasms, attempts to measure or weigh the soul, anatomical searches for the seat of the soul within the body, electromagnetic haunting, quantum physics theories of consciousness, ghost-hunting, electronic voice phenomena and near-death experiences. Not at all a ""scholarly"" work and written in a tongue-firmly-in-cheek fashion. I'll allow there were some funny moments (I'm still chuckling over the chapter on reincarnation, entitled ""You Again?""), but unfortunately it's not as entertaining as the diverse and bizarre subject matter might suggest. The tone of the whole thing is smug and self-involved, enamored of its own clever little turns of phrase, like an endless NPR personal essay or a salon.com article.Could be good, amusing food for thought if you're interested in this kind of thing, but for some reason it seems to drag a little bit. It's almost boring.How can anything be boring when it includes people killing themselves out of curiousity about the afterlife, mediums hiding cheesecloth and animal parts in their vaginas, electromagnetic impulses being sent into the right lobe of the brain to simulate the experience of being ""haunted,"" and a man mowing his lawn in a three-piece suit? Don't ask me, but it is.Incidentally, I actually listened to this on audiobook - whatever you do don't do that. The reader is terrible, and manages to step on the punchline of nearly every joke (I also didn't need the exaggerated French accent when reading a quotation from Descartes in English, thank you very much)."
10,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene,2,"I was very interested in reading this book, 'Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife' , as I have had a lifelong interest in the supernatural and paranormal. I was curious to know just what science has contributed to this topic. In this book, Mary Roach ambitiously tackles a wide range of topics. The first subject she delves into is reincarnation… a subject I have read a great deal about. She recounts a visit she made to India and her meeting with Dr. Kirti Rawat, director of the International Center for Survival and Reincarantion Research. Dr. Rawat , a retired philosophy professor, takes his role very seriously and approaches his subjects in a thoughtful manner and demonstrates a firm belief in the claims made by families and their young children regarding memories of people and events from what they believe are previous lives. Dr. Rawat tirelessly visits families throughout India and Ms. Roach recounts her impressions of particular visits. Reading these accounts was tremendously fascinating to me but if you are a reader looking for more definitive proof…. well, you won't find it here. For me, however, each time I read such stories , I can't help but marvel and wonder…. and perhaps ultimately that is all I can hope to do.Ms. Roach also presents a multitude of other topics in her book, including a somewhat confusing explanation of ectoplasm (and I confess that I'm still unclear what it actually IS!), and an accounting of all the ways and manners in which phony mediums found to exude such substances from multiple orifices of their bodies…. definitely a little too much information !!! She also includes chapters on electronic voice phenomena (EVP), near death experiences… which I admit, I find particularly captivating… and an extensive and somewhat tedious description of the spiritualist craze of the 1920's.All in all, there just was not much in this book that I had not read extensively about previously… with the exception of the experimentation which has been ongoing regarding the experience of ghostly phenomena and apparitions. The discovery that Ms. Roach refers to is the discovery of infrasound … sound at a frequency too low for humans to hear.. and how infrasound has been shown to create or cause the experience of ghostly phenomena. Ms. Roach tackles many topics in this book and it occurs to me that perhaps this is part of the problem I have with the book. Each topic was discussed briefly and superficially ; and I suppose this was her intention .. a kind of overview on the topic. But for someone like me, who has done a fair amount of reading on many of these subjects, the book ended up very unsatisfying.The other problem I had with this book… and at times, it was insurmountable… was its tone. Although Ms. Roach clearly states in her introduction… ""The moral of the story is that proof is an elusive quarry and all the more so when you are trying to prove an intangible""; I found that rather than presenting the information that is available and allowing the reader to decide its veracity, she editorializes throughout and seems to be saying quite often that she finds particular topics silly and based on ignorance. Her tone, to me, often seemed mocking and disdainful; and although I'm assuming that she perhaps intended her tone to be playful and humorous, it didn't 'feel' that way to me. It sometimes seemed mean-spirited. I have no idea what the truth is regarding reincarnation and near death experiences but along with so many people, I AM curious about what is next after this life ends. And I can't help but wonder… could this be true? As Albert Einstein said, ""There are two ways to live: you can live as if nothing is a miracle or you can live as if everything is a miracle."" I suppose I choose to believe in the possibility that miraculous things CAN happen.I would give this book 2 1/2 stars as I admit that perhaps I was not the intended audience."
11,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1767089-karen,1,"Given the title, I expected a little more actual science and less mockery of fringe and historical science. The last two or three chapters came the closest to what I'd actually expected this book to be-- chapters where she's researching subjects she felt were credible-- but the rest of the book was... meh. The subjects were mostly interesting, but the author's superior and mocking tone REALLY got up my nose. (For the record, no, I don't believe in most of the stuff she talks about, either, but I do at least feel that there are things science can't sufficiently explain yet... nor do I expect 19th century scientists to be able to apply 21st century rigor to their studies.)Honestly, I think this book would have worked much better as a either series of (shorter) magazine articles, or as a title co-written with an opposing viewpoint (at least someone more tolerant of unexplained phenomena, as she is most definitely NOT). I understand the author was attempting to be playful and lighthearted in tone, but that's not how it came across to me. Yes, she poked fun at herself, but she spent a lot more time making fun of her subjects, their methodologies, and their (to her standards) nonexistent evidence. (This from someone whose research method of choice was mainly to ""Google it."") She did avoid most major religions in her survey (I suspect to avoid a nasty backlash), although she took on Hinduism's belief in reincarnation in the first chapter.Open-minded she was NOT. (Sometimes, I found myself wondering why she chose this subject at all-- excess research material from her bestselling ""Stiff,"" I was told.) She was at least up-front about her lack of belief in anything except hard science, but she also seemed pretty intolerant of people who *did* believe or question. (On the subject of weighing souls, when a researcher came up with a result for which he had no rational explanation, the author's explanation was that the researcher was probably a loony.) Though she was concerned over the researchers' possible biases, she had no problem freely expressing her own. (Her ambiguous ""can't really prove or disprove"" statements in some chapter conclusions didn't really smack of conviction-- for the most part, it was pretty clear she'd made up her mind on the subject.)Some of her asides were entertaining (I have GOT to try the thing with the cows), though a larger number of them were extremely juvenile (mocking Kimberly Clark's name, for example, because it was the same as that of a feminine product manufacturer).If I want more lighthearted edge-of-normal human interest works, I think I'll stick with A. J. Jacobs, who is at least respectful of his subject even when he disagrees with it."
12,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3019559-mari,1,"I was unable to get through the first chapter of this book, as the narrator, when reading the quotes of an Indian doctor, spoke with a fake Indian accent to the likes of Apu from the Simpsons. Audiobook directors: DON'T DO THIS. IT'S RACIST."
13,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus,3,"Rating: 3.5* of fiveThe Book Report: Hot off the success of Stiff, Roach launched herself at an equally surprising topic: Does the soul exist? Is it possible to find it? Can the soul's survival of individual death account for the mysteries of reincarnation and hauntings?In a word, No. Roach travels the globe looking for the kind of evidence that scientists look for when postulating the existence of muons and Higgs bosons, sans the billion-plus dollar measuring equipment and teams of serious guys in funny coats and booties. Unsurprisingly, she fails to find it.My Review: All the stars in this book's favor are for Roach's hilarious writing and funny anecdotal collections. None are for the subject at hand, which she simply cannot bring herself to treat seriously. Her lapsed Catholicism made her too deeply skeptical to break free of it horrible fist-clench and look at the improbability of success from the few, one-quarter-assed feeble swats science has aimed at resolving this topic scientifically. Spend twenty or so billion dollars and a couple decades on it. Then let's see what science has to say. After all, they're doing *just that* for this Higgs boson dingus at CERN, so far with no success, and the immense machine they've built to see this particular angel dance on that particular pinhead seems as cranky as my knees on a cold morning.So please forgive me for rating her quest at zero, failed utterly before it started due to prejudice on the part of the questor and her chosen henchrats, but that's the only honest judgment I can render. Going looking for something in a place where it just isn't, and you already knew it wasn't, isn't looking...it's looking for chances to be funny, snarky, and cool, plus scoring one off the mental midgets who spiritually abused you in the name of Jeebus.But GOD this woman's funny! I laughed and laughed and laughed at some of her lines!"
14,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222319-jill-hutchinson,1,"I was totally disappointed in this book. Although I like the premise, which is looking into the scientific aspects of afterlife/reincarnation, I did not like the way that the author approached it. . The first chapter is about reincarnation and she travels to India to investigate some of the reincarnation reports. I should have gotten a hint of the tenor of the book at that point as she is condescending and borders on being offensive about the Indian people and the Hindu religion. The rest of the book deals with her experiences with scientists and groups that study the subject of what happens when one dies and takes a very smug attitude, interspersed with ""humor"" which is totally inappropriate. The only saving grace is the chapter where the fake mediums which were popular during Victorian times are exposed as frauds, with some particular cases highlighted. It really doesn't matter whether one believes in an afterlife or not, an unbiased study of the subject was what I was looking for in this book. Instead I got the cynical, demeaning. and rather flippant attitude of the author who obviously thinks that the study of the existence or non-existence of an afterlife is an unworthy topic for serious consideration."
15,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126421-april,2,"I enjoyed ""Stiff"", also by Mary Roach, so perhaps my expectations were too high for this book. Although I liked Roach's irreverent style in ""Stiff"", I found it forced and distracting in ""Spook"". The copious footnotes, that were only sometimes relevant, annoyed me. Perhaps ""Stiff"" was more interesting because it was full of facts that surprised me, things that made sense, but that I didn't know about. For example, I didn't know that if you donate your body to science it could end up in an experiment helping determine time of death for murder victims. This is valuable information for forensic scientists. Fascinating.In ""Spook"", there were a few interesting studies, especially concerning near death experiences, but I didn't find any surprises in Roach's conclusions, unless you count her weak last few sentences, ""The debunkers are probably right, but they're no fun to visit a graveyard with. What the hell. I believe in ghosts."" The ""why not"" attitude wasn't very satisfying. The book wasn't fascinating and if I wasn't reading it with someone else, I probably wouldn't have finished it. "

Faith did not take, because science kept putting it on the spot.""This was a fun read. I love Roach's sense of humor, which is self-effacing and witty without being condescending. But make no mistake about it, she's a natural-born skeptic, an agnostic with a keen eye and a heart of gold. Spook doesn't completely dismantle the concept of an afterlife but it certainly illuminates much of the flawed logic people often use to assert its existence."
17,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,5,"This is a funny and fascinating book on the soul. Does it exist? Is it physical? Can it be seen or measured? Are NDEs (Near Death Experiences) real? Do animals have souls? Mary Roach fearlessly dives in head first. This book comes down on the side of 'no'. No proof of a soul, no proof of a next life, no proof of ghosts. Even though in the end, she says “I believe in ghosts”, that is just because she WANTS to believe that there is something more out there. The book will turn people into skeptics. I enjoyed it a lot. Mary Roach has a great sense of humor."

She did her normal amount of research but, in this case, there just isn't really anything new to share. There's no proof of an afterlife and, at least for me, there wasn't much I hadn't already encountered elsewhere.Written in Roach's breezy-yet-serious style, which I love, it's thoughtful and thorough. This was just one of those things where I didn't get as much out of it as I usually do with her work.2.5 stars"
19,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,4,"I loved Mary Roach's Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers (how can I not adore an author who has me laughing heartily as I read about what happens to dead human bodies?!) (a 5 star book for me) and I’d like to read her book Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void and maybe Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex too, but I wasn’t that enthusiastic about reading this book. But, it’s the October selection for my real world book club so I dived in, with maybe not an open mind but not a 100% tightly shut mind, just a 99.99% shut mind. This book, I’d likely never have picked up on my own, at least not until I’d read all other books by Roach. This book is a delight because its author is funny. So funny! She’s also scientifically minded. Sense of humor and scientific mindedness are two things I value highly. And, it’s a good thing that this book is laugh out loud hilarious because I also had to get through reading about absurd and gruesome experiments on animals and people that she describes. The contents turned out to be partly about a subject I’ve always enjoyed: the history of medicine.And on page 72, there is even mention of the man I read about in the children’s picture book Fartiste by Kathleen Krull and Paul Brewer and illustrated by Boris Kulikov. This is a remarkably quick read. I laughed and smiled more during the first half than the second half of the book, but I’m not convinced it got any less funny; I’m more inclined to think the humor wore thin for me, and I’d had enough of the subject. But there is plenty of humor throughout and even the “Acknowledgements” section is a hoot.The book is organized beautifully; one chapter flows perfectly into the next.Oh, and for all my talk of the hilarity present within these pages the subject is taken seriously, and with an open, albeit scientific, survey.I must say I was a wee bit surprised by her expressed opinions in the “Last Words” section in the back of the book. What I love most about this book (and Stiff and I assume her other books too) is that she takes her readers on a journey that she is also experiencing for herself.There is an impressive Bibliography, materials listed for each chapter of this book.My book club chose this as our October selection because it’s the month of Halloween. I’m not sure how much we’ll talk about the book vs. our own beliefs vs. general talk, but that’s the case for virtually all our book club meetings, no matter which/what types of books we read; most meetings we talk more about non-book related things than the books we’ve read, and the vegan food we’re eating and enjoying is a common enough subject of our conversation.3 ½ to 3 ¾ stars"
20,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103544-sammy,4,"I picked up Spook first because it's subject matter interested me and then I knew I had to buy it when I saw that the author was none other than Mary Roach who had written another interesting and intriguing book dealing with the physical body at death. Remembering how amusing and fascinating that read had been (I recommened it to several friends who have the same weird sense of humor and morbid curiosities I do) I had a feeling this book would not disappoint. And it didn't.First off I'm going to give the same disclaimer Roach did: this is not a book written to debate various moral, religious, or philisophical beliefs. It's not meant to prove or disprove life after death, the existence of souls, or if heaven is out there. Rather it explores the various research that have been imployed to discover that. It's meant to shed light and simply learn. Okay, with that out of the way, I can safely begin!If you had started reading Roach's other book, Stiff and just found it to icky to go through with it, have no fear, you'll be safer with this book. There are a few moments you're a little disgusted, but the amount of times you'll be laughing, shaking your head, or simply saying ""wow"" definitely out weigh any squick moments. It's Roach's sarcastic wit that really makes the book an enjoyable and fun read. Her footnotes (that really read more like sidenotes) are a real treat constantly scattered throughout. Her approach and way of writing non-fiction subject matter is dealt with in a really nice way that even those who cannot stand anything dealing with real life will find the book hard to put down. There's almost a constant narrative and a steady stream of thought going on, something I think is made possible because instead of just constantly regurgitating facts a lot of what she's writing about she went and experienced first hand. It's the personal twist on everything she writes about that makes it a lot more interesting and easy to get into.There were the inevitable dry moments that were scattered throughout. Those mostly came about when Roach began giving the scientific explanations that were needed to explain the theories and research being done. I did feel kind of dumb reading some of this as it was way over my head some of the times, but Roach managed to remedy that by poking fun at her own ignorance. The fact that even the author was a little confused at times makes you feel a lot better for not getting it.I don't feel the book really opened any new beliefs for me, or pointed out anything I hadn't thought of before. For me, the book more or less explored the actual studies that went into what different people think happen to us after we die. No new school of thought is introduced to us in this book. That still doesn't make this book old and nothing we haven't heard before. I actually learned quite a bit. Especially with how long people have actually been trying to find the soul (and the various places people have put it in the body), my knowledge of Spiritualism has been greatly increased, and the fact that there are funded studies still being done out there to research the soul and life after death is fascinating. If this sounds interesting to you, even in the slightest, you will really enjoy this book then. Even if it doesn't sound interesting, Roach's style and humor will probably pull you in anyway."
21,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/634816-noah-soudrette,4," When I sat down with my newly purchased copy of Spook and started to read, I was rather surprised. The first thing I find myself reading about is reincarnation. This is not a subject I readily think of when I think of ghosts, nor is it a topic I care much about. However, as I read I was fairly engaged and found Mary Roach to have an opinion of the whole thing similar to my own. As I kept moving through the first few chapters I began to realize something rather disappointing. While this book is titled Spook and the very last word of the book is “ghosts”, this book really has very little to do with ghosts. Instead, as the subtitle indicates, this book is really more about scientific attempts to prove the existence of an afterlife. Personally, I have little interest in this subject. I’ll find if there’s an afterlife when/if I get there. This revelation aside, I still found myself enjoying this book quite a bit. The book is divided into what is essentially twelve essays. Each one deals with a different subject: reincarnation, the search for the soul by anatomists, the “weight” of a soul, ectoplasm, scientifically monitored mediums, a trip to medium school, telecommunication with the dead, the effect of electromagnetic fields on the human mind, psychoacoustics, a court case involving a ghost, and near-death experiences. As I said earlier, I have little interest in the idea of reincarnation (though I wouldn’t mind it turning out to be true) and I’m well aware of the history of anatomists trying to find the seat of the soul in the human body. However, chapter three, which deals with the commonly known idea of a human being losing twenty-one grams of weight at the moment of death, has been a subject I’ve been wanting to hear more about for a long time. I was equally disappointed and excited to see that the jury is still out on this one. While it has been tested in animals, resulting in only negative reactions, it has never been verified using a human being since the time of the original experiment. The chapter also provides a good reason why the theory could be true, but the results using animals have all been negative. Other highlights of the book include Mary exposing herself to electromagnetic radiation, resulting in minor auditory and visual hallucinations, stories of mediums hiding fake ectoplasm in their vaginas, and Mary solving a very old mystery involving ghosts through the use of a handwriting expert (though I have learned lately not to rely too heavily of handwriting analysts after watching Zodiac).  While there’s a lot to like here, I did have one big problem with the book. I couldn’t help but feeling Mary could have searched out more reliable researchers than the ones she encounters. It’s not really her fault though. While she ends up consulting scientists at very prestigious institutions such as Cambridge and a few big fancy American colleges, I was a bit shocked to find these learned men so biased (particularly the guy who tests those who talk to the dead). Personally, I find people like the Ghosthunters from the Sci-fi channel much more open and practical. However, I too am biased having met them in person.  All in all though, this book is rousingly entertaining and Mary Roach’s ability as a writer is clear. Not only is she light and humorous, but she’s also very personal, and we walk away from this book feeling as though we know her quite well, and I look forward to reading her other books."
22,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,2,"The author approaches her subject (the afterlife) with an open mind, if not with a little bit of wishful thinking. She looks into the research (mostly pseudoscientific, or bordering on it) on reincarnation, the soul, ghosts, mediums, and near death experiences (NDEs). She also relates research using some technology, like telecommunicating, electromagnetic fields, and acoustics. Almost all of the research she investigated she found wanting as it should be, but a few she still felt that the jury was still out.The book was fairly good, and she has a good sense of humor that clearly comes through. None of the research she looked into panned out; although, the NDEs experiment in the last chapter was still underway with no positive results so far. However, her desire for some proof of an afterlife I cannot share. In the final paragraph (p. 295) she shares her hope: “Perhaps I should believe in a hereafter . . . simply because it’s more appealing—more fun and more hopeful—than not believing.” I do not see why an afterlife would necessarily be “more fun.” And, why would it be “more hopeful”? Would it really be fun to live for an eternity? Would it not get boring? Plus, no one has any idea of what such an afterlife would be like. The Christian version is untenable as there is not any support for it outside the Bible, which does not really describe what it would be like, anyway. The Bible is just too inconsistent and contradictory in places to be valid. The same could be said for Islam’s version, which is actually worse because it sanctions violence, where death lands one in paradise. Would not they get tired of all those virgins? As for “more hopeful,” how so? I for one think that we live our lives as best we can and not worry about death, because death is it. When your dead you will have no awareness or memory of the past. So, what is there to lose?I do not know who would like this book. I suppose it would be attractive to debunkers, or possibly just to get some laughs or chuckles. I see no reason why it would be attractive to those that believe, since it offers no evidence for an afterlife."
23,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,0,"I have this book on my Kindle. Not a good idea. Spook is not a novel. It is a thoroughly-researched publication about the search for the soul by scientists and everyone else looking for it in different ways.This is the kind of book that should be on a coffee table, or in the throne room of the house. It is for interest's sake. It can be entertaining, or it can be serious, depending on your approach to the subject. It can be many things to many people. It is just not a book that should be read in one sitting, like a novel.Well-written. I will not finish it, nor rate it, for now. It simply does not talk to me nor does it hold my attention long enough. The information and experiments are interesting to a point. Perhaps a mood swing might do the trick."
24,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4719641-wigs,4,"Maybe a 3.5, but I'll round up because I laughed out loud several times and I'm hard pressed to do more than a smirk when I find something I'm reading funny.If you've never read a Mary Roach book before, her work is like this: she researches a bunch of scientific studies about a particular subject, and then presents them to you with witty prose and tons of oddball stories along the way. It's quite enjoyable, but beware that there is a fuck-ton of name dropping constantly, to of course credit all the sources and people she found information from, and you have to be one who enjoys reading about sciencey type stuff at least on a cursory level.This is her book on ghosts. She is a skeptic, hoping that through her research something can be proven to her. I am not a skeptic, I just don't believe anything. I don't sit and wonder, I personally feel confident in my decision that nothing is going to happen to me when I die, my brain will shut down and so will any control, memories, or anything, and that will be that. That's cool though, I don't care one way or the other (though my ex was just terrified by the notion that I thought this. Meh.) This book does nothing to try to convince you of any ghosts or afterlife either, because almost all experiments are either failures or serve the purpose of debunking anything that seems to be a ghost.I think the issue with this book, and what makes it not as good as Stiff, or even Bonk, is that it is based on something that can't actually be proven one way or the other, intangible and untouchable. With the science presented in Stiff, we actually learn things that are exactly as they are. With these stories, it's like ""well that was the experiment, and nothing happened."" There are many stories like that in the book. It's interesting to see what lengths people will go to, but in the end, it's all the same, there's no proving it.What I did like, is the silly stories of people acting like complete fools. There was plenty of that. And in fact, since I don't have much more to say (I enjoyed the book, you might enjoy it too if you like Mary Roach and science, but I recommend much, much more her book Stiff first), I'm going to leave you with my favorite passage from the book, which I typed up just now just so people can have a laugh:Is it possible to dress up like a ghost and fool people into thinking they've seen the real deal? Happily, there is published research to answer this question, research carried out at no lesser institution than Cambridge University. For six nights in the summer of 1959, members of the Cambridge University Society for Research in Parapsychology took turns dressing up in a white muslin sheet and walking around in a well-traversed field behind the King's College campus. Occasionally they would raise their arms, as ghosts will do. Other members of the team hid in bushes to observe the reactions of passerby. Although some eighty people were judged to have been in a position to see the figure, not one reacted or even gave it a second glance. The researchers found this surprising, especially given that the small herd of cows that grazed the field did, unlike the pedestrians, show considerable interest, such that two or three at a time would follow along behind the 'ghost.' To my acute disappointment, ""An Experiment in Apparitional Observation and Findings,"" published in the September 1959 Journal of the Society for Psychical Research, includes no photographs.Several months later, the researchers revised their experiment, changing the venue and adding 'low moans' and, on one occasion, phosphorescent paint. One trial was set in the graveyard right off a main road and clearly in the sight line of drivers in both directions. Here observers hid in the bushes not only to record reactions, but to 'avert traffic accidents' and 'reassure anyone who became hysterical.' But again, not a single person of the hundred-plus who saw the figure thought it was a ghost, including two students from India. ""Although we are superstitious in our country,"" the men told one of the researchers, ""we could see his legs and feet and knew it was a man dressed up in some white garment.""In their final effort, the research team abandoned traditional ghost-appropriate settings and moved the experiment into a movie theater that was screening an X-rated film. The author of the paper, A.D.Cornell, explained that the X rating was chosen to ensure no children were traumatized by the ghost, as though that somehow explained the choice of a porn theater as a setting for a ghost experiment. This time the 'ghost' walked slowly across the screen during a trailer. The phosphorescence was not used this time, and presumably low moans were deemed redundant. No mention is made of the specific images showing on the screen behind the ghost, but clearly they were a good deal more interesting: The audience was polled after the film, and forty-six percent of them didn't notice the man in the sheet. Among those who did, not one thought he'd seen a ghost. (One man said he'd seen a polar bear.)"
25,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2539412-ashvin,1,"Ugh, holy shit did Mary Roach drop the ball on this one. ""Spook"" reads like a terrible first draft. I didn't finish it.I read ""Stiff"" and ""Bonk,"" two of her other books. They were entertaining, informative, and light. ""Spook"" was just horrible. She didn't bother to come up with a real story for the book, so she resorted to the lazy device of describing her own experiences in chronological order (as if those experiences were the story). While uninspired, that would be OK if her experiences were interesting. They were not. She also inserted some pathetic attempts at humor here and there. These attempts reminded me of when I'm forced to hang out with someone I don't know well (like at a conference) and the other person tries to be funny by pointing out what he thinks are negative things in the our immediate environment... except they're not negative, they're just different, and he's not being funny anyway. Here's what I think happened: the deadline for this book was coming up, after doing a little research, Roach realized that what she had wasn't all that great, she didn't feel like putting in any work, so she half-heartedly threw some crap together a said, ""Good enough."" Oh, and her editor was drunk.As I read this book, I felt like I sometimes feel when I skim over some terrible sports column: ""Some asshole got paid to write this piece of shit? And some other asshole OK'd it? What the fuck?""Anyway, as I mentioned, I liked Roach's previous books. I appreciate books on science that are written for the general public. However, as for ""Spook:"" don't even bother. "

The subject is very hard for science to pin down - and while she doesn't come right out and say there's no afterlife, she also doesn't find any proof. I wanted more stories and anecdotes, which doesn't match the whole ""science"" thing. I enjoyed Grunt much more. I've a couple of her other books on my shelf so I'm sure to read more. Stiff looks particularly interesting ;)"

I think this is the fourth I've read, and I'm starting to get the same feel from many of them, and it is this: she finds interesting stories, but she doesn't do enough with them, just plops them down in front of the reader like her job is done with the anecdote, and without delving more deeply into the issues that really interest me.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

Roach's inability to let a peanut gallery opportunity go by made the tone wearying after awhile, and some sections were long-winded and deathly dull. Maybe it was the subject matter or the way she presented it, but at any rate, it was just ok in the end. 2.5 stars."
29,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"”The debunkers are probably right, but they’re no fun to visit a graveyard with.”With that one sentence, Mary Roach sums up my whole view of the survival of a soul. She explores reincarnation stories, Victorian spiritualism, and ghost hunting. She attends a workshop to develop her mediumship. In general, she treads the odd pathways that I would if I had the freedom to do so, and she does it with her characteristic humour.I think one of the key things, that gets several mentions in the book, is the role of loss and grief in starting people on the path looking for spiritual survival of death. When my parents were killed in a car accident twenty years ago, I had dreams of them that were so realistic that I almost believed that I was communicating with them again. The longing was so strong (and still often is so strong) that I truly wish that I could somehow reach out to them one more time.One of my sisters twisted my arm until we visited a local clairvoyant, who I must say provided a very comforting experience. But I left that session feeling like my emotional self (that wanted to believe desperately) and my intellectual self (that analyzed the session and decided that my sister & I provided most of the information) were definitely in dissonance. It was an interesting experience and I don’t regret it, but I also don’t think I will ever repeat it.Perhaps not as much fun as other Mary Roach books that I’ve read, but still an enjoyable way to spend some time."

Mary Roach delivers once again, leading us on an insightful and hilarious voyage of discovery - this time into the world of paranormal research, mediumship, and the search for proof of the afterlife. Along the way we encounter the earliest theories of the human soul's location, attempts to determine its weight, spiritualists who produced ectoplasm, modern researchers with various levels of scientific rigor, and even a legal case resting on ghost's testimony. Mary Roach goes so far as to sign up for a class in order to become a medium herself. It's a whole lot of fun."

32,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26491898-victoria-tu,3,"Mary Roach's Spook tells the story of her research on the afterlife, a mystery that many are more than eager to learn about. The book consists of her quest to search for answers to her questions which cause her to look through various books, explore ideas from the past and travel to different locations in the world, bringing us readers along for the ride. This book doesn't have a set conflict or problem, but rather tells a story of a curious woman who hunts for evidence in an attempt to prove or disprove the existence of the afterlife before marking herself down as a believer or a nonbeliever. To do this, Roach follows researchers and enrolls in an English medium school to study the possibility of life after death, an idea that she herself is doubtful about. The book is simply a collection of her experiences and possible evidence that may be used to support or reject the idea of an afterlife, which may provide a different perspective to our own. In one memorable event, Roach visits Bangalore, India, where she meets up with Dr. Rawat, a reincarnation research. She follows him on a case where a young boy, Aishwary, is believed to be the reincarnation of a man named Veerpal, a factory worker who lived a few villages away from Aishwary's family. Roach and Dr. Rawat interview Veerpal and Aishwary's families in hopes of finding proof that supports the claim. Aishwary seems to be able to recognize Veerpal's family members, but in rural India, where claims of reincarnation flourish, it is hard to tell whether Aishwary really recognized Veerpal's family or if he heard this information from the adults who firmly believe in the existence of the afterlife. However, what made this scene so memorable to me was not how Aishwary was able to recognize Veerpal's family, but how, for a split second, I thought that reincarnation was possible. This is where I decided that this book would be a worthwhile read. I didn't want to read about what I already believed in; I wanted a story that would show me different perspectives, something that would give me something to think about and fuel the desire to keep reading on. This scene did just that. Ultimately, the story of the quest to solve the mystery of the afterlife brings the readers on a trip with the author, traveling from place to place, enrolling in English medium schools, being electromagnetically haunted, and attempting to weigh a soul, all for the purpose of finding out what happens as we die and after we die. It all adds up to a tale of a scientific adventure, one that relies on brain power and creativity, rather than a strong physique and strength. Spook tells that story very entertainingly, providing us with evidence and insight that will either change our strengthen our beliefs of the afterlife.For me, learning about the afterlife is not something that would ignite feelings. However, parts of this book did pique my interest, and it is because of this that I could continue reading. If nothing interested me, I would have put this book down and moved on, without a second thought. However, through this book, I learned a lot about past experiments. Spook is sort of like a science book--the author gives us background information of the sciences who conduct the experiments and their motives for doing so, and then lead us through the process. I like to categorize the books I read, or try to read, into three categories: books that I cannot bear to continue reading, books that I read once and never touch again, and books that I will never get bored of. Spook, for me, goes into the second category. Although it was a fun read, I wouldn't come back and reread this book. Perhaps it would be different for people who enjoy reading about science, but for those who prefer action-packed stories, I would only recommend reading this book if you are seriously interested in finding out more about the afterlife. "
33,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"Not as good as the author's previous work, Stiff, but still entertaining.This book would be more accurately named ""Mary Roach Tackles the Afterlife"", as it's an account of her personal search for proof of life after death. If you like Roach's writing and her sense of humor, you'll probably enjoy the book. She does have a tendency to include amusing yet irrelevant anecdotes about the people and places she encounters during her research.Part of the book is concerned with the historical efforts to seek proof of an afterlife. She covers both serious scientific experiments, such as those designed to view and weigh the human soul, and fraudulent efforts, such as the antics of 19th-century mediums who rocked seance tables and regurgitated ectoplasm.Roach also experiments herself, attending classes on how to become a medium and accompanying modern ghost hunters on excursions to famously haunted locations. When confronted with a roomful of people who believe they can contact the spirits of the dead, Roach is not persuaded that the phenomenon is real, yet she seems to feel bewildered and lonely rather than contemptuous. She's appropriately intrigued by the occasional spooky anecdote. Like many skeptics, it's not that she doesn't want to believe in the paranormal, it's that she cannot ignore the total absence of hard evidence.As a skeptic myself, I was gratified that she remains unconvinced by the shaky evidence she uncovered yet frustrated that she does not actually dismiss any of the crazy methodology which left her so unsatisfied. (Except the ectoplasm fad, which is a pretty safe subject to mock.) I think a believer would be gratified and frustrated at opposite points."
34,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1271545-david,2,"Mary Roach is smart and funny, which made this a mostly entertaining read. But I don't really feel like she had anything to say. It was more of an exploration of kooky metaphysical or pseudoscientific people throughout history, most of whom were full of shit. Each chapter is connected to the next by one paragraph of half-assed segue, and there is no apparent reason for her chapter order. At the end, she seemed to realize she needed an overall theme for the book, so she used the last few pages to say, (SPOILER ALERT) ""Since no one knows if there's really an afterlife and it's fun to believe, why not believe?"" This is a fine point of view and everything, but it's not one you need a few hundred pages to support. I'm not especially interested in afterlife/psychic literature, which is partially why this didn't do anything for me. But I am of the opinion that a good writer should be able to make a subject interesting to anyone (two writers who didn't disappoint in this respect are Carl Sagan and David McCullough). I may read Stiff or Bonk at some point in the future as I've heard better things about them, but I'm in no hurry. "
35,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13614926-caidyn-he-him-his,3,"Joint review with Chantel will be up at some point!I have to say, I didn’t like this one as much as I liked the other ones I’ve read by her. Last year, we read Bonk together, which was looking at some of the wacky research people have done about sex. Then, last year, I read Stiff on my own, which is a look into the life of a cadaver. This one didn’t quite measure up to those.My main problem with the book was that it meandered too much. It tried to touch on all these things that had to do with the “afterlife” but they didn’t seem to fit together well. One chapter on reincarnation. Nothing really on research into heaven besides near death experiences. There was lots about mediums and spiritualists, huge movements in the world that really influenced it. But, it didn’t seem to make sense or add into an afterlife very well since those movements and the people involved have been largely debunked.So, while I laughed and chuckled and learned some new stuff, this book just didn’t impress me like I had hoped it would."
36,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4413597-praxedes,3,"Roach's insatiable curiosity is so compelling that one tends to forgive her hit-or-miss attempts at humor. I enjoy the methodical nature of her approach, exploring techniques used over the years to prove an afterlife (seances, infrasound, EVPs, etc.). I also like her honesty as she evaluates each one: it's almost as if she wants to believe in an afterlife but cannot overlook the lack of hard evidence.When she includes a clever footnote her humor works well, but inserting witticisms in the middle of a serious passage is distracting. She did the same in her first book, Stiff, with similar results. But if you are curious about this topic this book is a great place to begin."

Mary Roach writes with humor and treats (most of) her subjects with respect even when they are vomiting doilies onto the seance table. 
39,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,1,"This is one of those books where I have alotalot to say about the author’s perspective, because philosophy of science is one of my very favourite things to think about and something I consider so important in the current scientific and philosophical climate that it can’t be overstated, but I’ll try to keep it short because, really, this is not a hugely important book in any field. Worth reading though? Really depends. I had a phase (as all good Catholic schoolgirls do) where I had this adorably simplistic interest in the soul, the afterlife, the occult, etc. In fact there was a point at which my dearest wish was to study parapsychology at the University of Edinburgh (they offer PhDs, by the way). Forgive me, I knew not what I did. Anyway. My point is, most of this book was old information. Also, and most importantly because this is Mary Roach’s strongest selling point, it wasn’t really that funny. Mostly reads like a very long Wikipedia article. Except worse? Because there was some heavy xenophobia in the first few chapters, and near the end some mean-spirited digs and mocking of what Mary too clearly views as “those uneducated hicks down in their country home with their gingham and corn who don’t know science like us educated folks do. Wish I were so simple and homespun as to be satisfied with that!” Sooo… I really kind of want to sit down with Mary and discuss the absurdity of the cult of progress, and also to have a chat about how very, very similar religion and science are in ideology, practice, and self-affirmation. And I would really like to know her thoughts on, say, Feyerabend, or Kuhn, or anyone who has thought long and hard about what “proving” something within a system that validates its conclusions from within its own internal framework really means (and if, in fact, that’s not more or less what religion and superstition does, just with a different systematic framework- is it really proof if the methods used to demonstrate it are part of the network that the hypothesis fits into?). And I kind of want to laugh at her for laughing at people who don’t critically analyze their beliefs, because like, hi, irony. Basically, if you loved Stiff and are coming for more of the same, I’d avoid. If you’re looking for a basic summary of research in the afterlife (primarily historical), it may be useful. Good points: I did learn that ectoplasm was at one time thought to come from the vagina (pretty sure that’s called squirting, guys) so that’s something. Oh yeah, and there’s a whole chapter on my friend’s current psych professor which was interesting.I sort of feel bad giving this book one star, because it's not a horrible book, it by no means deserves a spot on my books-to-burn shelf, but for me, 3 stars is ""I liked it, might not read again but I did like it"" and 2 stars is ""not for me, did not like, but I can see the merit in it for other people, we just didn't connect"" and 1 star is ""not for me, don't see why anyone else would love it either."" So that's this. It's just a book. I dunno. I don't feel too bad because I gave her other book, Stiff, a well-deserved 5 stars. "
40,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,3,"Despite the subtitle, I found this book to be light on both science and the afterlife. There is some actual science in here—including trying to quantify near-death experiences, infrasound as the cause of hauntings, and pointing electromagnets at the brain to induce the feeling of being watched—and I enjoyed those parts the most, but a lot of this stuff was tackled with just plain common sense, like the six or seven chapters (I exaggerate...a little) on mediums. They weren't debunked by science; they were debunked by turning the lights on, and not letting them wiggle the table with their feet.The afterlife part deals more with the soul (its weight, its reincarnation) than any actual ghosts, which is really what I was interested in. A good portion of the book is dedicated to mediums and their various fakeries, including ectoplasm (cheesecloth, or less often: sheep's guts), than the spirits themselves. Roach even goes to a weekend seminar on how to be a medium, a pretty worthless chapter, really, as you don't learn anything you couldn't learn from an episode of The Mentalist and neither does the author. I feel like the content was hit or miss, with some chapters feeling like a page out of Roach's travel diary rather than an attempt to get across a substantial idea. And then she pulls a trick where she says she's observing a patient participating in a scientific study, only to later confess—in a footnote, no less—that she wasn't allowed to be present for that study, so this is just some random dude who is undergoing a similar procedure, with no near-death experience protocol whatsoever. There was no reason to mislead the reader about that; it wasn't a critical part of the book, and that kind of deception harms her credibility.I've never fully trusted Roach after Bonk in which she wants to touch the penis of an unconscious man undergoing a surgical procedure (aka ""sexual assault""), and she shows similar poor judgment here in some of her word choices (""lame"" used as a pejorative, ""disadvantaged"" of the mentally ill and developmentally disabled/delayed), as well as an unnecessary reference to Woody Allen, a man whose very name needs a trigger warning, even if you're only referring to his films.Anyway, now I want a book about ghosts. Anyone have recs for any good ghosty nonfiction?"
41,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4310312-cloak88,4,"Is there a soul? -- Mary Roach 3.5 starsMary Roach goes at it again. This time she tries to find out what happens with your soul after death. Basicly she tries to find out if there is such a thing as a soul and how would you observe, measure and quantify it. How would reincarnation work and how do you prove it. Meanwhile she unearths a lot of interesting information and shines a light on past and present research on the hereafter. Science with ghost and humour. "
42,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1211806-ariel,5,"In typical Mary Roach style, this book kicks a lot of ass.If you've read a Mary Roach book before, you know what you are getting into. A lot of humor, facts presented in a way that is both interesting and educational (and very far from boring), and no desire to cut out what some people deem ""the icky stuff."" If you haven't read a Mary Roach book before, buckle up, you're going to have some fun.Spook does exactly what the subtitle suggests: looks at the afterlife through the lense of science. If you are a deeply religious person, this book may not be for you. She says straight up she is not a God person, and God plays no part in how she will start researching the afterlife. She is a science person. I went into this book with little expectation other than a) I've read a few other of her titles so I know how great she is, and b) I was hoping there would be ghosts involved. Because hello, afterlife. I was not disappointed on either account. However, this book is not the science of ghosts. (Which, okay, maybe I was hoping it would be.) She deals with many different scientific endeavors on the afterlife that have occurred throughout history, as well as different beliefs and customs that occur all across the globe today. Every time I read a Mary Roach book, I come away with not only a deeper understanding of the topic at hand, but all these fun anecdotes I can spout off at parties, and this book only broadened that pool of knowledge. She deals with the subject of death and dying in a respectful but humorous way, and I appreciate the positivity she brings to what is otherwise kind of a downer.If you are looking for a good intro into nonfiction in general, or into her work, this is a nice place to start."
43,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35789244-paul,4,"Mary Roach is the funniest science writer ever. She's worth reading just for the humor. An example: man gives a vial of semen with gonorrhea to a researcher. Her comment: ""Hey, thanks!""Roach does a great job puncturing various afterlife frauds and naive believers. She goes to India to research reincarnation, which is hilarious, debunks the spiritualists of yore who swore ectoplasm came out of their noses and created little spiritual hands. She finds the evidence unconvincing through most of the book, but she happens in the last chapter to follow a scientist who is trying to see if there is a soul independent of the body by putting computer screens with bright pictures on them just under the ceilings of operating chambers to test the accuracy of all the people who almost die and then see themselves from the ceiling looking down on their body. If they come back and say they've seen the screens, it's a yes. Eben Alexander writes of a similar experiment in Proof of Heaven (great book), except his researchers are putting lurid tabloid front pages that you couldn't miss if you were floating near the ceiling. No results have been reported yet from Alexander's experiment nor the one that Roach describes. She ends up leaning in favor of an afterlife, just based, I guess, on her intuition.Fun book!"
44,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4026072-kim,2,"This is the third of Mary Roach's scientific exploratory books I've read and feels the weakest so far. In this book Mary tackles the idea of after-life but from a scientific angle. For me one of the issues I have with this book, and it shows in her other books, is she never really engages the people she's talking to. Sure there will be quotes and little anecdotes but never any real discussion. It always leaves me wanting to know more but then she moves on to the next subject. The part of the book I found most interesting wasn't even about the after-life, instead it was about a handwriting analyst comparing old wills. Yeah it wasn't the most exciting of books. I was happy to see the end of it. I do have her latest book which I've heard is much better but don't expect me to pick it up in any hurry."
45,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,4," A most entertaining book by Mary Roach, who has become well-known for her investigations into various topics. In this 2005 book, she investigates the afterlife. A serious subject to be sure but she does it with a light spirit and always with a skeptical mind. She looks into mediums- and ectoplasm, and ghosts, and telecommunicating, and what many people feel makes the most persuasive case for life after death--NDEs ( near-death experiences). And she travels to India to look into reincarnation, which I thought was the most fascinating aspect of her investigation. Along the way, Ms. Roach encounters a wide variety of believers--or you might term them oddballs. And she herself becomes one of the most entertaining characters of all in her story... Does she find a solution? NO SPOILERS here, but what do you think???"
46,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1140743-jason,4,"Coming from a religious background I was curious about whether or not Roach would tackle this topic from that perspective. She actually didn't dwell on the spiritual aspects of death much at all. Rather she painstakingly researched the weight of a soul, examples of alleged near death experiences, reincarnation, etc. I LOVE the fact that Mary Roach makes science and learning fun. She can be super irreverent at times and loves scatalogical humor and other grade-school antics that brings a bit of levity to such heavy topics. I also appreciate that she avoids making assumptions in her work. She does a good job of remaining professional and letting the science speak for itself. If you're interested in what may happen to you after you die, don't miss this book."
47,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1595477-jz,4,"Mary Roach writes about the every day things that we don't even think about most of the time, because they're just life. Or death. Or what comes in between. Sex, eating, war, death, and now, what comes after all that, and how people have coped with thinking of what's next. The whole book is wonderful, but the section on spiritualists and their debunkers is priceless. The whole thing about the sheep's omentum, and the woman who gave birth to rabbits held me spellbound. It's a wild ride, as usual with Mary. I love how her mind works. This is possibly even better than Stiff, which has been my favorite of her works until now. I may even give this another listen before I send it back to my beloved library."
48,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/129343-charity,3,"I thoroughly enjoyed Mary Roach's sarcasm throughout the book. Frankly, I applaud Roach's restraint on that front. I would not have been able to keep my eyes rolling out of my head while researching/witnessing most of the events detailed in the book. Alas, I ended up giving Spook 3 stars, as there are only so many paranormal experiences/experiments a skeptic can read about before growing weary and a bit bored. And the last sentence of the book left me exasperated. Really, Mary? Really??"

Although I wish I did read STIFF instead, so maybe it was a Freudian slip.)DNF @ 36%I still love Mary Roach's writing, but even she can't make me care about pseudoscience -- which, going into a book like this, I pretty much anticipated it being Not For Me. I might check out some of the later chapters, but I'm not feeling a great need to finish this, despite my wanting to read all of Mary Roach's books. (Oh well.. I tried!)"

There were so many places in this book that I just had to set it down and laugh out loud. This book involves mediums, ghosts, life after death, near death experiences, and the afterlife. Just hilarious! And quite amazing what normally intelligent people were spiritualists. I can't wait for her next book!"
51,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23935950-waverly-fitzgerald,4,"This is humorous look at various scientific attempts to prove that there is an afterlife. Mary Roach has a tongue-in-cheek, skeptical attitude that really brightens up the somewhat strange and serious topics she chooses to write about (her previous book, Stiff, was about ""the curious life of human cadavers."" I was surprised at the end to read that she does believe in ghosts. And that she's inclined to believe in life after death, perhaps just because it's more interesting than the alternative. I read this book because I'm writing a historical mystery about a Victorian trance medium and so I've been trying to figure out both what my characters and I believe about the afterlife. (I do believe in ghosts, having encountered a few, but I have no desire to hang out with ghosts.) Here are some of the things I found interesting:various metaphors to describe the spirit(soul) from Aristotle (pneuma=wind) to metaphors used to describe the way the spirit acts upon the body including Descartes (it plays on the nerves like an organ, the musical instrument), Galen (it moves like the heating system of a Roman bathhouse), Albertus Magnus (like the distillation of brandy). And she points out that we now often refer to consciousness in terms derived from computer programming as in running out of disk space or multitasking or information overload.Ectoplasm was one of the popular ways to convey the existence of the spirit after death during Victorian and Edwardian seances. It was considered to be a substance extruded from the body of the medium (often from some rather intimate orifices) which could then tap people on the shoulder or levitate tables. Sir William Crooke, the scientist who invented vacuum tubes, was ridiculed for saying the luminous green substance inside those tubes was ectoplasm. Charles Tichet, who won a Nobel for his work on anaphylactic shock also believed in ectoplasm. Most attempts to prove the existence of ectoplasm showed what appeared to be phosphorescent pieces of cloth, or muslin, which were probably secreted in the medium's body cavities. One researcher, Dr. W. J. Crawford, a lecturer in mechanical engineering at Queen's University in Belfast, believed tables were levitated by ectoplasmic cantilevers. He put a bowl of putty under the main support of a table to try to capture the existence of the ecotplasm at a seance presided over by Miss Kathleen Goligher in 1920 and found impressions afterwards that he believed to be created by ectoplasm. But a subsequent researcher, conducting the same experiment, found the imprint of a woman's shoe and then a foot. Shortly after he showed these to Crawford, Crawford drowned himself, possibly out of embarrassment that he had been duped.Roach visits Gary Schwartz who conducts experiments at the University of Arizona where he is a psychology professor. I had read his book about his afterlife experiments. He's associated with several prominent mediums, including Alison DuBois, whose first encounter with a spirit came when a discarnate man walked through her in the laundry room of her apartment building. She went upstairs and told her husband about the encounter, mentioning that she knew the man loved clam chowder and that he had a heart attack"" and her husband, ""That's my grandfather."" Roach also had a startling reading with DuBois. Much of the information was irrelevant or vague, but one was so accurate and so unique (but also trivial--why is it that the spirits so often focus on the trivial)--that her brother collects hourglasses--that Roach was dazzled.Arthur Findlay when he died in 1964 donated his home Stansted Hall to the Spiritualists' National Union and Roach went there to take a class in becoming a medium. She was not successful. She also explored EVP (picking up sounds with sensitive recording equipment in which mysterious voices can be heard). And looking for ghosts in areas of high magnetism. Dr Michael Persinger is a neuroscience professor at Laurentian Unviersity in Toronto who has been trying to induce ghost sightings in people by exposing them to electro-magnetic fields. The theory is that it can cause hallucinations. Roach spent time in the soundproof chamber but didn't see any ghosts though she did hear some sirens. Sir Fulke Greville was killed in London by his disgruntled servant Ralph in 1608 but his ghost drifted back to Warwick Castle where he lived from 1606 to 1608.The Chaffin case in 1925 where a ghost supposedly revealed the place where a subsequent will was written which was later shown to be a forgery. Songs associated with seances ""Lead Kindly Light"" and 'There's a Land.""Jay Mandel is her agent. Jill Bialosky was her editor at Norton. "

""She begins the journey in rural India with a reincarnation researcher and ends up in a University of Virginia operating room where cardiologists have installed equipment near the ceiling to study out-of-body near-death experiences. Along the way, she enrolls in an English medium school, gets electromagnetically haunted at a university in Ontario, and visits a Duke University professor with a plan to weigh the consciousness of a leech."" (source)I don't have a whole lot that's new to say about Mary Roach with this particular book. It was my favorite of her books that I've read other than Stiff and was her second book published, also after Stiff. The sense of humor was very similar and made me laugh out loud frequently, especially the footnotes. The only time the humor didn't work for me was when it was in relation to horrible experiments done on animals, when it felt inappropriate and jarring. I do think that if this was the first book of Mary Roach's that I'd read I might have given it five stars. Her sense of humor and engaging writing style are pretty unique, but after reading much of her backlist, it's what I expect instead of an exciting surprise.Even before I checked, I thought this might have been one of Roach's earlier books. That's because she began by talking a bit about her reliance on science to provide accurate answers, answers to big questions like what happens after we die. I enjoyed this opportunity to learn more about how she thinks about science. If you've read some of her newer books and liked her sense of humor, I'd definitely recommend checking out both Spook and Stiff. If you've not yet read anything by Mary Roach and aren't too squeamish, I'd probably recommend starting with Stiff, but this book wouldn't be a bad place to start either.This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"
53,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816875-jordan-lynch,3,"Spook is a very interesting read. Unfortunately, it's also a somewhat off-putting read as well.I loved Mary Roach's Stiff, so I was rather intrigued to see how she tackled the existence (or lack thereof) of the afterlife. It's clear that Roach once again did her due diligence; there's a plethora of both personal and researched stories, all full of interesting facts and plenty of things to think about, and the experiments she relates are ones that have both remained in society's memory and ones that have been all but forgotten, mercifully in some cases.I now know more than I ever wanted to know about ectoplasm and its 'mysterious' origins. Frankly, if I never hear the word 'ectoplasm' again, it will be too soon.But despite being interesting, there was almost too much information at times. I'm usually all for footnotes, but the footnotes Roach provides were usually used to provide information that didn't necessarily relate to the experiment at hand; while I would normally find that interesting, the fact that this happened repeatedly bogged down the writing. Furthermore, the footnotes were often used to poke fun at the person or the topic or the experimental method. In fact, the tone of the book in general didn't sit well with me. I realize that a lot of this science seems absolutely ridiculous now--and even 'then' in many instances--but science almost always seems silly until it works. Some of the jokes or puns were actually funny, but I eventually reached a point where I was just annoyed with Roach's sarcasm and mockery. Perhaps Roach was using the jokes as a form of levity for such a heavy topic, but I feel it just shows that she failed to truly keep an open mind about the topic. Her commentary makes it clear that she refuses to let her skepticism be loosened even the tiniest bit, and while I can't really fault her for sticking to her guns, there's a way to respectfully disagree with others that Roach fails to apply here. I can't say that I believe in ghosts, and I think psychics and the like are charlatans, but I don't feel the need to ridicule those who feel otherwise like Roach does.All in all, Spook tackles an intriguing topic and presents a lot of interesting science. If you can get past Roach's snark and obvious disbelief, you might actually learn something. However, there are probably better books on the topic if you find yourself interested in the various theories of the fate of the soul."
54,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17878620-margaretdh,2,"This is written in the same style as other Mary Roach books that I have enjoyed, but this one just didn't do it for me. I think there are three main reasons:1. This book is light on the science, mostly because there isn't very much of it. A lot of the science parts seemed stretched into something larger than they needed to be, and I found myself skimming.2. Roach spends a lot of time investigating pseudoscience, and I just don't care about that. Maybe if I had picked up the book because I wanted to read about pseudoscience, it would have been different. But because pseudoscience isn't a real thing, I read pages and pages about what felt like nothing. Also, if you're familiar with medical history, there's a lot of repeats here. For example, you might already know about Mary Toft, the woman who tricked doctors into believing that she was giving birth to rabbits.3. Despite the fact that I don't believe in ghosts, spiritualism or pseudoscience, a lot of people do. And Roach spends a lot of time mocking the people who believe in this stuff. And something about her tone and approach just didn't sit right with me. I don't believe that people can read palms or talk to the dead, and I think it's silly at best, defrauding the gullible at worst, but seeking those people out just to make fun of them seems... petty. And kind of bullying.So, I might still pick up another Roach book, but I'll be a lot more thoughtful about the topic in the future."
55,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7620837-frank,3,"I have read a couple of Roach's other books including Bonk, a funny and in depth look at sex and science, and My Planet, a really humorous look at Roach's everyday experiences that I enjoyed very much. I also have some others on my to-read shelf including Stiff that I've heard a lot of good things about. I was kind of mixed on Spook, Roach's look at whether there is any scientific proof to show that there is life after life. She looks at things as diverse as reincarnation to scientists trying to weigh the soul at the moment of death. She also delves into near death experiences, mediums and the popularity of spiritualism in the early 20th century, and the use of scientific equipment such as tape recorders and other tools to try to capture or measure the presence of spirits. Of course Roach threw in a lot of humor in her discussions and some of her footnotes were priceless. But overall, I found the book to be rather ponderous and dry especially in some of the purported scientific methods used in these studies. I will be reading more of her books based on other reviews and hopefully I will enjoy them a tad more than this one."
56,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/909198-mary,5,"Binge read. Mary Roach is a fun writer and sprinkles her wit throughout her recounting of her investigations into whether there is life after death. Things we have all wondered about are explored in her work: ghosts, mediums, reincarnation, near death experiences, and psychics. She interviews the experts in the various fields and reads their works some of which involve pretty complicated science and math with she honestly admits is over her head. She also witnesses experiments and visits reportedly haunted places. It make me feels good to know that some fine minds are out there exploring this area of science that gets little respect from traditional academia. Of course, I am not going to give away any spoilers of her conclusions in my review. I don’t want you to miss out on Roach’s experiences and humor. Very entertaining and informative reading.I hope there is an afterlife, and I am intrigued by the concept of reincarnation-keep coming back till you get it right. I like the idea that the way I live my current life will present me with challenges in my next life to improve myself.

It was a bad reading month where all I read was Harry Potter. However, I’m not too upset about not finishing Spook because it was a struggle for me to get through. I really enjoyed Bonk by Mary Roach and honestly, I look forward to reading more of her books based on that book. I think the issue here was the topic and I think for me, that’s ultimately why I couldn’t get into it.I only read a few chapters but that was about fifty pages or so. The first chapter was about reincarnation which is a subject I find interesting, but nothing in the chapter was interesting to me. I found the chapter about the history of souls and the methods of trying to detect souls far more interesting.This book’s subtitle is “Science Tackles the Afterlife” but death and the afterlife are two things that are impossible to prove with science. Science and afterlife, don’t mesh. For me, that was the main issue with the book. Roach could only speculate about the evidence that was presented to her and even then she was skeptical because it could easily be explained for one reason or another. There is nothing concrete about what happens after death and while I think what Roach did was ambitious, it didn’t work for me. "

The author's premise truly captured my attention, but as soon as I started reading I felt annoyed by her tone and her (at times inappropriate) sense of humor. Apart from the chapter where she exposes fraudulent mediums from the Victorian Age, the essay feels as if written just to fill in pages: we can see the author bragging about entering the super exclusive library in Cambridge, being disrespectful to the Indians and generally feeling superior to what she is writing about, which that is simply an unacceptable thing for any writer to do.

66,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,3,"In Roach's ongoing examination of many scientific areas of interest, she chooses next to tackle the afterlife. Having already examined the life of corpses and the dead body, this seems like a segue worth embarking upon, even if its science is less concrete and more... belief-centric. Roach's explorations took her from the concrete studies of the human soul (and its associated weight) as it departs at the time of death to the more absurd exploration of mediums who seek to make a connection with the departed. Her explorations span 4 centuries and are chalk full of scientific studies and journal articles, as well as the deeply intrinsic religious values of reincarnation amongst Hindus. Perhaps one of her most interesting exploratory areas would have to be the near-death experiences had by people, including the out of body experiences some feel they have had. Roach tackles these, any other areas of interest to her, making her numerous points on the afterlife, which works well with some of her other work.After reading this, my third Roach book, I was not as impressed with the content or the acerbic wit she usually presents. Perhaps it is the collection of topics or it could be the collection of people she's interviewed or studied, but something was lacking in this tome that left me less driven to move forward and more as though I was simply passing through this series of topics. The afterlife need not be a dry topic, nor does it need to be free from humour, but Roach chooses more of an education spin on the content than her mocking and joke-filled narrative. That aside, she does a great job offering a plethora of topics under the umbrella of the afterlife, using both science and the supernatural to show the multi-faceted approaches that people have to life after death.Kudos, Madam Roach for this insightful book, filled with your own charm and unique angle."
67,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3238610-mark-juric,3,"I have a crush on Mary Roach. Seriously. A for real, honest-to-god, schoolboy crush. When I read her books, I find myself flipping to the author's page to look at her picture. She makes me laugh at things I shouldn't laugh at, and I like her for it. I imagine us huddled together in the corner of some austere laboratory or solemn place of worship, covering our mouths and trying to stifle an inappropriate giggle. My crush started with ""Bonk"". Here was a woman who devoted two years of her life to poking and prodding the squickiest, messiest, most intimate, most potentially embarrassing subject possible - and she did it in such a non-judgmental, openly curious way, it was as if she'd decided to order anchovies on her pizza instead of watching Scandinavian farmers massage a pig's clitoris to increase fertility.Mary Roach brings the same humor and openness to ""Spook"", and yet, something is missing. The book feels disorganized and a little unsatisfying. Sex is sex is sex: I know it when I see it. Yet ""Spook"" wanders around, poking at reincarnation; prodding at seances; and examining near-death, brain-death, after-death, and charlatanism as if they're all sides of the same coin. Outside of a Clintonian level of equivocation, sex is always sex. But as Ms. Roach points out toward the end of ""Spook"", interpreting the very little data that purports to espouse an afterlife boils down to belief: is it science or is it mystery? Once you remove the hucksters, the con artists, the believers, and the downright criminal from this book, sadly, there's not much left to sway you either way."
68,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,3,"Ok to be fair I really liked this authors writing style. I like her train of thought, I like her humor, I like her immensely and this is the only thing of hers that I have ever read. But as a book? This was not at all what I was looking for. Were I to probe into that great question of what is there in the hereafter from a ""scientific approach"" the last thing I would do is go chase down mediums and stories on reincarnation. I found that both demeaning to science and utterly a waste of time. There are better approaches in journals such as Nature. What about the brain? Wouldn't that be a good place to start? There are studies on the brain showing that the last few minuets before death become as an eternity to the dying and that neural pathways are opened up to allow information exchanged in those moments that were not used prior to. What about going down that sort of route? What about actual science? Are we so desperate to explain it all that we have to look down spook alley? No no no she has to go play ghost catcher with a bunch of crazy people. Unfortunately for the author I take the idea of death very seriously and despite the fact that I can get a joke on occasion it just didn't blend well with the subject matter for me. I really want to know what happens after you die and this book gave no answers only crazy stories that even the author admitted she didn't buy into. Well if you don't buy into it then you are looking in the wrong place! "
69,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,4,"Mary Roach looks at the afterlife through the eyes of science, both past & present. It's a tough subject to pin down, as she shows in her typically thorough & funny way. If you read this looking for what actually does happen after you die, you've picked up the wrong book. She says that in her introduction. Yes, she was trying to find out. She interviewed dozens of scientists, read up on more & even went on outings or classes with a few paranormal clubs. The upshot is, no one reliably knows. But her explorations & the facts she turned up makes a wonderful read.Her research seems pretty exhaustive to me. I don't know much about the subject nor do I have a lot of interest. I confess, I bought the book because I enjoy her writing. She has a quirky sense of humor, but doesn't over power me with it. Just flashes it to lighten what could otherwise be a boring subject. How many people want to read about someone going to medium school, after all? Well she did & made it interesting.I can't wait to read her next book ""Bonk - the curious coupling of sex & science"". After having several kids, I probably know all I need to about sex, but the trip with her should be interesting!"
70,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"I don't think I'm the greatest fan of Mary Roach's style. It's informal, easy to read, self-deprecating -- but when it comes to a topic like this, I don't want to hear all about Mary Roach unless it really illuminates the subject matter. Granted, stuff like near-death experiences and the various ideas of what happens to us after we die are things I've been interested in for a long time, and don't really need an entry-level primer on. (I had to memorise the stages of an NDE as described by Kenneth Ring for my religious studies A Level.)Still, where this deals with facts instead of impressions, it's interesting stuff. A couple of the studies and anecdotes were familiar to me from what I already knew: I still find the case of the woman who saw the surgical tools being used on her despite having her eyes taped shut an interesting one. (It's convincing because it wasn't a typical tool, not something she'd have come across elsewhere, and she didn't see the instruments before or after her operation.)Overall, this probably isn't going to convince you either way, if that's what you're looking for, but it's certainly got some interesting snippets of information."
71,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3771119-julie,4,"I gave this book a go, but put it down after the first few chapters failed to grab my attention. Then I picked it up again several months later, skipped over some of the old-school science chapters (like How to Weigh a Soul) and was thoroughly entertained throughout the rest of the book. Not quite as sharp and witty as Stiff, it was still a great book and Roach knows how to do her research and present it in a fun and engaging way. The final two chapters were definitely the best and most captivating. Her momentum kept building as the book approached its conclusion. I would have enjoyed it a bit more had it maintained that level throughout, but instead I was disinterested in the very first chapter on reincarnation and was daunted by the few proceeding it. Over all, it was well worth it for the read for the last half of the book, and I know I’ll be interested in the next morbid topic Roach decides to tackle for her next book."
72,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/131590-adrian-fradnle,4,"By the Mary Roach, the same author that managed to deftly maneuver the (st)icky subject of what happens to cadavers (in the book  Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers) with unexpected grace and humor tackles another delicate topic: the afterlife. She analyzes a hodgepodge of different beliefs about what happens when we shed our mortal coil with the scrutiny (and footnotes) of a meticulous scientist. The twist, however, is that Ms. Roach proves that ""straight science"" is a slippery slope through her dissection of disciplines like Parapsychology, mediumship and even quantum physics where all show the line between ""belief"" and ""proof"" is ghostly thin. Moreover, she manages all this with quirk and humor of a hilarious mad scientist.Oh, and there's a chapter on how people used to pull ""ectoplasm"" and other spooky material out of their nether-regions - fascinating read!"
73,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2409670-gofita,2,"Interesting information in this one, but I didn't like Mary Roach. She didn't seem honest to me. Most of her chapters contain her making fun of those she's interviewing or the ideas themselves...and yet somehow at the end she says she just doesn't know...even though the whole time she's clearly stating she doesn't believe any of it. Sigh. And I don't think her research was done very well. I've read a few other books with some of these case studies and I know that the info presented just didn't contain all it could have. I really went into this one wanting to love it. I enjoyed her most recent book Packing for Mars but this one was just lame. Bad form on her part. I just felt she was pandering and wavering due to the sensitive nature of the topic to many people. To me that's just dishonest journalism."
74,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3029844-michelle,5,"I am completely biased toward any Mary Roach book, I admit it. I love the way she brings science to an understandable level while keeping her dry humor. The subjects that she tackles are often not easily explained by science, but she gives it her all to come to some sort of a conclusion or at least to give the readers something to think about. This book was no different. How do you measure a soul? How do you scientifically know that there is something beyond death? Roach studies the past, looks into other religions, travels to various countries and sits in on a surgery all to find answers to her questions. This was an interesting, easy read that kept me coming back for more.Roach is a wonderful writer and a very thorough researcher. She is willing to go to great lengths and if necessary make a fool out of herself in the process. I can't wait to find my next book by her."
75,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50231391-aneeza,1,"I've always been interested in the paranormal and I was hoping the author would have a systematic and methodical approach to the subject, giving the readers an insight into the research done on the afterlife. The book starts with the author traveling in India to investigate reincarnation claims. The author's approach to the Hindu religion and Indian culture was condescending and borderline offensive. The chapter about seances in the Victorian era was interesting but incredibly boring and repetitive. The last chapters regarding ghost investigations, infrared sounds, and near-death experiences were quite interesting and were the only saving grace of this book. I was hoping for an objective and unbiased approach to the afterlife, instead, this book was peppered with the author's cynicism and demeaning attitude towards anyone who believes in life after death."
76,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95099-jenn-pellerin,4,"This book made me realize that, while hearing about old-timey ghosts and messages from beyond the grave is fun for a while, what really gets my motor running is electromagnetic fields and hallucinations. I feel like the last couple chapters were total payoff, but I'm sure there's a lot of people who won't agree. I appreciate Mary Roach because she seems to have my sense of humor (ie. that of a 12 year old boy) and that's just fine with me. Some people won't appreciate her footnotes about the excellence of the name ""Clara Butt"", or how she heard ""dairy area"" as ""derriere"". But I, for one, am feeling a deep deep connection. The anecdote about the Cambridge University ""ghost"" study in the 50's made me snort like an idiot. "
77,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/667234-james,5,"Just great, as usual from Mary Roach. She is to science, and often observations about contemporary life in general, what Sarah Vowell is to history (and often contemporary life in general.) They share a gift of finding just the right tone in writing about sometimes-touchy subjects; serious without being solemn or pompous, irreverent without being mean, poignant without being mawkish. And like Vowell, Mary Roach is an author whose books I'll get without hesitation because I know they'll be good. My wife and I read Stiff together and are now reading Spook (I'd already finished it, but it's as entertaining the second time through as the first.) This is a writer I would love to have over to dinner."
78,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6039263-leslie-nienaber,2,"I've never read a book with so many footnotes, most of which were used to crack witty jokes or provide useless information that probably got cut from the main text. I'll be honest: I don't like Mary Roach. She takes her 'wit' too far: it's almost as if she used the topic and her research to prove that she's too smart or too much of an atheist to believe In life after death. She's cool. Everyone else is crazy. Her side notes and attempts at humor by attacking researchers' appearances or plain-out calling them crazy makes me believe she's a bitter woman who probably shouldn't believe in the afterlife because I doubt she'll enjoy it much anyway (or, heaven forbid, have an opportunity to actually show emotions about anything.) "
79,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4743101-amy-vickers,1,"I only made it to 27% of this book. It's a shame because I am really interested in the subject. This book wasn't just boring, it was actively hurting me.I'm shocked that she got away with using the word ""science"" in her subtitle because her scientific literacy is so poor and approach so unscientific. She starts off questioning the cultural bias of a researcher (because he happens to be Indian) while ignoring her own obvious cultural biases. She's constantly patting herself on the back for being rational and impartial, while being exceptionally judgmental and dismissive.Worst of all were her attempts at being funny. Her jokes were mostly to mock and disrespect the research and methodology of others, especially those who don't share her very strict and narrow-minded views."
80,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61950-ian,3,"This book was much like Roach's earlier Stiff, which I also enjoyed, but seems not as well-honed as her prior effort. She does a good job of keeping the tone light, but it can be too ""jokey"" to read for long stretches; nearly every paragraph ends with a rimshot, with many other punchlines interspersed. This jocularity seems to be Roach's MO, and it serves science writing well, but it can be wearying at length. The gleefully inconclusive conclusion was also a bit tepid, but likely a result of the topic itself. At any rate, if you liked Stiff, there is a lot to like here as well."
81,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747711-william,3,"This book was interesting at times but at times it was just plain dull. The main thing that kept me reading was the author's sense of humor. I don't know what I expected but there are no answers here. Deep down I knew that would be the case but one can still dream. Most of the case studies and research that was mentioned was just rife with fraud. It was good to see there was some actual science backed research going on in the area of Out of Body experiences. I think Ms. Roach is a talented writer but I feel that ""Stiff"" was the better of her two books I have read."
82,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6721230-paula,4,"oh Ms. Roach, you are so droll. Roach is hysterically satirical. She is impeccably researched and so funny. I loved to see a solid scientific method applied to the looney toons she describes, but around 2/3 of the way through it gets repetitive. Enough Mary. Thank you so much for keeping me entertained right up until the needless rehash that piles up at the end. I don't need to meet every single fruit cake indistinguishable from the last. A fun read, Roach just didn't know where to make it stop. It peters out slow and low. I never thought I'd want a book of her's to end."
83,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3095901-karen,5,"Roach is the funniest, sharpest, most irreverent writer of popular nonfiction around. Her footnotes alone would make her books worthwhile, even if you didn't also get such great writing about such interesting topics. Roach wears her strengths lightly, often presenting herself as a bumbling interloper into the lives of learned specialists...when she's not wryly marveling at the foolishness of the self-deluded. She's one of those people--like Madeline Kahn and Viola Davis--who seems to make everything better by arriving on the scene. Also, she'll walk a mile to make a poop joke."
84,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4250714-greg-bates,3,"I'm waffling hard between three and four stars for this one - whichever it ends up being, consider this one a 3.5. At it's best, Roach's Spook reads like a funny junior-league version of Carl Sagan's The Demon Haunted World: a tongue-in-cheek debunking of ridiculous pseudoscientific concepts like ectoplasm and electronic voice phenomena. Roach has a good ear for the amusing anecdote and the clever factoid, I just wish she wasn't obviously casting her net at the widest possible audience. It's a very shallow, fluffy, fun book: but there's nothing wrong with fun."
85,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/624440-tobin-elliott,4,"I was trying to decide how to phrase what I felt about this book, then I happened to see Lydia Peever's review, and I can't get much better than that. It's as intriguing as Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, and almost as fun, but not quite.Still, having said that, it's a fun read."
86,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30347735-plum-crazy,2,"I have a bit of a mixed review about this book as I much preferred reading about the authors actual experiences rather than some of the historical facts, which I found hard to concentrate on in parts.I really enjoyed Chapter 7, ""Soul in a Dunce Cap"" where the author enrolled in Medium school* but I couldn't get to grips with Chapter 2, ""The Little Man Inside the Sperm"", or ""Possibly the Big Toe"" at all. Overall not for me though not without it's interesting points.*I also found the footnotes were generally quite amusing :o)"
87,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381266-sandie,4,I did much better with this book when I read it exclusively and not one of a bunch. I stumbled a bit with all the research projects she sites and that this researcher was the student or mentor of this one.....Her humor is often times so subtle that you almost miss it. The trails of her research are fascinating and the transitions from project to project as described in the book are smooth. Liked Stiff and Packing for Mars a tad better than this one but still a worthy read. Going on to Gulp next.
88,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51089-jamie,3,"Nothing new here, and at times a bit too jokey for its own good. But, it’s Mary Roach. (I love Mary Roach.) The latter half is best, more weighted with earnest skepticism over rimshot jokes. I have to admit, it won me over with the Chaffins and Blackwelders of Mocksville, the sweet-tempered neighbors with their ancestors as ghosts. These are the people I grew up alongside, North Carolinians to the core.Conclusion: I’d like to buy Mary Roach a beer."
89,0393329127,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11202056-catherine-james,4,"Another fantastic book from Ms Roach. As always, Mary delivers a book that leaves me coming away feeling smarter, yet thoroughly entertained. Though not my favourite of all her titles (probably Bonk, Stiff,and Gulp), Spook still has that rare quality of being a book about history, science, and facts, but presented with wit and wry observations that left me utterly fascinated. I sound like a squealing fan girl. But I am. "
