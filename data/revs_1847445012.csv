0,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"Ben Miller is probably best known for playing a detective in the gentle, rather underrated comedy drama Death in Paradise, and as half of the comedy duo Armstrong and Miller, but he studied physics at Cambridge and was en route to a doctorate when he realized that getting a real job was much more useful. (I would like to apply a large kick to Brian Cox for writing the most condescending puff for the book I’ve ever seen: ‘A fun and insightful ride through the whole of science – it’s almost as if he’d finished his PhD.’)I don’t know why it is, but people always get a little excited when an entertainer has a science qualification. (Think Brian May or Dara O’Briain for instance.) No doubt many others have, say, English or history degrees, but for some reason this doesn’t cause the same amazement. Perhaps the assumption is that all entertainers are a bit, well, thick. But either way we really have to take the book on its merits. And they are considerable.Miller conducts a rambling tour of some of the best bits (in the terms of being mind boggling) of science. He takes us into the world of particle physics and the Large Hadron Collider, into the depths of the universe and black holes, looks at how the solar system formed, at the wonders of evolution and geology, DNA, the chemistry of cookery, global warming, and how space travel requires Newton’s laws of motion. All this is done in a good humoured light-hearted fashion. Particularly engaging are the sections where he describes how he got into science, his experiences at Cambridge and taking on Gordon Ramsay in making a sponge cake.I’d say the ideal audience for this book is someone who has never read a popular science book and wants a primer. It is probably too simplistic for any regular science reader, but for the newcomer, Miller’s enthusiasm (much more Magnus Pyke than Brian Cox) is infectious. Just occasionally it gets a bit too childish and hand wavy, but mostly it works well. Admittedly even Miller can’t make geology exciting. And there is one out-and-out error, when he describes Einstein’s 1905 papers as general rather than special relativity, but these are small issues. He hits most of the good bits on the nail (except quantum theory, which is hardly covered at all) and carries the reader along effortlessly.Not a book for everyone, then, but for teenagers or adults taking a first step into the world of popular science, this is a cracker.Review first published on www.popularscience.co.uk and reproduced with permission"
1,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21132066-zoe-carney,4,"I have a complex relationship with science. On the one hand, I find it interesting - the search for the Higgs boson, climate science, evolution and so on - while on the other my educational experience is such that the merest hint of the word 'mathematics' makes my brain shut down.This book, therefore, could have been written for me. Miller takes several of the big ideas in science and breaks them down for the lay person, gently leading us through ideas about particle physics, evolutionary biology, and yes, rocket science without ever seeming patronising or like he's 'dumbing down'. Of course he's simplifying and glossing - he admits as much throughout the book - but he's simplifying in the way that someone who thoroughly understands a subject and doesn't feel they have to use big words does it, while always remembering he's talking to adults. It's a fine line to walk, and he does it with aplomb.I actually found the final chapter about rocket science the least interesting, but once he got away from the workings of actual rockets and into what space exploration (and other scientific concepts such as evolution) can tell us about the possibility of life on other planets, I was back into it. The other chapters I really enjoyed.In short, a fun read, and as a confirmed non-scientist, one I'd definitely recommend for other people who feel like they don't get science. "

3,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2485778-lindz,3,"Science and I have never really gotten along. All through high school science was tedious boring and annoying. I ran over the arms of messy smiling history. The goofy kid with tousled hair and over sized shoes, while science was equivalent of Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory. So why was I reading a book about science? I'm not sure how it happened either. I originally bought the book for my boyfriend who likes fazers, aliens, stars, explosions, and big guns. In the past three years I have sat in many a movie which consisted of, monsters/aliens blowing up stuff, while hero runs around with a BFG (not the giant) like they have just stepped out of a 90's music video. So yes the Chef enjoyed the book. But why did I?Author Ben Miller is a British comedian with Footlight connections, something I find impossibly sexy. The Chef was excited about it, I had just watch an episode of QI featuring said Footlights comedian, he made out with Rob Brydan, it was a good show, and during a pretty nasty flu found myself on the couch watching a BBC science documentary. So I picked Miller's book, it was just lying on the coffee table, I was only meant to read a few pages, just to get a taste......... I read the whole thing.I liked the premise. Miller wanted to introduce you too science, nothing serious just a quick fling. So he gave you the sexy stuff, no graph's no equations (except for maybe the most famous one), more things like the hadron colliders, black holes, planets, sending space shuttles to an asteroid, e=mc2 (yeah that famous equation), evolution, DNA, global warming, and even the chemical reactions in food. He filled the book with interesting tid bits, like adults who can consume cows milk without their intestines doing the conga, you are weird and a mutant. Due to Dairy Farming which started about 7 thousand years ago, it caused a mutation in I think it was the lactose gene (I could be wrong remember this was a one night stand), most mammals cannot process milk into adulthood. Interesting huh? Needless to say in the great tradition of reading and my book buying binges, I have ordered a bio on Einstein. God help me, but it is by the same guy who wrote the Steve Jobs bio so I should be ok. I'm not sure this is going to spark a complete love of science, but it is nice to fool around some times."
4,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6068530-jim-whitefield,5,"I love Ben Miller, the author of this book, as a comedian and actor – who is currently starring in the acclaimed TV (second) series ‘Death in Paradise’, but I had never before read anything written by him. My wife bought me this book for my birthday as she knows I also love simply presented science. Ben Miller is best summarised as a person on the rear cover so I will let that speak for him: “Ben Miller is, like you, a mutant ape living through an Ice Age on a ball of molten iron, orbiting a supermassive black hole. He is also an actor, comedian and approximately one half of Armstrong and Miller. He’s presented a BBC Horizon documentary on temperature and a Radio 4 series about the history of particle physics, and has a regular science column in The Times. He is slowly coming to terms with the idea that he may never be an astronaut.”This book is fun; none of the ‘hard to understand’ stuff, just a purely delightful foray into the most interesting science – leaving you with a basic understanding, following an enthralling and often humorous journey. Black holes, DNA, the secret code of creation, The Large Hadron Collider, climate change, the scientific possibility of extra-terrestrial life – and more, are all covered, and although the title suggests otherwise, it actually does explain rocket science (the simple but exciting stuff) and how we landed on the moon in a delightfully informative and interesting manner. Professor Brian Cox summed this book up well with his front cover comment “A fun and insightful ride through the whole of science – it’s almost as if he finished his PhD!” I loved the ride and was sad when the end of the book inevitably came along. If you love science but have yet to understand some of the basics – and you enjoy a light hearted way of having it presented – then this is the book for you. "
5,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5732285-sarah,4,"I love most aspects of science, I’d like to say that first off, however what interests me about science and what I’m good at are two completely separate things. Before I get into my science love I’d just like to have a little vent about the people who complain that this book is too easy for them. If your science knowledge is so good then why are you reading a science book designed for the people who have not bonded with science? (like it? A little chemistry joke there for you) It’s like someone who buys milk and then complains that it’s not chocolate milkshake. Dude, you bought it, it was clearly labelled, shut the hell up. My science knowledge is very good. It’s very good in certain areas and poor in others. I have a background in chemistry however I love physics; specifically particle physics and cosmology. I knew all the facts about those subjects in the book however my knowledge of geology and the natural sciences is quite poor so I learned something reading those chapters. Long story short is I like Ben Miller, I liked this book and I thought it was worth reading and surely that’s the point of any book?"
6,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6507905-lcitera,5,"I am a fan of DEATH IN PARADISE and followed Chief Inspector off the screen and into the bookstore. I learned more about science from this book than I had previously mastered in far too many years of education, Ben Miller's credentials come from a Ph.D program at Cambridge University...but what makes this book click is the humor. I now have at least a basic idea of a quark...and a good shot at the correct pronunciation of the word. Especially enjoyed the chapter on Astronomy. Never thought I would voluntarily read a ""science book""...much less find such pithy, enjoyable and most surprisingly, A very very good read! "
7,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38026873-waseem-sheriff,4,"An excellent attempt by Ben Miller to break down into simple terms the world of seemingly complex science around us - from sub atomic particles to biological evolution to food science to the formation of the cosmos ... and everything else trending in science.Although some parts of ‘It’s Not Rocket Science' does still seem like ‘rocket science’, this book launches readers into a world of scientific marvel and escapism, propelled by clear, factual and logical explanations and theories.The author's sense of humour might need some getting used to."
8,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/545982-narrelle,5,"Intelligent, accessible, fun and funny. I wish parts of it were available as pamphlets to hand to people to explain climate change and the moon landings, for starters. Miller's enthusiasm for the joys of science is infectious! "
9,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10124798-rog,5,"The book basically takes all your favourite Science subjects from school (Biology, Physics, and Chemistry), strips out the boring stuff (Blast furnaces for example) and as Ben Miller states in a metaphor that I am now going to mix, removes all the 'first principles' stuff and just feeds you the exciting 'tip of the iceberg' stuff (my metaphor).So, for Biology, we have a whole section devoted to evolution, Darwin etc. and how DNA works (ever wondered what a Haplatite is, or Mitochondrial Eve???). For Physics, we get how we know about the Big Bang and what Einstein and Hawking have taught us. For Chemistry, we learn about the weird and wonderful world of the very small and how it completely needs a new way of thinking about stuff.We also learnt that unlike his TV persona, Gordon Ramsay's actually a bit of a dude. :-)It was a brilliant book and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about the universe they live in."
10,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66436518-nathalie,4,"3.75 stars. Very interesting. When I started this, I had no idea it was written by a comedian, so all the joke-ish bits came as a surprise to me. I really liked that he put science in a simple form. I hate maths and always did, so while I found science interesting, I shied away from it, as I always thought it would include too much math (which is technically true). But in that way, these sort of books, not too seriously written, are perfect for me, as they fulfill my craving for science knowledge that I don't really need, but am interested in, without feeling like a lecture I want to run from. My only complaint is, that sometimes I felt his jokes and funny bits were too much. It could have been more toned down in that aspect, but then again, he is a comedian, so he has to do what he does."

14,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"I’ve always loved Ben Miller - as an actor, sketch artist and comedian, it’s easy to forget he’s a great scientist too! I’ve heard him on a few podcasts as well and he’s incredibly clever (started his PhD at Cambridge in semiconductor physics with a thesis on ‘Novel Quantum Effects in Quasi-Zero Dimensional Mesoscopic Electron Systems’.) Also seen him portray the roles of James Lester in Primeval and a fantastic detective in Death in Paradise - he’s a man of many talents!This book was a fantastic read. Discussing things from black holes, to evolution and DNA, to climate change and the chemistry of making a Victoria sponge cake ! I mean, who wouldn’t want to know about those things?! It was very enjoyable reading, learning without feeling like you are, funny and full of great content. Great book!"

18,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369018-lee,3,"I was in a Heathrow Terminal 3 bookshop a few months ago, all too aware that the one book I was taking on holiday would be insufficient. What I needed was something to read that would take a while. Something big and complicated with lots of equations and indecipherable diagrams. I needed a book on rocket science.Then, as if Serendipity-incarnate herself had just landed in WHSmith, I espied a paperback by Ben Miller. “Ben Miller? Isn't he the amusing comedian chap from the telly?” I thought to myself, having no one else to think to. “I enjoy his work with comedy partner Alexander Armstrong. And, since I'm thinking to myself and no one will ever find this out, I admit to being partial to his much-belittled detective TV show, Death in Paradise.” I was also vaguely aware that he had a PhD, or most of one, in Physics or something like that, but had decided to become a professional jester rather than striving to uncover the very secrets of the Universe. Not that I'm judging him.I'd probably been stood there for a few minutes at this point, staring gormlessly at a bookshelf while listening to this inner monologue. It was time to move on. After all, much as I might enjoy Ben Miller's comedy he clearly wouldn't have written a book about rocket science. He gave up science years ago, this was probably a book about going to fancy parties with his famous friends, or about the history of jokes in Mesopotamia, or whatever it is comedians write about. On a whim, though, I decided to deign the book's title with a quick glance. And who would have thought it, it was rocket science!Sure there were some other words in the title, but they were probably just “An advanced guide, with lots of fancy equations involving Greek letters, to…” or something like that. But whatever it said couldn't be important. Everyone knows that God, the New Yorkër, and the Westboro Baptist Church all hate qualifying clauses at the start of sentences, and Ben Miller doesn't strike me as the kind of person who'd incur the wrath of that particular trio.Decision made, I literally picked up the book and bought it, ready to metaphorically devour it on the plane.Well, upon starting the book a little while later, and to quote Robert Oppenheimer, “I am become disappoint.” Turns out you should read the whole title before buying books in the WHSmith in Heathrow Terminal 3. This wasn't an excruciating trawl through the finer points of ballistic mechanics. There was no discussion of the effects of jerk on fuel consumption, not to mention jounce, crackle, pop, lock, and drop. Instead Ben Miller tries to rub some of his enthusiasm for science off on the reader by discussing in short essays lots of different interesting results from various scientific fields. He's at pains to point out that he's just an enthusiastic fan of science not an expert. This gets a little incongruous at times, like finding out your tour guide in the natural history museum is just someone who really likes Jurassic Park.Still, once I'd gotten over my disappointment I did warm to the book. Ben Miller is nothing if not enthusiastic and does his best to convey the wonders of modern science. I can't help but feel there's a pretty small market for the book, since it needs people bright enough and curious enough about science to want to read it, but also who don't really know anything about science to get anything from it. Maybe that's why he's resorted to luring people in with promises of being a stodgy old book on mechanics when it's actually a lively zip through, well, everything. The scoundrel. "
19,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4809767-sho,5,"(I've only just realised that I've spelt Physics wrong on my ""bookshelf""... don't judge me)I ordered this when I heard it was about to be published - and waited and waited, and the forecast date of delivery was pushed further and further back. Then - BANG! - came the email I'd been waiting for: it was on the way.Currently, what with studying on the OU and all, I don't read as much as I used to. But I buy (nearly) as many books as I used to: only I pile them all on a shelf of ""books to be read during my summer break"". It teeters precariously, almost defying the laws of gravity (ha ha) and although this is one of the later editions, it was one of the first ones I grabbed when ""Time To Read On The Train Instead Of Studying"" came round.What can I say? I love Ben Miller. Actually, I fancy him a bit even though he can't in all honesty really be described as hot and/or sexy. But he is very amusing (I love Armstrong and Miller) and he is obviously clever (he broke off his PhD to go into the entertainment industry, and did study at Cambridge). I really fell for him, though, when he did complicated maths, in his head, on an episode of QI. (I could probably only really really fancy him a lot if he was a tall, lanky, posh boy with cheese-cutter cheekbones and a penchant for using long words like ""correlation"" - but I digress)This book consists of 8 chapters each covering one aspect of popular science that Miller chose to write about. Until the chapter about space travel (chapter 8) there is no maths. And even then you don't have to actually understand it (although I did - roughly - which gave me a little frisson of excitement) - partly because I did maths A-level back in the days when it was difficult* and partly because at this stage I have read a fair few popular science books and the maths does tend to crop up over and over again.Presumably because Miller picked eight subjects that he is interested in, they are a rather eclectic bunch ranging from the aforementioned space-travel, through climate change and DNA to fossils. The tone is engaging and written in such a way that you can actually imagine it as one half of a conversation with Miller about science. Chatty, amusing (witty, even) and not at all stuffy. In fact, I think if you were going to recommend a science book to someone who really doesn't know about science, or says they don't like it - you could do a lot, lot worse than chuck this one at them. (swiftly followed by anything by Marcus Chown, the Bill Bryson about everything and the one about Einstein's theory of relativity by [the lovely] Brian Cox and [the not so lovely] Jeff Forshaw**)* So difficult was it (one 3 hour paper of pure, one 3 hour paper of applied maths) that I failed. I got an F. But still. I was present (in body if not mind) for 2 years of it. Some of it really did stick. But now I'm getting flashbacks about i-numbers so I'm going for a lie down.** Sorry, Jeff."
20,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34257694-ann-goodwin,5,What a brilliant book. Covering a lot of hot topics in an extremely readable and funny way. Although I am not sure about his conclusions about Alien life. And it did make me realise how little I actually know about stuff *sigh*
21,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45944861-david-spargur,5,"Pretty entertainingVery fun read and solid science, just 2 notes: His estimates on the Drake equation tell us Mars 100% has had life. Also I understand stars twinkle from our atmosphere, rather than interstellar medium. But the Drake equation estimate was enlightening, giving 7 alien civilizations in our galaxy waiting for a call, though an estimate of none in our galaxy is more reasonable to me."
22,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4038800-misa-buckley,5,"It's very possible, were I not a fan of the sunny detective show Death In Paradise, that the existence of this book might have passed me by. It if weren't for that program, I probably wouldn't have followed Ben Miller on Twitter. And if it weren't for that, I'd not have realised he'd written the book.Wait, I hear you say, are you saying this is a book written by an actor? Short answer is yes. The longer answer is that Ben was at Cambridge University studying physics when he stumbled onto Footlights, writing comedy and Alexander Armstrong. Promptly distracted, he pursued a career in comedy and acting (he starred alongside Rowan Atkinson in Johnny English as well as playing the snarktastic James Lester in Primeval) but, as he says himself, first loves run deep and he still loves the sciences.That love, coupled with a dry sense of humour and a tendency to distract himself even when writing, makes It's Not Rocket Science a highly entertaining read. It's written with a lightness of touch that must have many scientific authors chewing on their livers in envy, and it has its target audience very firmly in sight with the result I often got weirded out - there's something inherently creepy about reading a book that seems to have been written specifically for you.Have I learnt anything from this book? Absolutely, and though not everything I've picked up is useful (dandelions do not form part of the natural diet of a fox), I had a lot of fun reading and fully intend to reread it (I've also bought the audio version and Ben has the sort of reassuringly calm voice that would be perfect for The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy)One of Ben's last comments is that he hopes the book serves as a ""gateway"". Given I gave into the long-held dream of buying a telescope off the back of the chapter on astronomy, I reckon he achieved that with me at least."
23,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6744684-hannio-j,4,"Rating - 4.5 stars!I don't know exactly what has got me into science books recently but something has suddenly clicked... it's just a shame that this new found love of science couldn't have emerged back when I was at school taking science!The writing style was extremely easy to understand, it was amusing and in no way did I feel as though Ben Miller had dumbed it down in anyway. It might not have been as technical as some other science books I've read but that was in no way a bad thing in my eyes.He had chosen a few subjects on science and focused on that which I enjoyed reading about. I always think you can tell a good book when you close the cover and actually feel like you've learnt things which you didnt know. I found that happened several times while reading this book. an example being that I had absolutely no idea how calories were measured and now I do!I would most definitely read this book again and I've already got a small list of people to lend it to (I have so many books that I've got my own private lending service which I really should begin to think of charging for)So why didn't I give it a 5 star if I loved it so much... because a 5 star in my eyes has to be pure perfection and this was just ever so slightly off! So, So close though... so close that I may change my mind by the end of the day and bump it up, you never know!I would definitely recommend anyone with a vague interest in Science to read this though!"
24,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,3,This is a tricky one to comment on. Ben Miller is incredibly clever and very very funny - to me a mixture I am deeply jealous of. But his writings - first off the passion he feels for the subject cannot be denied- however like all clever people who love a subject at times you do get the feeling you want to tap him on the shoulder and say wooo - slow down there and let my brain catch up. Now that is not to say he patronises you or blows you away with technobabble - no his work is very accessible the problem is that many of the lines of his explanations go along he lines where technobabble and high principles are necessary or even demanded - so you do have to ride out the wave as it were. Now that I have said that i feel guilty as I too was a scientist at a time and know what it is like to be in the think of things - however I also know you are picking up this book to read out of interest and personal achievement - so you have to keep it interesting. And yes Mr Miller has achieved that - I am not sure how well he will write on a subject he is not so passionate about or even so knowledgeable - i guess that is where passion and drive are replaced by practice and natural ability. I for one would be eager to see what else he produces and see if I feel as enlightened and a little confused as I do after reading this one
25,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7325648-dan,4,I very rarely read non-fiction books but I was recommended this by a colleague and thought I'd give it a read as Miller is one of my favourite sketch comedians and a book which explains scientific concepts for entertainment was something which I thought sounded interesting.Miller certainly succeeded in being entertaining although I didn't find it to be that educational. Some parts I could barely understand and was baffled by and others were largely recapping things I knew about. I did find the chapters about alien life and evolution particularly fascinating and every chapter was certainly a joy to read. Every chapter that is except one about the science of food which was largely anecdotal. Miller does anecdotes brilliantly but it felt out of place compared to much of the rest of the book. This is an entertaining read and I whizzed through it quickly because it's informal style made me want to keep going. Great for anyone with a casual interest in science!
26,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10283018-eris,4,This book was very inspirational and educational also entertaining since I guess the fact Ben Miller a actor and comedian was very informative yet simple since the writing was so much easier and less technical than the dull science books at school. The book put such a insight on me because I never realise how the universe really work especially the important parts such as evolution and gravity these I never understand their importance in science since at school the teacher never explain them quite well so this actually give more explanation and detail that I need plus I believe science is the key to my future seeing I want to work in area of science in the future not sure what kind part of science I want to work. Lastly this has given me both physically and mentally a motivation to actually want to discover a lot more of science. 
27,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16034997-heather-taylor-nicholson,5,"A brilliant book specifically for a non science audience, written by comedian and actor Ben Miller. Miller studied Natural Sciences at Cambridge, specialising in Physics and then went on to study Novel quantum effects in low-temperature quasi-zero dimensional mesoscopic electron systems, as a PhD, (semi conductor quantum dots!). Miller gave up his PhD for comedy but has always maintained his love affair with science. In this book he explains various aspects of current issues and scientific discovery in a light hearted way, but also to make you think. He stated his aim was for science to be enjoyed by the reader and not to worry if some of the concepts go a little over one's head. It's a good read and introduction to science in its many forms, but does not patronise the reader at the same time. Go get it!"
28,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8224213-reg,4,"A thoroughly enjoyable jaunt through Science. Being reasonably geeky I was familiar with a lot of the material and probably in more detail than the 'Avoid Maths or anything that would put a casual reader off' way that the material is presented, but I still gained and learned a lot from the book. Brilliantly Miller manages to link up pretty much everything - from cooking to the evolution of man, from geology to weather patterns, biology to climate change, intelligence to physics to space travel and the possibility aliens in a manner that is superbly accessible. This is a tongue-in-cheek napkin sketch of how everything links together that most people just don't understand or at least haven't thought of enough to quite grok - I certainly hadn't. Very well done indeed."
29,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2686359-cf,4,"Really entertaining. I've been a fan of Miller for many years for his comedy work, and finding out he is an incredible scientist and writer as well is just delightful. Miller outlines the big issues in science. Climate change, evolution, space, particle physics and more. His sense of humour shines through his writing and he makes these usually complex issues much easier to understand. I have been interested in science since I was a child but, as I'm sure many of you also were, was the unfortunate subject of bad high school teachers. Primary science is fun and full of wonder, and Miller manages to get the old curiosity juices pumping again. Worth reading for anyone interested in science at any level, witty and hard to put down once you pick it up. "
30,1847445012,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10082096-paula-connelly,5,"I thought this was a terrific book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I've always had a vague interest in science but have never been able to grasp it, my mind being more engaged by history and the arts. This book certainly redressed the balance for me. It's written in such a readable and light-hearted way as to hold your attention and yet there was (for me) some pretty challenging stuff to grapple with and at times I had to read parts several times over.Ben Miller is one of my favourite comic actors and his own particular style of humour at times had me laughing out loud, something I wouldn't have dreamt possible from a book about popular science."

I've always had a vague interest in science but have never been able to grasp it, my mind being more engaged by history and the arts. This book certainly redressed the balance for me. It's written in such a readable and light-hearted way as to hold your attention and yet there was (for me) some pretty challenging stuff to grapple with and at times I had to read parts several times over.Ben Miller is one of my favourite comic actors and his own particular style of humour at times had me laughing out loud, something I wouldn't have dreamt possible from a book about popular science."

A whole chapter on cooking seems misjudged, but the chapter on climate change is brilliant, not least of all for its balance, and deserves reading even if you skip the rest.
