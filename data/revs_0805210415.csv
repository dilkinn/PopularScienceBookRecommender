0,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"In an interweaving between the elements and stories, Primo Levi tells his life. But he chooses episodes to relate carefully and never discusses his children. At the end he tells us, that his writing was only """"partial and symbolic"". The man who wrote so much and so tellingly of Auschwitz in If This Is a Man remains a mystery.The greatest mystery of all, to me, was his death. At 67 he fell over the balustrade of the stairs down from the 3rd floor of the house he'd lived in all his life (except when he was imprisoned in Auschwitz). How do you fall over a stair rail? Was it suicide? Was he the last victim of the concentration camps? "

In this book, I'd find a sentence, and go to copy it and realize it relied on the one before it, which relied on the one before that for its complete meaning. So I'd copy down whole paragraphs, whole pages, because Primo writes in integrated, seamless blocks of meaning. Which is enviable.Other than that, I want to give Primo a big kiss, buy him a beer, and ride bikes with him in Italy."
2,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,4,"Each chapter is named for an element; some chapters are autobiographical, some are essays, some are vignettes of people he knew and their careers in chemistry; two are short stories about metal prospecting and mining with hints of fantasy. Most are autobiographical and through these we learn a bit of his childhood; his boyish fascination with chemistry experiments which grew into his college education and career as a chemist; his puppy loves and courtship and his imprisonment in a labor camp during WW II. There’s a lot about language derivation, especially of names. For example, the mixed Jewish/Piedmontese dialect in the fabric shops of that Italian region gave Italy a lot of its fabric terms. And he worries that while he can speak it (Piedmontese, essentially a spoken language), it loses its authenticity from his book learning rather than native fluency. It’s fascinating to learn things such as urstoff in German means element or primal substance. Here’s a quote chemists will love: “…the nobility of Man, acquired in a hundred centuries of trial and error, lay in making himself the conqueror of matter.”We even have a passage about fake news: “…how could he ignore the fact that the chemistry and physics on which we fed…were the antidote to Fascism…because they were clear and distinct and verifiable at every step, and not a tissue of lies and emptiness, like the radio and newspapers?” Apparently fake news is a theme of the great Italian writers of this era because it reminds me of a related passage I quoted recently from Italo Calvino’s If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler: “We’re in a country where everything that can be falsified has been falsified: paintings in museums, gold ingots, bus tickets. The counterrevolution and the revolution fight with salvos of falsification: the result is that no one can be sure what is true and what is false, the political police simulate revolutionary actions and the revolutionaries disguise themselves as policemen.” Occasionally there is a theme of chemical mixing and the mixing of Jewish and Christian culture. The author was forced to work as a chemist in the Auschwitz labor camp. He later corresponded with his German supervisor at the camp. Several passages deal with the tense relationship between the Italian fascists and the Jews such as: “…one could be polite, one could even help him [a Jew], and even boast (cautiously) about having helped him, but it was not advisable to have human relations with him, nor to compromise oneself too deeply, so as not to be forced later to offer understanding or compassion.” Levi could not receive his college degree since awarding a degree to Jews was prohibited; nor could he initially get a job since the “racial laws forbade it.” The author makes some humorous but nasty comments about librarians. With apologies to the many users on GR who are librarians, here’s one passage: “The librarian…presided over the library like a watchdog, one of those poor dogs that are deliberately made vicious by being chained up and given little to eat; or better, like the old, toothless cobra, pale because of centuries of darkness…she was small, without breasts or hips, waxen, wilted, and monstrously myopic…She gave the impression of never having been young, although she was certainly not more than thirty, and having been born there, in the shadows, in that vague odor of mildew and stale air…she stank of mothballs and looked constipated.""I read somewhere this was the greatest science book ever written. No, I prefer Richard Feynman, but it’s pretty good. Translated from the Italian. photo of Primo Levi from itascabile.com"
3,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,4,"Every suicide is like a nail bomb full of vicious questions and the questions don’t care where they land. Why didn’t somebody do something? – there’s one. Surely there must have been signs. Right there is a triple blow delivered to the bereaved partner and immediate family. They’re reeling from the event, then they have to conclude this depression, this malaise, was so acute it blotted out even thoughts of themselves in the suicide’s final minutes. And after that comes the unspoken accusations and avoidings by friends and associates. (Why didn’t they see and having seen taken steps?). Some suicides still hang like paradoxically visible black holes of misery up in our skies, Sylvia Plath, van Gogh, David Foster Wallace, Kurt Cobain, Ernest Hemingway, BS Johnson, Mark Rothko.Primo Levi committed suicide at the age of 67 in 1987. The repercussions were uniquely distressing. He had been the embodiment of an idea that is so cherished it’s nearly unbearable to think it may not be true. The idea that a person can go through the worst and most inhuman experiences, in his case Auschwitz, and survive not only in body but in spirit too, and not become corrupted, and not destroyed. Levi’s books were and are the clearest-eyed, most lucid, most carefully discerning, and most humane books about the Holocaust I have come across. The idea that Auschwitz finally got him, 42 years later, that Hitler had extracted one more posthumous victory, was horrible. And this final act now throws a long shadow over all his great writings, so that we loop round on ourselves and almost catch us yelling and denouncing Levi for doing such a thing, and then feel instant shame at such a thought. This suicide involves Levi’s readers inevitably in these psychological traps. Of course you can argue that the depression and anguish which led to the suicide might have a whole other aetiology of which we are completely ignorant. It’s possible, and it’s a comforting thought, were it not for the continuous theme in his various writings being Auschwitz and the Holocaust from If This is a man (1947) to The Drowned and the Saved (1986). Or - you can argue that it wasn’t a suicide at all, it was an accident – an old man fell over a balcony. There was no note. The concierge of the block of flats had spoken to him minutes before he died. He seemed okay. But both his biographers think it was suicide. We have to say that it doesn’t matter. The work is the thing. Rothko’s canvasses are not affected one way or another by his death just as Wuthering Heights would be just as great a novel if Emily Bronte had celebrated her 100th birthday on 30 July, 1918, as World War One was coming to an end. It doesn’t matter.The Periodic Table is a quirky memoir of a Jewish-Italian chemist. There are elements of cool humour throughout and hardly a trace of bitterness. "
4,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110812-kinga,5,"Chemistry as a metaphor for life. Blurb writers love phrases like that. They are short, succinct and intriguing. But how hard is it to write something that would deliver on such a promise?I had never read anything quite like ‘The Periodic Table’. It more than delivered – it exceeded my expectations. The book is a beautiful marriage of life and science, perfectly accessible to a regular reader. The truth is that anything can be fascinating provided it’s explained by a person truly passionate about the subject (and it doesn’t hurt if they are also mind-blowingly good writers like Primo Levi). You might know Primo Levi as an Auschwitz survivor and you might worry that ‘The Periodic Table’ would be too dark of a read. But it is not ‘If This is A Man’. Holocaust is still lurking around shadowy corners of this book and it is quite obvious that Primo Levi would be a different kind of writer if it weren’t for that trauma (some might even ask if he would be a writer at all) but this collection of anecdotes, recollections, allegory and glimpses is, I would venture to say, an ultimately almost positive (if not downright optimistic) work. The very first story might be a little odd and discouraging but either soldier on or skip it altogether – it’s not really representative of the rest of the book. I found reading about the intricacies of a Piedmont dialect with its borrowings from Hebrew rather fascinating. I am interested in the process in which words change their meaning entirely (not unlike they did in cockney rhyming slang) but I can appreciate that such linguistic elaborations are not to everyone’s taste.Further chapters – each named after a different chemical element document Levi’s life as a chemist and they are often funny, tender and bitter-sweet. They are intersected with fictional short stories which read like fairy tales and where chemical elements take on almost mythical qualities. The most striking story is the penultimate one in which Levi comes across a German who oversaw his work in the laboratory in Auschwitz. Like a true scientist Levi wants to rationalise and understand his feelings. He wants to know what it is he expects from the encounter. His struggle to organise the swarm of emotions is probably the most touching part of the book. ‘The Periodic Table’ is not a science book, whoever calls it that has no idea what they are talking about. It’s a book about the love for science. It’s about what every scientist wants us to believe – that their subject is not some obscure knowledge of interest to few, but it’s life and reality that makes us breathe, move and think. The last story in the collection spells it out for you in case you missed the more subtle hints in the previous chapters. I liked it a lot because it reminded of the times when, as a little girl, I fantasised about the history of atoms in my body – where they had been before me. I imagined them as a part of dinosaurs, king and queens, old houses, wild horses… The story is Levi’s crown argument for his thesis that it is only through matter (not sprit) we can know the universe. (And this is a thesis I can easily believe in – it appeals to me. I am not what you call ‘spritual’).If you made it this far in my review, I will reward you with a link to an excellent interview with Primo Levi in the Paris Review of Books: http://www.theparisreview.org/intervi...

5,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7213075-ted,4,"There are so-called inert gases in the air we breathe. They bear curious Greek names of erudite derivation which mean ""the New"", ""the Hidden"", ""the Inactive"", and ""the Alien"".Thus begins Primo Levi's book of a score or so mini-memoirs. Each of these is named for one of the elements, thus the name of the book. The elements used are in no particular order – not alphabetical, not by atomic number (the ordering of elements in the periodic table). They range from Argon (the first chapter) to Carbon (the last), from Hydrogen to Uranium, from Nitrogen to Arsenic.Each of Levi's unnumbered chapters is launched with something about the element used for its name. ""Argon"" begins with the sentence above, and continues for a rather lengthy paragraph along these lines, ending with ""… argon (the Inactive) is present in the air in the considerable proportion of 1 per cent, that is, twenty or thirty times more abundant [by volume] than carbon dioxide, without which there would not be a trace of life on this planet.""But then the next paragraph (in ""Argon"") begins The little that I know about my ancestors presents many similarities to these gases. Not all of them were materially inert, for that was not granted them. On the contrary, they were – or had to be – quite active, in order to earn a living and because of a reigning morality that held that ""he who does not work does not eat."" But there is no doubt that they were inert in their inner spirits, inclined to disinterested speculation, witty discourses, elegant, sophisticated, and gratuitous discussion. It can hardly be by chance that all the deeds attributed to them, though quite various, have in common a touch of the static, an attitude of dignified abstention, of voluntary (or accepted) relegation to the margins of the great river of life. Noble, inert, and rare: their history is quite poor when compared to that of other illustrious Jewish communities in Italy and Europe …Here ends my newer update to original review, continuing below …- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -I read this book several years ago, and every so often see something about it here on GR.

Levi is well known as a survivor of Auschwitz, a writer of great talent and great humanity. He died (a probable suicide) in 1987.I thought what I'd do here is give a link to a recent article in the New Yorker by James Wood. It's basically a Levi retrospective, and (without mentioning the new book at all, unless I missed it in a sentence) presumably written to coincide with The Complete Works of Primo Levi, published about a week ago in three slip-cased volumes, with an Introduction by Toni Morrison.Wood discusses The Periodic Table extensively in the piece, and also writes movingly of Levi's memoirs, available together in If This Is a Man / The Truce.http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/201.... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Previous review: Ornament of the WorldRandom review: Classics for PleasureNext review: Almost No Memory Lydia DavisPrevious library review: My Brilliant Friend Elena FerranteNext library review: The Wine-Dark Sea"
6,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31384949-ian,5,"There was an occasion last year when I had to hang around for a few hours in a town about 40 miles from where I live – my car was in for repair. As is my wont, I spent the time in a bookshop, and eventually was there long enough to feel guilty about not buying anything. I’d heard of Primo Levi and of some of his books, so decided to settle on taking this one away.I found this kind of wonderful. Mainly, it consists of snippets from the author’s life and especially his career as a chemist, with each chapter ingeniously linked to one of the atomic elements. Some of the events described are commonplace (others anything but) but each story forms part of a meditation on life. The quality of the writing is outstanding. I realise of course that I’ve read a translation, so credit to translator Raymond Rosenthal for creating such a superb version of the original. The edition I read was in paperback form, but if I’d had this on my Kindle there would have been so much text highlighted that it might have formed the majority the book. My only slight reservation was that, along with the autobiographical pieces, the book included 3 fictional short stories. I liked the last chapter, “Carbon” but was bit less taken with the other two stories, “Lead” and “Mercury”. The author more or less tells us what he was trying to achieve with “Lead” and I thought that was OK, but I was a bit less keen on “Mercury”. I would maybe take a half-star off for those aspects, but overall, 4.5 stars rounded up. Deservedly a classic."
7,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26706841-steven-godin,4,"I have to admit as I spent most of my science and chemistry lessons staring out the window daydreaming my knowledge of the Periodic Table sucks, Primo Levi has now changed all that. Using each element to fascinating effect in his own experiences, from the classrooms and studies of his youth through fascist Italy to his capture by the Nazi's and ultimate test of the human spirit to rally and remain mentally strong to survive to tell of the aftermath also. The linking of stories to eponymous elements is in a few cases purely metaphorical — in the opening piece the inertness of Argon represents characteristics of his ancestors, Sephardic Jews in Savoy. Levi worked as a chemist, however, and a thread running through the books is what it is to be a chemist, to wrestle with matter; the connection of the stories with elements is usually quite immediate, though sometimes circumstantial rather than substantial. One thing I learned in the second half of reading, he was a seriously intelligent guy and as a free-lance chemical consultant and problem solver the talk baffled the hell out of me!. The shifts in tone make this stand out from similar writings and each small segment can quickly change your perceptions. An interesting and important piece of true life story telling. "
8,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul,4,"4.5 starsThis is a collection of short stories, twenty-one in all, each one named after an element of the periodic table. In the UK the Royal Institution has voted it the best science book ever. There is a variety of stories: some are very personal memoirs, a few are fictional, some look at industrial processes and there is a good deal about the nature of words. Sometimes Levi does describe a search for a particular element, but in others he uses the fundamentals of the element for comparative purposes. In Argon he uses its almost complete inertness as a symbol for the marginalisation of his Piedmontese Jewish ancestors.Levi explains his passion for chemistry and the reasons for his pursuit of it as a career; as always the reasons are complex:“I have often suspected that, deep down, the motives for my boyhood choice of chemistry were different from the ones I rationalised and repeatedly declared. I became a chemist not (or not only) from a need to understand the world around me; not in reaction to the cloudy dogmas of Fascism; and not in the hope of riches or scientific glory; but to find, or create, an opportunity to exercise my nose.”Levis also writes well and tells a good story and there is a lyricism to his writing and even humour:“Zinc, Zinck, zinco: they make tubs out of it for laundry, it is not an element which says much to the imagination, it is grey and its salts are colourless, it is not toxic, nor does it produce striking chromatic reactions; in short, it is a boring metal. It has been known to humanity for two or three centuries, so it is not a veteran covered with glory like copper, nor even one of those newly minted elements which are still surrounded by the glamour of their discovery.”There is a poignancy to it as well, as when he leaves a job at a nickel mine to go to a lab in Milan, describing his essential belongings:“..my bike, Rabelais, the Macaronaeae, Moby Dick translated by Pavese, a few other books, my pickaxe, climbing rope, logarithmic ruler, and recorder.”The most powerful piece in the collection is Vanadium. It is post war and the firm Levi is working for has a query about the quality of some compound being purchased from a firm in Germany. He begins a correspondence with his opposite number. Gradually he realizes that he knows the man, a civilian scientist in the war who worked for the Nazis and he met him in Auschwitz. Levi explores his feelings and reactions to a man who was not unkind to him, but who essentially was a moral coward in the face of evil. The last chapter on carbon could be described as a little sentimental, but I can forgive Levi that. This isn’t a book about science, although there is plenty of science in it; it’s about humanity and the quirks and idiosyncrasies of everyday life. Levi is a good storyteller expressing human warmth, puzzlement and a sense of justice. A must read. "
9,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graye,4,"The Connotations of the ElementsAll elements have been named in a more or less arbitrary manner: after people, places or mythological characters. To those who named them, if not necessarily us, these names had metaphorical connotations. For non-scientists, this significance might be lost in the scientific haze that befuddles us.One achievement of Primo Levi's novel is to revive the power of the metaphors. Each element he has chosen represents a person, an experience or a story. Each chapter named after an element assumes both an individual and a collective power.The collective power resides in the periodic table. The tabular presentation of elements not only identifies each element, but, because of the way it has been structured, it also defines their relationships.In this way, Levi's periodic table symbolises individuals, families, societies and nations.A Literate ChemistScience is the foundation of society, even if most of us have forgotten. It took a literate chemist capable of striding over the two cultures, scientific and creative, to remind us.Levi recognised that elements rarely manifest themselves to us in a pure, unadulterated form. They appear in combinations, either as mixtures (such as air) or compound molecules.It was only in the 17th century that scientists started to devote a lot of effort to distinguishing the elements from each other. They had to be separated. They had to be purified, but only for analytical purposes. Then, with greater knowledge of their properties, they could be artificially joined as new compounds.There was no particular functional value in the unadulterated purity of a single element in its own right (apart from any beauty that precious metals like silver and gold might be perceived to have).Enchantment and AdulterationLevi reached this conclusion from a scientific point of view. The nature of matter is what is of concern to a scientist or chemist. Still, he managed to find enchantment in matter and its adulteration. It is the stuff of life. Without adulteration, there would be no life and no diversity.Bit by bit, over the course of the book, he communicates his enthusiasm, happiness and satisfaction to us. It is the wonder of someone who is truly alive.Racial PurityEqually importantly, Levi extended the metaphor of adulteration to the type of social and political discourse that emerged in the time of Fascism.The German and Italian Fascists were trying to achieve purity of their respective races (Professor Googlewiki informs me that in 1921 Mussolini referred to the Italians as the Mediterranean branch of the Aryan race. He later denounced ""Nordicism"", although the issue continued to simmer). They regarded other races, in particular Jews, as threats to racial purity. Jews supposedly adulterated Aryan perfection. They had to be eliminated.What was missing was a perception of different races as different elements in the periodic table. The universe does not consist solely of one element. There are numerous elements, and all of them have a role, large or small, in making the particular universe that we inhabit. No one element can be said to adulterate the universe.Matter and SpiritRace is a product of matter. The Fascists tried to add weight, ironically a rhetorical mass or gravitas, to their arguments by resorting to the language of spirituality. They believed that a race, the matter behind the physical manifestation of the race, has a spirit. However, the spirit, according to Fascism, is superior to and dominates matter. It is the desire to preserve and perpetuate the spirit that motivated the political movement behind Fascism.To do so, other mass, other spirit had to be perceived as inferior, incorrect, defective, deviant, an impurity, something deserving of elimination.Just as in metallurgy, ore had to be refined: the target metal had to be separated and the impurities discarded on the mullock heap of life or death.The Fascist modus operandi was to send Jews to extermination camps. Levi, a Jewish chemist, was fortunate to survive the experience, because of the value of his scientific skills.Tales of Militant ChemistryFor all the horror that the author experienced and witnessed, his novel is not just a compendium of ""tales of militant chemistry"". It is an exercise in tolerance of those who would commit or permit evil, as long as they are prepared to repent. His message is one of forgiveness for those who acknowledge the wrong they did.The chapters are named after 21 elements. I haven't tried to analyse why each one of these elements was chosen or whether there is any significance in the order. I'm sure that, if you were prepared to put in the effort, it would be like understanding the structure of Joyce's ""Ulysses"".These are a Few of My Favourite ElementsThe novel starts with 
Argon,
 an inert gas, one incapable of aggregation with other elements. Levi applies it to his Jewish family, although he denies that they were wholly inactive:""The little that I know about my ancestors presents many similarities to these gases. Not all of them were materially inert...on the contrary, they were - or had to be - quite active, in order to earn a living and because of a reigning morality that held that 'he who does not work shall not eat.' But there is no doubt that they were inert in their inner spirits, inclined to disinterested speculation, witty discourses, elegant, sophisticated, and gratuitous discussion. ""It can hardly be by chance that all the deeds attributed to them, though quite various, have in common a touch of the static, an attitude of dignified abstention, of voluntary (or accepted) relegation to the margins of the great river of life. Noble, inert, and rare: their history is quite poor when compared to that of other illustrious Jewish communities in Italy and Europe...""They were never much loved or much hated...Nevertheless, a wall of suspicion, of undefined hostility and mockery, must have kept them substantially separated from the rest of the population...As is always the case, the rejection was mutual."" 
Phosphorus,
 a rare but vital element, applies to a brief love interest, which never really eventuated because of the war:""We are not dissatisfied with our choices and with what life has given us, but when we meet we both have a curious and not unpleasant impression (which we have both described to each other several times) that a veil, a breath, a throw of the dice deflected us onto two divergent paths, which were not ours."" 
Gold
 is the river Dora, which represents youth, joy, life and friendship (even when it is lost). The 
Silver
 chapter details the reunion of two friends, ""two positive heroes,"" at the 25th anniversary of their graduation:""Each of us would gather more stories like this one, in which stolid matter manifests a cunning intent upon evil and obstruction.""The name of the element 
Vanadium
 derives from the Old Norse ""Vanadis"", which is one of the variants of the name of the goddess of love, Freya or Freydis (who might also be familiar to W. T. Vollmann fans). It is the chapter in which Levi explores forgiveness and repentance, a way out of the horror of the Holocaust.This is What Matters The final chapter is 
Carbon.
 Here, Levi acknowledges that his book is neither a chemical treatise nor an autobiography, except to the extent that, like every other piece of writing, it is ""partial and symbolic"". Instead, it is a ""micro-history"" with a scattering of ""sad tatters [and] trophies"", both failures and successes.Yet, this chapter asserts how fundamental to life are atoms, elements of the periodic table. Carbon atoms travel from one form of life to another, from an organic form to an intermediate inorganic form, back to organic life. Carbon atoms travel through time, passing on their characteristics to other matter around them.The focus of this chapter is elements, atoms, molecules. Chemical energy becomes mechanical energy, and mechanical energy generates heat. ""Such is life.""Yet, the great beauty of the novel is that it tells the story of people living, loving, giving birth, parenting, and perpetuating both life and love over the ages.This is matter. This is what matter does. This is what matters. The Marvel of DiversityBy the end of the novel, you marvel at humanity and its diversity. You value each and every life. No thing doesn't matter. No life doesn't matter. The novel subtly encourages you to care. It makes you want to behave like you care. Conversely, you struggle to understand that Fascists might have looked at the same people as we do, and didn't care.This novel is almost an afterthought to two earlier works by Levi about the Holocaust (""If This Is a Man"" and The Truce""). It even leaves gaps where the earlier books would have fit. It houses them, makes a home for them. It is a periodic table into which these other elements fit perfectly. This novel is rich in its own right, but it invites us to read his other works, to wander around the whole periodic table, one element at a time.The sense of this man, Primo Levi, who is now no longer with us, makes me want to read his other works, so that, like an atom of carbon, his legacy of vitality, creativity, love and forgiveness, can live on, transcending both his life and his death."
10,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a book of memoirs by Italian chemist, Primo Levi. On one level, the book is an autobiography. Each chapter has the name of an element of the periodic table, and the chapter relates some episode in Levi's life that has some relationship to that element.On another level, the book is about the tragedy of the Holocaust. Primo Levi and his fellow chemists lived through the beginning of the war by pushing the war out of their minds. They saw the war for what it was; they had a fateful attitude, in that they could not do anything about it. But, in 1944 Levi was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. The life expectancy for an inmate at the camp was three months, but Levi defied the odds. He remained alive for 11 months, when the Soviet Army liberated the camp. Perhaps the most poignant chapter is about a post-war meeting he had with one of the German guards at the concentration camp.This book is written in beautiful prose, on a high aesthetic level. Levi comes across as a gentle soul, but does not wallow in sentimentalism. Much of the book is about his studies and his early jobs as a chemist. His writing about the Holocaust is very matter-of-fact. The book is rather short, and it is not a difficult book to read. "
11,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward,5,"This was a pleasant surprise: not at all the mournful account I had expected. The Periodic Table is Levi’s autobiography told thorough his work; an expression of his love for the chemists’ art and trade, and though the war and holocaust (being inseparable from his life) are part of the story, they not central to it (he wrote about these in more detail in other books, which I have not yet read). I enjoyed Levi’s light, enthusiastic tone, his intimacy and passion, and the stories themselves, which are a mix of the real and the whimsical. Through these stories Levi hints at a human world filed with as many potential permutations and ways of being as the underlying chemical world; a world where all matter shares a common ontology and a common teleology. When I was young I had an interest in chemistry, which faded after a year of classes that were preoccupied with esoteric theory and taxonomy. Had I read The Periodic Table during this time in my life, Levi’s impassioned accounts of trial and discovery may have convinced me to persevere."

The Periodic Table consists of 21 stories and each story refers to one of the 21 chemical elements. Chemistry was vital in Primo Levi's life. He not only worked as a chemist before and after the war, but it probably also saved him in Auschwitz, where he was selected for work in a laboratory. Chemistry also gave him security, in a world in which he felt himself insecure. The stories give an insight in Primo Levi's life history and in his work as a chemist. There are also a couple of fictional stories. 

For me, the most interesting stories were his autobiographical stories. I didn't like his fantasy stories (Lead and Mercury), nor the final story which I found too mystical (Carbon). Although for the most part the theme of chemistry in his stories was really fascinating, there were also a few moments that I felt the chemistry theme was too elaborate.

“In order for the wheel to turn, for life to be lived, impurities are needed, and the impurities of impurities in the soil, too, as is known, if it is to be fertile. Dissension, diversity, the grain of salt and mustard are needed: Fascism does not want them, forbids them, and that’s why you’re not a Fascist; it wants everybody to be the same, and you are not.

16,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419287-jessica,4,"Finally, an argument in favor of being forced to read books! I hated the beginning of this and fell asleep twice during the first chapter, so I never would've kept on going if I hadn't had to for school. But The Periodic Table got progressively better then finally peaked at the end, as is my personal preference for books. I cried for like twenty minutes after I finished this, though I'm not sure if that had to do more with Primo Levi or with my own lady hormones.In any case, though it took me awhile to get into it, I did really like this book and recommend it, especially if you're interested in chemicals. Levi insists that it's fiction, not autobiography, but it feels very true, whether it all is or not. Each chapter is structured around an element from the periodic table, and tells the life story of an Italian Jewish chemist who grows up under Fascism, survives the Holocaust, and then works -- among other things -- as a varnish manufacturer. I haven't read Levi's Holocaust stuff, but the way that experience is handled here is unexpected and moving -- there is a little bit about it, but basically he's like, ""I already wrote that book"" and elides most of it, so the story is more about how his life continues on after that. Again, slow start for me but ultimately got into the Big Shit in a strikingly human, profound, and lovely way."
17,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,5,"I had to think for awhile to decide which adjective seemed to best sum up Primo Levi’s writings, and finally decided on “graceful.” His stories are perfectly formed, plotted out with an introduction to set the scene, exposition to fill out the narrative, and a clear conclusion. And yet, they never feel artificial or contrived; they flow smoothly, and it is easy to imagine him telling them to friends over a glass of wine at the neighborhood trattoria.The stories start with events from his formative years, early in the Fascist regime, when Jews were still treated as outsiders, as they always had been, but were not actively oppressed. The proscriptive laws would come later, and while Mussolini’s Italy had concentration camps and plenty of brutes and thugs, depravity for the sake of depravity was uncommon until the Nazis took over the country in 1943. In these first stories Levi studies chemistry, makes mistakes such as almost burning down the building he was in, and learns mountain climbing. He has a good eye for describing the people he meets and works with, especially their mannerisms and quirks. Even the ones who are obvious fools are treated with a light touch; Levi smiles at them but never takes away their humanity.He treated his experience in Auschwitz in other books, and only touches on it in this one. He first describes his time in a partisan group that had more enthusiasm than aptitude, and which was quickly betrayed and rounded up by the Fascists. Levi made the mistake of admitting to one of his interrogators that he was a Jew, and was deported to Auschwitz, where he spent eleven months. This itself was an extraordinary act of survival, since few slave laborers lived through more than eight weeks of starvation, beatings, and forced labor. His chemistry skills saved him, and he got a job in the Buna artificial rubber plant, but death was never far away. He tells a story of finding and stealing a jar of iron-cerium rods, used to light oxyacetylene torches, which he and a friend ground down to make flints for cigarette lighters. Each flint could be traded for a day’s ration of bread, which meant survival for a few more weeks. They had to do the work late at night in secret, because they would have been hanged if one of the prisoner informers had told the Germans what they were doing. More by luck than anything else Levi did manage to live long enough to greet the Russians when they arrived in January 1945.The immediate postwar years were grim throughout Europe. Levi got a job as a chemist in a factory that made paint and varnish, and worked in a partially destroyed building where every window pane was broken. The best tale in the collection takes place here, as he is asked to investigate a ruined batch of paint to see what could be done. The tale unfolds like a detective story as he investigates the problem and searches for clues. He eventually finds a solution and the batch of paint is saved. His reward is a raise and two new bicycle tires, which at a time when all consumer goods were in short supply, were probably more valuable than the money. There is even a delightfully absurd coda to the story. Years later, he learns that the factory is still applying the fix he developed, even though it was needed only for that one bad batch, and applying it to properly made paint was not only unnecessary, but lowered the quality of the product. And so it goes….The most moving of the later stories relates an event from years after the end of the war, when Levi, in the course of routine business correspondence with one of his firm’s suppliers, realizes that he is dealing with one of the former German supervisors from the chemical plant in Auschwitz, someone Levi had interacted with during his imprisonment. Even back then Levi had considered this man clueless about the lives of the prisoners, as when he asked why they didn’t shave more often. The years since had not brought him any additional enlightenment, and when Levi asked him about the war and the camps his responses were evasive and perhaps willfully ignorant. He accepted no responsibility for his part in one of history’s darkest episodes, did not even realize that accountability was called for.Each of the stories in this collection is built around one of the chemical elements, although chemistry plays a secondary role to Levi’s examination of humanity and circumstance. Each of them is well told and worth reading, a fitting tribute to a fine and memorable writer."
18,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26071992-nooilforpacifists,5,"I had no idea what to expect. What I got exceeded any expectations--and my greatest expectations.Levi, an Italian Jewish Chemist, managed to get a PhD and stay employed until the Italians initially toppled Mussolini's Fascist government, provoking a Nazi invasion that returned Italy to the Axis, albeit as an occupied territory. Levi and his friends took to the mountains to fight as partisans, but were inexperienced and caught almost immediately. Levi admitted he was a Jew and was transferred to Auschwitz. All this I knew, and is told in Levi's autobiographical works such as ""If This Is A Man""--that I have yet to read. ""The Periodic Table"" is different. A set of 21 short essays, each named after an element, and linked to its chemical nature, they form a rough autobiography of Levi. But not every essay is personal; some are imaginative tales of ""types"" (one an over-obvious tying of the German mentality to a certain element); others political metaphors of fictional characters. Only a single chapter, Cerium, is written about Levi's time in Auschwitz, though about half the book is post-war--and Levi plainly never recovers.Yet, for all that, this is a tremendous science book. (I come from a long line of chemists; I'm the aberration.) Plus a worms-eye view of Italian history. And some of the most beautiful writing:""Our hands were at once coarse and weak, regressive, insensitive: the least trained part of our bodies. Having gone through the first fundamental experiences of play, they had learned to write, and that was all. They knew the convulsive grip around the branches of a tree, which we loved to climb out of a natural desire and also (Enrico and I) out of a groping homage to the origin of the species; but they were unfamiliar with the solemn, balanced weight of the hammer, the concentrated power of a blade, too cautiously forbidden us, the wise texture of wood, the similar and diverse pliability of iron, lead, and copper. If man is a maker, we were not men; we knew this and suffered from it.""""The factory of which he was the owner was on the outskirts of Milan, and I would have to move to Milan. It produced hormonal extracts: I, however, would have to deal with a very precise problem, that is, research into a new cure for diabetes, which would be effective if taken orally. Did I know anything about diabetes? Not much, I replied, but my maternal grandfather had died of diabetes, and also on my paternal side, several of my uncles, legendary devourers of pasta, had shown symptoms of the disease in their old age. Hearing this, the ""Commendatore"" became more attentive and his eyes smaller: I realized later that, since the tendency to diabetes is hereditary, it would not have displeased him to have at his disposal an authentic diabetic, of a basically human race, on whom he could test certain of his ideas and preparations.""""And yet Cerrato aroused my curiosity… He had not been compromised by Fascism, and he had reacted well to the reagent of the racial laws. He had been an opaque but reliable boy in whom one could trust: and experience teaches us that just this, trustworthiness, is the most constant virtue, which is not acquired or lost with the years. One is born worthy of trust, with an open face and steady eyes, and remains such for life. He who is born contorted and lax remains that way: he who lies to you at six lies to you at sixteen and sixty.""The penultimate chapter, called ""Vanadium,"" is the work's apex--riveting, emotional, and yet (typically) unresolved. The final chapter is a revision of a story/poem Levi first wrote while studying for his PhD. Despite its grounding in organic chemistry (Do they still make those CRC manuals? Brutal.), it's almost Eastern in its cyclic mysticism.Levi was depressed for years. He died in 1987 after falling three stories from his balcony. The coroner called the death a suicide. Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel disagreed: ""Primo Levi died at Auschwitz forty years later."" This book has vastly more joy than depression, especially for those who enjoy puzzles of any sort, even when translated into the search for chemical knowledge."

Some are great stories and often have a great ironic sense of humor. Others, well, they spoke less to me. I appreciated the idea as a motif, but as stated earlier, I feel the writing was uneven.In terms of the stories I appreciated most were:- Iron is the story of his capture as a partisan before being captured by the Nazis.- Uranium is the story of his life after the war in customer service- Vanadium is a confrontation with a former SS after the war- Carbon is a more fantastical story about how we are all connected and closes the volumeFino's Reviews of Books about the HolocaustNonfiction:If This Is A Man/The Truce by Primo LevyThe Periodic Table by Primo LevyThe Drowned and the Saved by Primo LevyThe Night by Elie WieselAuschwitz by Laurence ReesFiction:The Tatooist of Auschwitz by Heather MorrisCilka's Journey by Heather MorrisTravel to Krakow to visit Auschwitz:Krakow:City Guide [Blue Guides]"
20,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/763288-joshua,5,"Primo Levy was a chemist, a poet, and a novelist--a man of luminous imagination and spirit, despite his forced descent into darkness as an Italian Jew during World War II. This book is a memoir, with each chapter named after an element culled from the periodic table. In each chapter, Levy's awe for the alchemical power of the chemist shines through. But he has a poet's heart rather than a chemist's sterile exactitude. The opening chapter ""Argon"" describes how this element is much more common in the atmosphere than any other, but we are hardly aware of it, and he relates this fact to the comic yet lovingly evoked life of his family, who spoke a rare dialect of Italian Yiddish.The chapter ""Titanium"" is short and sweet, regaling the reader with the tale of a majestic house painter and a little girl, as he paints circle of titanium white housepaint around her and keeps her enthralled--the task of all great liars and storytellers. And Levy's yearning for the more ethereal life of the physicist as opposed to the hapless chemist, cooking up combustible potassium recipes and tapping potatoes for phosphorous in his lab, will ring true to those who deep down, long for a life of the mind. Truly, this book is as fundamental to life and how we might understand it as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen."
21,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,3,"Primo Levi (1919-1987) was an Italian Jewish chemist who survived Hitler's Holocaust. This is my second time to read a book by him. I read his first novel Survival in Auschwitz (3 stars) last year and I feel in love with it so that I had to make sure that I have this book and If Not Now, When?. These seem to be his trilogy of memoirs directly recalling his experiences in the concentration camps.This book is composed of short stories and annecdotes from before, during and after his life in Auschwitz. Each of those pieces of beautiful writing is somehow related to the an element or group of elements in the Periodic Table (that explains the title of the book). However, I think The London's Royal Institution on 19 October 2006 got it wrong when they voted this book onto the shortlist for the best science book ever written. The reason is, despite direct references to chemisty and the elements, this is a memoir and not a science book.There are also two seemingly Italian folklores and standalone short stories ""Lead"" and ""Mercury"" that are said to have been published separately. Other than those and the offplaced first story ""Argon"" everything else are about the Holocaust. My favorite part is when he was hired as a chemist and this explained well why he was able to survive his life in the concentration camps: his being a chemist made him stay inside the laboratory even if he was not doing anything except on how to steal food in every opportunity. I found this humorous now but of course, there was definitely not an iota of fun while he was doing all those stealings as one lapse could mean his life.I found Survival in Auschwitz (It This is a Man) too heavy but I of course liked it. The Periodic Table on the other hand is a sweet mixture of sadness, poignancy, fantasy, humour and a lot of chemistry. Even if one of my favorite subjects in high school and college was chemistry, there were just too many references for my taste as my schooling days were a least three decades ago and all I could recall about chemistry are some of the elements symbol, some salts, some valences, the carbon bond, parts of the Krebs cycle. That's it. But this book has a lot more.If you are a reader who has background in Chemistry and you dig the Holocaust stories, in movies and in prints, this book is for you. "
22,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4373783-dhanaraj-rajan,4,"From the Concluding Section of the Book:""The reader, at this point, will have realized for some time now that this is not a chemical treatise: my presumption does not reach so far - 'ma voix est foible, et meme un peu profane.' Nor is it an autobiography, save in the partial and symbolic limits in which every piece of writing is autobiographical, indeed every human work; but it is in some fashion a history. It is - or would have liked to be - a micro-history......""The point is made very clear by Primo Levi himself. But what is to be considered here is that Primo Levi was a Jew/prisoner in Auschwitz and among the handful few who survived the Holocaust. Thus, the micro-history becomes an important document of the time. I had already read P. Levi's Survival in Auschwitz and was struck by his account. It was like a third party observation seeking no sympathy and passing no judgment. Yet, the impact was poignant. Levi succeeds in this book as well to convey the message in 'a seemingly disinterested third party style but with a powerful after effects'.Here is a snippet from one of the episodes in which he speaks of his life after Auschwitz:""...I had returned from captivity three months before and was living badly. The things I had seen and suffered were burning inside of me, I felt closer to the dead than the living, and felt guilty at being a man, because men had built Auschwitz, and Auschwitz had gulped down millions of human beings, and many of my friends, and a woman who was dear to my heart.....""Finally:The episodes are organized under the title of chemical elements in the Periodic Table. Each element is symbolic of an event or a person that appears in that episode. Being a chemist, Levi knew the qualities of each element and the way they react. Like a chemistry teacher, he introduces the element to a novice in chemistry (a lay reader) and then all of a sudden jumps from chemistry to history. The whole history of Levi's family from its ancestry to his present state - a survivor of Auschwitz - is narrated in this book. History is a good teacher. So, read it."

He describes a small community during wartime, as he was pressured to extract more nickel for the war effort.""Lead"" is a short story that I think may be set in the early medieval period.

Primo Levy was a Doctor in Chemistry and in this work he takes pleasure in telling a variety of short stories relating to professional adventures in his young life, as well as some witty and humorous fictional projections.And finally some tragic memories of the time of heroic resistance to fascism, and his post-war encounter with Herr Müller, one of the German Officers he had to work for in Auschwitz when he was a prisoner there. Except for the last chapter which is based on painful memories, the other stories are delightful and often funny and humorous in style and always very original in ideas. In his own words, he said he wanted to see if he could communicate to the ordinary reader the taste, sharp and bitter, of the profession of chemistry, which is only one among others of the means of making a living. He said it was unfair the world should know all about the lives of doctors, of prostitutes, of sailors, of murderers, of a countess, of Ancient Rome and Greece, and nothing of the chemist. What he wanted to show was the life of the individual chemist, inexperienced and on foot, as he was himself in his young years.This book makes up for the dark and sad impression a reader could have had of Primo Levi's first work, his memories of Auschwitz ""Si c'est un Homme."" LE SYSTEME PERIODIQUE is a pleasure to read and very recommendable."
25,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33276635-chaunceton-bird,4,"Based on its title and it having been named by the Royal Institution of Great Britain as ""the best science book ever,"" I thought this would be a science book. But it's not. It is something of a memoir, told in short stories, about an Italian chemist (who happens to be Jewish) navigating the late 1930s and early to mid 1940s. Through each short story Mr. Levi brings to life one of the elements of the periodic table. It's an excellent, entertaining book. "
26,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28280419-jan,5,"Although the ‘Periodic Table’ is recognized by the Royal Institute of Britain as ‘the best science book ever written,’ it really not a science book. It’s a memoir, it is philosophy, and it is written by gentle soul. The book arrived with high praise from Bellow, Roth, Calvino and Eco.It came 30 years after Primo Levi’s famous ‘If This is Man’ (or 'Survival in Auschwitz’ in the US) which was written in 1946, almost immediately after his 11 months in Auschwitz. He said he wrote it because he had a moral duty and a psychological need to bear witness to what he experienced. He and other inmates feared no one would believe what was being done. Plus, he said all the very best men died in the camps. (Levi survived only because his education as a chemist was useful in making synthetic rubber.) His fears were on target and for ten years there was no interest in his story. His writing is vastly different than Wiesel and his background in science lends for a very calm, dispassionate, almost detached reporting of his factual observations, but he was always searching for reasons. For example, he concluded the excesses in violence were probably done to dehumanize the victims so the oppressors would feel less guilt about their murders.‘Periodic Table’ is more contemplative than 'If this is Man' and devotes only one chapter to Auschwitz. Levi reminisces about his early life in school as a very shy, awkward youth, the joy he found in science, and his respect for working, especially the pleasure of problem-solving. Separated by 30 years from the events of the 1940s, there is more serenity, more reflection and more follow-up conclusions - this is not an angry or brooding book.In 1987 at age 67, Levi fell four stories from his balcony and died. The coroner ruled it suicide and his biographers generally agree. There was no suicide note; however, he had just finished his last book, ‘The Drowned and the Saved.’ Some say the book was his suicide note as he wrote: ‘. . . this injury cannot be healed.’ Levi told of ‘a dream full of horror (that) has still not ceased to visit me, at sometimes frequent, sometimes longer, intervals. . . I am sitting at a table with my family, or with friends, or at work, or in the green countryside . . . yet I feel a deep and subtle anguish, the definite sensation of an impending threat . . . everything collapses, and disintegrates around me, the scenery, the walls, the people, while the anguish becomes more intense and more precise. Now everything has changed into chaos; I am alone in the center of a grey and turbid nothing, and now, I know what this thing means, and I also know that I have always known it; I am in the Lager (the death camp) once more, and nothing is true outside the Lager.Upon hearing of his death, Elie Wiesel said: ‘Primo Levi died at Auschwitz forty years earlier.’Levi was actually a secular humanist. He said 'I was not a believer; I am not now a believer. Spirit is something you can’t touch. At that time it seemed to me an official lie insisting upon something you can’t experience with your eyes, your ears, with your fingers.’ He was sent to Auschwitz because of his Jewish heritage.He was a man of the rational era, someone who took pleasure in the wonders of the world believing everything around him was a mystery to be solved, someone who sought to understand suffering in the world, someone who wrote with a calmness and with integrity.An extraordinary book."
27,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy,4,"An odd-ball blend of autobiography and short fictions, organized around a motif that would be almost cute if Levi didn't approach everything in his life with somber, intelligent reflection. As odd as it sounds, this is exactly the sort of writing I would expect from a life-long chemist. Even when he waxes heavy on entomological minutia, (something which I think he gets from his fellow Italian, Vico), this is all clearly the product of a highly analytical mind. He barely touches on what happened to him in Auschwitz here, but you can feel the weight of it pressing down almost constantly. The old world haunts, as ever."
28,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,4,"Primo Levi may or may not have committed suicide in 1987 and it is all too convenient for myth-makers to say, as Elie Wiesel did, that Levi had died at Auschwitz forty years earlier.However, there is one section of this book - Vanadium - where one understands the possibility of existential despair for Levi, his exchange with a German who was 'on the other side' at Auschwitz.It is not that the German was wholly obtuse and certainly the man knows that bad things were done. By all 'conventional' standards, he is not a 'bad man' - indeed, he reminds one of Arendt's description of evil as fundamentally banal.But the world views of victim and (relatively) minor participant are so utterly different that the only conclusion to be drawn is that empathy is always going to be the human exception rather than the human rule.The Royal Institution awarded this book the title of 'best science book ever written' in 2006 (it was written in 1975) but it isn't. This is pure sentimentality - rather it is a very well written series of memoirs and some stories, hung together around a scientific theme. It is, in fact, a bit of a mish-mash and it is perhaps time to 'toughen up' and stop missing the point. If Levi was defined by his experience in Auschwitz, the world has colluded out of what can only be described as a mass guilt trip that, I think, insults the dead.We know now that - separated from the eurocentric view that rediscovered Nazi attrocities in the 1960s and after - the human species is capable of atrocity by its very nature. We live in a world of discovered and new atrocities, of Milgram experiments and Rwanda.Primo Levi's testimony is important because he was in the heart of hell but we diminish him by patronising him. He does not come to terms with anything in this book and we should not either - we cannot 'empathise' or believe we have any conception of what he experienced.Indeed, that is the flaw of the book - a set of incidents for which the periodic table is an excuse skirt around the elephant in the room, a 'why' that has no answer. It is as if he is clearing his mental deck of thoughts and memories but we come out none the wiser as to the reality. We are filled with sympathy but blocked from anything but a very sentimentalised empathy.At the end of this book, I deeply cared about this man - not humanity - but this man and in that sense the book is a success insofar as it helps us see each victim of these grinding machines to be a person.But it takes us no nearer to coherence or understanding. The lack of anger or rage in itself seems to be taken as a good sign, that Levi was not a man who hated or seeked vengeance. I disagree.The sweet reasonableness is what most people want to see but it does not look like a truth, only a repression out of confusion. Levi never ever says he forgives here or elsewhere. He is simply pining in 'Vanadium' for a German to understand what it is to be Primo Levi.The tragedy is not only that the German does not understand what it is to be Primo Levi but, bluntly, none of us do. If we claim to do, because of his fine writing, then we are self-deluding liars.The praise and the awards and the claims about the man are almost piling insult on injury. No one understands what it is to be Primo Levi any more than anyone can understand who it is to be me or you.Atrocity is now understand to be common enough - Stalin and Mao were both responsible for more deaths than Hitler. It cannot be great to be in Guantanamo or see your family blown to bits in a drone attack or macheted in Rwanda - but each person in each atrocity is unique.Worse, the dead person no longer suffers - only those left behind suffer and we cannot 'get' this essential injustice where we cannot be sure whether it is better to be alive or dead.So, Levi is important because of what he fails to be able to say not because of what he actually says. Who knows what he thought on the night of his death but it is a fair guess that he would have given up all his writing just to know that someone, anyone, could actually communicate that they knew precisely what he had become because of the cold brutality of others. It just can't be done. So, by all means read this book and get what you can from it (including insights into life in pre-war Italy) but do not expect to really understand what is going on here.Or, at the least, read and re-read 'Vanadium' and be humbled at the inexpressible sadness of the human condition. Sometimes, all that is left is a respectful loving silence. Literature is an ambiguous friend in such circumstances. "

More dangerous are [those] ready to believe and act without asking questions."" - Primo LeviThe Periodic Table traces Levi's family history using the chart of elements. London's Royal Institution voted it one of the greatest science books ever written.From the July 31st edition of The Writer's Almanac:It's the birthday of writer Primo Levi, born in Turin, Italy (1919.) He came of age when Mussolini was in power and, as was expected, he joined the movement for young Fascists as a teen. He was fascinated by science and graduated with a degree in industrial chemistry, but his diploma listed him ""of Jewish race,"" and he was unable to find work in his field. Two years later, his family was forced to flee Mussolini's forces and he joined the partisan resistance. His group was taken prisoner, and on February 21, 1944, he and 650 other Italian Jews were transported to the concentration camps at Auschwitz. When the camp was liberated by the Red Army almost a year later, Levi was one of only 20 of that group who survived.A year after returning home, he met and fell in love with his future wife, Lucia, when she offered to teach him to dance at a New Year's Eve party. She also encouraged him to take up writing and he began to document his experience in the camps. He found work at a paint factory, but rather than commute he stayed at the plant during the week and used the quiet time at night to draft his first novel, If This Is a Man. A small press published it in 1947, but 10 years later, it had only sold 1,500 copies. Levi worked with a translator, and in 1958, the book was released in the U.S. under the title Survival at Auschwitz. He followed with books of poetry and more memoirs, including ...this book."

This story is Levi's memoir of his time before and after his time in Auschwitz. Each chapter gets its title from a different element from the Periodic table and each chapter describes how, as a chemist in his native Italy, he got work using that particular element and also his life as a Jew, which in the years leading up to his imprisonment, changed his status to an exile in his own country. Levi lived in the Piedmontese Jewish community as laws arose that outlawed his very existence as well as the existence of his communnity. He could no longer openly work as a Jew yet managed to work until he was transported to Auschwitz. It was an interesting story, but also a little strange because he kept interweaving his work as a chemist with the different elements with the complicated relationships he had with his co-workers and also his friends. Much of it was rather surreal to me.Nevertheless, I am glad I read it because it offered new insight as to how it would be to live in a country and to suddenly become a pariah, where a new reality arrived and people who had liked me, had been my friends, no longer knew me, out right rejected me, or in an act of profound courage, struggled to be my friend or hire me as an employee.Levi wrote this in the 1960s, so we know that he survived those years and that he wrote this while looking back at a distant time, which may have allowed him to reflect with a greater emotional detachment than when he was just coming out of the Terror."

It's a quest that's never ceased to capture the collective imagination of millions of people through the ages, all contributing their own part to this shared endeavor. But it's been more than just an external search, as Primo Levi shows us.The premise of this collection, while simple, is rather unique. Each short story is named after a chemical element, and features characters or situations with the characteristics of said element, as well as the element itself. The stories are set against the backdrop of World War II, and the long shadow it casts on Levi's own life. The hardiness of Italy's Jewish community, the rapt curiosity of boyhood, the hopeful first flush of love, the horrors of war, the dogged struggle to stay alive...Mirroring his own professional trade, Levi manages to transmute the raw elements of the craft of writing and storytelling into something so much more than a series of stories on chemicals. Each story explores a different facet of humanity and human nature, with Levi's own dreams featuring to highlight these explorations.Levi's masterful writing, with its flourishes, and descriptions of brings out the magic he sees in the art of chemistry and how he sees human nature in similar terms. He manages to extract an entire host of emotions, dreams, and visions from the art of working with matter, and distill this mix to its very essence, as a mix of various elements in constant flux.It's easy to see why this collection was named 'best science book ever'. Pick it up, and it will not disappoint."

Anyhow, it ended up being one of the most entertaining reads of the year and I discovered a very unique type of book in the process.* It is fiction, by the author's own assertion, but it's very much grounded in his own life as a chemist. The stories of the book combine – in a thematic framework given by the chemical elements of the periodic table – autobiography, fictional elements and real chemistry to make up a vivid picture of what it was like to be a Jew in Italy during Mussolini's rule, WWII, and the aftermath of the war. They speak of the Jewish community, they speak of growing up, playing with chemistry in school and college and of his status as a chemist during the war and after it ended, a period which, for him, was always tainted by it.That he does until the last story about carbon, which narrates a fictional, but perfectly possible, journey which one atom of carbon takes until it is metabolised by his own body and leaves its own mark in the writing of the book. It is a chemist's praise of nature, our physical world and the processes that have shaped and continue to shape our universe. Come to think of it, this story is a deeply moving, profoundly atheistic praise of nature (since, apparently, Levi was very vehement in his atheism).OK, I admit, I was quite passionate about chemistry in middle school and I guess that's where some of the book's appeal to me was born. I would, however, be very interested to know the opinion of others, who have had less exposure to chemistry than me. The book transcends the rigid chemistry and is filled with human traits, feelings and experiences. Highly recommended!* small update: I remember reading a similar book by a Romanian author, Octavian Paler's Calomnii mitologice, a book of essays very much grounded in the author's own experience, but using both ancient and new(er) or more personal myths as thematic anchors."

He worried about passing his exams, he thrilled at having the title Doctor, he wanted a wife, he survived the camps, he worried about earning enough to eat. Through it all, some philosophical insights produced by chemistry sustain him as much as actual lab work of producing chemical reactions. This is a beautifully written work which explores the mysteries of survival. The framework is the life of a chemist during war time, but the stories are full of discovery and wonder at how people react to events.The fictional interludes were atmospheric; I think Levi was writing of incidents that moved his story forward while at the same time illustrating how without ultimate meaning it all was, other than being events in his life. Surviving a genocide must call into question if any human life has any real meaning or purpose. "

It's a portal into a lost world and a lost language, and into human lives that were snuffed out on principle. This sets the tone of The Periodic Table. Primo Levi comes off, ultimately, as a damaged person. Maybe that's all he went through, but he mostly recounts his professional and romantic failures, but rarely his successes. He doesn't come off as a whiner-- rather, I think, most of us can realize how we'd react in the same situations.Chemistry is a beautiful thing. It is utterly impassive to humanity. Levi loves to point out how the ambitions of mankind often run up against a hard wall of material reality, of chemistry and geology and physics. It might be his failure, it might be the failure of others, it might be the failure of the odd, abstract fictional characters that enter and leave the text. But dammit, we're going to keep on trying.Americans don't write stories like this. We want to think that we're special and that we can do anything we set our minds to, that our beliefs and feelings and minds matter. They don't. Fuck you. I appreciate a lot of continental European writers because they have the courage to say that: Camus, Calvino, and Sebald all come to mind, and in my mind, Primo Levi is among their ranks."

That Levi was able to keep his positive outlook on human beings and human nature after being tortured and thoroughly dehumanized by two fascist regimes, that he could keep his dry, ironic sense of humour and keep up his child-like wonder for a world which had often offered him only pain and degradation, is in a miracle-yet for Levi life and the world itself was an endless source of miracles, the never-ending wonders of chemistry and human nature are the elements which make up the essence of ‘The Periodic Table’ Levi starts with a brief if humorous account of various relatives and half-relatives and half-remembered relatives, a kind of eulogy to the lost world of Piedmontese Jewry, to its dialects and the noble inertia of the cranks and eccentrics who populated it. Yet the humorous tone is hiding something irrevocably tragic-that this culture was not lost via the vestiges of time but via the evil of the gas chamber, that these people who were deemed subhuman, sly and usurious, responsible for the fall of civilizations and depravation of a race, were just human beings, with the same quirks, foibles and eccentricities of any other people. As Levi states; “According to the above-mentioned regime, a Jew is stingy and cunning, but I was not particularly stingy or cunning, nor had my father been.” Levi found his answer to the dehumanization of both himself and all the other groups who fascists deemed sub-human via two things: chemistry (or science) and art. For many the two are not linked, yet for Levi the two are one and the same thing, if chemistry allows us to explore the elements and atoms which make up the world around us, then literature allows us to express their beauty-one cannot exist without the other; “It was enervating, nauseating, to listen to lectures on the problem of being and knowing, when everything around us was a mystery pressing to be revealed, the old wood of the benches, the sun’s sphere beyond the windowpanes and the roofs, the vain flight of pappus down in the June air. Would all the philosophers and all the armies in the world be able to construct a little fly? No, not even understand it…” For Levi the didactic nature of Nazism was the death of both science and art, once we open our eyes to the intransigence of Nazism we close our eyes to the beauty of the world, to the sanctity of life or to the beauty of an insignificant fly. Levi was distrustful of the dictatorial nature of Nazi scientists, of its unquestionable logic and unquenchable ignorance. For Levi the ideal scientist would be certain of nothing and uncertain of everything, he would constantly seek to test his views and hypotheses, for Levi science was merely his pathway to explore the wondrous nature of the universe; “My legs were shaking a bit, I experienced retrospective fear and at the same time a kind of foolish pride, at having confirmed a hypothesis and unleashed a force of nature. It was indeed hydrogen, therefore the same element that burns in the sun and stars, and from whose condensation the universes are formed in eternal silence.” Levi is able to counteract Nazi theories of racial purity via a scientific experiment via the importance of impurities in creating balance, that there was no such thing as purity without impurity and quite often is was impossible to differentiate between the two and know which was which; “the praise of purity, which protects from evil like a coat of mail; the praise of impurity, which gives rise to changes, in other words to life. In order for the wheel to turn, for life to be lived, impurities are needed, and the impurities of impurities in the soil too, as is known, if it is to be fertile. Dissension, diversity, the grain of salt and mustard are needed: fascism does not want them, forbids then, and that’s why you’re not a fascist; it wants everybody to be the same, and you are not.” For Levi art was another way of overcoming the degradation of fascism, it was an avenue for him to regain his humanity via his life, his memories and the people he loved and lost, whose individuality Levi is able to bring out and celebrate by comparing them to the various chemicals which make up ‘The Periodic Table’. “The things I had seen and suffered were burning inside of me; I felt closer to the dead than the living, and felt guilty about being a man, because men had built Auschwitz, and Auschwitz had gulped down millions of human beings, and many of my friend, and a woman who was dear to my heart. It seemed to me that I would be purified if I told the story…by writing I found peace for a while and felt myself become a man again, a person like everyone else, neither a martyr nor a debased saint: one of those who look to the future rather than the past.” Levi was fascinated by the rise of fascism, yet he was not one to propose simple solutions or to paint all Germans, or even all fascists with the same brush, however contemptuous he was of them. Take, for example, the case of Dr Muller, who rescued Levi from the gas chamber by giving him a job in a laboratory, yet turned a blind eye to the horrors of the holocaust, to the gas chambers and genocide, thinking them an anomaly, an unfortunate by-product of a well-meaning regime. This kind of mass myopia which took over the minds of so many German’s following the holocaust, this inability to admit that many good and honest people had taken part in or ignored the systematic dehumanization and destruction of an entire race, that the German people were unable to admit to their guilt was almost a bad a crime as fascism itself, because this collective exoneration would do nothing to prevent further atrocities from taking place. Fascism would never regard itself with ironic self-abasement like Levi, never know the stoic individuality of the heroic Sandro, never possess the vivacity of Guilia or the humility and wisdom of the old cobbler who had no wish to revenge himself on the upstart cobbler who tried to poison him. No fascist would ever know the beauty of phosphorous, the wonders of chemistry or the world around us. "

The book is named as a pun on an almost chronological tabling of anecdotes from the life of a (not ordinary) chemist. Each of the 21 chapters are tied loosely with the Elements which form the title of the chapters. And yet all chemistry is incidental.I loved chemistry in school, so much so that, I was able to understand the tests/experiments/processes described in the book. So the book seemed fascinating and at the same time like a scholarly article. The author slips in multiple metaphors from the world of chemistry and projects it onto the world.The couple of fiction stories inbetween - I did not find the place for the books (and maybe should have been kept outside like Lanthanides). The anecdotes linked with his life were a bit of mixed bag to me. I could not help feeling, this book in itself was more important to the author than the honesty of the content. Mixed bag.

I had not read his autobiographical works about life in Auschwitz. I'm actually glad that I read this book first because it gives such great insight into Levi's personality, especially his intelligence, ability to observe the world around him, and great love of life. You can take this understanding of him into your reading of Life in Auschwitz (original title: If This Is a Man). In the Periodic Table the Holocaust is always there behind the stories because you know Levi's history, but Auschwitz itself is the setting of only two short chapters. It's Levi's life as a free man in all its richness that dominates. His focus is on chemistry and its effect on his life -- from his first experiments in his friend's brother's prohibited lab to tales of his university years to accounts of interesting jobs he's had analyzing strange chemical phenomena. Each of the twenty-one short chapters is named for an element (argon, potassium, etc.) that plays a central role in the chapter's story. Throughout the book the war is there, however, and he writes of the growing sense of being a Jewish outsider in Italy and the looming sense of doom as the war progresses. I was drawn to the book because I was interested in how a chemist (who can write really well) sees the world. Levi's love of chemistry comes shining through -- especially his curiosity about chemical analysis and problem-solving. I left this book thinking more about the chemical world and how little I understand of it. I also left it eager to read Levi's account of Auschwitz, which I highly recommend along with this book."

It reminded me of Speak, Memory by Vladimir Nabokov in the way that we got snippets of events in Levi's life, in a non-traditional biographical format. Once I adjusted to this I started to enjoy the stories about friends and family and it was interesting to see how they related to different chemical elements, though this was never a dominant feature of the book. I can't help but compare it to Levi's If This Is a Man / The Truce about his experiences during and after WW2, which of course is a more powerful, raw and harrowing story. So I feel bad to say that I didn't enjoy this book as much. However it was a great addition in learning about Levi's younger life and it was brilliantly written as usual."

Not only is it a great book on science, it's also brilliantly and wonderfully written. Levi has the intelligence of Borges, but deploys it more judiciously, to enliven his stories rather than as the basis of them. He also has the power to inspire wonder for our world and to make insightful observations about man and our relation to it.I feel like this is a book that, if read early enough in one's life, could have the power to change the entire course of it. You can see why the Royal Institute voted it the best science book ever written, even if the actual amount of scientific content is not so very high. Is there any better description of the process of scientific enquiry than:""... one should not surrender to incomprehensible matter, one must not just sit down. We are here for this - to make mistakes and to correct ourselves, to stand the blows and hand them out. We must never feel disarmed: nature is immense and complex, but it is not impermeable to the intelligence; we must circle around it, pierce and probe it, look for the opening or make it.""These are words that should be engraved above the entrances of scientific institutions and in the minds of students everywhere.I found particular joy in the chapters ""Potassium"", in which Levi warns of the dangers of ""the practically identical"" with a storytelling prowess bordering on the magical, and ""Chromium"", which delightfully illustrates both the investigational scientific process in action and the tendency of recieved wisdom to persist even when harmful.One word of warning: opening chapter ""Argon"" requires much more work than the rest of the book, so I would recommend either leaving it to last or ensuring you carry straight on to ""Hydrogen"" afterwards, to ensure you don't become discouraged.Because as Saul Bellow says on my edition's cover, ""This is a book it is necessary to read."""

Would you please read and find his reasons yourself why he started with those particular elements? Why not, say, Oxygen since it's quite common to general readers? Enjoy!"

Although some stories are less-rated by me, I have a very strong feeling that if I reread it at some point, that i will understand them much better and relate more, so as to be able to give this a higher rating. Most of the stories here form a part of his memoir: from his teenage days, through his times during WWII in Italy and then at Auschwitz, and finally as a post-Holocaust survivor. Only two stories are fantastical fiction which too are wonderful.Levi's awesome prose makes the stuff of (his as well as others') living such a wonder to read!! With writing about his own dynamics with others, and all the nuanced thoughts that he injects into the minds of the readers using clear and superb analogies, I see his ways as purely and so uniquely his own! There is absolutely no doubt about it, considering that I have been fascinated to see such a thing in this title, as being his fourth of his books that I have read. Although some of his stories here have received a mediocre rating from me, I believe that it is completely subjective. Some parts of his few stories I may not have been able to relate very well, or because of his inclusion of difficult language at certain times, leaves a lot of more potential in a reread. I am, most certainly, tempted to rate this as a five-star, but a four should suffice at this point, although that is just from me. Would highly recommend this book!! :D"

In fact most of the book is about Levi's upbringing among secular Piedmontese Jews, and life as a simple chemist after the war. (A brief section takes place in a camp, presumably Auschwitz, and he refers to his writing about it ""elsewhere""(say, If This Is a Man).) Levi's voice is that of a lighthearted and diligent man of science, awkward with women and harbouring secret literary ambitions. (The book includes two early, unpolished, short stories.) It ends with an interaction with a German who supervised his work in Auschwitz, who applauds his ""Christian forgiveness"" and seems to feel that bygones are bygones. Levi thinks the man ""hasn't got a clue"". But overall this is a chemist's memoir, an attempt to portray the tactile, overwhelming magic of chemistry, the study of matter in its most basic and universal form. "

After all, it had beaten Charles Darwin's magnum opus, and with a title like this, the book should spit out serious top-notch chemistry trivia, right? Well, time to dampen those expectations a bit.So, I found it really fast that this is not a pop-sci book, no no.... This is basically a science-themed autobiography and memoir based on experiences of author during and after the Facist regime of Italy, where he was captured by Germans (his memoir on experiences in concentration camp is titled 'If this is a man'). As ignorant as I am, I got to know a great deal about Mussolini's regime and Fascism through this book, which was a plus.The 21 chapters of this book are each organised around an element, which features in the chapter itself. The writing is pretty smooth, not pretentious at all. What I really liked about the book was its matter-of-fact attitude, and the personality of the author. I mean, Primo Levi is one hell of a character!! He is hopeful, romantic, self-deprecating, resourceful, humorous, nerdy... Man, he would make such a wonderful dinner companion.I am not sure whether this is the all-time best Science book or not, but this is definitely a gem of a book.

Everything just fit very well together (chapter titles, stories within the story, character personalities, etc.) – I give props to the author for being so clever in his writing. The author’s wittiness was also somewhat similar to my own, which I found welcoming (and funny). At the same time, though, the author writes in this monotone-like fashion that just did not keep my attention and I was thankful the book was under 250 pages. Had it not been in the book club rules that I MUST finish the book no matter what, there were various points throughout the book where I just might have stopped reading it.

The use of the elements as a framing device for a collection of stories, memories and more for a chemist is excellent. The early elements take the form of a memoir and are good. However, the stories, such as the aptly titled lead, don't seem to add anything and for me don't work either as fables or indeed stories. Some of the later entries, recounting his post war chemical chemical career, didn't resonate. The entire book though is lifted by the superb vanadium. He writes of his encountering in the course of business a German chemist who he worked for in the death camps. The correspondence between them and his analysis of the German doctor's ""guilt' is quite superb. If the entire book was on this level, it could have been a masterpiece."
53,0805210415,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew,3,This is a strange and compelling book and i am sure there are those out there who will give it a full rating. Basically its the author reliving aspects and episodes of his early life as a Jew and a chemist through the second world war living in Italy. Each chapter is named after an element which closely resembles the tone or key aspect of that chapter. As a chemist myself i can see many interesting aspects both in his exploits and in his career. However because they are condensed in to chapters its really autobiographical enough and the chemistry is little more than a tool to tell a story. I do not doubt the authors power of words or his frightening and fascinating early years just this failed to capture me like some works i had read.

The Periodic Table  is not as boring as the title insinuates. The book consists of 21 short chapters, all named after an element, and all but two are autobiographical. The other two are works of fiction which the author wrote as a young man and were lost for decades, but found as he was writing this book. He claims in the book that he included the two stories as he did not want to abandon them. The stand-alone anecdotes which make up each chapter relate in some way to the element which the chapter is named after. The two fictional stories relate to the dangers of the chemicals lead and mercury. Primo Levi (1919 - 1987) was an Italian Jewish chemist. He writes about his family growing up, education, professional life, and how he was affected as a Jew by the WWII spread of fascism in Europe. Going in, I expected a book about science written by a scientist, but rather discovered a beautifully written, very personal book about the good and bad of humanity with chemistry as the backdrop. The book starts a bit slow- the first chapter is about his family and Jewish vocabulary - but I found most of the following chapters compelling.This is the January 2018 Book Club read for the Goodreads Science and Inquiry Group. Despite the amount of chemistry and science talk in this book I would still recommend to everyone as it is more about the happy times and extraordinarily difficult times of a chemist's life during a dark period in history; and besides, you might learn some chemistry.

Primo Levi tells us his adventures through the world of chemistry - as a biochemist by training, this is especially gratifying as it feels like a story tailored to what I know, to what I have been taught, in a way that is captivating and beautifully refreshing. However, in the midst of this lies the Shoah, the ethnic oppression and genocide that Levi suffered through. You read how his life as a chemist progressed, but there is always this backdrop of immense sadness, like a single event provides a continuous aura - the time until and after it happens. It really is a book that should be read, because it combines this aura of trauma with the resilience of living with and after it. It's the reckoning of suffering and whatever comes after it."
