0,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7261586-dawn,3,I think I understood it while I was reading it...but don't ask me to explain anything.
1,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79575646-inkspill,4,"Part of the Science Masters series, I would not call this an easy read but it was a beginning. When I finished, I had a more understanding about expansion of the universe, singularity, continuance (as it reflected on Einstein’s theory of relativity) and quantum, mostly physics. As a beginner reading this subject, I was not expecting this book to be easy but I was surprised to come away with the little understanding I did. This is a book I would return to, feeling confident I will come away with more understanding with each read."
2,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,3,"A good account of the origin of the universe and concepts of theories, our existence and matters of the universe with a great foundation for those interested in the area and beginners wanting to find out more about this topic. Plenty reeling of facts and principles, great for those who don’t have any prior knowledge on this. And equally as good for those who do but just want a recap of what they might have learnt before. I also loved the addition of the Sherlock Holmes quotes, as a lover of Arthur Canon Doyle’s work!I liked the chapter on quantum too which was great and delivered in a way that helped to describe an incredibly confusing and complex concept. Plenty of great information in this and doesn’t over complicate, providing you with the facts needed to understand this topic. "
3,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,4,"Easy to read and def covers the topic. It does cover the origin of the Universe. It does do so in a compelling way. I think there are just a ton of competition in this topic. For that reason, it's hard to give it 5. 4 is a strong rating, though and if you can't be bothered to read some of the larger tombs, I would go to this one. "
4,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95235457-kate,3,"Książka ta przypomina inną książkę, którą czytałam ostatnio (""Astrophysics for people in a Hurry""), ale nie posiada ona aż tak chwytliwego tytułu. Może ocenianie przez porównanie tych dwoch książek nie jest bardzo obiektywne, ale wiele z informacji w tych dwóch książkach się pokrywa, choć znalazłam też takie, które warte są przytoczenia.Ciekawostka 1:Ekspansja Wszechświata jest izotropowa, czyli taka sama we wszystkich kierunkach.Ciekawostka 2:Model stanu stacjonarnego Wszechświata został wymyślony w 1948 roku przez Golda, Bondiego i Hoyle'a. Wedłuch nich, Wszechświat zawsze wygląda tak samo i nie ma początku, a gęstość materii w nim jest stała. Inna teoria opisująca Wszechświat to teoria Wielkiego Wybuchu. Przewiduje ona, że gęstość materii we Wszechświecie ciągle maleje, bo nie następuje kreacja nowej materii. Dodatkowo, Wszechświat miał początek.Ciekawostka 3:Obserwacje astronomiczne lekkich pierwiastków pozwalają badać znacznie wcześniejsze epoki niż obserwacje mikrofalowego tła. Na podstawie obserwowanej ilości helu we Wszechświacie, można było wydedukować ile jest rodzajów neutrin (3).Ciekawostka 4:Obecność węgla we Wszechświecie jest uzależniona od stanu rezonansowego helu, berylu i wegla. Ten stan rezonansowy powstaje przez kombinację jąder helu i berylu, co skutkuje powstaniem węgla. Dodatkowo, węgiel, wkrótce po utworzeniu, teoretycznie mógłby poprzez przyłączenie kolejnego jądra helu zamienić się w tlen. Jednakże, rekacja ta nie wykazuje rezonansu, co skutkuje relatywną obfitością we Wszechświecie zarówno węgla jak i tlenu."

The breadth of content covered is astounding and it really leaves you wanting more. However, there were many times when concepts felt rushed over, particularly in the case of the bit about magnetic monopoles which I've read back over a few times and still don't quite understand. Nevertheless, if you're trying to get into cosmology and you're looking for a few different books to read (I wouldn't just read this one), this is a good one to have on that list. "
6,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3912935-marco,2,"Queste ""onde/particelle"" si potrebbero paragonare più a delle onde emotive che a delle onde liquide. Se un'ondata di emozione si diffonde nelle nostre vicinanze, ciò significa che è molto probabile che da quelle parti vi sia un comportamento emotivo."
7,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1450643-amanda,3,This book was quite meaty for being a short intro to the topic. Definitely something I will need to re-read to get a full understanding.
8,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10709915-klaudia,3,"Ciekawa i nawet nie taka trudna, ale średnie tłumaczenie psuje przyjemność czytania."
9,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76092953-charlie-bray,2,"Wish it would have had more intuitive explanations, along the lines of the balloon example/illustration given towards the beginning."
10,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5533196-tatiana-rymarenko,4,"The book suffers for the embarrassment of riches that is its niche, otherwise a good read."
11,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54135119-bogdan-teodorescu,2,Not that good. Just taking on the major problems of cosmology and discussing them very briefly. Poor

13,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Barrow's book is said to be written for beginners. Throughout his book, he lays out issues that engage, but his explanations are often too complex or spare to be clear, resulting in repeated frustration. Still, there's enough to be gleaned from the book to spend time on it. Barrow describes, for example, two theories of time in relation to the creation of the universe (universe created in pre-existent time vs. time that comes into existence with this universe's creation). Elsewhere, he writes something similar about space, saying that the universe is space(i.e., there is no space beyond this universe). He also notes that total mass in the universe is matched by its opposite, total energy, which is, he says, ""exactly zero."" Interestingly, this places the notion of balance and equilbrium seen in our corner of the cosmos onto a universal, macro scale. Finally, despite what would seem to be statistical odds that other cosmic bodies would support life as we know it, Barrow points out that that the probability of the spontaneous creation of life actually occurs only in a ""small range of conditions,"" suggesting that our spot in the cosmos may be pretty rare. Though no doubt dated, this book does engage the reader with commentary like this. "
14,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish,4,"Originally published on my blog here in October 2000.Part of a series of explanations of important areas of current science by leading science writers, The Origin of the Universe would be an ideal place for to start for a reader with virtually no scientific background who wants to try to understand something of current thought on the subject. It is concise and simple, admirably written, and has the odd point of interest even to a voracious reader of popular science books. It reminded me of the science books of Isaac Asimov, and is a worthy successor to his books on cosmology, written skilfully in the same spirit yet up to date. I found Asimov's books fascinating when I was a teenager - they were all about the interesting science they didn't teach at school - and I think that The Origin of the Universe could have the same effect on an interested teenager today."
15,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478469-don,3,"This was published in 1994 and its been on my bookshelf unread since then. But I'm glad I finally picked it up, even if the science has undoubtedly moved on.Barrow provides a particularly good explanation of inflation and the critical role it played in the development of the universe. For the first time I got sa glimpse into why the search for WIMPs is so important, and the huge investment in CERN is worth every penny. If we finally do get evidence of the existence the Higgs Bosun then it will indicate that the very early universe was producing the sort of particles that would precipitate a period of rapid inflation. That much Barrow manages to explain reasonably clearly, but some of the paragraphs leap into technical science and it's easy to be left behind. After reading passages like this a couple of times I just end up accepting it on faith and moving on in search of a section which will knock the idea into recognisable shape. But the difficulties are minimal in this book, and all in all its an informative read."
16,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526106-jason,2,"It has been sometime since I read this book, and yet I remember clearly my basic response, which was either that the author had failed in trying to explain contemporary cosmology to a literate nonscientist (i.e., me) or that the contemporary cosmology was itself inexplicable, at least to a non-mathematician, and more or less meaningless. I was struck by the relationship between high-energy particle physics and this contemporary cosmology, and how the study of both is resource intense and apparently far removed from everyday human concerns. One vaguely remembered factoid from the book involved the insanely fine-tuned nature of the universe's starting conditions, which is more or less shrugged off. To my way of thinking, the flabbergasting odds that led up to a universe in which I am keyboarding these thoughts deserves a better origin story than the one Barrow provides here, whatever the cloud chambers and equations suggest. "
17,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8989185-allan-leonard,4,"There are plenty of science books to explain the origins of the universe. However, Barrow's work is the best for the layman. Barrow's prose is plain English. His explanations of very sophisticated concepts are clear and accessible.For example, Barrows calmly points out the difference between the universe -- everything that is -- and the visible universe, that finite realm where there has been enough time for light to reach us.While no degree in physics (or any other science) is required, a general understanding of basic laws, e.g. speed of light, absolute zero, will help. This is one book to have at hand to handle some of the more mind-bending theories of the universe, not only its origins but where it may all be going."

19,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,2,"Another book on cosmogony. This one was in the Science Masters series; it was very short and oversimplified, and the style is trying too hard to copy Hawking's bestselling A Brief History of Time. It might have been a good choice for a complete beginner when it was written, but for anyone who has read anything else it's too low level a popularization, and of course now it's very out of date."
20,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19944422-duane-bowker,4,"Another excellent book from the ""Science Master Series"", this one focusing on astrophysics and cosmology. Written for the lay reader, it presents the current (as of 1994) state of knowledge concerning the origins of the universe with discussions of superstring theory, dark matter and other possible universes. Some truely mind-blowing stuff!"
21,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,4,"This is one of those books for making yourself feel smart and stupid at the same time. Stupid, because it is really hard to understand how time can be a dimension of space. Smart, because you're even making an attempt to understand it in the first place. Really though, I learned a lot. At least, enough to understand most science fiction plots, I think!"
22,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3314747-denise,3,"I bought this book in the mid 90s, it came in a box set with Origin of Humankind and Last Three Minutes. At the time I was still in High School and hadn't had any physics, cosmology, or astronomy. I picked up a few things but I remember finishing and wondering what the heck I'd just tried to put my brain through.These days, the material is a lot easier and I can better appreciate the contents."
23,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3189888-bob,5,"Very clearly written and fully credible. Explained how the evidence was acquired, the questions it uncovered, and what theories were developed to offer plausible explanations. All the while being honest to the problem that there is so little we really know. This book I will read again, later. It takes time to absorb this information, which I want to understand far better."
24,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22668658-attila,4,"The first Cosmology / Cosmogony book I have ever read, back in high school, and that was when I became fascinated with the origin and evolution of the Universe. A good introductory book, even if it is quite dated by now."
25,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4586546-pippa,4,"This covered some of the same ground as Smoot's 'Wrinkles in Time' and I think I preferred that, but it may have been because I read it first. This helped me reinforce some things I'd learnt from that, and clarify others."
26,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399130-timothy-finucane,3,"A good book for getting the big overview of cosmology and the big bang, but it may not be as easy to read for beginners as it claims. I did have to re-read a few parts to get a good grasp."
27,0465053548,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45556027-kelvin-pineda,4,A good overview and introduction to early cosmology. I loved it.
