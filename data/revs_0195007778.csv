Aldo Leopold is often called the father of wildlife management. But Sand County Almanac is not a text book, with nary a glossary, set of models, or flow chart within its pages. It does contain some pretty drawings, and some spellbinding imagery. Leopold goes beyond vividly describing a scene of chopping wood or canoeing a river; he pans back to ecological connectivity or the aesthetic importance of the natural world to humanity. He talks about the need for a land ethic, and it sounds very logical and obvious-- I have to remind myself that he wrote these essays before such a mindset was commonplace. Even if his views were not completely original for the time, he is undoubtedly remembered for being so darn eloquent. A master of the one-liner, it's no wonder that all of my nat res classes seemed to quote him several times each semester (and some classes on a weekly basis). I feel sheepish for not reading it much earlier in my career, but I'm very glad I picked it up. He was a remarkable naturalist and writer. I can see him clearly, squatting in ice-crusted mud before dawn breaks over the marsh, his shotgun poking through the reeds and ears open to the sounds of approaching waterfowl, all the while silently creating poetry."

What a dull world if we knew all about geese!
Nature is refreshing. Even a short walk in a park can powerfully clear one’s head. For whatever reason—perhaps because our ancestors lived in trees—surrounding oneself with birches and maples produces in nearly everyone feelings of warmth, comfort, and peace. And for many people, nature is more than refreshing: it is awe-inspiring, even divine. Natural environments are, for some, more uplifting than cathedrals. Emerson might have captured this strain of mystical naturalism best:In the woods, we return to reason and faith. … Standing on the bare ground,—my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite spaces,—all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being flow through me; I am part or particle of God.I myself have had comparable experiences in the woods. Yet both Emerson and I are pure amateurs next to Aldo Leopold. Leopold was a pioneering conservationist and forester. He was also a superlative writer, and in this brief book he covers a lot of ground. He begins with a month-by-month account of Sand County, a poor farming region in Wisconsin. This was my favorite section, since Leopold’s sensitivity to his environment is nearly superhuman. He has a keen sense of both the history of environments—how they change with the seasons, how they have evolved through time, how they have been warped by human activity—and the close-knit interdependence of ecosystems, how each organism shapes and is shaped by every other organism, forming a perfect whole.  As a stylist, he manages to be lyrical and poetic while sticking scrupulously to what he sees and hears. His sentences are short, his diction simple, and yet he manages to evoke a densely complex ecosystem. This is because, unlike Emerson or I—and more so than Thoreau—Leopold really understood his environment. He can name every species of plant, and tell what soils they prefer and what plants they like as neighbors. He can identify every bird by its call, and knows where it roosts, what it eats, when it migrates, and how it mates. Scratches on a tree tell him a deer is nearby, his antlers fully grown; the footprints in snow tell him a skunk has passed, and how recently. All this is described with exquisite sensitivity, but no romantic embellishment. To borrow a phrase from E.B. White, Leopold had discovered “the eloquence of facts.” And, like White, Thoreau, and Emerson, his writing has a pleasing, folksy, rambling, ambling quality, wherein each sentence is nailed to the next one at an oblique angle.  In the rest of the book, Leopold puts forward a new philosophy of conservation. This train of thought reminded my very much of another book I read recently, The Death and Life of Great American Cities. In that book, Jane Jacobs explains how top-down approaches to city planning killed neighborhood vitality. Just so, when Leopold was a young man in the forestry service, he participated in the policy of removing predators—bears, wolves, and mountain lions—to protect livestock and to increase the supply of hunting animals, like deer. When hunting became necessary to control population, parks began building more and more roads to make access easier; and meanwhile the exploding deer population prevented new trees from growing. Thus the park was encroached upon by cars, and the ecosystem thrown off balance—in the same way that blindly building highways and public housing can destroy neighborhoods. Leopold was, I believe, one of the first to popularize the idea that ecosystems act like one giant organism, with a delicate balance of cooperating and competing components. Every healthy ecosystem is a harmony that cannot be disturbed without unpredictable results. To again borrow from Jacobs, an ecosystem—like a city economy or a human brain—is an example of “organized complexity.” Thus ecosystems baffle attempts to understand them by thinking of their components separately, as a collection of individual species, or even statistically, as the average behavior of interchangeable parts. Complexity like this tends to be a product of historical growth, with each distinct component making minute adjustments to each other in a dense network of influence. Leopold doesn’t say this in so many words; but he does something even more impressive: he illustrates this quality using short anecdotes and schoolboy vocabulary. His most philosophic contribution to the environmental movement is what he called a “land ethic.” Previous arguments for conservation were couched in terms of expediency: how national parks and nature reserves could benefit us economically. Leopold believed that this approach was too narrow; since hunting lodges and mechanized farms are always more profitable in the short term, this would eventually result in the destruction of wild ecosystems and the disappearance of species. We needed to move beyond arguments of expediency and see the land—and everything on it—as valuable for its own sake. Leopold believed that we had an ethical duty to preserve ecosystems and all their species, and that the aesthetic reward of wild nature was more valuable than dollars and cents could measure. I want to go along with this, but I thought that Leopold was unsatisfyingly vague in this direction. It is simply not enough to say that we have an ethical duty to preserve nature; this is quite a claim, and requires quite a bit of argument. Further, aesthetic value seems like a slender reed to rest on. For every Emerson and Thoreau, there is a Babbitt whose tastes are not so refined. To his credit, Leopold does argue that a great part of conservation must consist in elevating the public taste in nature. Otherwise, conservation will consist of little more than the government using tax dollars to purchase large swaths of land. Individuals must see the value in wilderness and actively participate in preserving it. But molding tastes is no easy thing; and, more importantly, if we are to do so, there must be compelling reasons to do it. The most compelling reasons for conservation are, I believe, expediency—but expediency in the widest sense. The difference between folly and wisdom is not that the former is preoccupied with expediency and the latter higher things; it is that wisdom considers what is expedient on a grander scale. Leopold comes close to making this same argument. He was, for example, ahead of his time in being deeply concerned about extinction. Every time a species disappears it is an irreplaceable loss; and considering that our medicine partly depends on new discoveries, extinctions may have terrible consequences for us down the line. (I saw a PBS special the other day about scientists trying to discover new antibiotics by shifting through raw soil.) Since Leopold's day—long before Silent Spring or An Incovenient Truth—we have learned plenty more ways that environmental destruction can be equivalent to self-destruction.Carping aside, this is a deeply satisfying book: lyrical, descriptive, educational, and innovative. Leopold realized what Orwell also realized: that winning converts requires both argument and propaganda. He does not only argue for the value of nature, but he really captures the beauty of unspoiled environments and serves it up for his readers’ consideration. We are not only convinced, but seduced. This is propaganda in its noblest form—propaganda on behalf of nature."
2,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma,5,"“Does the economist know the grebe?”—Aldo LeopoldYou begin with this, which is where I believe we are, in terms of the health of the planet:https://www.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-news...Sand County Almanac is a 1949 collection of essays by Wisconsin conservationist Leopold—some people now call him one of the fathers of “deep ecology”—that is one of the two most influential and well known environmental books of the twentieth century, the other being Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring. Today it continues to sell about 40,000 copies a year, though apparently that was not enough or perhaps influential enough readers to stop the tide he saw rising as early as the middle of the nineteenth century, where shortsighted American corporate greed and consequent rapacious environmental destruction triumphed over what he called a “land ethic,” or a responsible relationship existing between people and the land they inhabit. “There are two spiritual dangers in not owning a farm. One is the danger of supposing that breakfast comes from the grocery, and the other that heat comes from the furnace.”Leopold knew that most Americans look at beautiful natural places and think profit:“To those devoid of imagination a blank place on the map is a useless waste; to others, the most valuable part.” But he writes with a deeper appreciation of that beauty:“Our ability to perceive quality in nature begins, as in art, with the pretty. It expands through successive stages of the beautiful to values as yet uncaptured by language.” Leopold loves art and music but worries that people might value art in a museum and music from a symphony more than the Colorado Rockies or “geese music.” People, Leopold knew even then, are cut off from nature, couldn’t name as he does lovingly and knowingly the plants and animals that are around them, nor see how crucial they are to our survival on the planet; as Wordsworth said:The world is too much with us; late and soon,Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—Little we see in Nature that is ours;We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! Leopold thinks that we went wrong when we decided to teach chemistry in school but not ecological ethics along with it. Maybe he wouldn't be so sad about the damage already done to the environment in the forties when he wrote this. But because was one of the few educated to know it, he felt isolated: “One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen. An ecologist must either harden his shell and make believe that the consequences of science are none of his business, or he must be the doctor who sees the marks of death in a community that believes itself well and does not want to be told otherwise.” The ""marks of death"" he was observing closely, and tracking from a century before. What would he write about now, when he was already so sad and mad then? These essays that I reread felt like a sad elegy to a time that he was already himself lamenting, when we might still have made the choice to live in harmony with nature.Here is Leopold in his essay, “Thinking like a Mountain”:“We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes. I realized then, and have known ever since, that there was something new to me in those eyes - something known only to her and to the mountain. I was young then, and full of trigger-itch; I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, that no wolves would mean hunters' paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view.…I now suspect that just as a deer herd lives in mortal fear of its wolves, so does a mountain live in mortal fear of its deer. And perhaps with better cause, for while a buck pulled down by wolves can be replaced in two or three years, a range pulled down by too many deer may fail of replacement in as many decades. So also with cows. The cowman who cleans his range of wolves does not realize that he is taking over the wolf's job of trimming the herd to fit the range. He has not learned to think like a mountain. Hence we have dustbowls, and rivers washing the future into the sea.”Our world has been shaped by ignorance, and shortsighted businessmen, and our preference for what he calls ""gadgetry"" (our love of tech, already in the forties) over the deep pleasures of the outdoors: “The modern dogma is comfort at any cost.” But at what price, for those of us facing the future now?

It expands through successive stages of the beautiful to values as yet uncaptured by language. The quality of cranes lies, I think, in this higher gamut, as yet beyond the reach of words.There is nothing, nothing, beyond Aldo Leopold's reach of words. I've read, oh, sixty or seventy books so far this year - some inventive, some incisive - but nothing matches the magic of this writing. And so, I'll have to quote a lot.Acts of creation are ordinarily reserved for gods and poets, but humbler folks may circumvent this restriction if they know how. To plant a pine, for example, one need be neither god nor poet; one need only own a shovel. By virtue of this curious loophole in the rules, any clodhopper may say : Let there be a tree--and there will be one. . . . God passed on his handiwork as early as the seventh day, but I notice He has been rather noncommittal about its merits. I gather either He spoke too soon, or that trees stand more looking upon than do fig leaves and firmaments. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --There are other plants who seem to ask of this world not riches but room. Such is the little sandwort that throws a white-lace cap over the poorest hilltops just before the lupines splash them with blue. Sandworts simply refuse to live on a a good farm, even on a very good farm, complete with rock garden and begonias. And then there is the little Linaria, so small, so slender, and so blue that you don't even see it until it is directly underfoot; who ever saw a Linaria except on a sandblow? . . . There are birds that are found only in the Sand Counties, for reasons sometimes easy, sometimes difficult, to guess. The clay-colored sparrow is there, for the clear reason that he is enamored of jackpines, and jackpines of sand. The sandhill crane is there, for the clear reason that he is enamored of solitude, and there is none left elsewhere. But why do woodcocks prefer to nest in sandy regions? Their preference is rooted in no such mundane matter as food, for earthworms are far more abundant on better soils. After years of study, I now think I know the reason. The male woodcock, while doing his preening prologue to the sky dance, is like a short lady in high heels: he does not show up to advantage in dense tangled ground cover. But on the poorest sand-streak of the poorest pasture or meadow of the Sand Counties, there is, in April at least, no ground cover at all, save only moss, Draba, cardamine, sheep-sorrel, and Antennaria, all negligible imprediments to a bird with short legs. Here the male woodcock can puff and strut and mince, not only without let or hindrance, but in full view of his audience, real or hoped-for. This little circumstance, important for only an hour a day, for only one month of the year, perhaps for only one of the two sexes, and certainly wholly irrelevant to economic standards of living, determine the woodcock's choice of home. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --For one species to mourn the death of another is a new thing under the sun. The Cro-Magnon who slew the the last mammoth thought only of steaks. The sportsman who shot the last pigeon thought only of his prowess. The sailor who clubbed the last auk thought of nothing at all. But we, who have lost our pigeons, mourn the loss. Had the funeral been ours, the pigeons would hardly have mourned us. In this fact, rather than in Mr. DuPont's nylons or Mr. Vannevar Bush's bombs, lies objective evidence of our superiority over the beasts. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --Thus always does history, whether of marsh or market place, end in paradox. The ultimate value in these marshes is wildness, and the crane is wildness incarnate.

He cites the history, backwards, as they saw through, ring by ring, year by year. It's splendid stuff and not conventional history like Hitler did this or General Sherman did that; but, more about carp planting and barbed wire and the things meadow mice have been know to do. At the end (beginning) of each decade, we hear: Rest! cries the chief sawyer, and we pause for breath. So, there's a musical cadence too. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --Sorry for quoting so much, but I hope you see why I did. This book is in three parts: the first two are his observations of nature and the last part is kind of a call to arms for conservation of wilderness.

4,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,4,"I first read this book back in college as extra credit in a biology class. My reread was made more pleasurable this time around due to the fact that I wasn't being graded, and to the addition of Michael Sewell's stunning nature photographs. The book features monthly entries, as Leopold guides you through a year spent on his one hundred and twenty acre Wisconsin farm. His writing style is warm and welcoming, and occasionally dosed with humor:My dog does not care where heat comes from, but he cares ardently that it come, and soon. Indeed he considers my ability to make it come as something magical, for when I rise in the cold black pre-dawn and kneel shivering by the hearth making a fire, he pushes himself blandly between me and the kindling splits I have laid on the ashes, and I must touch a match to them by poking it between his legs. Such faith, I suppose, is the kind that moves mountains.His observations are perceptive:One swallow does not make a summer, but one skein of geese, cleaving the murk of a March thaw, is the spring.A cardinal, whistling spring to a thaw, but later finding himself mistaken, can retrieve his error by resuming his winter silence. A chipmunk, emerging for a sunbath but finding a blizzard has only to go back to bed. But a migrating goose, staking two hundred miles of black night on the chance of finding a hole in the lake, has no easy chance for retreat. His arrival carries the conviction of a prophet who has burned his bridges.And, I loved this line about the utter perfection of one particular month:I sometimes think that the other months were constituted mainly as a fitting interlude between Octobers . . . This edition concludes with some eloquent essays, pleas really, about the importance of conservation. Leopold's book was published posthumously in 1949, and has never gone out of print. I highly recommend this one - words from a fine teacher offering important lessons on taking the time to observe the world around you."

It's a little too cold for reading outside today but the sun is shining, I have the door wall open and I'm enjoying the fresh breezes and birdsongs of spring...while listening to a few of Bach's cello suites. Perfect!Writing in 1948, Aldo Leopold was already lamenting the damage to nature and the environment caused by human greed and carelessness in the pursuit of more and bigger. He asks the question: ""Is a higher 'standard of living' worth its cost in things natural, wild and free?"" Part I is written as an almanac of seasonal experiences at his weekend retreat on a sand farm in southern Wisconsin. ""There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot. These essays are the delights and dilemmas of one who cannot."" Part II are sketches of forty years of travels across the continent and the issues of conservation he had observed. In Part III The Upshot, Leopold lets loose some of his thoughts on what has become of our beautiful, wild country. And this was nearly 70 years ago! Quite depressing. And now that we have climate-change deniers in the administration and the EPA standards and regulations weakened or cancelled, is there any hope at all? Sad, sad, sad...All these essay are beautifully illustrated by the drawings of Charles W. Schwartz. Aldo Leopold died the same year this book was written (1948) while helping to fight a grass fire on a neighboring farm. This was shortly after becoming an advisor on conservation to the United Nations. He was posthumously named to the National Wildlife Federation's Conservation Hall of Fame in 1965."
6,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"First published in 1949, A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There by Aldo Leopold was definitely way ahead of its time. Much of that stated within remains valid and relevant still today. It is a book about conservation and ecology and man’s relationship to land. At the author’s death, in April 1948, the book existed in draft form. His son edited it and brought it into publication a year later.The book has four parts. The first section reads as a monthly nature almanac. Here is recorded observations of flora and fauna on the author’s 120-acre property in Sauk County, Wisconsin. Thereafter follows snippets, stories, assorted writings at other locations in Wisconsin, Illinois and Iowa, Arizona and New Mexico, Chihuahua and Sonora in northwestern Mexico, Oregon and Utah and finally Manitoba, Canada. The third and then the final fourth section, more and more philosophical, academic and didactic in tone, have essays on conservation, ecology and what the author calls “land ethics”, which, simply put, is the relationship that should exist between the land and those inhabiting it. As with all collections of essays, some essays are better than others. One’s appreciation of the first and second sections will depend upon the reader’s recognition of the flora and fauna spoken of. Knowing intimately the landscapes will add to one’s appreciation too. My interest was aroused when the creatures and plants I meet on daily walks in France and Sweden are mentioned. The same will be valid for others too. The prose style is not lyrical. It is philosophical. The author voices his views. His self-assurance is manifest. He has a tendency to look down upon others. The last section is excessively academic and theoretical in tone. He categorically states that the final section will not be of interest to the layman. I found the essays in the second and third sections best and the theorizing in the final section overblown. Many lines are wise and true. Note the irony embedded in some. Consider the following quotes:“To those devoid of imagination, a blank place on the map is a useless waste; to others, the most valuable part.”“All conservation of wildness is self-defeating, for to cherish we must see and fondle, and when enough have seen and fondled, there is no wilderness left to cherish.”“Education is learning to see one thing by going blind to another.”Speaking of a frightening but magnificent thunderstorm, Leopold says, “It must be a poor life that achieves freedom from fear.”Speaking of two boys on a camping trip, he says, “The wilderness gave them complete freedom to make mistakes.”Note the humor here, “Pines, like people, are choosy about their associates.”And this, in speaking of how other writers and observers of nature fail to register the effects of wind on the bodies of fowl -- “They (other authors' books) are written behind stoves.”“We grieve only for what we know.”This is so very true!Other times, that which Leopold says is questionable. How he looks at hunters and hunting is one example—he is a man of his time. It is stated that Europeans do not camp or partake of meals outside! That is just not true, and it had me questioning the validity of other statements made! This is, I suppose, merely a petitesse. Much of that which is stated about the value of conservation is today accepted by all. The author speaks of the need to make people aware of the immense satisfaction husbandry of land can bring to a soul. He seeks to encourage the general public’s awareness and perception of nature’s magnificence and innate beauty. He warns us that we must care for it, preserve it for future generations. All of this I support, but tell me, who wouldn’t?! The book’s content is amazing, particularly if one considers how long ago it was written. And yet I must also say that the writing lacks the lyrical resonance of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring. It does not pull you in as Carson’s does, not by a long shot.Mike Chamberlain narrates the audiobook. He speaks clearly. The tempo is not rushed, but the reading is without modulation. He drones on and on. The audio performance I have given three stars.*********************Silent Spring 5 stars by Rachel Carson*A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There 3 stars by Aldo Leopold"

Leopold was an ecology scientist at the U of Wisconsin, Madison, who bought a small piece of property in the Sand County region in central Wisconsin, where he and his family would take long weekends and vacations, fixing the place up and enjoying nature.The essays collected in this amazing book are Leopold's musings and observations on his little chunk of the wilderness, reflecting on everything from sipping coffee outside in the morning as he listens to the litany of chickadees and nuthatches surrounding him in the post-sunrise woods, to the balance of an ecosystem captured in the description of a childhood experience of shooting a wolf. The prose is rich and deep, and draws the reader along into looking at the world through a fresh lens -- a lens that accentuates the ordinary and helps us gain a more proper perspective on life.I love this book. I've read it many times, and have pushed it onto many a hapless reader . . . including my kids. If you have even a tiny bit of appreciation for nature and the outdoors, you will love this book. That is not something I say about very many of the Nature Lit type books, but this is one. I've taught it many times as part of the reading list in my college Nature Lit course, and have had numerous students tell me they were stunned at how good this book is, and how it changed the way they look at the world around them.Get it.

10,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1767657-adeline,4,"Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac is a compelling blend of beautiful depictions of nature, personal opinion and reflection, and political commentary. Leopold extols the beauty of nature and emphasizes how much humans are a part of it. As members of the natural world, humans have a dramatic effect on the environment, and Leopold does not shy away from this issue. Rather than advocate for total preservation of wilderness, Leopold expresses the value of hunting and using the resources present in the wild. Hunting, he argues, is actually a way to become more attuned to the subtleties of a natural environment. Leopold's commentary about how nature should be used is one of the most striking things about the book, second only to the reverent appreciation of nature that he expresses. 	Leopold depicts hunting as a meditative process in which the hunter becomes part of his environment and develops an understanding of and respect for his prey. This seems reasonable, despite my personal instinct that an environmentalist must be against hunting. Of course, Leopold cannot condone all methods of hunting. The new age of “gadgeteers” (214) and the hunters who buy their wares are not in tune with nature. Leopold wonders if they are “absorbing cultural value” or “just feeding minks” with the birds missed by their hasty shots (215). It is interesting to hear someone with such respect for nature also acknowledge that he enjoys killing animals. I didn't particularly respect this position; I am glad to hear that he does not use too many high tech gadgets, and I know that hunting is something of a national pastime, but I can't wrap my mind around it as acceptable unless it is done for subsistence. This is not to say that I haven't enjoyed wild turkey meatballs and venison sausage killed by the local hunters in my town, but hunting seems so barbaric. Yet we are animals with all the instincts that entails, and meat sure does taste good. Somehow I can only approve of hunting when it is done only with tools found in nature and made by hand. Paleolithic hunting methods are pretty much the only ones I can condone, but maybe I need to get over my romanticized ideas about nature. I have always thought that if everything we build our bodies with comes from nature, and we eat animals that have suffered and been tortured, and then we turn their cells into our cells, we are building ourselves out of sorrow. "
11,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,5,"As a conservationist, Leopold was an heir to Thoreau and a thinker ahead of his time, yet I expect few people know how much of our current philosophy of wildness and the human impact on the world is indebted to him. This was first published in 1949, the year after Leopold’s death, but so many of his musings ring true today: how we only appreciate wildlife if we can put an economic value on it, the troubles we get into when we eradicate predators and let prey animals run rampant, and the danger of being disconnected from the land that supplies our very life. And all of this he delivers in beautiful, incisive prose. The almanac itself, a month-by-month account of life in his native patch of Wisconsin, contributes less than half of the length of the book; the rest is composed of occasional pieces set everywhere from Mexico to Manitoba. Although I liked the almanac best, there are memorable lines strewn throughout. (Charles W. Schwartz’s black-and-white illustrations are also wonderful.)“We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect.”“There are two spiritual dangers in not owning a farm. One is the danger of supposing that breakfast comes from the grocery, and the other that heat comes from the furnace.”“A conservationist is one who is humbly aware that with each stroke he is writing his signature on the face of his land.”“whereas I write a poem by dint of mighty cerebration, the yellow-leg walks a better one just by lifting his foot.”"
12,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/894852-stephen,5,"Completed shortly before his death in 1948, University of Wisconsin forestry professor  Aldo Leopold grants his readers the supreme privilege of seeing nature through the original ecologist's eyes. Leopold was probably not the first to use the term ""ecologist"", nor the first to be be so branded; surely he was the first to deserve it. Though it may appear a quaint historical piece at first glance, its message is no less potent and relevant in the 21st century: nature, the land, deserves full respect and love without regard to traditional economics. Without this, effort at conservation will be a vain half-measure at best.Sand County Almanac is a series of short pieces, organized in three primary units: A Sand County Almanac, Sketches Here and There, and The Upshot. Each is filled with a beautiful prose showing an easy command of the English language and yet also displaying enough humility to remain accessible to all. Along with scientific precision Leopold brings evocative imagery and an emotion at times ironic, but never overly so.The Almanac teaches us how to really see nature — how to understand a thing for what it is instead of what it is not. Thus the Leopold-educated, confronted with a marshy backwater, is no longer prone to see it as a lost opportunity for development. Rather, she will encounter a unique habitat, developed over geologic time into a home for beautiful pasque flowers, graceful cranes, and playful muskrats. Through a web of consumption — passing energy up through the soil to the plants, herbivores, carnivores, and back to the soil — the marsh sustains itself with only slow changes over time. Without the right mix of players, the biota is liable to collapse to a less sustainable, less organized, and less diverse state; in other words, it will devolve into a field of corn.In the Sketches, we get a portrait of Leopold's development as a young man and as a forester. Reading the Sketches, one feels a great sense of loss for all that humanity has done to its environs, for all that humanity unintentionally — and unfeelingly— has destroyed. And yet it is clear that he continues to respect the best elements of humanity:""To love what was is a new thing under the sun, unknown to most people and to all pigeons. To see America as history, to conceive of destiny as a becoming, to smell a hickory tree through the still lapse of ages — all these things are possible for us, and to achieve them takes only the free sky, and the will to ply our wings. In these things, and not in Mr. Bush's bombs and Mr. DuPont's nylons, lies objective evidence of our superiority over the beasts.""We find that he is no Luddite. He does not shun civilization or the amenities of life. Its just that he believes in moderation, and convincingly shows that what most of us take for moderation remains overindulgence. What I think he laments most in mankind is the lack of a sense of connection to the land.This theme of connection is more thoroughly explored in the final unit, The Upshot. These four essays take both a more philosophic and political bent (though by no means partisan). The crowning jewel of the book is ""The Land Ethic."" He wishes us to see the land not as merely dirt, trees and water, but as a complex regenerative system that is beautiful and deserving of respect in its own right. My guess is that this is the most influential paragraph of the entire work:""The 'key-log' which must be moved to release the evolutionary process for an ethic is simply this: quit thinking about decent land-use as solely an economic problem. Examine each question in terms of what is ethically and esthetically right, as well as what is economically expedient. A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.""Incidentally, within ""The Land Ethic"" one can find the seeds of Gaia theory,  Jared Diamond's  Guns, Germs, and Steel theories, and a clear understanding of the systems and complexity theories that were only beginning to emerge within the scientific community.The Almanac is a masterwork. It breathes the rarefied air of non-fiction elevated to the point of literature. Any education system that wishes to impart to its students an ability to know and understand nature (the goal of science) should require reading at least a selection. Any citizen who wishes to play a positive role in the future development of her city, region, nation ought to partake of Leopold's genius. This is a work that will stand the test of time. If one day a child, hearing of its fame, should read the Almanac and wonder at its hallowed status in light of what he perceives as commonplace observations, then shall we know that the Land Ethic has truly taken hold.For a sample of Leopold's writing, I recommend Thinking Like a Mountain, the first piece I ever read from him. From the Sketches, it expresses both a magnificent sense of the order in nature, along with Leopold's wistfulness about mankind's present role in the greater ecosystem. Also available online is The Land Ethic itself."

Leopold's life was cut far too short, and I can't help but wonder how much further America's conservation efforts might have evolved in the past 50 years had he lived longer. Many of his observations and warnings from the early part of the 1900s still ring true today. In that respect, this book was somewhat of a bittersweet read for me. I read his biography, A Fierce Green Fire, a couple of years ago, and this was a nice complement to that. In this collection of essays about the land he loved, Leopold shared his views as a conservationist, scientist and observer of life in lovely, often literary, prose that surprised me and hit an emotional chord. His essay, Thinking Like a Mountain, brought a lump to my throat and an ache in my heart as he described how he once participated in the killing of wolves in his ""conservation"" work for the federal government, and how in doing so he learned what a great mistake and tragedy it was.""Only the mountain has lived long enough to listen objectively to the howl of a wolf."""
14,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2964113-rise,5,"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.So simple and so direct that one was struck by how obvious these statements are, and yet these words seemed like a newly discovered insight, especially as they came logically after a series of vivid expositions on nature and natural history. Nature is beautiful and if we preserve it, we truly deserve it. If we destroy it, we are killjoys. Simple as that.A foundational text on environmental ethics, A Sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold was a master statement of one who spent a lifetime of thinking in terms of nature and who has meditated on the imperiled future of wildlife. Leopold's long experience in the subject made him a credible person to tackle the impending environmental crisis that resulted under the 'care' of man.In the book, Leopold presented a sound case for the protection of wilderness areas and the flora and fauna inhabiting them. Leopold’s philosophical ideas outlined and prefigured the major ecological strategies of nature tourism, economic valuation of environmental resources, wildlife conservation, biodiversity management, and environmental education. It was the latter that Leopold emphasized as education (and research) is just the thing that can transform the old thinking on the use of natural resource base (utilitarianism) into a modern and progressive thinking on the harmony between man and nature (co-existence). The book was a clamor for an intellectual revolution in ecology; its intelligence was deep and came from a heart and mind so attuned to the daily cycles of birth, growth, vigor, death, reminiscence, and rebirth in nature.The poetic language was actually a foil for the deep-set values that Leopold harbored while staying in the Sand County. He built up his hermetic ideas into an exposition of an environmental worldview starting from a monthly calendar of natural cycles of plant and animal journeys, to some of the best sketches of nature writing ever put on a canvas, and concluding with an ethical sequence which unfolded like a jamming session of a philosopher in the underbrush of trees.One’s “prairie birthday” was clearly marked sometime in July:During every week from April to September there are, on the average, ten wild plants coming into first bloom. In June as many as a dozen species may burst their buds on a single day. No man can heed all of these anniversaries; no man can ignore all of them. He who steps unseeing on May dandelions may be hauled up short by August ragweed pollen; he who ignores the ruddy haze of April elms may skid his car on the fallen corollas of June catalpas. Tell me of what plant-birthday a man takes notice, and I shall tell you a good deal about his vocation, his hobbies, his hay fever, and the general level of his ecological education.This of course was a challenge from a proud man, and one could take it up without regret. Reading the prose was in itself a discovery of plant-birthdays when the natural curiosity suddenly flowered, took flight, and aspired for a higher education.A very fine sensibility to and perception of the natural world, Leopold’s writing was filtered through a powerful lens of human-ecological experience and consciousness. There was a slow internal rhythm to the first two parts of the book (“A Sand County Almanac” and “Sketches Here and There”), but immediacy and freshness lent itself to some of the best passages of nature literature ever written. The prose poetry that alighted on the essays here was awe-inducing.The middle part was an on-the-road, freestyle riffs on some of the memorable but fast disappearing wild places in America. Each place was unique for some reason, but really each place was the same. They were all found in one and the same location because they sprang from the same idea of something good, something transient, and something we encounter with, even if only once in a lifetime, authentic and humbling gladness. They are “here and there”, all around us, and they are waiting for us. We need to commit them to memory, to record them indelibly, and to believe that they can be lived again.The final section, ""The Upshot"", was a cogent argumentation for environmentalism that was not tainted by the usual gloom-and-doom rhetoric. It contained Leopold's dictums on what consists of right and wrong when it comes to human-environment nexus. The “Land Ethic” essay in this last section had been anthologized many times over in scores of books on environmental ethics. I think I own two or three other books where this essay was reprinted.It was a further achievement of the book that it was able to integrate the principles and concepts of ecology, then a pioneering science, into a style of writing that will be appreciated even by a layman. I recommend this book (actually, shoving it) to nature lovers and naturalists, but really, to general readers who want to escape the inertia of urban living and retreat into the folds of wilderness. (based on a review posted in my blog 06/2009)"
15,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96590-msbrie,5,"Are you one of those people who actually likes to read Thoreau? Well then you’re missing out! Aldo Leopold is sooooo much better. Leopold’s writing is poetic yet it also calls the common person to action. Likewise Leopold walks the walk when it comes to protecting the environment. While this book didn’t pass the random page test, if you like authors like Thoreau, then you should definitely check out The Sand County Almanac, which is the bible to environmentalists. First Page: There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot. These essays are the delights and dilemmas of one who cannot…the opportunity to see geese is more important than television, and the chance to find a pasque-flower is a right as inalienable as free speech. Page 20: Is education possibly a process of trading awareness for things of lesser worth? The goose who trades his is soon a pile of feathers. If you are a die-hard environmentalist (or you just like to read poetic things) this book is for you. "
16,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,5,"Wow. Even though my parents owned few books and yet did own this, I never got around to it. And maybe as a child I wouldn't have enjoyed it so much. But now, goodness, I recognize that it belongs on the same shelf as Thoreau, Rachel Carson, Bernd Heinrich, and Michael Perry. The man is indeed a hero for the conservation movement, and writes beautifully. Wisconsin's wilderness, and the nation's perception of the value wilderness and of diverse ecosystems, owes much to him. We have made progress since his day. Yes, much has been lost with our increasing material wealth and population growth, but much has been gained in our attempts to live more in harmony with nature and to let some of it remain free.""Like many another treaty of restraint, the pre-dawn pact lasts only as long as darkness humbles the arrogant. It would seem as if the sun were responsible for the retreat of reticence from the world. At any rate, by the time the mists are white over the lowlands, every rooster is bragging... and every corn shock is pretending to be twice as tall as any corn that ever grew. By sun-up every squirrel is exaggerating some fancied indignity to his person, and every jay proclaiming with false emotion about suppositious dangers to society, at this very moment discovered by him.""""Hard years, of course come to pines as they do to men, and the are recorded as shorter thrusts, i.e. shorter spaces between the successive whorls of branches. These spaces, then are an autobiography that he who walks with trees may read at will.""The book is not perfect, as there are references that need bibliographic notes and there are a few unfinished thoughts or incomplete conclusions. Some modern readers might object, too, to the bits about hunting (though Leopold himself seemed a bit ambivalent, as he himself hunts but doesn't approve the methods or aims of most others who do). But it is a classic, and still relevant."
17,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5524197-carol-smith,3,"This is a difficult book to rate. On the one hand, there is incredible value to be gained from the author's keen sense of observation. The first set of essays, the Sand County Almanac, takes us through a year of observing nature at work on Leopold's farm. He discovers firsthand how certain plants fare better when collocated. He bands chickadees and later discovers the bands in the pellets of a screech owl. He gains broad insights from small things that most of us pass by every day without considering. It's an ode to getting out of the classroom and into the field. He also supplies us with several formidable quotes and anecdotes on the importance of wilderness and conservation, especially in the later essays. The Flambeau River story (pp. 112-113) and his musings on the hidden uses of adversity (p. 84) are two that especially come to mind.But Mr. Leopold is also a product of his time, and it shows. He decries the decline of the grizzly (whose numbers have since recovered) but shares a tasty outdoor recipe that uses bear fat. He decries the overhunting of various species, but then goes fishing for rainbow trout and comments with some satisfaction of smoking on a midstream rock while he could hear the trout ""kicking in the bed of wet alder leaves at the bottom of the creel"" (p. 38). Cruel. In some respects, the work is as much an ode to hunting as to conservation. I don't oppose hunting, but I also feel the author fails to adequately address how hunting holds a proper place in the balance of things.Leopold also demonstrates substantial hubris towards his fellow man. He mocks a birder who attempts to describe a particular bird call in his log (p. 160), then goes on to admit that he himself will never understand the meaning of the call. Why be so nasty?!? I was personally insulted when he divided humans into four camps, including three types of hunters and one other type, the ""non-hunter"":The deer hunter habitually watches the next bend; the duck hunter watches the skyline; the bird hunter watches the dog; the non-hunter does not watch (p. 208).Mr. Leopold, I beg to differ.I recognize that he - inevitably - carries assumptions of his own time. I just question whether his message, which was highly appropriate and advanced for his time, still resonates as effectively. It certainly should be required reading for any student of conservation or ecology, in order to understand the historic roots of the movement. For the layperson, though, I for one would rather turn someone on to contemporary nature writers such as Robert Macfarlane or Roger Deakin.I enjoyed the illustrations of my edition. Any new printing would benefit, I think, from the inclusion of color plates that illuminate key topics such as the loss of biodiversity on the plains. "
18,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,5,"it is a shame that some of the most important and beloved books become also the most neglected. taken for granted, these works are thus robbed of both majesty and worth (to say nothing of efficacy). it's as if certain books are deemed classic and then left to impart their wisdoms from atop a dusty shelf. a sand county almanac is roundly acknowledged as one of the most seminal titles in the nature/conservation/environmental writing genre, and like all great books it remains imperatively relative despite the passing years. leopold's writing is consistently vivid and animated, but it is in the final four essays that it nears brilliance in clarity and reasoning. in a time of gross disharmony over environmental policy, one would be well served in (re)reading this book to consider a well-delineated perspective articulated soundly.written in the late 1940's:...but wherever the truth may lie, this much is crystal-clear: our bigger-and-better society is now like a hypochondriac, so obsessed with its own economic health as to have lost the capacity to remain healthy. the whole world is so greedy for more bathtubs that it has lost the stability necessary to build them, or even to turn off the tap. nothing could be more salutary at this stage than a little healthy contempt for a plethora of material blessings.~a system of conservation based solely on economic self-interest is hopelessly lopsided. it tends to ignore, and thus eventually to eliminate, many elements in the land community that lack commercial value, but that are (as far as we know) essential to its healthy functioning. it assumes, falsely, i think, that the economic parts of the biotic clock will function without the uneconomic parts.~ability to see the cultural value of wilderness boils down, in the last analysis, to a question of intellectual humility. the shallow-minded modern who has lost his rootage in the land assumes that he has already discovered what is important; it is such who prate of empires, political or economic, that will last a thousand years."

Behind the loud barking of too many dogs and below the many paved roads and above the blooming non-native eucalyptus and acacia I hear the trilling of the junco and call of red shouldered hawk. I see light sparkling on a natural stream that flows open to the air. I smell the Douglas fir, and I feel the sun pouring out her loving warmth and light. I envision bat houses and blooming native plants at the too perfect grounds of the Mormon temple, and I make a ritual out of speaking to the man who is digging up long untouched soil to redo a fence. I mourn at the spot where wild honeybees have been evicted from the hollow of a eucalyptus tree and I admire the honeycombs the bees had built.Let Aldo Leopold speak to you, and who knows what you might notice in your neighborhood. I'm planning to attend a gathering near Point Reyes in one month, Geography of Hope, and this year's inspiration behind the gathering is Aldo Leopold's land ethic.

22,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13510236-richard-reese,5,"Aldo Leopold’s book, A Sand County Almanac, is near the top of many lists of environmental classics. It was published in 1949, and has sold over two million copies. He was born in Iowa in 1887, when Earth was inhabited by just 1.4 billion humans. It was an era before radio, television, automobiles, airplanes, computers, DDT, nuclear fission, and antibiotics. Most roads were dirt. Vast ancient forests still thrived. On the first page, Leopold informs us that this is a book for people who cannot live without wild things.Part one is a series of twelve sketches, one for each month. They describe how the land changes during the circle of the seasons — the return of the geese, the mating ritual of the woodcocks, the rutting of the deer, the bloody snow where predators snatched prey. They describe what life was like in simpler times, before the sprawl, the malls, the highways, the tsunami of idiotic consumer crap. People were more in touch with the life of the land, because it had not yet been deleted.In 1935, Leopold bought a farm in Wisconsin. The previous owner had tried and failed to make a living tilling the lean sandy soil. The place was cheap, far from the highway, worthless to civilization, but a precious sanctuary for a nature-loving professor. Luckily, the soil mining enterprise perished quickly, before it had time to exterminate the wildness.Leopold loved the great outdoors. He loved hiking and hunting. Birds fascinated him. He spent many years working for the U.S. Forest Service, and later became a professor of Game Management at the University of Wisconsin. Sadly, he lived in a culture that was waging full-scale war on nature, and this drove him mad. It was so senseless. During his life, the population had grown from 1.5 to 2.4 billion, an era of staggering out of control disruption.Part two presents observations, made in assorted times and places, about the damaged relationship between Americans and nature. This relationship was often abusive, because it lacked love. There often was no relationship at all. Many folks had no sense of connection to the rest of the family of life. For them, nature was nothing more than a treasure chest of resources that God created for the amusement of ambitious nutjobs.Leopold was saddened by the trends. He learned to never revisit places that had amazed him in his youth. It was too painful to see the damage that commerce and tourism were tirelessly inflicting. It was best not to turn sweet memories into heartbreaking nightmares.He was raised in an era when it was perfectly normal to kill wolves, coyotes, and other predators at every opportunity. These “vermin” killed too many game animals, depriving hunters of their rightful harvest. The most famous essay in this book is Thinking Like a Mountain. Having just shot a wolf, the gunman noticed a fierce green glow in its eyes. With the wolves eliminated, the deer multiplied in numbers, stripping the vegetation off the mountain, and wrecking the ecosystem. Deer lived in fear of wolves, and the mountain lived in fear of deer.Part three is essays describing the need for a land ethic. Cultures have ethics to define right and wrong. Traditionally, these defined person-to-person interactions, or the interactions between individuals and society. Leopold lamented that American culture lacked a land ethic, rules for living with the natural world, the family of life. In our culture, as long as the land was not claimed and defended by someone else, you were free to do whatever you pleased.Mainstream education was close to useless, because it was incapable of recognizing the glaring defects in the mainstream worldview. It loaded young minds with the crash-prone software of infantile self-interest. Generation after generation was being programmed to spend their lives as robotic servants to our economic system. The education system and the economic system were the two primary threats to the health of the land. Today, 65 years later, the lunacy has become a roaring hurricane. Leopold would be horrified and furious.Leopold was a pleasant lad, glowing with love for the natural world, and a gifted storyteller. But this should not be the only ecology book you ever read. Since 1949, there has been an explosion of research in anthropology, archaeology, ecology, and environmental history. Many important discoveries have been made about hunter-gatherers, agriculture, deforestation, civilization, finite resources, climate change, and ecological sustainability. Today’s deep ecologists will sneer at a few statements in the book, but in 1949, no one was more radical than Leopold.At the time, he knew we were on a bad path, and we needed to pay serious attention to where it was taking us. He clearly understood what we needed. He wrote, “Conservation is a state of harmony between men and land.” He was sketching out a concept now known as ecological sustainability. Here’s his land ethic in a nutshell: “A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.” Great!Since the book was published, population has skyrocketed from 2.4 to 7.3 billion. Our leaders, educators, and the vast human herd remain lost in a dream world where perpetual growth is the only channel on the glowing screens. It has paralyzed our culture, and condemned our descendants. It’s running out of time. Hopefully, in its aftermath, important lessons will be learned and never forgotten.Leopold’s book was written “for people who cannot live without wild things.” As the swelling mobs surge into vast cities, our disconnection from wild nature is almost complete. We have forgotten who we are, and where we came from. Well, we’re wild animals, and we came from wild nature, like every other critter. Darwin revealed this embarrassing secret, but it still makes us uncomfortable, since it clashes with our deepest, darkest myths, our grandiose illusions of superiority.These anthropocentric myths have ancient roots in every civilized culture, and they are like venomous brain worms that turn us into planet thrashing monsters. In 1949, few expressed doubts about these myths, but Leopold did. He was a flaming radical in his day. He often dreamed that the progressive movement would eventually grow, flourish, and address the primary challenges of our time, but reality hasn’t cooperated.His vision of a land ethic would have been a first step, but not a miraculous cure. No other animal needs a formal system of rules and regulations to discourage self-destructive behavior. Like our chimp and bonobo cousins, the others have never forgotten who they are, or how to live. Thinking like an animal has worked perfectly for millions of years. Thinking like a conqueror has been a disastrous failure."
23,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80361-john,5,"Passionate, thoughtful and with an eye for subtle beauty, Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac (much like Rachel Carson's Silent Spring) is a Bible for the modern environmental movement. His writing combines the acute perceptivity of the scientist with the holistic understanding of the conservationist. He preached the gospel of conservation before it was popular to do so; at a time when the memories of buffalo and passenger pigeons still swarmed like fruit flies over the collective guilty conscience of a people who were just waking up to the consequences of their impact on the world around them. He understood the connection between the health of the environment and the prosperity of mankind at a time when the science of ecology was still in it's infancy. As population and environmental pressures make themselves more painfully felt, I believe Aldo Leopold's Land Ethic will prove more pertinent than ever before, not just to the health of the environment, but to the future of humanity."

You could feel so much in his words and on passage in particular will stay with me forever. "" We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes. I realized then, and have known ever since, that there was something new to me in those eyes-something only known to her and the mountain. I was young then, and full of trigger itch; I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, that no wolves meant a hunter's paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view"" That my friends is a message that everyone needs to hear and understand!"

I was so wrong. Leopold is known as a forester and environmentalist but he's also written concise and poetic descriptions of land, flora and fauna that make me feel like I'm also on that farm in Wisconsin.  It goes month by month through the year, with March bringing the return of the Canada geese, July the prairie flowers, September the sandhill cranes stopping over on their way south, October the red lanterns (blackberry leaves) and December the snow. This is almost a coffee table edition of the book, it includes full page color photographs by Michael Sewell, a leading nature photographer.

The land, the people and the other species are all part of a circular system, which humans have disconnected from since industrialisation.

A very enjoyable read from a world that is ever diminishing under modernity.
28,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac describes our relationship with the land—what that relationship often is and what it can be. And it is also contains singularly unique expressions of enthusiasm about the Canada goose.I was impressed by Leopold's ability to empathize with not only flora (he especially loves pines) and fauna (my favorite section was about a chickadee) but also about systems. I write 'empathy' with some trepidation. One danger that Keen highlights in Empathy and the Novel is our readiness to override and simplify the feelings and experiences of others with our own limited imagining. It takes a lot of knowledge and training to empathize well. It is perhaps also worth noting that our understanding of empathy comes from an aesthetic concept that described the audience's feeling of unity with a text. Here, we see Leopold's thoughts as he considers an abandoned farm:Higher up the creeklet I encounter an abandoned farm. I try to read, from the age of the young jackpines marching across an old field, how long ago the luckless farmer found out that sand plains were meant to grow solitude, not corn. Jackpines tell tall tales to the unwary, for they put on several whorls of branches each year, instead of only one. I find a better chronometer in an elm seedling that now blocks the barn door. Its rings date back to the drought of 1930. Since that year no man has carried milk out of this barn.I wonder what this family thought about when their mortgage finally outgrew their crops, and thus gave the signal for their eviction. Many thoughts, like flying grouse, leave no trace of their passing, but some leave clues that outlast the decades.I could not read that much into the text of an abandoned farm, but it's easy enough to start down this path. I recently read Planting in a Post-Wild World and was struck by my ability afterward to superficially interpret gardens that before had just been vaguely brown and green masses. It takes training and knowledge as well as patient willingness to see in a landscape systemic interconnectedness, a history, or our place in that web. There is something in Leopold's writings that many readers, or at least readers like me, can aspire to.A Sand County Almanac also survives as a historical document. The last passenger pigeons were killed within living memory and Leopold also explains how the last grizzly on Escudilla Mountain was killed. In ""Thinking Like a Mountain,"" Leopold outlines how outdoorsmen would shoot wolves indiscriminately to take all of the game for themselves. There is a finality in that age's decisions that I don't think they recognized, as there is in ours. Sadly, due to shifting baseline syndrome, we often walk along a mountain with little consideration of animals that might once have lived there before they were hunted into little more than a faded memory on a library book shelf.Leopold reflects that ""Man always kills the things he loves, and so we the pioneers have killed our wilderness."" Such moments seem to have led him to reconsider his own relationship with the environment, and it is his attempt to outline it in the final chapters of the book that are now viewed as seminal. At one point, he writes:""I have read many definitions of what is a conservationist, and written not a few myself, but I suspect that the best one is written not with a pen, but with an axe. It is a matter of what a man thinks about while chopping, or while deciding what to chop. A conservationist is one who is humbly aware that with each stroke he is writing his signature on the face of his land.These thoughts survive in two ways. First, I would expect any American park conservationist to have read this work, and to worry about it as those lands held in public trust are now opened up for extraction. But they also survive as a philosophical idea, especially Leopold's declaration that ""A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.""How can we foster this awareness and knowledge in ourselves? Although there are some who think the best thing we can do is avoid the wilderness altogether, I wonder if it isn't the case that people need to engage with the environment, whether it be through hunting, managing a woodlot, or gardening, before they can begin to ""think like a mountain"" or a forest or a grassland. Each of these practices can become destructive, but there is a scene in one of Michael Pollan's books in which he tries to imagine the struggles of a carrot. Who would do that if they weren't already tending a garden?A Sand County Almanac is thoughtful and many of its ideas have endured. I see much of Leopold's engagement with the land in Richard Louv's Last Child in the Woods and David G. Haskell's The Forest Unseen. I worry that we also see the dominant environmental ethic of his time—to draw upon the planet's resources indiscriminately and then move on—in our own time. This wonton and unsustainable use is documented in books like Elizabeth Kolbert's The Sixth Extinction and David Montgomery's Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations. Although Leopold's A Sand County Almanac predates the green revolution or David Keeling's measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide, it remains an important text for anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of the environment."
29,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62390164-numidica,4,"I have known of A Sand County Almanac for years; it is referenced by writers like Elizabeth Kolbert, David Quammen, E.O. Wilson; it is generally considered a classic in the genre of conservation / nature writing along with Thoreau or Muir. So I am late coming to this book, but I’m glad I finally read it, because it expresses elegantly things that any one who loves nature and the outdoors understands in his soul. Aldo Leopold says in the foreward, “There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot.” So true. A person’s need to be in nature, if they have such a need, seems almost preordained from infancy; that is how it has been for me. And yet, I know people who look at me with a puzzled expression when I talk about backpacking or canoeing in New Mexico or North Carolina; to them it seems a lot of exertion and discomfort for a minimal return. Leopold’s book tries to bridge the divide and make the case for preserving wilderness, and for spending time in nature, but he is honest about the reasons for doing so, namely, because some people have a need for wilderness in their souls, not because of some contrived economic case touting the benefits of tourism to local economies, or etc. As Leopold says later in the book:“Wilderness areas are first of all a series of sanctuaries for the primitive arts of wilderness travel…canoeing and packing,….I suppose some will wish to debate whether it is important to keep these primitive arts alive. I shall not debate it. Either you know it in your bones, or you are very, very old.”The book is divided in three parts: first, the “almanac” of Wisconsin’s sand counties, describing the activities of nature in each month of the year; then various essays about nature, hobbies, and his time as a forester in the U.S. Southwest; finally, “The Upshot” – Leopold’s thoughts on how to instill a conservation ethic in America. The writing in many parts is lyrical and quote-able. Leopold describes at length his efforts to rehabilitate the run-down 120 acre farm he bought for back taxes after the bootlegger who owned it previously left the territory for parts unknown. There is discussion of things like how many of the original prairie plants and flowers are preserved in places like cemeteries and railroad right-of-ways, and of how flowers grow in the parts of plowed fields that are too close to the fence, or are in corners. Sadly, 70 years later, most of those remnants of native prairie plants have been eradicated with RoundUp or GPS-driven precision farming. Leopold also says:“There are two spiritual dangers in not owning a farm. One is the danger of supposing that breakfast comes from the grocery, and the other that heat comes from the furnace.”In a famous section, Good Oak, he describes cutting down a lightning struck oak, and the years and events it has seen pass, and he reflects that it will warm his cabin as firewood for one winter, not more. The essay is his way of thanking the oak.He spends a great deal of time on the value of soil, and since I have been a gardener most of my life, I completely understand his focus on this. Leopold fundamentally looks at conservation as gardening writ large; one must care for the soil, the water, maximize diversity of native plant and animal life in your care, and treat the whole with respect if you want to have a sustainable system. His fundamental point is as valid for the world today as it was when he wrote 70 years ago.Leopold writes beautifully of a canoe trip he and his brother took in 1922 on the Colorado River as it meanders toward the sea in Arizona, and of his time in the Southwest as a forester. The last part of the book is somewhat repetitive, but he makes some very salient points. He endorses individual efforts to preserve land and enhance diversity, but he makes the case (and I agree) that the overall goal of sustainability cannot be achieved without government enforcement of certain minimum standards, and he argues for the teaching of conservation in schools, and more importantly of the need for children to spend time in nature. When I was in my twenties and thirties, I planted the side of a mountain in Appalachia with about two acres of Fraser Fir and Red Spruce, along with a few hemlocks. When I began, the side of the mountain was beginning to erode badly; it was a place I loved, and I wanted to improve it. Today the mountainside has firs and spruce thirty feet tall, at least among the oldest plantings, and you can see the dark forest on the side of the mountain from several miles away. I don’t own that land, but it sort of owns me, and I have great satisfaction in visiting it now. I think Aldo Leopold would have approved.If you have any interest in environmental issues, this book is a foundational text, and you should really take the time to read it."
30,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7159819-mike-mensing,5,"The war between the forest and prairie, the return of geese every March and cutting down a tree for firewood; these are just some of the things that Aldo Leopold writes about in his novel A Sand County Almanac. The novel is split into four distinct parts, but every part of the book is about the environment, either how to save it or the author’s experiences of it. Most of the book is about Aldo’s experiences in the wilderness, which are split between his cabin in Wisconsin and his many trips throughout North America. 	The author constantly argues that the environment is crucial for human beings, either by giving the reader ideas on how to save it or by supplying a great deal of stories about how the environment has effected his life. The author also contends that it is a danger to forget about the environment for many reasons. “There are two spiritual dangers in not owning a farm. One is the danger of supposing that breakfast comes from the grocery, and the other that heat comes from the furnace” (Leopold, 6). 	Through interesting language that makes the reader hold onto every word, the author writes stories about wildlife and wilderness that make it impossible not to appreciate the outdoors. For example, not many people would want to read about how bur oaks are able to live in the prairie, but Aldo makes this subject seem so interesting that the reader will never forget why they are able to live in the prairie. 	Even though the author continuously argues about the environment throughout the novel, it is not a hard read at all. Aldo writes this novel as if he were an average Joe that loves the outdoors. Through his great story telling about things like how a plant sprouts every summer, the author shows the reader how important even the littlest things in the environment really are. 	The author’s love for the environment is shown throughout A Sand County Almanac especially when he explains the best ways, in his opinion to save the planet. First, he tells the reader that they say they love America and this country, but they don’t love the country that America was built right on top of. When the author talks about the country that America was built on top of, he is not talking about another country as we might think of, but he is talking about the dirt and soil and wilderness that we built America right on top of. “Wilderness is the raw material out of which man has hammered the artifact called civilization” (Leopold, 264). 	Given that the book was written in the 1940’s and may be a little out of date for conservation, it is a must read for all of those even mildly interested in the outdoors. No matter your interest in the outdoors, A Sand County Almanac will make you appreciate wilderness even more. The reader will have a new outlook on even the smallest things, even dirt, when they step foot outside. It’s a shame that the author passed away shortly after finishing this book because the world would be better off with more books like this one. "
31,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2728699-sandie,4,"I had to read this book for a middle childhood education class that integrated social studies and science. We had to read this book for our final exam and write 8 responses to 8 quotes we found in the book. Simple enough. But I put off reading this book because I thought it would be boring and statistical. To my surprise, I actually loved it. It was more than just a capture of the goings on at the author's farm in Wisconsin; it blended history and societal downfalls that are threatening to dissolve our naturalistic world. I loved the author's thoughts and feelings about the withering and gradually disintegrating environment...even though this was written in the late '30s and published in the late '40s, his opinions and concerns are still very relevant today. I recommend giving this book a chance...it is very similar to the works of Walden, if that kind of work grabs you :)"
32,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,5,"Though dated, Leopold's Sand County Almanac and Land Ethic are classics in the environmental/ecological/conservation world and well worth re-visiting. I wonder what he would say now given the current situation in the field and in government. Leopold writes quite lyrically like a poet and with depth of connection to the history he relates. He poses some opened questions and relates some of the shortsightedness and errors made. I find his approach refreshing in that he understands the land-human connection and presents this history honestly with an eye to different views, though he makes clear his own. This edition includes the Almanac and several other essays. Highly recommended."
33,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398073-nancy,5,"I was overwhelmed and saddened by the information in this book. Even back in the early part of the century, the environment was in serious trouble. I worry about the future of our planet...with all we know about the rhythmns of the natural world...humans continue to destroy the wonders of our world. From aerial wolf killing in Alaska (thanks, Sarah Palin), to the trashing of the world by amazing amounts of garbage (WALL-E)...well things don't look good for future generations. Everyone should read Aldo Leopold...and be afraid, be very afraid of what humans are doing to mother earth. "
34,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6970638-sheri,4," So we started this today as a family read-aloud. The goal is a chapter (corresponding to a month) a day for the next 12 days.January thoughts. I liked the narcissistic representation of the animals. Each is incapable of noticing the others; I found the economic description of the meadow mouse's tunnels under the snow and the grass buried in ground especially entertaining.February is all about the felling of an oak tree. I have a burr oak in my backyard that is 200+ years old; as Leopold travels back in time (although I must say that too many of his years were simply full of fires or drought...couldn't he find something unique about each year?) through the sawing of the tree, I was thinking about how different in scale time is for a tree than a human.March tells the story of the geese. I enjoyed Leopold's comment about his learned friend who had never noticed the migration of the geese. I am not quite that bad, but it is a good reminder to pay attention to the passing season. We also had a lovely discussion between the four of us about the benefits of being a muskrat. Is it that they eat geese or that they would be able to move about among the geese without disturbing their pattern of behavior?April has a great description of the love dance of the woodcock (as a nightly entertainment) and also a short essay on the veteran bur oaks (of which mine is one).The nesting plovers in May give a new definition to field ownership. Although, I'm not sure I've ever seen a plover; maybe the forest conservationists were not just in time as Leopold asserts.June is the story of the non-prudent fisherman. The kids were interested in the fact that Leopold fishes by hand (not with a rod and reel). I thought about how different their attitudes are when at the lake; if they catch fish (some years they do) then all is well, but the years that they do not catch fish are boring and treacherous for all.July was wonderful on two fronts. First, we have a compass plant in our front yard (planted by my father in law who is a lover of all things prairie) and second, my dog(s) also does not believe in the tenure rights of birds.August was about the river painting a picture, although I wasn't convinced it was the river. Yes, the water level is determined by the river and it is a good focal point but most of the color is in the flowers and the grass, neither of which are fed by the river.September deals with the songs of the elusive birds. I am getting to a point in this book where I am not quite sure about the distinction between chapters. They all sort of seem to be about listening to the birds.October is great for those of us early morning risers: ""unlike those who sleep late, they are given to understatement of their own achievements."" I'm not sure I quite agree (and not convinced that he makes an argument for such), but it is a cute quip.November is described by the pine and the birch and the trees on Leopold's farm. Maybe it is just because I am currently reading Ayn Rand as well, but the description of the tools (axe and shovel and all else as a derivation thereof) meant more to me than the description of the trees. I'm glad that we are down to only one more month.December features my favorite quote: ""moderation is best in all things""; this is something I frequently spout. My kids loved the story of the tagged chickadee who managed to live for 5 years.So, I finished the rest on my own (the family assignment was just for Sand County Almanac) because I felt like I should read the full thing for reviewing. Part II of this book is similar to SCA, it is more descriptive natural observations and stories focused mostly on place. Leopold describes more of WI, IL, CO, AZ, NM as well as some of Mexico. His description is beautiful, but personally it is not really my cup of tea.Part III was more interesting; he gives substantive explication to his theories on conservation. I found his arguments compelling and prescient (given the extent of natural areas during the time he wrote as compared to modern times). Having just finished reading Atlas Shrugged, I found Leopold's viewpoint to be even more compelling; he argues that we need to see land as biota, rather than just soil and emphasizes that ""a system of conservation based solely on economic self-interest is hopelessly lopsided."" I enjoyed his comparison between Odysseus's murder of the slave girls and our continual destruction of natural places: until and unless we recognize the value in all living creatures we will not give adequate respect or attention to conservation. He argues that the composition of plant life (even plants that are not ""economically relevant"") determines the structure of the soil, which in turn does affect our own food chain (either through the growth of useful plants like corn or food for animals that then become plants). He demonstrates how loss of predators can leave to over development of prey which then changes the plant composition. I am glad to have read this. Living in Madison, I have come across Leopold's name and rough outline of his ideas. It is remarkable just how forward thinking he was, given that he was writing in the 1920s-1940s on issues that were yet to be so apparent."
35,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541670-caroline,4,"What a delightful surprise!I took an environmental science class in high school and as part of the class we had to read one environmental science book from a provided list. I ended up picking a super boring book about sea ice* whose title I don't remember. But, I remember seeing A Sand County Almanac as one of the options and being intrigued by the title. Also, it was written by a man called Aldo Leopold, which is just an awesome name. Between those two things, this book managed to stick itself in my memory as something I wanted to check out.When I checked the book out from the library and realized that it was much older than I thought and a foundational text in environmental non-fiction, my interest became a bit more cautious. I had every intention of still reading it, but I think I mentally braced myself for a bit of a slog. I cracked the book expected something Walden-esque. Dense, but ultimately worthwhile.My expectations could not have been more off base. Instead of philosophical treatises on the environment, Aldo Leopold trafficked in beautifully rendered vignettes that contained some philosophical musings, yes, but also descriptions of nature from someone with both a deep love and understanding of the natural world. This book exudes warmth.A Sand County Alamanc is comprised of three sections: the first is the almanac itself, within which Leopold describes his farm in one of Wisconsin's sand counties (so called because of their sandy soil), with each chapter comprising of a snapshot of one of the year's twelve months. Leopold's prose is just gorgeous and infused with the love and wonder he feels for the nature he gets to experience on his farm. Each chapter made my heart hurt a little bit, but in a happy way. I particularly loved the essays ""A Good Oak"" and ""Too Early,"" but everything in this section was just tender.The next section is called ""Sketches Here and There,"" and in it Leopold broadens his view to the rest of the western United States, with essays about his experiences in Utah, Texas, California, and more. While still lovely, these essays don't have the intimacy of those in the previous section. Reasonably enough, as how can you write about a foreign place in the same way you write about home?The third and final section is ""The Upshot"" and here's where the philosophical musings rear their head. I remember tensing up a bit at this point, worrying that the flow of the text and my enjoyment of it were both going to falter. I shouldn't have worried. Leopold describes his idea of a ""land ethic"" with the same readable prose as the rest of the book. There's a reason this book is a classic of conservation writing - it's smart, foundational stuff and Leopold primes you for his message by having you more or less drunk on his descriptions of the natural world by the time you get to the theory.One last thing worth mentioning was the thread of science that ran through the writing. Aldo Leopold didn't just enjoy writing about the beauty of the natural world from his farm. He was a trained at the Yale School of Forestry, worked for the Forest Service, and was a professor of wildlife management at the University of Wisconsin Madison. I was surprised and delighted by the scientific ideas that Leopold incorporated into his writing, particularly those of evolution and biology. It provided additional depth to an already wonderful book. 4.5 stars.*I'm sure an interesting book about sea ice exists, but it certainly wasn't the one that I ended up reading."
36,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1624588-bonny,5,"Yesterday I listed to a Radiolab podcast (http://www.radiolab.org/story/what-do...) exploring the subject of putting a monetary value on nature. While the aspects that Radiolab scrutinized were interesting in their own right, Aldo Leopold was the real master at blending environmentalism and philosophy. He beautifully recounts his observations from his farm in Wisconsin, reminds us that as humans we are a dramatically powerful part of the natural world, and introduces his land ethic.A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.He was one of the first to talk about this in these essays published in 1949, and I think it's even more important to revisit and understand his ideas today. To build a road is so much simpler than to think of what the country really needs. A roadless marsh is seemingly as worthless to the alphabetical conservationist as an undrained one was to the empire-builders. Solitude, the one natural resource still undowered of alphabets, is so far recognized as valuable only by ornithologists and cranes. Thus always does history, whether or marsh or market place, end in paradox. The ultimate value in these marshes is wildness, and the crane is wildness incarnate. But all conservation of wildness is self-defeating, for to cherish we must see and fondle, and when enough have seen and fondled, there is no wilderness left to cherish.We shall never achieve harmony with land, any more than we shall achieve absolute justice or liberty for people. In these higher aspirations the important thing is not to achieve, but to strive.I've included so many quotes here because Leopold explains these important ideas so much more succintly and elegantly than I can. Another of my favorites:There are two spiritual dangers in not owning a farm. One is the danger of supposing that breakfast comes from the grocery, and the other that heat comes from the furnace. To avoid the first danger, one should plant a garden, preferably where there is no grocer to confuse the issue. To avoid the second, he should lay a split of good oak on the andirons, preferably where there is no furnace, and let it warm his shins while a February blizzard tosses the trees outside. If one has cut, split, hauled, and piled his own good oak, and let his mind work the while, he will remember much about where the heat comes from, and with a wealth of detail denied to those who spend the week end in town astride a radiator. In his essay ""Thinking Like a Mountain"" Leopold writes about the interaction of prey, predators, and the land they both inhabit. His specific example of a trophic cascade here is wolves and deer, and how eradication of wolves can lead to over-browsing of vegetation by deer, ""hence we have dustbowls, and rivers washing the future into the sea."" I wish Aldo Leopold was alive today to write about another part of the cycle, the reintroduction of wolves and the decimation of deer and elk that the latest human attempts to control the environment have brought about. Don't know what a trophic cascade is? You owe it to yourself and the natural world you are a part of to read A Sand County Almanac and find out from one of the most thoughtful and prosaic writers on the subject."
37,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12693827-justin-rose,4,"Leopold's descriptions envelop the reader into his outdoor experiences. He was obviously a man who understood and appreciated the outdoors.Much of Sand County informs the reader of the conditions of North American wild land, and the causes of its deterioration. Like others of his genre, however, his idealism distorts and clouds a scientific approach at the problems, and methods to stop and reverse environmental damage. For example, on page 51 he proposes the idea that there should be “idle” strips of land kept from grazing and mowing so that “the full native flora, plus dozens of interesting stowaways from foreign parts, could be part of the normal environment of every citizen.” Leopold can’t be blamed for thinking this, but increased knowledge in Range Management teaches us that undergrazing or not gazing at all is detrimental to range conditions. Native ranges expect to be grazed, and if they’re not, other invasive plants, that increase in response to undergrazing, will dominate the site.Later Leopold blames fences for the problem of overgrazing. This time Leopold is right for the majority of cases, and the ranchers ignorance was to blame. In the past 60+ years since, however, determining the proper level of grazing is common science to ranchers, and fences actually aid as a tool to avoid overgrazing through a procedure termed rest-rotation.I celebrated when I read Leopold say that science class should not be memorizing bones. I learned much more science in agriculture class than I did in biology.There is a contemporary solution to problems that still exist. While Leopold’s suggestion the government control land was a solution in his time, today individuals who work the land realize the benefit of native plants and animals. The way to make these benefits lasting is to have the individuals who work the land be the same people who own the land. Truth is, the cowboy who runs cattle on Ted Turner’s ranch isn’t as concerned as the rancher who owns and ranches his own spread."
38,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17130414-frank-berg,4,"Published in 1949, shortly after the author succumbed to a heart attack while fighting a forest fire near a friend’s home near Baraboo Wisconsin, A Sand County Almanac is a joyful piece to read. I can’t completely describe how closely this book resonates to home. Opening up with a subtle but key difference in the way we view the world as an interaction rather than an ownership, is an essential respect we must provide to our ambitions as custodians of the Earth. As cognizant beings with a free will to our actions, I feel it is our duty not only to preserve the Earth with which we live, but to preserve its qualities, ripe and ready for exploration, for a wild and natural growth that can be experienced the same 5 generations from now as it was before Aldo wrote this great work.Through the seasons he exhibits intricate insights that, to me, prove his value as a seasoned and dedicated conservationist. All the seasons, arranged by monthly perusals of Aldo’s journal, are speckled with the intimate details of his farm: the skunk tracks, tagging birds, trout fishing, The writing quite well reminds me of the charismatic emphasis and tact Hemingway has behind his craft. As they both write about nature and their pursuits therein, they also include solid and distinct details about each activity that connect with insights to their views on life.Here is a favorite selection of mine from his June section:“I sit in happy meditation on my rock, pondering while my line dries again, upon the ways of trout and men. How like fish we are: ready, nay eager, to seize upon whatever new thing some wind of circumstance shakes down upon the river of time! And how we rue our haste, finding the gilded morsel to contain a hook. Even so, I think there is some virtue in eagerness, whether its object prove true or false. How utterly dull would be a wholly prudent man, or trout, or world! Did I say a while ago that I waited ‘for prudence’ sake’? That was not so. The only prudence in fishermen is that designed to set the stage for taking yet another, and perhaps longer, chance.”"
39,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1113281-trish,5,"I first heard of this book when I was reading Fire Season, and decided I wanted to read it. Its split into three sections: the Almanac itself; the Sketches, which extend the author's observations across various US states: and a collection of ecological and environmental essays. Moreover, nothing he says or comments on is any less valid now, than it was in 1949, in my view. The Almanac is a beautifully written book, lyrical and evocative in its descriptions. I was pleased to discover that his farm, which forms the centre of the Almanac, still exists (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_Le...) to preserve his methods, and has even been extended by his descendants, as his family have maintained his environmental legacy.The Sketches are just as beautifully written, but are, in a way, much more poignant, in that during in the nearly-seventy years since it was first published, a lot of the places, animals and birds that Leopold describes have probably gone forever.With respect to the final section of essays, in my view these should be read by anyone in politics, as they cover views on the importance of the environment, ecology and diversity, and the need to keep stretches of wilderness, which are probably even more important now, than they were when he wrote them."
40,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17239441-dave,0,"Stunning. (What does one say?...) Not only is the whole ethic and philosophy of conservation and nature here (what a beautiful metaphor in one spot in the book: 'the round river', of life and ecology, for example -- just put that metaphor out there in text to start one series of short essays and then never invoke it again, later; but the thought remains through all the rest of the essays) -- not only is all the thought and observation of these things here, but the Leopold style of writing (the well-thought word choices, the structure of the sentences) is 'the icing on the cake'. That's the wrong metaphor -- 'icing' -- because the style of all these essays is integral to the entire 'dish' (and meaning of it) at the same time. ... It's driven me to read Abbey as my next author on this topic, because I've heard that's good already. But Abbey (I'm 75 pp. into that -- starting the next without finishing the first book!) is not the equal, in all parts, of what this book joins together. ... "

Anyone who has missed reading these essays drawn from nature is missing one of the best ""meals"" served up by writer for both mind and senses. The author is a professor who lives on some modest acreage in Wisconsin in the mid-twentieth century. He devotes an essay to each month of the year (hence, ""almanac"").One of my favorite essays was the one about the oak tree which was hit by lightning and then felled for firewood. As the sawyers cut through the rings the author summarizes the years which those rings represent. I made mental note that the year of my father's father's birth heralded the introduction of barbed wire.I may have to make the reading of this book a yearly pilgrimage for myself."

46,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5119314-anne-gigi-chan,5,"I wrote 2 essays about this book for my restoration ecology class. I thought I would share them here. This is the first one in response to Part I: A Sand County Almanac.A Sand County Almanac made a significant impression on me the moment I read these words in the Foreword: … our bigger-and-better society is now like a hypochondriac, so obsessed with its own economic health as to have lost the capacity to remain healthy. These words were true in 1948, and, sadly, they are still true to a large extent almost 70 years later. I knew right then that I could look forward to more words of wisdom from Leopold in this book. Unlike some of my fellow restoration ecologists-in-training, this is my first encounter with this book. The style of writing is not what I am accustomed to in that it is filled with scientific facts and knowledge without being technical or didactic. Instead, Leopold’s light-hearted and conversational style made it a lot easier to absorb the information and appreciate the trove of knowledge he imparted to his readers. I am truly inspired by the constant sense of wonder the author had for the natural world as well as his appreciation for the historical and ongoing interactions between people and nature. Leopold touched on multiple aspects and characteristics of nature throughout his writing. One of these is the difference in perception of time from the view of the natural world and that of people. He alluded to this in The Green Pasture, when he described the fleeting appearance of the green swathe of Eleocharis after the river deposited a thin layer of silt on the sand, and in Draba, where he talked about the tiny flower which bloomed just for a very short time in spring. A short moment in time for people is enough for a full cycle of events in nature. These essays highlight the importance of the need to be observant and vigilant at all times in order to learn about ephemeral features in the natural world. The Green Pasture also reinforces the idea that no matter how advanced human technology might be, there will always be something in nature that is out of our control, and sometimes it is best to just be aware of it and appreciate it as it is presented to us. Juxtaposing the above short-lived phenomena was the apparent constancy of an 80-year-old tree in Good Oak. While numerous human actions and decisions were impacting the environment, both negatively and positively, during those eight decades, this oak tree appeared to be unchanging and unaffected by the passage of time in that it “laid on wood just the same”, being a sentinel to the evolving relationship between humans and their natural surroundings. Having played a seminal role in the establishment of Curtis Prairie, the oldest ecologically restored prairie in the world, it was not surprising to see Leopold make references of themes pertinent to restoration ecology in these essays. For instance, he was very cognizant of the functions and values of the natural world. The recognition of ecosystem services was evident throughout the book: wood making in Good Oak and Axe-in-Hand, hunting in Smoky Gold and Red Lanterns, and fishing in The Alder Fork are but a few examples. The appreciation for these benefits from the ecosystem is often what motivates and drives ecological restoration. For example, many restoration projects along the Duwamish River focus on improving salmon habitat; that is partly driven by the economic benefits from having a higher and sustainable salmon population (and also because certain salmonids are listed in the Endangered Species Act). In A Mighty Fortress, Leopold alluded to another topic that is often center to many ecological restoration projects: functional groups. Although it did not sound appealing to have acquired “almost as many tree diseases as […] trees” when he bought the woodlot, the dead trees resulted from these diseases were paramount in supporting an assemblage of diverse species. This example draws special attention to the importance of considering all the functional groups when designing a restoration project. Another theme that is germane to restoration ecology is species selection and this includes choosing which species to remove and as well as which ones to install. In Axe-in-Hand, through the discussion of deciding which tree to cut down, Leopold hinted at a salient point: while an ecologist may understand, intellectually, that each species has its function and role in the ecosystem, one must always be aware of potential personal bias for or against a certain species that may have nothing to do with science. It is, therefore, important to focus on the goals of the restoration project and make the species selection based on the best available science. Although these essays were not written specifically as an instructional guidebook for restoration ecologists, one can draw relevant knowledge and, hopefully, wisdom from Leopold’s musings on the bonds and interactions between humans and nature as well as the intricate relationships amongst the various components within an ecosystem.And this is my second response: Many philosophers in the past century have proposed theories and frameworks regarding how humans interact with nature; however, Aldo Leopold was the first one to introduce the phrase “land ethic” in A Sand County Almanac. Leopold considered the land ethic a result of evolutionary process after the development of ethics regarding relationships between individuals and relationships between the individual and society. The logical progression of such “ethical sequence” would be an ethic that deals with the relationships between people and their natural environment. Land ethic is a set of moral principles which guides how an individual behaves when interacting with the community to which s/he belongs, whereby the community comprises of other individuals as well as “the land”, which includes the soils, water, flora, and fauna. It is also often the moral framework behind which ecological restoration exists. The acknowledgement that human activities, through utilization and management of ecosystem services and natural resources, are responsible for the degradation of ecosystems and the desire to right this wrong are the drive and motivation behind many ecological restoration projects. Leopold believed that such an ethic is necessary because he observed people reaping the benefits from the natural world without restraint and without consideration for the long-term consequences to the ecosystems. In Clandeboye and Song of the Gavilan, he expressed his concern for the wetland and riparian/riverine ecosystems that have yet been degraded by human activities. He lamented that, unlike those who inhabited along Rio Gavilan centuries ago, modern men are not capable of coexisting with their natural environment without “disrupting the harmony of its life”; he bid farewell to the marsh and the river as he knew that it was just a matter of time before unrestrained human activities, all in the name of progress, would arrive at these locations. If people abide by the land ethic, they would exercise restraint when harvesting ecosystem services and strive to achieve co-existence with their environments in “mutual tolerance and harmony”. One of the core concepts in restoration ecology, and ecology in general, is the dynamic equilibrium within an ecosystem in a steady or stable state. Leopold discussed this concept in The Round River when referring to the stable communities of soil, fauna, and flora in Wisconsin, which remained essentially the same for 12,000 years, despite periodic disturbances. He also alluded to it in Thinking Like a Mountain by showing us how such equilibrium was disrupted when an apex predator, the wolf, was eliminated from the equation. A restoration ecologist must learn to “think like a mountain”, that is to look at the big picture and consider individual components of the ecosystem in relation to the entire system. One must understand that every biotic and abiotic component, or “every cog and wheel”, plays a role within an ecosystem and appreciate each component as an integral part of a system, without which the ecological balance would be disrupted. This conceptual framework provides guidance throughout the entire process of a restoration project, from assessment, goal setting, design, and implementation to maintenance and monitoring.Preservation of wilderness and utilization of natural resources are often presented as opposing ideas. However, based on his writings, Leopold did not believe that they are mutually exclusive or contradicting concepts. Being an avid hunter and fisherman, as illustrated in Smokey Gold, The Alder Fork, Goose Music, and The Green Lagoons, he obviously had no issue with using natural resources. Meanwhile, as evident in Wilderness and the fact that he was one of the founders of the Wilderness Society, Leopold clearly appreciated wilderness for its intrinsic value as well as its value for recreation, science, and wildlife; by extension, he also believed in the need to preserve it. By harvesting and managing ecosystem services in a sustainable manner while preserving wilderness wherever possible, one can stay true to the land ethic and strive for a “state of harmony between men and land”.Reading A Sand County Almanac has been an inspiring journey for me. The messages in the book echoed the reasons why I decided to pursue a career in restoration ecology. The essays that resonate with me, e.g. Odyssey, The Round Table, and Thinking Like a Mountain, are those that talked about the interconnectedness of the various components within an ecosystem – this is one aspect in ecology that fascinates me the most. I also appreciate how Leopold compared the land to an organism and mentioned “land doctoring” and “land health” in Wilderness; with my background in veterinary medicine, that is often my default frame of reference when assessing a degraded, or “sick”, ecosystem. I look forward to “revisiting” Sand County and, probably, adding more dog-ears and annotations to the book in the future."
47,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836012-joel,5,"An optimist might easily describe Aldo Leopold, along with John Muir and Henry Thoreau, as a pioneer species in the eventual succession of modern environmentalism. To the pessimist he remains a shunned prophet, whose advice was relevant at its conception, continues to be so, and yet is repeatedly ignored. No wonder the cry of the eco-warrior resounds ever more desperately! The work for which Leopold is most famous, A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There, was first published in 1949, twenty-three years before the founding of Greenpeace. The longevity and continued pertinence of his work is evident, particularly demonstrated by the introduction of the ‘land ethic’, a term as prominent now within environmental discourse as Escudilla Mountain on an east Arizona horizon (p. 133). However, if he had lived to experience the reception of this book, Leopold would have most likely construed the label ‘visionary’ as an insult, no doubt insisting his senses other than sight as astute. For that matter, he would have been in all likelihood adamant that it was not he who was worthy of praise, and that any fan mail should be addressed to his dog, a long term companion and Professor of Logic (p.63). 	The book is certainly curious in its arrangement. The first section, A Sand County Almanac, is a series of short, descriptive essays on nature observed from his Wisconsin backwater retreat set around the Gregorian calendar, which forms a convenient framework for both author and reader. Leopold is quick to point out, however, that nature obeys no such rigid representation of time, but is in fact the orchestrator. To his mind a skunk’s track marks the beginning of a ‘cycle of beginnings and ceasings which we call a year’ (p. 3). Nature is the canvas on which the behaviour of various organisms paints a picture of time: seasonal activities depict a year, their instinctive habits illustrate a sense of eternity. Thus the mystique of nature and its transcendence over the human world are succinctly introduced. This theme is further exemplified later in the book: the annual return of cranes to a marsh ‘is the ticking of the geologic clock’ and thus they exist not only ‘in the constricted present, but in the wider reaches of evolutionary time’ (p. 97). The short descriptive chapters of the first two parts of the book, the second of which furthers the scope of the book to more remote locations and distant times, build towards the academic essays that make up The Upshot, the final section, wherein Leopold sets out to achieve the reintegration of the human and the natural world through his theory of the land ethic.To call the book visually emotive is to tell only half the story. The rich, lucid text appeals to all the senses, as Leopold brings remote wilderness scenes within earshot. The dog, meanwhile, routinely proffers his opinions on the landscape through his preferred medium of smell. The pace is leisurely, much like a wander in the outdoors, allowing curiosity to dictate direction. The unorthodox style of the book’s structure avoids irony when the author states that education is better learnt through awareness than via book. His assertion that ‘every farm woodland... should provide its owner a liberal education’ (p. 73). Never has there been a better, if unwitting, justification for geographical fieldwork. It recalls Lin Yutang, when he writes ‘a man who knows how to read finds everything becomes a book... hills and waters are also books’ in The Importance of Living. A Sand County Almanac reads similarly to fiction, only there is little in the way of characters. We learn little of the forester telling the story, outside his clear eccentricities, and even less of the dog. Instead, character development is dedicated in the main to nature. Encouraged by the innumerable personifications made by the author, notably the discussion on the way different species of pine ‘differ radically in their opinions about marriageable age’ (p.85), the reader is encouraged to invest emotionally in the plight of nature, such as one would accord a protagonist in a novel. In a time before documentaries such as Planet Earth (2008) or The Private Life of Plants (1995) existed, this book plays an important role in enamoring nature to the reader. Modern readers may benefit from the intertextuality of the modern wildlife film and A Sand County Almanac, and British readers might find it difficult, if it weren’t for the occasional Americanism and the exclusive States setting, to separate Attenborough and Leopold in their minds. Both are easy narrators with which to get along, and both share a love of personification when describing nature. The great virtue of this part of the book, and arguably the greatest talent of Leopold, is the way in which he can create a connection between reader and every aspect of nature. Further to the light work he makes of giving personality to the organic (for example: ‘there is much small-talk and neighbourhood gossip among pines’ (p. 83)), he succeeds in doing similar justice to the inorganic. The tale of atom X as he passes through the nitrogen cycle in a chapter entitled Odyssey springs to mind. The suggestion ‘for the last word in procrastination, go travel with a river reluctant to lose his freedom to the sea’ says it all. 	Set out in the foreword are the principle ideas expounded by the volume. Ecology is worthy of study, environmental conservation is of paramount importance, and ‘the land yields a cultural harvest’. However, it is not until the final part of the book that these concepts are given full philosophical and academic analysis. In summary Leopold asserts that the solutions to mankind’s problems can be found in nature and advocates an ‘ecological interpretation of history’ (p. 205). He also states that research into ecology is necessary so that agriculture can be informed to improve its environmental sustainability. The conservation of nature is important because science is infant in its knowledge of the symbioses of the world environment, as demonstrated by the ecological disaster of the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The idea of the embeddedness of culture in nature, is perhaps the assertion most vulnerable to attack in the postmodern age, and perhaps the theorem through which the book shows most its age. To today’s Western man, culture is a world of screens, celebrity and cosmopolitanism. The man who finds national culture in the nature of his locality, and defines himself in terms of outdoor pursuits is arguably a thing of the past, or at the most a minority. The book culminates with the formulation of ‘the land ethic’, in Leopold’s words the enlargement of ‘the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants and animals, or collectively: the land’. It is this demand for an alternative to the anthropocentric ideologies of the age, which resonates so loudly to this day and continues to inspire new generations of environmentalists.	From the book it is possible to infer some of the politics of Leopold, and it is in this respect that some readers will have difficulty sympathising with his views completely. In the book, Leopold writes of ‘the land’, but perhaps it would be more suiting for him to write of ‘the Land’, such is his belief that human salvation is attainable only though the embracing of nature, or perhaps even subordination to it. He is almost fanatical in his admiration. In his eccentricity, which he freely indulges throughout the first parts of the book, he finds wonder in things that the average human might find quite uninteresting. He writes that the ‘ability to perceive quality in nature begins, as in art, with the pretty (p. 96). The unfortunate fact may be that this is where such an ability also ends for the majority. Socialists and feminists among others might ridicule his formulation of a ‘land ethic’, instead prioritising a ‘human ethic’ which is yet to be realised. On reading the book one can infer that Leopold was not only a conservationist but also a conservative. British readers might identify him as of the One Nation conservative mold, others as a compassionate conservative. He places great stress on the value of the wilderness as an arena in which to foister an American sense of self-sustainability, and talks of the importance of nurturing national culture through nature, but at the same time recognises that ‘politics and economics are advanced symbioses’ of ‘co-operative mechanisms with an ethical content’ (p. 202). One can imagine how, in an alternative reality of random dinner dates, any interchanges over buck steak and sour-dough biscuit between Aldo Leopold and Edward Luttwak, author of Turbo Capitalism (2000) would be both complimentary and amicable. This prompts the question: was Leopold a true progressive, as modern day environmentalists tend to self-identify, or was he a Luddite, antagonistic of modern ways of life and merely wanting to return to the time and place of the wildernesses of his youth? Is the land ethic philosophy a yearning for a distant past or a utopian future? Or both? Does it even matter? The endangered species has as little interest in the motivations of its saviour as in his opinions on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage. Such inferences may grate, however, with modern sensibilities, as do his old-fashioned references to ‘civilised’ and ‘primitive’ peoples.See comments for conclusion of review..."
48,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,4,"Although unknown to me until recently, A Sand County Almanac is a classic in environmental literature, often compared to the work of Henry David Thoreau and John Muir. A friend of mine, a philosophy professor at Seton Hall University, is using the book in an environmental studies program. When I asked her why she was no longer teaching philosophy courses, she pointed out Aldo Leopold’s book, saying it had a very explicit philosophy pertaining to environmental issues.The book is divided into three sections. The first describes the author’s experiences with a washed-out, 120-acre, abandoned sand farm which he bought in Wisconsin, near the University of Wisconsin, where he taught. He mainly describes the birds, the wildflowers, the trees and in general the wildlife as he observed it and experienced it over many seasons. While my head is not suited to retaining the names of many plant species, still his descriptions are moving and beautiful, especially when he imagines the perceptions of the birds and small mammals which populate the farm.The second section ventures more widely to wildlife scenes in various parts of the United States, as well as in Mexico and in Canada. There is more variety, and Leopold is able to describe deterioration of the land as a result of logging, farming and economic development. I am particularly interested in the results of eliminating the natural predators of deer, such as cougars and wolves, so that the deer overpopulate the woods and destroy all of the saplings and ground level native plants. Then invasive species take over, and eventually the trees die out. This is a pattern that Leopold documents in detail, and the same pattern is damaging, if not destroying, the local woods in the South Mountain Reservation where I am a volunteer preservationist.The third part is the philosophical section, and I was impressed by how thoroughly Leopold has thought out our relation to our biome. He thinks of our environment, the biome, as an organism, organized in a kind of pyramid, building from the soil, to plants, to insects, to birds and rodents, to larger animals, and ultimately to omnivores such as humans, bears and raccoons. Leopold inveighs in many different ways against seeing the environment in purely economic terms. A wildflower which dies out may have contributed to the biome in a way unfathomable to us, so that by conquering the wilderness we are damaging the organism of which we are a part.Without getting lost in the philosophical weeds, I will quote one passage in which Leopold masterfully bridges the gap between the environment and philosophy: “An ethic, ecologically, is a limitation on freedom of action in the struggle for existence. An ethic, philosophically, is a differentiation of social from anti-social action.” People often think that ethics pertains to relationships among people, and not to anything non-human. Leopold points out that damaging the organism of which we are a part is of social concern to everyone.This is a beautiful book, with very substantial philosophical passages, not to mention poetic passages. It inspires me to go back to Thoreau, and to think more philosophically about my love of wilderness America."
49,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61115-kimber,5,"This collection of writings and sketches by Aldo Leopold, a man known as the grandfather of conservation, was published in 1949 by the author's son, one year after Aldo Leopold's death. The essays are divided into three parts, with a scattering of nature/outdoor sketches throughout. The first section includes Leopold's acute observations of nature on his 80-acre “sand farm” in Sauk County, Wisconsin, through 12 essays – one for each month. In the second section of essays, Leopold includes observations from other places he has worked, camped, walked, canoed, or hunted in, including a section about canoeing with his brother on a river with green lagoons, a trip during which they didn't see another human being for weeks. The third and final section is made up of a few longer essays sharing Leopold's viewpoint and philosophies on conservation and the land ethic.I really enjoyed taking this book in. Leopold's writing is lyrical and he describes a scene or setting so that you almost feel like you were there with him as he follows the tracks of a skunk through the snow, purely out of curiosity for what sort of business the skunk had undertaken after a period of winter inactivity, during an early spring thaw. His philosophies and outlook during the early to mid 1900s seem prescient although they shouldn't, because he plainly says that you can predict what will happen to America's wilderness by studying what happened to Europe's wilderness. The whole book is a call to preserve America's wild life and wild places. It's full of deep knowledge and thoughtful sentences: “A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.” It's a book I think everyone should read."
50,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5029399-paul,3,"Aldo Leopold was a scientist, author, forester, ecologist, and environmentalist before he passed away in 1948. One year after his death A Sand County Almanac was published, and is now known as one of the greatest pieces in nature writing (writing about the natural environment). Leopold splits his book into three main sections, “A Sand County Almanac”, “Sketches Here and There”, and “The Upshot”. He illustrates the diversity, beauty, and complexity of nature throughout these sections and urges the reader to change the way they see and value land. In his first section, “A Sand County Almanac,” Leopold describes what he sees in nature (everything from geese to trees, trout to prairie flora etc.) around his “sand farm” in Wisconsin. This creates a section compromised of extremely detailed testimonies of the happenings of nature in Wisconsin for every month of the year. While this may sound dry to most, Leopold develops a interesting pull to areas that may be originally thought of as boring. For example, in the February chapter he recalls a time when a tree was struck by lightning and he decided to use it for fuel. While the this experience is not quite special, Leopold opens the reader’s eyes to how amazing (and old) trees are. While sawing the tree down Leopold pays attention to each ring (or year) that they cut through. Instead of stating the tree lived to be 71 years old, Leopold accounts each year that the tree lived from 1936 to 1865. Hearing that something is 71 years old is not powerful in itself, but hearing the history of each year that tree survived though is very powerful. When accounting the years, Leopold states “Now our saw bites into the 1920’s, the Babbittian decade when everything grew bigger and better in heedlessness and arrogance-until 1929, when the stock markets crumbled…Now the saw bites into 1910-1920, the decade of the drainage dream, when steam shovels sucked dry the marshes of central Wisconsin to make farms, and made ash-heaps instead.” What makes this portion powerful is Leopold tells of the hardships the tree overcame, while including big human events to help the reader realize how much time is passing. This account and many others in this section puts nature into a different perspective, it humanizes nature and shows the intrinsic value in it. The second section, titled “Sketches Here and There,” Leopold shares personal testimonies organized by different states he has visited. He brings the reader through some of his amazing personal journeys that all are interconnected through a common theme: conservation. In one journey he goes into depth about how important each role in the ecosystem is to keep things going smoothly. He describes the incredibly intricate network of a mountains biome and the countless consequences of disturbing the ecological balance. He specifically goes into one account on the possibility of wolves overhunting and states, “I know suspect that just as deer lives in mortal fear of the wolves, so does the mountain live in mortal fear of its deer.” The imbalance of one member of the ecosystem throws off the affects everything around it. This idea leads into the last section of the book, “The Upshot”.This section is fueled by the previous two sections, and is the “purpose” of Leopold’s book. Through various essay’s Leopold discusses how people view and treat nature, and its role in American culture. He talks about conservation and the scientific piece of it. More importantly, he argues that it is a social need. He claims not enough is being done to help conserve the environment because our society and government only cares about economical progress. Leopold hopes to change societies views about conservation, and get people to think of land outside of self-interest, but claims it cannot exist without people who love and care for the environment. He thinks lack of proper education is the biggest thing leading us in the wrong direction, “One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen. An ecologist must either harden his shell and make believe that the consequences of science are none of his business, or he must be the doctor who sees the marks of death in a community that believes itself well and does not want to be told otherwise.” Leopold hopes for a more ecological educated society, for a society that doesn’t know that it’s hurting the environment won’t stop hurting it. Leopold carries great knowledge, detail, insight and character in his book. His three sections intertwine and are easy for the reader to follow. The book contains pleasing drawings, and some spellbinding imagery. While some areas of the first section seemed to become boring at times, Leopold managed to be incredibly detailed and still keep the reader interested about things like field mice; but what really convinced me that this book was a success was it’s drive to get the reader to view nature differently. It often had me thinking, “why do we cut down living trees” or “it’s really a shame we thought farming was superior to the beauty of prairies.” Leopold was ahead of his time, and unfortunately we were not able to make many advances in the direction he wished for, but I believe he is ecologically educating people through this book. I full heartedly agree with Leopold in that our society should take a step back and stop caring primarily for our economical advance."

Aldo Leopold instills such a sense of wonder, duty, imagination, and adventure into his writings while also educating.

52,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4592864-kevin,5,"hen was the last time you saw a natural forest, prairie, marsh, or waterway untouched by humans? Instead, we see concrete, roads, buildings, and the infrastructure of our modern world. As a society, our idea of nature comes from parks intermediately dispersed throughout an urban jungle. Even in the most rural parts of the country, the landscape has been altered to fit human needs with fences, plowed fields, and forests cleared for more agricultural land. We have removed ourselves from nature and forgotten what it really is. The consequences that stem from the degradation of the environment are remote and foreign. As long as the repercussions are not happening in our backyard, they do not exist and are not factors in our decision-making. We don’t think about how an SUV’s emissions might influence the climate; instead, we worry about the amount we’ll pay at the pump. Aldo Leopold set out to change that mindset with his work on A Sand County Almanac more than fifty years ago. Leopold’s idea that we need to be good stewards of the environment has had a profound influence on the modern restoration movement, but it is an important component in the push for more sustainable economies, and wilderness preservation as well.A major obstacle to restoration efforts is changing people’s perception of how they should relate to nature. For the average person nature exists to satisfy their needs, whether that means using it for development, recreation, or simply ownership. Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, humans have asserted a dominant role over nature, insisting that we can somehow control and change nature to suit our purposes. Rather than approaching nature with a sense of community of which humans are a part, we have long had an attitude of entitlement and ownership. Leopold proposes a major shift in paradigm by suggesting that we make an addition to our ethical framework that he calls a land ethic. He argues that we must enlarge the boundary of what we consider community to include the soil, water, plants and animals, in other words nature. Adopting the land ethic would change our human centered world-view to incorporate the natural world, thus shifting humans’ from the conquerors of the community to integral members of it.). Leopold condemns the economic valuation of nature, therefore denouncing the current practice of sustainable development. Placing an economic value on something determines our relationship to it. A land ethic is about being a member of the land, not being the owner, and learning how to appreciate the intrinsic value of nature. While the intrinsic value of nature is crucial to the land ethic, as a conservationist Leopold understands the need for humans to exploit nature for the necessities of life. As a result, Leopold strives to create a perfectly balanced system that can protect nature’s integrity, while simultaneously meeting societal demands for goods and services. In modern economies, the large and growing population, along with improvements in technology, has put a serious strain on that balance. These days short-term economic models and commodity based society give little thought to how crucial it is to maintain natural resources, or to the correlation between their economic decisions and environmental degradation. Let alone how we are throwing away the resources future generations will come to depend on. The current trend cannot continue forever because ecology and economics are intertwined. For economies to survive, countries need to exploit its natural resources, but economic collapse is a direct consequence of resource depletion. Our only solution is to become more sustainable. Leopold felt that by upholding the health of the land, its capacity of self-renewal and regeneration could also be maintained. In the land ethic Leopold describes a way to maintain a steady relationship between people and the environment. By getting back in touch with nature, humans will come to better understand how their actions affect the environment.For most of the population, the natural world is an abstract notion leading to gross neglect of the environment. Instead, Leopold advocates that the human population as a whole work together with an environmental ethic to become good stewards of nature. Becoming a good steward of the environment means that we have to take restoration more seriously, institute sustainable practices into our economy, and preserve wilderness for future generations. By incorporating a land ethic into our sense of values, we have the power to re-integrate ourselves with the natural world we have long forgotten. A quote from Leopold best describes the ultimate goal of any environmental conservation effort, “we end, I think, at what might be called the standard paradox of the twentieth century: our tools are better than we are, and grow better faster than we do. They suffice to crack the atom, to command the tides. But they do not suffice for the oldest task in human history: to live on a piece of land without spoiling it.”I focused here on the latter part of the book, because I think it had the largest impact on me, but the rest of A Sand County Almanac is well worth the read. Leopold writes with beautifully simply but passionate prose. His description of cutting a tree down, recounting its long history is simply amazing."

54,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86459859-ashwin-sivakumar,5,"For those who pay attention to the details of the natural world around them, as well as those who delight in discussions of fundamental philosophy, A Sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold will be a spectacular read. Leopold, a famous biologist and environmentalist of the early 20th century, succeeds in both captivating the readers with a series of stories about his experience with nature and convincing them to care about the land. A remarkable verbal portrait of the North American landscape, the volume consists of three different books, united by their pinpoint focus on the often-overseen details of the natural world.	In the first book, the original Sand County Almanac, Leopold describes, month by month, the most beautiful and humbling moments of living amongst nature on his farm in rural Wisconsin. Each vignette is composed in vivid, poetic detail, painting a remarkable image of the extraordinary natural environment Leopold experienced. Leopold transports the readers back in time and allows them to see each and every natural phenomenon, whether it be small, plump woodcocks plummeting from the sky in an incredible display or the sight of Leopold and his colleagues sawing through the trunk of a 70-year-old oak on a cold February morning, exposing ring after ring of history as they progress, or the sounds of a covey of quail breaking into chorus at daybreak. The first book makes one think about not only the simple joys of living in nature, but also starts to highlight the importance of preserving it. 	The second book, “The Quality of Landscape,” is similar in tone and theme, but much grander in its scope. It takes us along Leopold’s travels across the North American continent, dragging us between simple yet beautiful portrayals of a number of seemingly random locations across the United States and beyond. Though the locations Leopold takes us to may seem ordinary, he makes sure to show us at least a snapshot of the astounding natural communities that make a living at each one, ranging from a spring storm in the remote Arizona mountains to a pair of grebes raising their young in a marsh in Manitoba.	In his third book, “A Taste for Country,” Leopold takes an entirely different turn. The tone transitions quickly from vivid descriptions of nature to profound essays on ecology, philosophy, and wildlife conservation. Suddenly, the readers, who thus far have only been luxuriating in the wondrous phenomena of nature, now must contemplate the hard reality of how humanity has been treating it. Leopold does not fail to ponder each of the ethical dilemmas that arise from considering our relationship with the land. While this book may take time to absorb in full detail, it is ultimately gratifying and will leave the readers thinking long after they finish.	Finally, Leopold manages to tie together the themes introduced in the previous three books in a revolutionary and inspiring conclusion - “The Upshot.” In this section, Leopold unveils a brand-new framework of thinking about ecology and nature conservation - the “Land Ethic.” To truly appreciate this book, one must understand the context in which it was written. Throughout the early 20th century, politicians and wildlife “managers” had a distorted view of nature - they viewed it as something that existed solely to cater to the needs of humans. For this reason, the government sponsored the eradication of numerous apex predators, such as wolves and bears, from the United States. Leopold realized this policy was foolhardy, and he emphasizes the importance of preserving the ecosystem as a whole, with all parts intact. Once one finishes the entire volume, his theories make perfect sense due to their ideal juxtaposition with the vignettes on the beauty of the biosphere earlier in the book. 	All in all, A Sand County Almanac is a two faced book, but these faces work perfectly in conjunction with one another. The stories of Leopold’s experiences in nature is sure to delight those who enjoy observing the wonders of the natural world around them, and the later chapters will captivate all those who find themselves pondering ethical questions from time to time. The book is by no means easy to digest, often containing extremely flowery prose and terminology, but for those who are interested in the topics the book concerns, this simply adds to the flavor. In conclusion, A Sand County Almanac is a remarkable, groundbreaking book that belongs on the shelf of anyone even remotely interested in nature, as well as those who ask deep questions about the world around them."

I see why its such a classic for folks in natural resources. It resonates very deeply with my (and many other folks) passion for nature.

The first portion of the book describes the seasons and land in a poetic almanac fashion, focusing on Aldo Leopold’s property in Sauk County, Wisconsin. His land was considered to be marginal farmland, too sandy to be useful. The seasons are narrated, highlighting how beautifully ecosystems adapt and flourish even in wildly varying and often harsh conditions found in northern continental climates. The descriptions are observed in differing biomes found in ‘a sand county’; tall grass prairie, oak savannah, and forest. Aldo Leopold fondly describes the inhabitants of these ecosystems – appreciating the cleverness of their ability to adapt and find niches in the environment, a “theatre of evolution” before our eyes. The second portion of the book is comprised of some of Aldo Leopold’s essays. The essays combine and connect diverse subject matter from ecology and history, to politics and hunting, farming, conservation and freedom in a prose that is unassumingly both poetic and philosophical. For instance, he describes how marshes represent a certain quality in nature, even though wetlands were commonly thought to be a waste of land that could be drained and farmed. The marshes for him represent an earthly history and intricate ecosystem, resulting in brilliant creatures such as cranes. The essays resonate with the importance of ecological functioning and use our abilities and human expertise to detect and mimic the harmony already present in earth systems. He writes on farming, hunting, and different theories of conservation and on intersections among our social world of politics, government, economists and social planners. His essays become philosophical, reasoning that breaking and destroying functioning ecosystems is an ethical issue. Science is acknowledged to have brought about the moral contribution of objectivity, but also material ‘blessings’. But he goes deeper than ethical reasoning. He cuts to an honest human dialogue with himself, from his hunting experience he recounts shooting an older wolf: “we reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes. I realized then, and have known ever since, that there was something new to me in these eyes – something known only to her and to the mountain.”Aldo Leopold’s formulation of a land ethic makes up the third portion of the book. An ethic, after all, is really a form of evolution: the forming of a social code of conduct – “the tendency of interdependent individuals or groups to evolve modes of co-operation.” This is simple symbioses for us, he argues that healthy ecosystems have inherent value and we should expand our realm of morals and ethics to include a Land Ethic in our conservation education, and to make sure conservation is about maintaining harmony between humans and the land. 	A Sand County Almanac is a must read for anyone studying the environment. Aldo Leopold’s pure honesty certainly rings true with me: “one of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives in a world of wounds.” It has become a classic book in the body of American environmental literature. But this book is more than an environmental classic; it explains a type of sensible, yet radical thinking and appreciative understanding of nature and our environment that is often hard to put into words.

The back half, while making many valid arguments gets a bit preachy, unfortunately at times even taking on an undertone of us versus them. All in all, however, I thought it to be well written a very worthwhile read."

Aldo Leopold — a forester, farmer, professor, and later advisor to the United Nations — writes brief pieces about his farm in the sand counties of Wisconsin and the joys of his experiences with wild life and the sorrow he feels at its loss. Leopold has a keen eye for the connectedness of his world and a deep love for the native and overlooked species of his place. He waxes eloquent about wildflowers most people don't notice and sings praise to the birds few have seen. He explores the life span of molecules and the importance of protecting the land's predators. He clearly sees the threats to the land (by which he means the soil, plants, animals, and water) as a threat to America's economy, stability, culture, and history. He mourns the loss of landscape that American's have lost forever. He despairs that loss, but hopes for change.The great thing about this book is that I can see it playing well with multiple parties. It might simply be a result of this book being a product of another time, but I'm going to attribute it to Leopold's special blend of experience and sensibility. He is a farmer, a hunter, a fisher, an ornithologist, a forester, an academic, a conservationist. Because he is a part of so many worlds, he speaks well to so many worlds. He definitely calls out the shortcomings he sees in all those fields, and in no uncertain terms, but it would be hard for someone to say, ""Oh, he just doesn't get that because he's never done that before."" It feels to me that Aldo Leopold is a kind of person that we need today, but don't have; a fact he had foreseen. Read the book. Mourn the loss and degradation of America's land. Believe that with action there is hope. Go find a piece of land and fall in love with it so that its need are before your own.Here's a bit from ""The Land Ethic"" (emphasis mine):""The land ethic simply enlarges the boundary of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land.""This sounds simple: do we not already sing our love for and obligation to the land of the free and the home of the brave? Yes, but just whom do we love? Certainly not the soil, which we are sending helter-skelter down river. Certainly not the waters, which we assume have no function except to turn turbines, float barges, and carry off sewage. Certainly not the plants, of which we exterminate whole communities without batting an eye. Certainly not the animals, of which we have already extirpated many of the largest and most beautiful species. A land ethic of course cannot prevent the alteration, management, and use of the 'resources,' but it does affirm their right to continued existence, and at least in spots, their continued existence in a natural state. ""In short, a land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such."""
59,0195007778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1064222-rebecca,4,"""We grieve only for what we know (p.52)."" Though the topic might seem a bit wonky, this thoughtful book, like Walden before it, feels both nostalgic and urgent in its message: we need to improve our land-ethic, and in order to do that, we need to know what a land-ethic is. This isn't ""leftist politics"" pushing an agenda, this is down-to-earth (literally) common sense for the benefit of us all (which, depending on whom you ask, is often the goal of ""leftist politics,"" too). ""Conservation is getting nowhere because it is incompatible with our Abrahamic concept of land. We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect (p. xviii).""We should be making land-ethic curriculum a priority for our junior high age students. We should be teaching components of this to our children from a very young age. We take care of the earth because we live here, because its health is our health. ""The present educational marathon in memorizing the geography of bones is the aftermath of this perfectly logical process of competition. It has, of course, other justifications. Medical students need it; zoology teachers need it. But I contend that the average citizen does not need it so badly as he needs some understanding of the living world (p. 207)."" We need to stop looking at reasons to take care of the earth as solely economic ones, and begin to see the need to preserve something greater. ""...[Q]uit thinking about decent land-use as solely an economic problem. Examine each question in terms of what is ethically and esthetically right, as well as what is economically expedient. A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise (p. 262).""For those who scoff at conservation, but feel deeply the pangs of conservative patriotism, Leopold offers this powerful rebuke: ""This sounds simple: do we not already sing our love for and obligation to the land of the free and the home of the brave? Yes, but just what and whom do we love? Certainly not the soil, which we are sending helter–skelter down river. Certainly not the waters, which we assume have no function except to turn turbines, float barges, and carry off sewage. Certainly not the plants, of which we exterminate whole communities without batting an eye. Certainly not the animals, of which we have already extirpated many of the largest and most beautiful species (p.239-40).""Extra note. I really liked this quote:""When some remote ancestor of ours invented the shovel, he became a giver: he could plant a tree. And when the axe was invented he became a taker: he could chop it down (p.72)."""
