And, in her defense, a younger version of me would have rather stabbed himself in the neck rather than pick up a book with this title.But, good gravy, this was one of the most fascinating books I've read in a long time. The author not only conveyed his admiration of seeds but told a story so compelling that I now share that admiration. I'm a fan of both the author and the subject."
1,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/885697-melissa,4,"This is a nice overview of the importance of seeds throughout history and around the world. The best part about this book is that it never gets too bogged down in scientific lingo- thus someone (like me) with very little knowledge on seeds can not only understand everything the author is saying, but also really enjoy it. The book is also set up in a way that if you wanted, you could read the book out of order or just read the sections that appeal to you- the chapter on coffee for instance, if you love coffee. As a lover of all things spicy, my favorite chapter was the one focused on capsicum peppers. I had no idea that so many varieties of pepper all originated from the same region. It was fascinating to read."
2,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7263585-megz,4,"I love micro-histories – books that delve into the history and specifics of one small specific thing. One of my favourites is The Big Necessity by Rose George, about human waste (and the toilet). Just for balance, my least favourite is Stiff by Mary Roach.The Triumph of Seeds: How Grains, Nuts, Kernels, Pulses, and Pips Conquered the Plant Kingdom and Shaped Human History by Thor Hanson is about, well: seeds. I requested the book because the cover looked pretty cool and because, as I already said, I enjoy finding out really random and extensive things about one focused object.In nature and in culture, seeds are fundamental—objects of beauty, evolutionary wonder, and simple fascination. How many times has a child dropped the winged pip of a maple, marveling as it spirals its way down to the ground, or relished the way a gust of wind(or a stout breath) can send a dandelion’s feathery flotilla skyward? Yet despite their importance, seeds are often seen as a commonplace, their extraordinary natural and human histories overlooked.Hanson has a fabulous relationship with his subject. He speaks of them in the same breath as his family, and he writes fondly about them. He exalts their qualities: seeds nourish, they unite, they endure, they defend and they travel.His sense of humour is rather enjoyable. For example, when he compares the reproduction of seed-bearing plants to that of spore-bearing plants, he writes,When spore plants have sex, they usually do it in dark, wet places, and quite often with themselves.Most enjoyable is the placement of seeds we know – or their products. Coffee beans, cocoa, chilies, ricin, coumarin – the latter both derived in one way or another from seeds, believe it or not – become altogether relatable. He interweaves their histories with human histories: wars, assassinations, economic booms and collapses.Things I loved learning:how climate influences the heat of chilieshow caffeine influences the growth of the coffee plant and its competitorshow coumarin was developedthe evolutionary impetus for the development of fruitsOf course, this book has a big dose of science as well. And I liked the way Hanson elaborates on his science. He does not dumb it down so much that the reader feels patronized, but he does not fill it to the brim with hard-to-understand jargon, either.So basically, Thor Hanson has written a pretty awesome micro-history of seeds, and I loved it. It didn’t read fast, but it sure read well, and I fully intend to get a physical copy of my own.Disclaimer: I received a digital galley of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."
3,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"Excellent in tone and in open-mindedness. Superlative in scientific description!This first half might be more depth into plant and seed evolution than the common reader for fauna might respond to/with- but oh yes, stick with it. There is much more beyond the coal fields' evidence in this wonderful mix of reality and uses for that ""a baby in a box with a lunch"" that is a seed.The chapters on seed shell thickness, their parallels to seed eaters and the flesh eaters who eat the seed eaters- all of the types. Just marvelous!I especially enjoyed the tale of the chilies and capsaicin. Thank you, fungi! Without you, capsaicin would not have arrived. Columbus searching for his spicy seeds and always finding the ""wrong"" kind. Seeds as fliers. Seeds as poisons. Seeds as inventive changing miracles!And of course the studies with the almendro that intrigue. That baby sure has a lunch.Thor Hanson has written one worth reading. I especially love some of his own asides to knowing the ""truth"" and all we don't know. Highly rec this one before spring planting. "
4,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4265436-nicole,4,"A really enjoyable and educational microhistory about seeds that I picked up at the library based on the cover. I'm glad I did! The author did an excellent job of presenting scientific information in ways that are enriching and educational. The science is there, but a PhD is not necessary to parse through it. Nor is it dumbed down! I didn't feel patronized at all. Instead, the author taught in the best way there is - conversationally, using real-life examples, including stories about his family and friends and his own experiences, in order to make the science more readily comprehensible. I thought my favorite chapter would be the one on coffee/caffeine, as an acknowledged coffee superfan. And it was a wonderful chapter, but surprisingly, my favorite was the chapter on chili peppers! As anyone can tell you, I have zero tolerance for spice and go out of my way to avoid it at all costs, but apparently reading about them is a different story. ^_^ "
5,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/215221-bria,3,"The only two things I could possibly complain about are not even complaints about this book, but just about pop sci in general:1. Not in depth enough. I need to stop expecting pop science books to substitute for university courses. I appreciate why authors move details to notes and list references, but really I just want to understand all of biology, ecology, and evolutionary history just after reading this one book - it would be easier than having to go hunt out more books.2. A bit more focus on human interest than I prefer - as in, personal narratives of the author, or other supposedly engaging stories. Somehow I don't seem to understand that I get bored without something that's entertainingly written, full of anecdotes, character descriptions, and other interesting, educational tidbits. So those aren't even complaints - those are really just telling me that Thor did a great job (really, some very clever sentences in there), and it's not his fault that I didn't come away a botanical genius. Now I guess I have to go read more books... I guess that's how pop science books reproduce."

7,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14938021-mandy,4,"4.5* Very well written story of seeds, easy to read even for the non-horticulturist and full of interesting facts and anecdotes"
8,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,4,"This was certainly better than I thought it would be. Based on the subject matter I thought this book would be a tad dry; but, on the contrary, it was really interesting and quite entertaining. The writing is very accessible and heavy scientific terms are left by the wayside for the most part. Hanson takes a common item that we take for granted and weaves interesting tales around them to make his point of how seeds shaped the world and influenced its history. Hanson takes the story back to how seeds evolved to become so successful and the most common way of plant reproduction after spore reproduction was the method of choice during prehistory. Instead of reciting a history of seeds he divided the book in to sections which included information pertaining to how seeds defend themselves, how they travel, how they endure long periods of dormancy, and how the design of different types of seeds helps them flourish. The examples he uses to exemplify each section and chapter are relatable and narrative easy to follow. Prior to reading the book, my wife and I were talking about fruits and wondered why apple trees, orange trees, peach trees, watermelons, etc., would wrap their seeds with such a large quantity of fruit. This is covered in the book. So are other interesting topics such as the design and function of the seeds of coconuts, coffee, chili peppers, and cotton. Cotton and coffee were given a lot of ink as their popularity basically changed the world, in good ways and bad. My favorite parts were the discussion of how seeds travel and the chapter about the seed banks found throughout the world, the most famous of which is the Global Seed Vault in Norway. Also, fascinating was the chapter about the endurance of seeds. A 2,000 year old seed found by archaeologists in the ruins of a city in Israel started growing in 2005 and is still flourishing! I would recommend this to anyone as seeds are actually really interesting and relevant to everyday life. The subject matter is presented more anecdotally than scholarly or technically, and knowledge of botany is not necessary to enjoy this. Seeds are everywhere and almost everything we eat and drink every day either was processed from a seed or grew from one. How can you not love them? 4.5 stars."
9,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9932495-bailey,4,"I loved this book for its lyricism and its (pardon the pun) digestibility. As a long time gardener I appreciated the reminder of why I'm invested in seeds and plants. I didn't love this book for its blatant side stepping of important topics related to seeds, especially with whole chapters on coffee and cotton. While he did recognize the horrific impact of the cotton boom on enslaved people in North America, and especially Southern USA states, I thought the topics of slavery and colonialism were owed more. It held up figures like Columbus without addressing the negatives of their legacy."
10,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"A seed has been described as a baby plant in a box with its lunch. The box (or testa) protects the plant from harm, while the lunch (or endosperm) provides food for the baby plant in the form of starches, oils or proteins. The transition of early plants from spores as the method of propagation to seeds represents an important evolutionary step for plants. Spores must fall on soil suited for their growth in order to survive. However seeds, with their internal source of nutrition, protective shell and clever methods for transport can survive for years or even decades until conditions or locations are right for their germination. Not only is this feature key to the plant’s survival, but for human survival as well. Thus agriculture is founded on the principle that seeds can be harvested and stored for future use when conditions are ideal for sowing. The Triumph of Seeds is all about the natural history of seeds as well as the uses to which humans have put them. Seeds are incredibly important. Grains provide more than half of all calories in the human diet and include three of the top five global agricultural commodities (corn, rice and wheat are #2, 3 and 4 respectively). Without seeds we wouldn’t have coffee or cocoa, so even if humans managed to survive without seeds, life would barely be worth living. Since they can’t run away from potential predators, seeds have developed sophisticated chemical defenses to ward off attacks. Capsaicin, the alkaloid in chili peppers that makes them hot, evolved as a defense against fungus and small predators. While caffeine acts as a natural pesticide: it can paralyze and kill predator insects feeding on the plant. Some seeds are toxic to discourage consumption, while others are encased within a sweet fruit to encourage dispersal. Hanson has an pleasant writing style that mixes personal anecdote with history and natural history to create an interesting story. His book Feathers is also quite good. "
11,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6614224-sara-van-dyck,4,"Charming , instructive, blending science and story – Hanson has the reader accompany him on a meandering mental (and sometimes physical) road trip, exploring the many worlds of seeds. He joins a dig in New Mexico, where researchers think the Carboniferous era may have had drier periods than was previously thought, enabling seed plants to evolve. Later he tastes coffees in a Seattle coffee house as he discusses the social and neurological aspects of drinking that beverage. Along the way he also considers the relationships that Columbus, Mendel, Eli Whitney, and Darwin had with seeds. I certainly looked at my meals – from morning coffee to an apple crisp dessert - differently while reading this! It was enjoyable to read, and worth reviewing later"
12,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3488439-daphne,5,"A really well done pop-sci nature book. Each chapter done well, and had lots of interesting information each page. It had the perfect amount (for me at least) of personal interjections and experiences within the science writing. He didn't make the book about himself, but he put himself into it just enough to get me vested in both the science and his journey to discover, understand, and then communicate what he learned.One of the best pop-sci books I've read in the last few years."

It mostly talked about things I already knew or would probably conclude on my own if had thought about it. For example, the fact that an Almond Joy consists if 5 kinds of nuts was the most interesting thing I found here. Good book, but not ground shaking for me. Maybe for someone else."

16,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38183775-ina,2,"After reading the book, I get the impression that the author is more into telling stories and talking to researchers, than gathering and conveying scientific knowledge. The facts presented seemed very superficial and not like the work of someone who has researched the subject exhaustively before writing about it.Plus, a reviewer on Amazon rightly pointed out that in the book the genus of wheat was said to be Tricetum, while it's actually Triticum. That's an unpardonable mistake for a book that is entirely focused on seeds and wheat being one of the most widely used and cultivated grains (a.k.a. seeds) globally.Can't speak for the validity of the other facts presented, especially the historic ones, but I'm not too confident in them after that mistake.Overall, while the book is a light and quick read, it's still a pretty big waste of time."
17,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45788609-kathryn-mears,5,"A topic that may appear dull on the surface, yet reads wonderfully. You will not think about coffee beans, chili seeds or the fall of the Roman Empire in the same way after reading. Thor has a humorous, endearing and well structured style to his writing that keeps you hooked from chapter to chapter. He weaves his own experience as a biologist with historical and scientific information but the book is always easy to read and accessible for anyone. I found his humorous and slightly self-deprecating style quite similar to that of Dave Goulson (A Sting in the Tale, Buzz in the Meadow etc), which for me is considered high praise. I look forward to reading more of his work!"
18,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/978177-thomas,5,"A very satisfying book. It's remarkable just how amazing the seed is. Hanson has written a tight, well-edited, easy-to-read history that showcases its magic. He weaves personal narrative alongside the science and covers all of the pertinent topics ranging from the why and how, as well as the incredible impact seeds have on humanity. I particularly enjoyed the socio-economic role seeds have played throughout history, having never really thought about just how powerful they've been in global politics and commerce."

24,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4306189-sofia,2,"Informative and entertaining to a degree, but very superficial. Plus a little too twee for my taste with all the cutesy-cute interjections from the author's personal life, a little too much time dwelling on how his conversations with other experts went on (and on and on...), and a few other things that didn't sit well with me (for example, no, Columbus was not the first to cross the Atlantic nor the first to report on the vegetation of the Americas; maybe the whole cotton-business-driven slavery business deserved more than a throaway line before spending paragraphs on the life history of the inventor of the cotton gin; and perhaps a seed dispersal ecologist should know better than to be an alarmist about gene technology)."

28,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"This is an artfully written, fascinating, and highly informative book all about seeds. The writing is personal at times, but not to the point of coming off self-centered. The author talks about his own experiences studying plants. But he also goes down many informative avenues.* Chemical pesticides e.g. caffeine and capsaicin found in seeds.* Germination and how seeds can stay dormant until the conditions are right.* Seed dispersal techniques e.g. being carried by the wind or in the stomach of animals.* Seed anatomy and the origin and spread of flowering plants.He gives passing mention to GMOs. And does so with disdainful gullibility. It's surprising to me that a scientist like Thor Hanson would be suckered into repeating such unscientific and false concerns as these.* He seems to imply that seed patents are unique to GMOs. This is false. Seed lineages have been patented for over 100 years. The introduction of genetic techniques hasn't changed the relevant laws. The up-front expense in producing new varieties using GM traits is made tolerable because of the patent system. This is the system working to allow science to happen. Only profound ignorance and extremely biased thinking could lead someone to conclude that GMOs are bad *because* their seeds are patented. This is a moronic idea and is popular because (thanks to human nature and the Internet) lazy, half-baked fear-mongering works astonishingly well.* He says there are valid environmental and health worries. But this isn't a problem unique to GMOs. Concerns have been raised about environmental and health impacts. And the science has consistently shown them to be unfounded. That GMOs are safe to eat is one of the most well established facts in science. GM technology is a tool. It's neutral. It can be used to help the environment. And health. It should be so used! Pest tolerant crops use less land and can use fewer (in tonnage) less-harsh chemicals than the non-GM alternative. Golden Rice can help prevent blindness in millions of children.* He even claims creating transgenic organisms is a ""moral issue"". This is ridiculous. Especially considering transgenic organisms occur in nature all the time. Where does he think we got the technology to introduce genes from one organism into another? Nature."
29,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"A seed, as botanists put it, is a baby plant with its lunch packed in a box. That's the best way to think of seeds. The necessary nutrients are inside a shell, ready to be used by the seed when the time is right for germination.There's a lot of really interesting information in this book: history (how seeds gave us agriculture and therefore civilization), biology (how plants evolved reproduction using seeds and how seeds operate), genetics (Mendel's experiments with beans), commerce (cotton and spices), gastronomy (how chili seeds and coffee beans evolved their properties not for our joy but as a form of pesticide), etc. "

38,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92311026-andrea-bearman,4,"Continuing on my short journey about plants and their parts, I found another gem at my local library: The Triumph of Seeds by Thor Hanson. I’ll admit, I was sold initially because of his name. I’ve never read an author named Thor before.Anyway, this book is all about seeds. He shares some popular seeds like coffee, chocolate, cotton, and others. He talks about the entire process, I don’t think there was a seed unplanted. Very early in the book he talks about what the seed does: endure, defend, travel, nourish, and unite. I love this definition. Seeds do a lot and as is often the case in our culture, we take them for granted.One of my favorite parts of the book is about Methuselah, a 2,000 plus year old date tree. A seed was discovered within the Masada fortress and scientists were able to germinate it. That’s amazing. I also loved his tales about peppers and how their spice is to repel creatures from eating it. I love that caffeine is a natural insecticide; which explains why I am always bitten to the core because I don’t consume caffeine.I could go on and on about what I loved about this book. But I won’t. I will mention a couple things I did not like and these are purely me, I have no doubt. Much like A Garden of Marvels by Ruth Kassinger, I became bored with the extensive information about Darwin, Columbus, Mendel, and so on. I have read about these historical figures so many times. I cringe when I see their name. I admit, however, that someone who does not read this genre as much as me probably would not have this problem.Overall, I recommend the book for all of those interested in the world of plants, nature, history, and food.Content: 4/5Structure: 5/5Meets Objectives: 5/5Creativity: 4/5"
39,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3638081-shannon,3,"I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. I feel like the author wandered a bit--the central ""theme"" is pretty loose, as it's not really a Point A to Point B to Point C kind of book. It is, however, a fascinating exploration of a question that never would have occurred to me: why do seeds work? I'm not a non-fiction person, nor much of an outdoorswoman. However, by the time Hanson got around to discussing things like defense mechanisms and dispersal, my interest was piqued. In short: I am not the target audience for this book, but I do think if you're interested in gardening, or plants, or agriculture, you'd enjoy this a LOT. The chapter on coffee was definitively my favorite, and not just because I like the stuff. Hanson discusses the history of coffee as the beverage of choice in the Middle East, long before it became trendy for white folks to enjoy, and explains how it came to be grown in the Americas. The narrative doesnt' get too political, but I do, and I found it all rather thought provoking: coffee as a billion dollar industry, and even (in some senses) a kind of cultural appropriation. Oh, and caffeine is a natural insecticide. All in all, a good read, and one I might keep a digital copy of to reference back to now and again. "
40,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6207706-jeanne,5,"What an amazing little package seeds are that they can create an entirely new plant from a ""baby in a box with it's lunch."" Not all seeds are created equal in that they seem to pick the perfect method of germination depending on the environment of the mother plant. Some seeds need fire to germinate, some need either constant water supplies or a promise of water to come. Seeds have different travel methods to find a new home including waterborne, airborne, or transport via ingestion and expulsion of the seeds. Seeds have been known to sprout after staggering journeys or hundreds of dormant years. Hybridization has changed and removed many seeds from the landscape, but there are dedicated seed lovers who have created seed banks to preserve them. Without a great diversity of seeds in our world we could find ourselves with plants that are so similar that a single plague could devastate an entire crop."
41,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13913099-paul,4,"Some people have a knack for asking disarmingly simple questions about things with which we’re familiar – or at least think we are.Why, for instance, does coffee contain caffeine, asks author Thor Hansen?If you’re like me it’s not something you’ve ever stopped to consider. It just does, period. And you’d be wrong.The answer and the delight of this book is in the detail of discovery; the whys and the hows. It delves deep without making the science inaccessible and in doing so it delivers an unexpected page turner.Caffeine, it seems, is the plant’s equivalent of chemical warfare, a pesticide/herbicide response to the assaults of more than 900 species and other pests that target the tree.Coffee’s biological backstory is much more complex than that and much more compelling – and it’s just one of the plants examined.Ultimately, the book induces a genuine sense of marvel and wonder about the sophistication of plants, about how much we know and how much more we can still explore."
42,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12293609-kate,5,"Wow! It's the rare book that earns five stars from me, but Hanson's book on seeds richly deserves it. This is a topic I'd never given much thought until picking up this book, but now I find myself perusing the bibliography and considering making a couple of interlibrary loan requests. Even if you don't end up geeking out as much over this book as I am, it's still a fascinating read about the science and anthropology of seeds. The whole book was great, but my favorite chapter was the one on poisons and toxins, and how little we really know about them. Best of all, for someone who's not much of a science person, the book was incredibly ""readable"" without being dumbed down - or if it is dumbed down, Hanson didn't let on. Pick this up if you're looking for an awe-inspiring nonfiction read!"
43,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108487871-lydia-halvorson,4,"Thor Hanson blends the fields of science and history with engaging, creative writing that can turn a sceptic into a seed enthusiast. He writes with an exuberance that has made me fall in love with this book. Hanson states in the book “Given time, evolution is much more likely to provide us with a multitude of solutions than it is to give us one ideal form.” I find it wild just how many varieties of seeds are out there. It is so fascinating how they have evolved over time to conquer the plant kingdom and effect our daily lives more than I ever knew. I chose this book because I wanted to further understand the historical significance of seeds on human migration and civilization for a research paper I am writing. By reading this book I have learned so much beyond that. I love that way Hanson views the world and shares his life stories from all of his travels. It so personal and engaging. I highly recommend this book! "
44,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53249136-silyara,4,"A fun, interesting, and informative science/history read about seeds. The author does pull on his personal experience (we regularly return to the almendro seed, from the tree he wrote his thesis about), but he manages to do so more often in order to help make a point rather than making the book about him. He's using his knowledge to guide people along on points, and he doesn't shy away from asking questions/getting expertise from others who know more on [insert topic here]. It's well organized, full of fun stories, and puts lots of matters in a different perspective. No, seeds aren't responsible for all of human history, but we've interacted with them throughout it, and it's played roles in a lot of it. This book manages, generally, to balance that understanding and is stronger for it."
45,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"In this book, Thor Hanson explores ""how grains, nuts, kernels, pulses, and pips conquered the plant kingdom and shaped human history"". Topics include the evolution and co-evolution of a variety of plant species seeds, how they function, seed banks, dispersal, spices, and historical tidbits (including assassinations, world empires and voyages of discovery). Seeds are a fascinating subject that the author covers in an informal but informative style without overwhelming the reader with science jargon, but also not wasting ink on irrelevant social observations. There are numerous illustrations throughout the book. My only quibble is that I wish there was more of the book and more specific details, but that sort of thing would probably require an encyclopedia on the subject."

And, yes, I really loved reading about seeds. Thor is an amazing writer who weaves cool science with history. The chapters are short, but each with several human stories, and of course a bit a science! There is a short chapter notes' section (fun!) and a glossary for a few of those wonderful geeky terms, like cotyledon. A good book for your winter reading list, when you are dreaming of green or if you need a fun, get-away from it all, and into nature book for whenever. Put this on your list! "

It still deserves a 4.5 I've actually read this book at least twice because I like to go back through and read certain passages again. From coffee beans to spices to cotton, The Triumph of Seeds provides interesting stories and history on the seeds that shape our lives. The science in it is very accessible and the historical facts are all fascinating. You can definitely tell Thor Hanson (of Washington State) is passionate about seeds."
48,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46494450-janeann-said,4,"Well, I’ll certainly never think of seeds in the same way again after reading this book! I’d never really considered the impact seeds have had in world history. With the wit and craft of a storyteller, Thor Hanson effortlessly weaves science, literature & the arts, modern technology, history and pop culture references to communicate the relevance seeds have had and continue to have in our daily lives. I never thought I’d laugh as often while reading a book about seeds! Truly unique approach to what is often a dense topic!"
49,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15293132-katelijne-sommen,3,"Quite interesting, and written with a fun and self-deprecating wit. I most liked the parts in which Hanson's seed-loving 3-year-old son Noah figure. :-)I learned a few things, but less than I thought I would. Guess I already knew more about seeds than I knew? It does put into perspective how dependent we are on co-evolution with all our fellow beings, from the grasses that helped our brains grow on the African plains to the pollinators who help grow most of our food today (and who are in serious trouble)."
50,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62283420-matthew-boak,3,"I think this book was good, but the way it was laid out made the information seem a little scattered. I think the information itself was great and interesting, but it wasn't weaved together as cohesively as I would have liked. Hanson tried to combine both scientific information with personal and historical stories and I don't think it was done as well as it could have been. With that being said I think anyone who wants to learn more about the function, use, and history of seeds in our world would benefit from reading this. I certainly learned a lot from it."

Seeds are very much a part of our everyday lives from our clothes, newspaper, coffee and bagel, but we rarely notice. In a similar grain as Lab Girl and Spineless, he intersperses the science with his personal life which makes it relatable. "

Written with deep affection and boundless curiosity. The first book to ever make *me* truly appreciative of seeds!"

I enjoyed it, but preferred ""Lab Girl"" (five stars). The historical perspective was interesting. I learned a great deal from this successful book. "
83,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/962625-mya-r,4,"4.5 stars. I enjoyed this book a lot If Hanson had included the scientific nomenclature for every plant he references, & written more about how orchid seeds function (in his final chapter on what might be next, evolutionarily), I would have gone with 5 stars. "

It is highly readable, entertaining, and full of facts about the subject. Probably make good late winter reading when everyone is browsing seed catalogs. It will make you aware of the miracle that seed really are."
85,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35598584-jonathan-hardy,4,I really enjoyed this history of seeds and details about how they work and hypothesis on why. This is a topic I admittedly had almost no knowledge on and I enjoyed the overview of the evolution and functions of seeds.
86,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21555182-lizzie,4,"Thor Hanson is great, again! I actually found his other books to be more engrossing but this one was still thought-provoking. Favorite fact is that cedar waxwings have rectums that can digest sugars. "

I learnt so much I never new and things I wasn’t expecting to be covered in this book.Definitely reading Buzz and Feathers soon, I love Thor’s storytelling so much"
88,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24088797-kiirstin,5,"I didn't think this was quite as good as Hanson's Bees, but it's still an excellent, entertaining investigation into a small thing we take for granted, and yet has an impact on everything we do, every day. Recommended."
89,0465055990,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2066054-marianne,4,"Following a talk by the author, I was captivated by his scientific studies and engaging writing style. I’ll always remember how Thor regards a seed as “ a baby plant in a box with its lunch .” What a fascinating book all about seeds and their critical importance on our planet. "
