0,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,4,"Part I - The Inspiring PartWhile I have mixed opinions of many of the ideas in The Inevitable, this particular paragraph stuck out as insightful and, for anyone interested in building products, potentially inspirational for some good ideas.""Three generations ago, many a tinkerer struck it rich by taking a tool and making an electric version. Take a manual pump; electrify it. Find a hand-wringer washer; electrify it. The entrepreneurs didn't need to generate the electricity; they bought it from the grid and used it to automate the previously manual. Now everything that we formerly electrified we will “cognify.“ There is almost nothing we can think of that cannot be made new, different, or more valuable by infusing it with some extra IQ. In fact, the business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI. Find something that can be made better by adding online smartness to it.""Thinking about this at a surface level is pretty exciting. Kelly also talks about how the general feeling in Silicon Valley in the 90’s was that the gold rush had passed and that everything good had already been done. He believes that we’re again in a lull where it may feel like everything has been done but that in fact we are on the cusp of another flowering of ideas and technology.Unfortunately, it’s not quite as easy as he makes it sound. The way he talks about AI as if it were a simple commodity glosses over a lot of really big problems that aren't going to go away easily. Yes, you can rent a lot of powerful machines from Amazon or Google and install TensorFlow on them, but for any AI to work well, you need a LOT of data to train a model. Gathering data specific to a problem, normalizing it and using it in a way that gives results that are good more than 50% of the time for any given problem is very hard. If it was easy, every bit of software we use today would already have AI. That said, the idea is exciting. A lot of problems that seemed ""solved"" are now ripe for the taking. If Kelly is right, and I think he is, there will be a lot of people who are either going to have to learn to incorporate AI into their products or watch helplessly as they are disrupted by smaller competitors who have products that are less feature-rich but seem almost magical in comparison. What if your todo list could tell you what you're forgetting to add to the list based on your other tasks? What if your shopping list could suggest recipes based on your list or ingredients that would go well with what you're buying? Maybe it could even suggest your whole shopping list after it learned what you usually buy and how often you buy it. Those are maybe the two simplest examples of how adding some IQ to an existing software could drastically change it. Niche market products and software that runs internet of things hardware are already evolving to incorporate AI in surprising ways. Kelly explores some of these in his book but the best ideas are yet to come. The more I think about it, the more exciting it is.Part II - A General Review of the BookI felt uncomfortable for large portions of the book. Kelly is, to no one’s surprise, an unabashed technologist. Even thought the title of the book is “Inevitable,” I get the clear impression that he’s not writing about what will happen as much as about what he hopes to happen. In his ideal world screens would be much more prevalent than they are now. Content would flow between them as we move between home, transportation, and work. User created content becomes more widely distributed, remixed and repurposed with micropayments flowing freely between consumers and remixers and eventually compensating original creators. Curators, some human, some AI trained by humans thrive in a world where taste and work drive the majority of humanity’s leisure time. Despite having every book ever written available in the cloud, many people move will move from consuming deeply to flitting from thing to thing to satisfy their every whim. In the physical world, ownership will wane as renting and sharing increases. This means everything from clothing to transportation to gadgets and living spaces. Everything from the food you eat to the number of breaths you take a day can and will be tracked and this information will be available to share at will to those who can process it either to provide insight or to sell you more things.It’s quite the vision of hyper-pervasive technology in a hyper-connected world.I appreciate Kelly’s optimism. His excitement is contagious. The problem is, and maybe this is just my resistance to the inevitable, that this all hinges on such an extreme level of consumption that it makes even today’s cell phone obsessed culture seem moderate. It comes at the expense of thoughtfulness, environmental stewardship, mindfulness and tangible, real world connection and creation.It reminds me of the story of the islander who sits on the beach all day eating coconuts. One day he’s approached by someone who tells him he should stop being so lazy and sell the coconuts. “Why?” He asks. “So you can make some money.” “Why would I want that?” “So you can get rich and build a big house and have servants.” “Why would I want that?” “So you can sit on the beach and eat coconuts all day.”What are we looking for in this hyper-connected utopia? If all the connectivity only leads to consumption, entertainment and away from creativity and actual human connection, it hardly seems worth it."
1,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50539206-charles-franklin,5,"This book both freaked me out and intrigued me because it showcased a future that blew my mind unlike any other book has before. Kevin Kelly presents a view of the future that is overly optimistic (despite my secret fear that robots will take all of our jobs and that every move will be tracked by a government agency that wants to control us). Kelly says that we shouldn't fight against the future, rather we should embrace. Yes, there will be more tracking. There will be more upgrades of the stuff we already have. There will be more robots. That doesn't mean we should live in fear, according to Kelly, or try to revert back to the past because of an unknown future. We should interact with it as best we can.Kelly discusses the different ways that he thinks the world will be different twenty, thirty, or even fifty years from now. For the most part, he steers clear of giving an exact timeline, but he does paint a picture of how he thinks the world will look and provides his rationale for thinking so. This was a particularly novel approach because Kelly focuses on the processes and trends rather than specific things. In short, he doesn't get caught up talking about the robots, he talks about what he thinks robots will be used for based on the trends that appearing today. Using his knowledge of technology and writing, this was an interesting and well-thought out journey.Overall, I enjoyed the ride, even though I was freaked out by it. I received the eBook by NetGalley, but plan to buy it in print because I think it's that important. If you're a fan of ""A Whole New Mind"" by Daniel Pink, this book gives me the same vibe, although it's more about how we will use technology (especially IoT) in the future."
2,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4276871-anders-brabaek,2,"This is not a good bookSummary: Kelly introduces the technological forces he believes will shape the future. These are;AI/artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT, robotics, the scalable cloud, virtual and augmented reality, omnipresent screens, quantified-self technologies, and social media. Rather than using the headers I have used above, Kelly is taking outset in what impact these technologies will have. For the non-techie, that might provide a look into certain possibilities in the near future. For the techie, there should be nothing new. It seems that Kelly has taken the above technologies and described their current trajectory. He is thinking that this will be for the next 30 years. I believe that it will be much much faster. Why: because Kelly explores nothing which hasn’t already been invented, even if some of it is still in its infancy. So, putting aside that there will surely be disruptive technologies, the picture Kelly is drawing will likely be possible to  some people.Kelly is very optimistic while at the same time ignoring the real opportunities. For instance, he describes how machine learning, AI and robots will take over a lot of the jobs we have today. Kelly then imagine that we will move on to the next thing which will be much better, which then again will be replaced, and we will move onto the next which will be much better... Now really? This will surely sometimes be the case, but is this laissez faire, everything will naturally work out for the best, attitude a healthy attitude. Or are we in the midst of a revolution which requires us to take a lot less mindless attitude for it to spell progress for the general population? As an example, there are 3.5 million truck drivers in the US. When self driving cars and robots rapidly slice that requirement in half or more, will these truck drivers rapidly acquire new skills which can be used in other businesses? And what businesses? It will not be radiologist’s, secretaries, translators, system administrators, car salesman etc. because those jobs will dwindle as well. Even for jobs such as composer, actor or musicians there is uncertainty. For many people, the algorithms will not look like progress, but instead, unbeatable competition, much worse than what the competition from e.g. East Asian workers vs western countries workers. There certainly are reasons to be optimistic. For my part, I wouldn’t focus on the games, toys and entertainment as Kelly does, but the possibilities in medicine, and efficient diagnosis to a much larger part of the world population. Combining machine learning, AI, big data and the quantified self techs will lead to massive innovation in health. Much of it only to the rich but there will also be landslide changes for the general population. Just as in healthcare and in medicine, there are obvious opportunities in education.Likewise, these technologies can, if we make an effort, help us in dealing with challenges such global warming. They can even be an efficient vehicle for understanding and dealing with social issues – even if - as I suspect, there will be forces working against such potential benefits, because it will require social reforms probably too challenging to most mindsets.Social MediaIf Kelly only for a second he manages to digress to one of the challenges of the technological themes he is discussing, he diverts with solutions which are unlikely because there are few forces promoting them. E.g. he manages to discuss the filter bubble* in an absurdly superficial way, and while explaining the concept without ever really acknowledging the reality of the problem, he closes the issue with something like there need to be put code in place which ensures we aren’t completely filter-bubbled. *(A filter bubble: a result of an algorithm which selectively guesses what a user would like to see based on information about the user making users becoming separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles.)Think! What would that entail? Pushing info on fx global warming, and racial inequality to angry (stupid) white men who are seriously contemplating voting for Trump, or pushing the reality these people are encountering on google and facebook to people like me who takes it as a scientific fact that they are driven by fear, bigotry and ignorance? Kelly argues that technological impact means that there will produced much more individualized entertainment to suit anyone’s personal preferences. Maybe, for my part I am not so convinced that this emphasize on individuality and individual preferences is healthy for the individual or the society. We are social creatures, and I think there is a real possibility that this “me” focus undermine our need for meaning outside our ‘egoistic self’, and establishes a climate of solitude and social inaptitude. Obviously there is being produced much more media content today than ever before and this evolution will continue. But with regard to quality, the answer is less obvious. Jaron Lanier in his preface to his book  You are not a gadget, writes, “You have to be somebody before you can share yourself”. The media produced by people who are sharing to become, appears increasingly overwhelming compared to those who share because they have something to share. PrivacyKelly also acknowledges that we are looking at a future with ever less privacy. He still manages to make a positive spin on this as he believes that this lack of privacy also pertains to public institutions and corporations. As examples, he is point to Snowden and similar cases. I believe he is wrong; what we are seeing now I a rapid change in security technologies. (For the technically inclined, we are moving from perimeter security to where the identity is the security perimeter). This will make future “Snowdens”/whistleblowers a lot less likely. It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future, but if we are to make any predictions about the future of privacy, it is that the individual will have less privacy, and the largest corporations and organizations more privacy – such is the nature in a world where every single piece of information is individually encrypted and protected by machine learning!In my perspective, Kelly is doing us a disservice with his mindless optimism dulling people into sleep. As individuals and as society, we need to think much deeper about what we want from technology rather than what technology wants – otherwise technology will rule and not to our general comfort.Books which touches the subject matterJaron Lanier: Who Owns the Future (more nuanced than Kelly)Christopher Steiner: Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World The shallows (though dated this book will provide a much better idea about what these technologies entails than Kelly)The human perspective forgotten by Kelly:-	Jaron Lanier: You Are not a Gadget -	Sherry Turkle: Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other-	Sherry Turkle: Reclaiming conversation-	Carr: The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains"

4,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Kevin Kelly, who is a Wired co-founder, lays out technological trends that are ""inevitable"". Like too many nonfiction books, I found a few chapters to be worth reading, and a few not to be. I enjoyed the sections on AI and books. And sometimes just zooming out to get bigger perspective is engaging, which was the case for me in the sections on VR/AR and tracking. Much of the rest of the book seemed geared for people less technically savvy, which was my only complaint as it really drew the book out.There is a famous saying in software said by Marc Andreeson that ""software is eating the world"". Kelly predicts, I believe correctly, that the next phase of this will be AI: ""It is hard to imagine anything that would “change everything” as much as cheap, powerful, ubiquitous artificial"". Kelly's perspective here that while it might feel like innovation in technology is slowing to some, it is much more likely that we are on the brink of the next renaissance, and we will all be ""taking X and adding AI"", much as happened with electricity and then the internet. Kelly correctly identified the three key trends that are making AI an exciting space today: processing power (GPU's), data, and better algorithms. However he didn't dive more into the longest pole: how to get a lot more data than we have today - that seems to me to be the key. But cool to get an overview. He did address one of the big fears about automation that many people have today: will computers take all our jobs? The quick answer is yes, but we'll have new ones. This has already happened multiple times in history. I agree with this, but think the more interesting question is what will happen when we can provide most people the basics (food, water, shelter) for very little cost. This was predicted in Diamond Age, and the answer was ""parking lots and chaos"", and a lot of people with no purpose in life.I also greatly enjoyed the section on books, mostly because (1) Goodreads is mentioned (hey I have paternal pride), and (2) it talks about things we at Goodreads are working on. Such as, the ability to see other peoples notes: ""Reading becomes social. With screens we can share not just the titles of books we are reading, but our reactions and notes as we read them. Today, we can highlight a passage. Tomorrow, we will be able to link passages."" Well, here are my notes from this book! Another big idea that Kelly hits on that I think is big and inevitable is how each book will become networked, much as the WWW has. Once we have ability to have pointers into and out from each sentence of a book, the speed at which ideas will fly out of books will step function.In the goodness of time, as all books become fully digital, every one of them will accumulate the equivalent of blue underlined passages as each literary reference is networked within that book out to all other books. Each page in a book will discover other pages and other books. Thus books will seep out of their bindings and weave themselves together into one large metabook, the universal library. The resulting collective intelligence of this synaptically connected library allows us to see things we can’t see in a single isolated book."
5,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,5,"(Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com]. I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.)It was a fascinating experience to read Kevin Kelly's The Inevitable right after tackling Nicholas Carr's 
Utopia is Creepy
, an experience that teaches a lot about why so many other tech writers come and go with the same blazingly fast trendiness of teenage pop singers, while Kelly has been around since literally the 1970s and continues to be one of the most thought-provoking writers of that entire industry. For while Carr's book is a disappointing series of blog-sized old-man rants about basically any name-brand technology that's crossed his eyes over the last few years (""What's the deal with Wikipedia!? What's the deal with Twitter!? What's the deal with Second Life!?""), The Inevitable takes a holistic and big-picture look at all the larger trends that have been happening in all of human culture over the last twenty years, to deliver a series of predictions not about what specific technologies or webapps will be the next big trendy ones, but the ways that general human behavior and human society is changing based on whatever the newest trendy apps are.And indeed, Kelly is in a particularly suitable position to do such a thing -- a former editor of the proto-cyberpunk hippie publication The Whole Earth Catalog, a founding member of proto-web online community The WELL, and one of the founders of Wired magazine, he's made a nearly half-century career now out of taking sweeping looks at the way technology has been changing the very nature of human existence and consciousness since the end of World War Two, delivering in this case a book of 12 chapters that each focus not on a specific technology but a general verb like ""cognifying,"" ""accessing"" and ""filtering."" Within each of these intriguingly titled chapters, then, Kelly delves into the recent history of these kinds of activities (for example, the history of chess-playing computers in the ""cognifying"" chapter), which then inevitably leads to a look at the most cutting-edge current research on the subject (an extended examination of IBM's Watson), a discussion of what surprising things we can learn from this latest research (in this case, that artificial intelligence is likely never going to come in a monolithic, human-aping form like HAL from 2001, but rather an endless series of ""dumbly focused"" intelligent apps that each do only one thing, but do them better than literally any human could even imagine that subject being done), then ending by speculating a bit on what this trend might foretell in a science-fictional near future (here, for example, that perhaps computers will one day soon figure out how quantum mechanics work, a subject that is quite literally too difficult for human brain comprehension but that might not be for a ""silicon brain"").As usual with Kelly's writing, it all adds up to some pretty heady stuff, an admirable hallmark from the optimistic, psychedelia-influenced era of cutting-edge technology in the 1970s he comes from, that we are sadly losing more and more in our current age of technology as capitalist commodity. One of the last grand thinkers from that era of the industry, Kelly's writing is still worth gobbling up with both hands whenever you can get ahold of it, with The Inevitable coming wildly more recommended than any of the other ""What's the deal with...?"" old-man rants of the moment that litter the tech bookshelves these days.Out of 10: 9.8 "
6,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3958765-craig-jaquish,2,"I’m growing increasingly skeptical about the utility of William Gibson’s frequently quoted observation (quoted again in The Inevitable itself) that “the future is already here; it’s just not evenly distributed.” Distribution speed is technological too. The “leveling” nature of the very technologies we’re discussing means that it’s increasingly difficult for anyone to gain a better vantage than anyone else. A more apt observation of Gibson’s (made also by other commentators) is that science fiction is less about the future than it is about the present. The world’s complexity is erecting a screen between the present and the future. For the better science fiction writers it’s a mirrored screen (they’re sporting their mirrorshades but the mirrors face inwards), but I’d say it’s a correlate not of science fiction writing in particular but of prediction more generally. And so Kevin Kelly’s new book, disguised in optimistic language about the future, is where readers can come to learn about…Kickstarter and the Pebble Watch and Kiva and the Netflix $1 million prize awarded in 2009.In his previous What Technology Wants Kelly made a good case that technological development has tendencies, if not outright direction. While everything in that previous book pointed to the word “inevitable”, from what I remember he was reluctant to use it. His elaboration was that mobile telephony and computation were inevitable while the iPhone in particular was not. My hope was that with a new book called “The Inevitable” he was finally ready to explore the largely implicit conclusion of his previous book and would provide a little more depth to his soft techno-deterministic argument. What is inevitability? But again it was spelled out via the iPhone.His twelve trends are hybrid sociological-technological—which doesn’t work as well as it sounds like it might. The fuzziness of the categories makes for better moments that rarely surpass wishy-washy philosophizing and harmless optimism. Meanwhile, the point of the proposition that mobile telephony is inevitable while the iPhone is not is to draw out the difference between a preordained kernel and all the contingencies which dress it up and give it shape. With all the attention on the (vaguely defined) inevitable, little attention is paid to the contingent. In a world of inevitability it’s the remainder, the part still up for grabs that’s most interesting; what’s ostensibly a mere aesthetic matter, contingency—the dressing—becomes a political matter. Here The Inevitable does not limit itself to inevitability alone, and despite Kelly being so up on future trends it’s hard to imagine a more unsuitable tour-guide to the aesthetic: Creative merit here equates largely to popularity, novelty, and awesome complexity—especially that arising from the crowd.While I wouldn’t dare take offense to his excitement over the falling entry barriers for the would-be creator, over the democratization of production, in championing this Kelly frequently conflates technical expertise (which technology is drastically lowering entry barriers to) with aesthetic maturation (which technology is not enhancing—which will diminish if we continue this conflation). “Today anyone with a phone—which is everyone—can instantly take a photo that is a hundred times better in most dimensions than one taken by a professional a century ago.” “It is a thousand times easier today to write and publish a book than it was a thousand years ago.” The physical technological difficulty of publication should not be equated with the honed senses required to write a book worth reading.Along similar lines, Kelly introduces the thematic word “fungibility” in a peculiar way a number of times throughout the book, claiming that a lot of great output is going to come from easy digital extraction of the increasingly swappable component parts of existing works. “Fungible forms of music encourage amateurs to create their own song and upload it.” As for music, so will it be for books and the rest. I don’t know that fungibility is really the word he wants to use here, but it’s certainly a telling choice. Money is fungible because every dollar is worth the same, and each dollar is interchangeable with any other. Dollars are interchangeable because their identities are interchangeable. I don’t think we’d come to that same verdict where concepts (or their component parts) are concerned; some are more precious than others. With Kelly’s complete absorption with the wonders of networks comes a world of equivalent ideas where no idea escapes the hold of the network, a world of incrementalism, devoid of breathtaking leaps. “The supreme fungibility of bits allows forms to morph easily, to mutate and hybridize.” A marked bill is a bill whose identity is now uniquely tied to a crime—one whose fungibility has been destroyed. Bits are only fungible before we ascribe them with meaning. As soon as we do fungibility is destroyed. An aesthetic world of utter fungibility is at the same time a meaningless one. And then, to make an argument that we’re witnessing the death of the author (the authority granted to that role) is one thing; to be so blasé about it as to author a statement like “A free movie you buy may be cut to reflect the rating you desire for family viewing (no sex, kid safe)” with no further scrutiny into what is being tossed in the trash and what this change means is something else altogether. Fungibility—arrival at the thermodynamic endpoint—is not something to be celebrated.“The fears that technology makes us more uniform, more commoditized are incorrect. The more we are personalized, the easier it is for the filters because we become distinct, an actualized distinction they can reckon with.” In the future each of us will be equally unique.Many dystopian fiction plots share a similar thematic structure wherein the protagonist must rouse a people sedated, mental slaves of one sort or another (through drugs, mind control, an excess of entertainments, entrapment within a computer simulation, etc.), by confronting them with the grim truth about the world they live in. Kelly’s a-day-in-the-future scenarios that complement most of the book’s chapters style him after one of the automaton-like extras in one of these plots. One scenario left him consuming media all day, continually using the phrase “I like…” although never “I think…”. I was somehow reminded of the old SNES RPGs when you’d go into a town and walk into taverns, shops, and homes talking to people in scripted dialogue. What do these people do and what do they say to one another when you exit, shut the door behind you, and let them return to their lives? In a day in Kevin Kelly’s future he’ll be combing websites curated with nothing but “cool ads” (he uses this term). (A couple of quotations from these vignettes: “When I get home, I really look forward to the string of amusing 3-D videos and fun games Albert lines up for me. That’s the name I gave to the avatar from Universal who filters my media for me.” And “Wow, now that robots are doing my old job, my new job is much more interesting and pays more!”)As inevitability became the implicit conclusion of What Technology Wants, when the twelve forces of Kevin Kelly’s follow up are taken as a whole an unarticulated thirteenth force is distilled: deautonomizing. Certainly Kelly’s follow up to The Inevitable will not be grappling with this idea any further than he has in The Inevitable itself—no doubt Kelly would pretty strongly disagree with my assessment of a thirteenth force. The deautonomizing force, though, is not something I’m myself prepared to discount; my concern here has not been to point to flaws in the idea of a core inevitability but to get at how little the book confronts what these “forces” do to us. It’s not the inevitability suppositions that are primarily lacking, it’s the experiential consequences and the wide horizon of open contingency that will shape how it is all experienced. The Inevitable seems to have flipped the classic script: the sedated man is convincing the roused individual to go to bed post haste. Can we at least wait until the sun has set? Similar to focusing more profitably on what’s up for grabs than on what’s inevitable, when peering into the future with logarithmically ballooning distribution speeds the more relevant question becomes not What does the future hold? but What is a future that’s evenly distributed before there’s time to grapple with what’s being distributed?"
7,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,3,"Okay, I've been following Kelly for decades, since the Whole Earth Review and his tenure at Wired. So maybe his optimism has worn thin by now. Or maybe its because I'm older. But color me skeptical about gee-whiz technology. After seeing some high-profile algorithmic flops -- like the 2008 crash, driven by computer investment portfolio algorithms. Or Facebook showing fake news because people hit ""like"" a lot, despite knowing that its fake. Or how 'smart' policing using computer algorithms, designe to stop violent crimes, like rapes and murders, ends up sending cops to ghettos to stop petty crimes like jaywalking or smoking dope. Not because there's more petty-crime per person in these areas, but because there's more crime per square foot, and thus maximizes the police departments arrests per man hour. To the abuse of credit reporting, etc. Needless to say, I'm skeptical of tech... even though I'm extremely tech savvy. And while I'll acknowledge the validity of some of Kelly's points, I am not sure of how ""inevitable"" anything he discusses is. Afterall, just because we can do something -- because technology and science make it inevitable -- doesn't me can or should. For instance, we can empty our overcrowded prisons by starting a war and making them fight for their freedom. It solves a problem, and we can do it easily... but is the payoff justified by the cost? Which makes me a little more tolerant of regulation than most Silicon Valley visionaries like Kelly. But powerful technology, like big-data and automated algorithms, does require big oversight. Since a handful of people wielding code have the power to consolidate wealth into unsavory hands. Does anyone really think that a person creating fake news deserves to outearn a real reporter who actually had to bust thier hump to source an article? Or that a 20-year-old facilities worker at Ohio State, who lives in a nearby ghetto, has a 800% greater chance of being arrested for smoking dope than an upper middle class fraternity boy at Ohio State? Perhaps there are people who do. I am not one of them. These notions run counter to my Christian values of justice. That said, Kelly is spot-on about so much. For instance, the tradeoff between anonymity and sharing. You can either not share, and allow the technology to serve you up a generic product that appeals to all -- like, for instance, recommending a Big Mac dinner. Or share information and allow the algorithms to recommend something better -- like, for instance, a nearby restaurant that serves your favorite Thai dish. Like many tech writers, Kelly remains bubble-bound. For instance, he ignores that our cheap screens today depend on slave labor in mines and cheap labor in factories. He also ignores that Americans today, the nation closest (next to, maybe, Japan) to the wired ideal, consume more power per capita in 2016 than they did in 2006, after consuming more in 2006 than 1996, etc. And that is not sustainable. So some of this technologic gee-wizardry may (or may not) hit an unseen kilowatt/ hour wall. So while I have reservations, Kelly, as always, provides a fun ride. And, if society and our energy supply can continue its stable trajectory, he does The downside is, the sounds exactly like Bill Gates's 1999 ""Business @ the Speed of Thought,"" and several other techno-utopia tomes I've read over the decades that ignore physical, biological and geo-political forces that can mess things up.So I'll not hold my breath. 3-stars. Fun read but shallow. And, for an innovator like Kelly, not very original. "
8,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42619809-stephen-heiner,3,"About halfway through the book I was bored. Not because the issues that Kelly discusses are unimportant to me, but because he delivers it in the one-note cadence implied by his title: The Inevitable. The only true inevitable was that I would finish the book so as to be prepared for the discussion with my fellows at the book club, not because I felt that he had a particularly relevant work, and 300 pages later, I still feel the way I do: Kelly falls far short.I believe that we as humans are imperfect, though immortal (because of our souls), and that whatever happiness we may possess in this life is fleeting and unimportant.Kelly presents us in this book a vision of the future that I find horrific: a world of twitch, free from simplicity, bound with complexity, and ending with convergence in a matrix. In one of our late chapters he uses exactly that word and describes something similar, in feel, to what that move so perceptively predicted decades ago: a fake world we may prefer to the real one.Kelly feels no compulsion whatsoever to ask ""should"" we accept the ""inevitable"" but rather keeps beating the drum for what we ""can"" do. Here are some revelatory quotes:""We are morphing so fast that our ability to invent new things outpaces the rate we can civilize them."" (p. 3). ""We keep inventing new things that make new longings, new holes that must be filled."" (p. 11)""We need AIs to tell us who we are."" (p. 49)""Let the robots take our jobs, and let them help us dream up new work that matters."" (p. 60)On page 108 I wrote in the margin ""absolutely horrifying"" after reading a description of a ""day in the life"" in the near future in which the only time we won't be seeing digital screens throughout the day will be at night when we sleep.I'm no Luddite. I'm happily pounding away on this keyboard, sharing my thoughts on this book with my friends and whomever else may be interested in reading, and I do it tied to my social media identity. There are technological changes that I welcome. But what Kelly never does, and what I am constantly asking, is twofold:1) *Should* we make these changes?2) Is it possible our lives will be worse, not better, because of technology?And given his stature in the tech space, it's pretty irresponsible to write a book like this and not weigh in on these matters. 300 pages of high-fiving ourselves and pointing out some important (and fascinating) trends. Got it. And then? We are made for more than a plugged-in VR/AR future. The problem is Kelly thinks we need to wait for that future to consider the truly important questions. The reality is that the future doesn't matter if you don't answer those important questions now."
9,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"Yes! What does the future look like? It looks more amazing than I could have imagined. Kevin Kelly outlines what AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality) will look like in the next 30 years. He wrote this book before Pokemon Go came out. I have been obsessed with catching all the Pokemon and evolving the ones I have. Just having played this one AR game, I can see how AR and VR games will take over the world. So fun! Kelly also looked at the impact of VR in the home. When talking about jobs and economics, Kelly knocked it out the park. Logical arguments about how each generation worried that their jobs were being taken over by tech, only to see that in the next generation, that tech created more jobs and an easier life. His discussion of using phones to self-track was equally great. Want to change your behavior, your health, your habits? Use your smart phone to help! But are all advances in tech good? No. Kelly is first in line to share concerns about how government and corporations are tracking us. However, he thinks there is little we can do to stop it. All our fighting might place limitations but will never actually stop the efforts of those with power who want to track the rest of us. Knowing this, Kelly suggests we put all our efforts into ensuring transparency. He likens the government and hackers' attempts to track citizens and corporations to the immune systems of animals (what a treat!). He suggests that while it's too early to tell if Anonymous is good for society, he sees value in small anonymous groups, because if the groups with all the power remain anonymous (e.g. gov keeps everything secret or corporations track you but you can't track them), then there will always be a power imbalance. The only way to ensure equality in any area of society (including dealing with law enforcement) is to have transparency. For this reason he is a fan of responsible whistle blowers and any kind of tech that ensures transparency. One of the most novel and exciting books I have read in a while. "
10,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11504643-beg-m-sa-ak,5,"This book is so insightful that I wish this book was compulsory for people pursuing technology & computer science degrees. The book Inevitable is divided into sections and each section is a gerund or force that is shaping us as a result of the technological advances. I want to point out how he is not only talking about technology but also the philosophy behind and how the gradual change is realized through current examples and glimpses of potential future adaptations. Regarding technology, I realized the book mainly focuses on the knowledge networks and how they are evolving rapidly. What technology enables is weaving a net of relationships from almost every aspect unimaginable and make once impossible connections possible. It was almost like a revelation to me to realize that: technology’s main goal is to make more networks and relationships and as it happens, more complex networks are to follow. I also like author’s optimistic viewpoint because he is not dystopian and doesn’t believe technology will definitely take over humans. Rather, he thinks there will be an increased interconnectedness between humans and machines. The author is doing a great job evoking curiosity on how this relationship will be and which other possible ways of interactions technology will reveal. Technology has always been a quest of humanity to know itself but now we are closer than ever to know ourselves. This book is a great one to read about technology and ponder about our new affordances and the future that is waiting for us. "
11,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18467333-tanner,5,"Audible. I love this book. Whether or not KK's predictions about the future are on point, the content and story telling of this book stretched my mind. I've never read a book by a 'futurist' before so this book was a real treat for me, as it also applies to the work I do as a product manager. The book left me feeling in awe about what the future holds--it also left me feeling a bit uneasy, as I scrambled to internalize this vision of the future. It even stressed me out a bit, with the notions that change is going to continue to happen progressively faster and that now is as fertile time as ever to help create the future. I certainly believe this is the rosy view of the future, where KK focuses on the capabilities of the technologies in the future and how that might play out, but not on the existential meaning for humans. Generally, I read about the past. One reason this book was so helpful for me is to helped me to exercise a new thinking muscle of sorts, one that tries to reason about the past, understand the present, and predict the future. One theme of the book that I really liked, was about how we, as humans, will continue to seek to understand our identity as we progressively automate aspects of our lives. This continual progression is driven by man's search for meaning and purpose in life--as we continue to progress as people we will be pushed to find what makes us unique. "
12,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65065726-kiana,2,"The book is full of examples that are part of our everyday life now. Sure, they have been a surprise at some point in the past but not any more. There's too many ordinary tech examples which bores the reader, especially if you work in tech and familiar with recent developments in technology. The overall idea of the book is interesting but probably could be summarized in one chapter. "
13,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1021218-george,5,"INTERESTING AND INSIGHTFUL. INFORMATIVE AND DELIGHTFUL.“We are moving away from the world of fixed nouns and toward a world of fluid verbs.” (p. 11) “In the intangible digital realm, nothing is static or fixed. Everything is becoming.” (p. 12)Although parts left me puzzling: what the heck was what I just read all about?, Kevin Kelly’s deeply insightful book, THE INEVITABLE: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future, is a futurist's delight. Kelly offers cogent and reasonable glimpses into what the impact of technology—Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Streaming, and more—might be over the near future (30 years or so) on each of us, on society, and on humankind. Absolutely fascinating.The twelve forces? They’re his chapter titles: Becoming, Cognifying, Flowing, Screening, Accessing, Sharing, Filtering, Remixing, Interacting, Tracking., Questioning, Beginning. Admittedly, my reach often exceeded my grasp as I grappled with some of the concepts presented—but, oh, what a wonderland of ideas to get lost in. My highlighting was going crazy.Personal frosting on the cake… My, almost ten year old, grandson stood in line at a book talk/signing in San Francisco (See the YouTube video of this author's talk, at: https://youtu.be/UqsxejMN5XA) to get me a personally inscribed copy of this book; and my soon-to-be daughter-in-law received a shout-out in the Acknowledgements because she “assisted in research, fact-checking, and formatting help.” She becomes only the second person I’ve personally known whose name appears in a published book. As if I needed something more for which to be proud of her. Recommendation: Definitely read this book. Extend your reach, expand your world view, and catch a peek at what amazing things might be coming down the silicon ’pike.“…crap constitutes 80 percent of everything.” (p. 248)"
14,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,3,"39th book for 2016. Wow. The Silicon Valley tech-heads live in a happy-happy future world; a world where we are all connected, all the time, in vast Hive Mind; where all our most private thoughts are given up to the corporate cloud; where our most basic consumptive desires are anticipated by ubiquitous AIs. In Kelly's take on things, there is no point questioning the future. No point in dwelling on critical questions of autonomy or ecological stewardship, as our fluid, connected, constantly distracted hive-like-mind is INEVITABLE.Except for all his sharp future goggles, Wired Magazine under his editorship saw the promise of the early Internet as simply 500-channels of TV on all the time everywhere (TV done right as he says). I find this anecdote telling as Kelly's vision, then and now, is one of corporate high-tech consumption -- so of course he didn't see the early promise of the Internet as one of connection and joint creation between like-minded souls, something that many other people did -- and his ""inevitable"" vision is a silicon valley corporate one writ large, full of ubiquitous advertising and consumption and some quasi-mystical mumbo-jumbo of us all becoming part of some emergent hive mind in the very near future. An interesting book if you want to breath in the giddy vapours of techno-optimism for a while, but I for one won't be drinking the Kool Aid just yet. "
15,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,5,"We are all newbies now. Kelly's approach to technology is an analysis of trends. The greatest benefit of the book is that Kelly's thoughts are a fantastic jumping off point for musing on your own experience with technology. Considering my life span has covered technological advances that are so mind-numbingly rapid, being able to think of them as trends has the added benefit of making me not feel like an overwhelmed, curmudgeonly Luddite. Kelly's section on books was especially thought provoking. "
16,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,4," Look at all these tabs! I had to revisit them all before being able to write a sensible review. There is just so much good stuff that got absorbed by my brain while reading The Inevitable, I had to digest and compartmentalize. First of all, I do have to say that Kevin Kelley focuses largely on the positive aspects of every technological advancement, and he addresses that concern very late in the book. I think stating his position earlier would have been helpful to the reader. Otherwise, if you don’t mind dismissing the dystopian connotations, you’ll enjoy the read very much.The Inevitable logically predicts the near future where a “tendency towards the dematerialized, the decentralized, the simultaneous, the platform enabled, and the cloud will continue unabated.” I support that statement wholeheartedly. But as I see it, that also means that our current economical model needs to sway towards a more social-oriented, rather than individual, spectrum. Currently I can access original text of The Odyssey with relatively ease. If I want to compare a passage as interpreted by several multiple modern translators, just for fun, I have no way of collecting this information instantly without paying separately to each author for a complete body of work, which is impractical on my end. Kelly predicts that eventually we are going to be able to interlink each and every book to follow references and supporting arguments in a network composed of all books ever written - a metabook. But what about copyrights and geographic restrictions? Under current economic model this kind of tech is out of our reach. But if we provide this kind of access, the benefits are innumerable. Education will be more accessible and affordable; individual’s understanding of any subject could become deeper and more accurate; innovation can be accelerated through such collaboration. Rather than the end product, the corporations need to start focusing on experiences, which are much more valuable and sustainable long term than any physical object or body of work. In fact it’s already happening. Most of the web content is built by unpaid users like you and me. A lot of software companies are giving away their product for free, rely on user base for betterment of the end result, and profit from supporting user experience by charging for manuals, tutorials, subscriptions, etc. By the way, have you noticed how many companies are switching to subscription-based model? Adobe suite, entertainment providers like Netflix and Amazon Prime, numerous monthly box services, etc.Why does that happen? Kelly argues that possession will no longer be as important as accessibility. And isn’t that true? I can’t remember the last time I purchased a physical music CD or a movie DVD. I’d rather pay a subscription service that would allow me to access desired media at any time without taking up space in my own home, or on my own device. I choose to rent/buy physical book, only because I enjoy the tactile experience of holding one. Experience prevails where product only becomes devalued. There are many other fascinating subjects covered, which I could discuss forever, but I’d rather you read this book for yourself and draw your own conclusions."
17,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay,4,"I really enjoyed Kevin Kelly’s predictions for the future in this book. He has that kind of over-the-top, goofy way to point things out – you can just tell he loves telling how he thinks things will be. I have a nephew that gets that excited talking about drifting, and he comes across about the same as Kelly. The best part of this book is when Kelly decides the way to express his idea of the future is to tell a story. He does this a few times throughout the book (more would have been better), and tells focused stories on the topics he is discussing. I found these quite fun. This felt a little like an Alvin Toffler story, but more to the point and less foreshadowing later topics. As to what Kelly covers, he approaches topics not from a pure technologists’ perspective but based on impact on society. There are quite a few points he makes throughout that I wrote down or tweeted, and Kelly has been tweeting many of the highlights of this book recently. Review of his twitter feed will give you a good preview of the book’s topics. My favorite idea from the beginning of the book is that since technology changes so rapidly now (think in terms of version updates of cell phone apps that happen weekly or faster), no one has time to learn how to use these new versions before they are replaced. Kelly’s way to phrase this is that we will always be newbies.The only weakness I see in the book is that Kelly’s “boosterism” for his own concept of the future feels a bit cherry-picked – it doesn’t feel entirely even-handed, it feels too positive. Overall, though, this is the best futurology book I’ve read in many years. I received a preview release of the ebook version of this book from NetGalley for an early review. "
18,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7856222-alexandru,5,"More of 4,5 stars. The book is a glimpse into a possible future and is written in an interesting style, easy to read and with relevant examples. It opened my eyes to what will happen in the next 50 years or at least the direction we are heading. Some of the points are obvious, but still insightful. I disagree with the conclusion of the author because it is overly optimistic, other, grimmer scenarios are possible for human civilization. But some of the simple ideas used by the author are just very insightful and simple at the same time. A good read when you are locked in your house for quarantine."

20,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29328847-michael-payne,4,"Out of our Minds! Most fascinating, disturbing, and awe-inspiring of the Inevitable forces Kevin Kelly highlights is the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR). Our future will part from all past as it will no longer be crafted only with our own hands, tools, and the machines that we once “controlled” with explicit instruction sets. Increasingly the machines are “teaching” themselves from vast data collection creating self-learning intelligences. We already use this AI to help us traverse a noisy world. Many now rely daily on facial recognition in Google photos and Facebook, speech to text in Siri, and self-driving realities from Tesla. Kelly prophetical foretells that this is but the beginning of the integration of AI into all technology as he vividly foresees in Oracular, or Cassandra inspired technicolor dreams.It was global news when Deep Blue beat Kasparov, or IBM’s Watson won Jeopardy, but what is the far larger and underreported trend is the Inevitable way these same learning algorithms are being rapidly integrated into our day-to-day lives. This is can't-stop-watching captivating tech. Kelly highlights how Google’s DeepMind programs their “mind” to master the early Atari games using only the controls and an algorithm to maximize score by learning through play. See for yourself how DeepMind masters breakout - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1eYn... , and here watch its learned play of Space Invaders - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePv0F.... Whether this Inevitable future is utopian or dystopian is left for the reader to decide, Kelly for his part is optimistic. All of us should be informed, cognizant and aware of these sweeping technological trends.As the co-founder of Wired, Kevin Kelly is in a unique position to transfer insights from his own self-Wired neural nets built up over his lifetime of technology trend following. Read this fast, as you can be guaranteed that multiple AI’s have already consumed and catalogued every word."
21,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5859626-andr-spiegel,4,"Automation is not a race against the machine, but with it. You can no longer choose to update your software, or choose not to, since software has become like an organism that is in constant flux. And the internet with its billions of minds connected to it is a kind of super-organism in a dream-like state.Those were some of the strongest, most brilliant ideas I found in the book. And among the weakest: When Kelly sketches the unfolding of a typical day in the future, driving past buildings which are giant advertising screens displaying personalized messages. And his world-wide library seems eerily dull, like an education video from the fifties.In other words: He is absolutely stunning when he grasps a new concept or development for the first time. As if a lense gets focused all of a sudden, an effect he often achieves with things that you've felt yourself for quite some time already, but couldn't quite put into words yet. As soon as he tries to envision a specific future on that basis, however, it gets boring as hell. Which seems very much in line with the main premise of the book, that you need to distinguish between the fundamental technological forces which are ""inevitable"", and the random realizations of those forces. If the structure of the future is indeed that inevitable, it is completely unnecessary to try to win us over to it.I think this is what bugs me about Kelly's visions of the future: That this future serves no purpose. It's only a future that is as present as possible. I want more than that."
22,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14526744-robert-miller,5,"A major theme of this book is that we can't stop the future: The author says, “We can't stop artificial intelligence (AI) and robots from improving, creating new businesses, and taking our current jobs.” For the most part, the author projects his vision of what the new gadgets will be and how everyone will be dependent upon them in most aspects of their lives. Our lives are changing and shifting from centralized to decentralized services and control because the internet permits massive collaboration efforts by the people. Our unexpected willingness to share our thoughts, habits and personal affairs (Facebook, other social media, and Amazon- style marketing techniques) with the world means that “Massive tracking and total surveillance is here to stay,"" Kevin Kelly opines. Similarly, he says that “virtual reality is becoming real.” AI will be the focus for most of the larger companies, including Google, now and in the future.The rapid changes in digital technology (every cool device we are using in 2050, will have been invented after 2016) will keep us all in “newbie” status.  “The highest-earning professions in the year 2050 will depend on automatons and machines that have not been invented yet.” Our moods, travel destinations, love interests, health, fun agendas and other emotions will be detected by our “screens” and shape our lives, Kelly thinks. The author's futuristic predictions aside, the book reads smoothly (his excellent writing style accomplishes this), is entertaining and educational. I highly recommend this book."
23,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,3,"This book feels dystopian and sometimes fascinating at the same time. Some of the things that Kevin Kelly predicts will definitely come to pass. His knowledge about tech and future trends is well-known. But my concern is getting too much dependent on technology and lack of privacy. If every move we make is tracked and turned into data so our life is nothing but bits to be fed to the technology beast. For a long time, technology was used to make our life easier and what is happening now is just the opposite. A lot of people don't even realize it and some are even applauding it for the sake of a little convenience. I know which side of the fence I am on. In his previous book he said “Humans are the reproductive organs of technology.” And now he says “While anonymity can be used to protect heroes, it is far more commonly used as a way to escape responsibility.” Don’t agree with these views. But “Evolution doesn't care about what makes sense; it cares about what works.”"

We watched the Jetsons and Back to the Future with giddy anticipation. But somewhere along the way, we started getting scared. The predominant emotion towards the long term future now is fear. Dystopia. How bad things will get. There are very few thinkers giving us a more realistic and balanced glance into the future. This book does just that. Without the lingering taste of fear and dystopia. And without a giddy utopia. Just... An inevitable look at what will be."

26,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5246491-suzanne,2,"Book was interesting but could have been a lot more succinct. This was a buddy read with BP and it was a bad sign that we barely spent any time discussing it. I fully recognize the irony of reading this book in a print format which meant I had to type up the notes below!How we will change how we relate to the internet:""The web will more and more resemble a presence that you relate to rather than a place -- the famous cyberspace of the 1980s -- that you journey to. It will be a low-level constant presence like electricity: always around us, always on, and subterranean. By 2050, we'll come to think of the web as an ever-present type of conversation.""That now is a time with more opportunities, great upside to invent and start something:""But, but ... here is the thing. In terms of the internet, nothing has happened yet! The internet is still at the beginning of its beginning. It is only becoming. If we could climb into a time machine, journey 30 years into the future, and from that vantage look back to today, we'd realize that most of the greatest products running the lives of citizens in 2050 were not invented until after 2016.""Kelly talks about how first we were the People of the Word (""culture revolved around the spoken word""). With the advent of the printing press, we became the People of the Book (""the heartbeat of Western culture was the turning pages of a book""). Words have now migrated - they are on screens everywhere. We are now People of the Screen.Talking about online behavior:""Code displayed on a screen is endlessly tweakable by users, while law embossed into books is not. Yet code can shape behavior as much as, if not more than, law. If you want to change how people act online, on the screen, you simply alter the algorithms that govern the place, which in effect polices the collective behavior or nudges people in preferred directions. People of the Book favor solutions by laws, while People of the Screen favor technology as a solution to all problems.""On the true nature of books:""What those kinds of books have always wanted was to be annotated, marked up, underlined, bookmarked, summarized, cross-referenced, hyperlinked, shared, and talked to. Being digital allows them to do all that and more.""Talking about the future of annotations in books (he later says you can get a sense of what will happen by visiting Wikipedia and thinking of Wikipedia as one very large book):""As I read a book I can (with some trouble) highlight a passage I would like to remember. I can extract those highlights (with some effort today) and reread my selection of the most important or memorable parts. More important, with my permission, my highlights can be shared with other readers, and I can read the highlights of a particular friend, scholar, or critic. We can even filter the most popular highlights of all readers, and in this manner begin to read a book in a new way. This gives a larger audience access to the precious marginalia of another author's close reading of a book (with their permission), a boon that previously only rare-book collectors witnessed.Reading becomes social. With screens we can share not just the titles of books we are reading, but our reactions and notes as we read them. Today, we highlight a passage. Tomorrow, we will be able to link passages. We can add a link from a phrase in the book we are reading to a contrasting phrase in another book we've read, from a word in a passage to an obscure dictionary, from a scene in a book to a similar scene in a movie. (All these tricks will require tools for finding relevant passages.) We might subscribe to the marginalia feed from someone we respect, so we get not only their reading list but their marginalia -- highlights, notes, questions, musings.The kind of intelligent book club discussion as now happens on the book sharing site Goodreads might follow the book itself and become more deeply embedded into the book via hyperlinks. So when a person cites a particular passage, a two-way link connects the comment to the passage and the passage to the comment. Even a minor good work could accumulate a wiki-like set of critical comments tightly bound to the actual text.""Kelly goes on to say that every book will become a ""networked event."" Right now, books exist separately and are ""pretty much unaware of the ones next to it."" He says that the vision of the advantage of having a digital library is not so much that it's portable, but that ""no book will be an island. It's all connected.""How it's not just about links""The link and the tag may be two of the most important inventions of the last 50 years. You are anonymously marking up the web, making it smarter, when you link or tag something. ... This type of intelligence has been indigenous to the web since its birth, but was previously foreign to the world of books. The link and the tag now make screening the universal library possible and powerful."" Screening is a new activity according to Kelly. It includes ""reading words, but also watching words and reading images. ... You might think of this new medium as books we watch or television we read.""Kelly's vision for the universal library:""Over the next three decades, scholars and fans, aided by computational algorithms, will knit together the books of the world into a single networked literature. A reader will be able to generate a social graph of an idea, or a timeline of a concept, or a networked map of influence for any notion in the library. We'll come to understand that no work, no idea stands alone, but that all good, true, and beautiful things are ecosystems or intertwined parts and related entities, past and present.""Favorite quote in this section: ""Books without this network will feel naked.""Kelly takes things a stage further by envisioning a time when you can create a collection of snippets of text and entire books that create a resource on a particular topic for you. You can then swap these with friends - can see how this would be really useful for students. ""Once snippets, articles, and pages of books become ubiquitous, shuffleable, and transferable, users will earn prestige and perhaps income for curating an excellent collection."" That then begs the question which I didn't see Kelly answer: how does the author get paid?Four things that happen when books are all connected:1. It becomes easier to discover books at the long tail - interlinking will help people most interested in esoteric topics to discover books about this.2. We'll get a deeper grasp of history. I guess we'll see how much history repeats itself and how much each generation forgets from previous generations. We'll link back through time to similar ideas.3. We'll have a ""new sense of authority"" as ""the empty white spaces of our collective ignorance are highlighted, while the golden peaks of our knowledge are drawn with completeness.""4. The universal library becomes a platform for cultural life. Kelly talks about a depth of interconnectedness that is breath-taking and frankly, a little scary. For example, you could stand in Trafalgar Square and see everything that's ever been written about it. Kelly then adds that networked books are never done. ""A networked book, by definition, has no center and is all edges."" This point is the key between the traditional, immersive experience of a printed book and this new screening that Kelly envisages: ""Books were good at developing a contemplative mind. Screens encourage more utilitarian thinking. A new idea or unfamiliar fact uncovered while screening will provoke our reflex to do something: to research the term, to query your screen ""friends"" for their opinions, to find alternative views, to create a bookmark, to interact with or tweet the thing rather than simply contemplate it."" Vision of office life in the future:""A future office worker is not going to be pecking at a keyboard -- not even a fancy glowing holographic keyboard -- but will be talking to a device with a newly evolved set of hand gestures, similar to the ones we now have of pinching our fingers to reduce size, pinching them out to enlarge, or holding up two L-shaped pointing hands to frame and select something. ... If you'd like to have a vivid picture of someone interacting with a portable device in the year 2050, imagine them using their eyes to visually ""select"" from a set of rapidly flickering options on the screen, confirming with lazy audible grunts, and speedily fluttering their hands in their laps or at their waist. A person mumbling to herself while her hands dance in front of her will be the signal in the future that she is working on her computer."" TrackingThe chapter on tracking is just downright scary. Kelly lists all the ways we are tracked (by government and private companies). I vaguely realized most of them, but it's when you put them together that you see how ubiquitous it is. As he says ""It is shockingly easy to imagine what power would accrue to any agency that could integrate all these streams."
27,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28483229-jenna-moquin,3,"Overall, I enjoyed reading Kevin Kelly's vision of our future. And he's right about many things, including driverless cars replacing truck drivers, and artificial intelligence. That's definitely inevitable, though it chills me when I think of something the late Stephen Hawking said, that AI will be the last thing man invents...and it's ironic that he's praising the very things that may just be our downfall. Technology got Trump elected. In the chapter ""Flowing,"" he states ""soon you'll be able to make music without being a musician....with new tools accelerating the fluid flow of bits and copies, we will all become musicians."" What he should've said is: ""we will all become DJs mixing electronic music."" That's not the same as being a musician. Though it's true that we all have cameras in our phones, that doesn't make us all photographers. Kelly also seems to believe that paper books will become obsolete. I wholeheartedly disagree. The people who love to read, love to read paper books, not on devices. The fact that paper book sales have trumped ebooks over the past several years is proof of that. You also don't retain information as well when you read it on a screen as opposed to a piece of paper:http://college.usatoday.com/2014/04/1...https://abcnews.go.com/Health/reading...He also believes that in electronic books there will be hyperlinking: Indeed, dense hyperlinking among books would make every book a networked event. The conventional vision of the book's future assumes that books will remain isolated items, independent from one another, just as they are on the shelves at your public library. There, each book is pretty much unaware of the ones next to it.So, would the Bible have a hyperlink to The Da Vinci Code? I don't think so. And what about banned books? Many schools still ban The Catcher in the Rye. How would we stop these hyperlinks from happening? Buoyed by the success of massive interlinking in Wikipedia, many nerds believe that a billion human readers can reliably weave together the pages of old books, one hyperlink at a time. Those with a passion for a special subject, obscure author, or favorite book will, over time, link up its important parts. Multiply that simple generous act by millions of readers, and the universal library can be integrated in full, by fans, for fans.That's precisely how disinformation is spread. Just look at what happened with the 2016 election and all of the fake news articles. Kelly ends his chapters with a ""day in the life"" example of what life will be like in the future. At the end of the ""Screening"" chapter, he goes on for nearly a full page about how much he'll be screening when he wakes up in the morning: news, messages, screens on his closet showing him his clothes, screens on a milk carton try to get him to play a game, and my personal favorite: ""As I eat my cereal, I query the screen on the box to see if it is still fresh."" (You can't tell it's fresh just by eating it?) And after he does all of this, he says: ""I need to take my son to school."" It's the first mention of having a son in this entire ""day in the life"" example. He does an awful lot before he checks on his child. If the future means we'll all be spending hours screening before we acknowledge our children, that's a frightening future indeed."
28,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78372466-marco,2,"Very hard for me to understand the hype around this mediocre book. A few good insights, sure. Some useful food for thought, I concede. The question about future trends is a fundamental one to talk about. But the book is mediocre in the way it has been threaded together and researched. There is virtually little background to make the case for why these trends should continue onto the future, what is the hard evidence (or at least convincing evidence) for why these trends and not other should show a lot of progress in future decades, and their supposed inevitability is convincing only in a few chapters but does not apply to all the 12 trends. A lot of anecdotes, some of their poignant, some quite useless, and poorly researched when it comes to solid evidence to back up the trends. Another criticism that I have is the blind, unicorn-ish optimism expressed in every page. I would not mind, but the fact that so many potential dangers of future technology are not even mentioned is quite concerning and make me doubt how thorough is the investigation of these future trends. The ""one day in the future"" pages, often towards the end of each chapter, are useless quasi-fiction based on current trends more than on any credible projection. I did not read it till the end and had only 90 pages left; overall I do not believe it is was worth the time investment to be honest "
29,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden,2,"This has to be one of the most cognitively dissonant books I’ve ever read. Kelly describes in detail a technofascist dystopia where every single thing you do is tracked, predicted, manipulated, and so on... optimistically. I imagine this guy watches Black Mirror and thinks it’s the feel good hit of the summer. There are certainly some interesting ideas here and some of his predictions may very well come true. But for me, I certainly hope most of this isn’t ‘inevitable’ and, if it is, we better get ready to put some major safeguards in place to ensure privacy, freedom, and personal autonomy persists. The future he describes doesn’t have to be bad at all, so long as we meet it with the caution and wisdom it deserves. But Kelly’s ‘it’ll all work out just fine’ attitude strikes me as incredibly naive if not outright complicit."
30,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17367460-jim-angstadt,3,"The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our FutureKevin KellyThe author has been keeping track of technology developments for decades, and helping us understand just what changes are going on around us. In this book, he distills those changes into 12 forces that he thinks will change our world and us. He might be right. Most of his forecasts are reasonable projections of current trends. His ideas are thought provoking and worthy of attention; we can help shape the future rather than just let it happen.One minor nit. I sometimes wished the author was more direct. Don't build an elaborate construct around a simple idea. An economy of expression is better that too much.Notes while reading:===== IntroductionThe general trends are inevitable, not the specific details.===== 1. BecomingAs the pace of change increases, we are frequently/always learning something new or different. We are becoming a little different. New Operating Systems, devices, applications, opportunities, and the constant stream of updates for security, or bug fixes, or tracking, or privacy, compel us to keep learning, adapting.===== 2. CognifyingThe nature of thinking has changed with time. Memorization, spoken words, written words, science; now we have big data, algorithms, machine learning, search; new ways to understand ourselves and our context. What next? Well, maybe: cognified music, laundry, marketing, real estate, nursing, construction, ethics, toys, sports, ... chuckle, snarf, burp.Four categories for worker replacement:- Jobs that robots can do better then humans- Jobs that humans cannot do- Jobs we didn't know we wanted done- Jobs only humans can do - at first===== 3. FlowingWith old computers we had ""batch"" jobs; then daily tasks; now on-line, interactive, up-to-the-second. The flow has changed. So have the metaphores: desktops, folders, then web pages and links, now the flow of twitter, feeds, streaming video, and similar. We expect free, fast, and accurate.What is worth paying for?- Immediacy- Personalization- Interpretation- Authenticity- Accessibility- Embodiment- Patronage- Discoverability===== 4. ScreeningFrom hard-copy to screens, all around us, becoming more feature-full.===== 5. AccessingAccess replaces ownership. Dematerialization accelerates, and leads to more on-demand access. Decentralization, or flattening grows. Platforms enable more innovation and dematerialization but maybe centralize the underlying tech.===== 6. SharingNew, or at least in more use, are various forms of social interaction.- Sharing- Cooperation- Collaboration. eg: linux, 3D printer plans, ...- Collectivism. The power of the individual vs. the power of the state is not a zero sum game. Aim to ""maximize both the autonomy of the individual and the power of the people working together."" We want the government to be more ""open"". Organizations can be a hybrid of bottom-up and top-down. Let everybody be an editor. Wikipedia started as bottom-up and gradually added the top-down component, ie the senior editors.===== 7. FilteringWe simply cannot process everything. We must filter. Currently we can filter by gatekeepers, intermediates, curators, brands, government, culture, friends, and other methods. And it's getting harder. Recomendation systems help, but are not enough. Plus, we want just enough unusual, different inputs to keep us fresh.Our attention is a limiting factor. Should we be paid for our attention?===== 8. RemixingWe see plenty of examples of remix in every-day life: music, video, books, movies, and more. Some has a profit motive, some do not.===== 9. InteractingVirtual reality (VR) is now low cost, interactive, and provides a sense of being there, presence. We will be interacting with everything. Internet of Things, IoT.===== 10. TrackingSelf-tracking, first for fitness, later for lifestream. IoT will/could add more data. We can know ourselves better. When aggregated, we can know ""us"" much better. Medical studies could look at vastly more ""individuals"" that previous.Commercial and government tracking are another dimension. Data could come from: cars, highways, taxis, airlines and trains, drones, postal mail, utilities, phones, CCTV, smart homes, interactive devices, loyalty cards, IRS, credit cards, e-banking, photo recognition, and much more. Technological rather than social or cultural.Page 260. ""Ubiquitous surveillance is inevitable."" Shape the nature of tracking. More symmetrical or coveillance. ""... is there room for anonymity?"" Yes, but in very limited amounts. Eg: we need whistle-blowers.===== 11. QuestioningOur ability to get good quality answers to our questions leads to more questions. The nature of what is now possible leads to more questions. Answers are cheap, so ask away.===== 12. BeginningThe author says we are at the beginning of a new way of living. It might have been interesting to have the author contrast this time with other historic times, like the industrial revolution, or the invention of the printing press, or, much earlier, the ability to record our thoughts on paper, or its predecessors."

33,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,4,"I don't know how I found this book but it was exciting to read. I think my brother would enjoy it. Even if Kevin Kelly is dead wrong on his predictions (which is highly unlikely), you can't help but imagine what it'd be like if he was right. I wonder what he thinks of dumb solar roadways. I was surprised not to hear anything about that in this book. But note to self: reread this book in 2050 to see if and how much he was right. Basically think of Ironman's world and that's a glimpse of what we'd have in a few decades. I like the concept of renting everything in the future. With the rise of AirBnb and Uber it is certainly heading that way. Also it will be helpful because we won't take as many things for granite like we do. For example, the paintings/pictures we have on our walls will be exchanged every month or year or so. It will teach us to live a Minimalist lifestyle (click on that link and read that 11 minute article by Mark Manson. It's pretty neat). Smart Shirts are going to be coolo. All of this is happening because of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think that technology is like a Deity. In fact, I think if I weren't a traditional believer and if I were perhaps agnostic I would, indeed, believe that technology is God and He's slowly revealing Himself to us until we can fully realize and comprehend it. Almost like Optimus Prime. And why not?This book reminded me a lot of the first part of the book I, Robot when they're on Mars.We're resistant to upgrades and updates for our devices but he points out that they're like hygiene for our tech. I hadn't thought of it that way. And like we learn in The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century there is a higher call for greater honesty in our world. Especially as things progress towards the Cloud and everything becomes searchable. Time to start cleaning up your act people. If you haven't already. Vanity trumps privacy after all."
34,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton,4,"There is a major irony in reading a book like this in physical form - when it is full of statements espousing the future, probably without too many physical books. Like most books that are making a projection about what will happen in the future, this will probably have a short shelf life. But for now I think it is one of the better attempts to make sense of the trends in technology and their implications. This should not be taken to mean I agree with everything Kelly writes, far from it. But he writes well, thoughtfully and in an engaging way. So, it is at least enjoyable to read. Futurists have a tendency to 2 extremes - those seeing only Utopia and those seeing only doom. Kelly is more inclined to the Utopian viewpoint, although with occasional sections on the challenges of getting there. I have no doubt, to steal Kelly's title that the future is inevitable. That's the easy part, the hard bit is working out which future it will be. Kelly paints a believable picture from a technological perspective, but I think underplays the challenges in getting there and the social implications. A lot of people are going to push back, possibly in fairly assertive ways, on the future he suggests. I suspect if you are the sort of person who is constantly reading about or engaged in technology this book will tell you nothing new - other than being a nice, condensed summary. On the other hand, if you are like me, someone who feels I ought to be interested in understanding the future but generally find much which is written dull and naive, you may enjoy this book somewhat more. "
35,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"Veteran social commentator Kevin Kelly has written a new book about the future of technology that will be a primer for science fiction novelists going forward. Indeed, the title resonates with the final words of my own recent novel: “Destiny was inevitable now,” and the reason, as Kevin Kelly so carefully articulates, is that future trends have already been established! Proprietary AI systems already control what you see when you Google search, tailor what you view on Facebook, manipulate what you buy on Amazon, and make most of the money in the world. VR technology has now reached the tipping point necessary to create an interconnective virtual domain that will transform the primitive internet beyond our wildest dreams, and bring the price down to free. When corporate AI machines eventually converge and begin feeding on exponentially increasing global metadata, a new symbiotic holos will arise that will extend beyond human consciousness, (dubbed “mothership” in my sci-fi novel FREENET,) a tool that becomes an end in itself, and also the beginning. Kelly's twelve defining postulates may seem somewhat artificial, and perhaps overlap a bit, but his premises are solid and his inspiration undeniable. What I like most about Kelly's view is his optimism. He throws the reader into the future by reminding us that the net is just waking up now and learning to crawl. These are the glory days of youthful innovation that we will soon look back on with envy from a standing position. "

It is all happening now. You should be so excited to be alive!---The book discusses the major trends of this Beginning: end of privacy?

Because it was both validating (I mean even by writing a Goodreads review I AM being the future) and challenging (I'm not ready for my AI overlords just yet). And reminded me of why I have a secret love of spec fic. And more than once I thought about my boy Joaquin in the excellent movie Her.On the other hand negative stars because, frankly, there is nothing about Kevin Kelly that seems woke and the back of the book was all testimonials fromWhite Men congratulating themselves basically. PASS THE BUCKET. Also Kevin Kelly was one time asked to help Steven Spielberg imagine the future for the average movie minority report and he mentions it in numerous chapters. So I guess even futurists can't get over their past glory days, ahe?"
38,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11001411-james-bender,4,"I love Kevin Kelly and have read all of his books. This one is an extrapolation of current trends and has a lot of interesting speculations and predictions. But like Yogi Berra said, ""it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future"". Or Jenny Holzer's Truism: ""The future is stupid"". Things may be veering more in the direction of the movie Idiocracy. With the current political situation it's probably worth rewatching as a counterpoint to The Inevitable. "
39,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"Kevin Kelly gives us a glimpse of the future organized around 12 technological trends that shape our world today, and obviously will shape the future. It is quite readable. To each trend he offers historical support to explain the idea, and in most cases offers a cautious, yet incredible, vision of where that might take us. In some chapters he gives us a vaguely disturbing vignette of how your day might go in the future. Both fantastic and credible at the same time.I really enjoyed this book. His method seems adequate, and he punctuates the explanations with relevant anecdotes. It introduced me to a few things happening now I was not aware of, and certainly feel more prepared to watch for these future trends. If you are in the position of needing to know where our culture is headed, you will find plenty of value in reading this book.My notes on the twelve trends:1. Becoming: We are all perpetual newbies. Things are changing continuously and automatically, and we can't anticipate the future, but the winner will be those who can adapt quickly. This is exactly the main point of Alvin Toffler's Future Shock written in 1970 -- strange he made no mention of it. (He starts with a common fallacy about thermodynamics, but it is unimportant to his thesis, see the details below.)2. Cognifying: ""The business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI."" AI is developing all around us, but not human intelligence but other KINDS of intelligence he calls alien intelligence. We might need to prevent consciousness to get the kind of intelligence we want. Many jobs will be replaced by robots, but humans will move into the job of training and running the robots. 3. Flowing: Digital tech copies everything it accesses, so the old ideas of purchase and ownership are going away. Spotify. Netflix. Instead 8 'generatives' that add value to a free stream: [1] immediacy: you get before others, [2] personalization: your copy is specialized, [3] interpretation: added meaning, [4] authenticity, yours is real and not just a copy, [5] accessibility: they organize it all for you, [6] embodiment: physically shared experience, [7] patronage: supporting the arts in new wasy, [8] discoverability (TV guide was worth more than the tv networks). There are four stages: (1) fixed rare things that get copied, (2) free ubiquitous availability (3) active sharing and services, (4) full engagement of flowing by all parties and co-creation.4. Screening: differences between book media, and screens as an interface to knowledge.5. Accessing: Uber is not about providing more cars, but easy access to cars and drivers that happen to be available at the moment. AirBnB. Why own anything? Why not just access what you need only when you need it?6. Sharing: (1) simple sharing moves to (2) cooperation toward common goals, to (3) collaboration which is organized and coordinated and finally to (4) collectivism: a self-organizing group of people who all receive benefit of their own initiative. Open source software projects are the best example. Not capitalist or communist but something new and different. Kickstart.7. Filtering: ""In a world of abundance, the only scarcity is human attention"" How to separate the wheat from the chafe? We might even be paid for our attention. 8. Remixing: mashups. fan fiction. Full blow video remixing, excerpting, referencing, etc need some inventions as we move into full video collectivism. Property and ownership problems. 9. Interacting: it is not just media, but two way communication as well. Second Life. VR interactions. Augmented reality. (1) we will have more sensors and senses, (2) hey will be increasingly intimate, (3) it will be increasingly immersive. And, yes, ""Goodreads"" was mentioned as an example.10. Tracking. Quantified self. Digital technology makes it cheap to record and then analyze. Surveillance is inevitable, but will the access be one-sided? Is coveillance possible? True anonymity always brings out the worst in people. ""Privacy can be gained only by trust, and trust requires persistent identity."" From tracking will come emergence of something new: ""There is no case in our experience where the difference of a factor of a trillion doesn't make a qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, difference."" 11. Questioning: Google and wikipedia answer 2 trillion questions every year, but something else: ""the impossible things happening now are in every case due to the emergence of a new level of organization that did not exist before."" We have more access to unusual things than ever before. Discoveries depend on asking ""good questions.""12. Beginning: we are becoming a planetary network of intelligence and artificial intelligence, he calls the ""holos."" What will become we can't even imagine. Today we have only the beginning.I can't let Kelly slip with a common misconception. He cites the 2nd law of thermodynamics, saying that it means that everything is flling apart slowly. This is NOT what the law says. The fallacy is thinking that there is a smooth distribution of the disorganization. Within a closed system, some parts will actually get MORE organized, while the overall net organization decreases. This is a nit that I have to pick because so many people make this same mistake. However, it is unimportant to Kelly's thesis in any way, so just a footnote here."
40,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"No one can say where exactly a ball thrown in the air will land, but at least on Earth it’s a certainty that a thrown ball will land. Kevin Kelly, formerly of Wired magazine, can’t say exactly what the future will look like, but he is confident enough to predict what trends will continue based on present technology. Our global civilizations have been radically transformed from the 1970s til now, but computers weren’t the catalyst for all the change we see around us. Networked computers were. By themselves, the first computers were house-sized calculators and overpriced filing cabinets; when they began exchanging information freely, magic happened. What world-changing wonders can we expect from the current trends in technology?First, says Kelly, is “becoming”: In the late eighties, Zygmunt Bauman introduced the term liquid modernity to our sociological lexicon. In previous generations, changes happened slowly enough that our societies were able to digest them and establish a new normal. As the 19th gave way to the 20th century, however, the rate of change has quickened to the point that a new normal is impossible: societiy is revolutionized multiple times within a single generation, with the effect that there is no stable ground to be had, no new normal to be reached. Now our products are no longer discrete products, but services that are continually being changed -- think of Office 365, or even Windows 10. Windows 10 is rumored to be the last Windows, not because Microsoft is retiring from the OS business, but because Windows 10's frequent updates constantly add new features that would have otherwise been developed and delivered in a new Windows. Our phones, too, are not merely the device that came out of the original box: as we add apps and accessories, we change their nature.The second big-ticket item in here is ""cognifying"", by which Kelly means using machine intelligence for everything. There won't be a master AI that controls every aspect of our lives, he says; instead, we''ll develop multiple machine intelligences for different suites of needs, and they''ll be utterly mundane -- and already are. When we execute a google search for recipes or ask it for directions, we are in fact helping train and benefit Google's machine-learning algorithisms: we are teaching them what we're most likely to be looking for. Those ""Related Products"" that Amazon helpfully shows you are also an early example of machine intelligence, as Amazon's database learns your shopping preferences and attempts to predict what you would like next.Two more concepts from the book worth sharing quickly here are Accessing and Tracking. Tracking sounds obvious, but Kelley isn't just talking about website cookies or Google & Apple recording your movements through your phone's GPS. By tracking, Kelly means that the door is open to quantifying every aspect of our lives. People can already use their phone's apps to track how much they walk per day, how well they asleep, and record their diets; they can already use phones to monitor their heartbeat; phones in the near future will be able to monitor blood pressure and blood sugar, as well. Cheap cameras and cloud storage mean that we can record more moments of our lives, and later poke through them at our leisure as if they were files in a drawer. The cloud is a key aspect of much of what Kelly covers, but it is especially prominent in the ""Accessing"" chapter, in which he writes that we're moving away from an ownership society. We no longer need to own a car; we just need access to one. Apps and tech allow us to share resources, and in some cases the resources are becoming so cheap that they can be offered for free: no one needs to struggle with an ersatz Office clone when they can use the freely available OfficeOnline.There are ten real concepts in total (there are two more chapters, ""questioning"" and ""becoming"", but they're less about content than thinking about our relationship with content), and the author purposely avoids mentioning any downsides. He takes it for granted that everything can be used to malicious purposes, but that would be another book entirely. (A book like Future Crimes II, perhaps...) I also liked the chapters on Interacting and Screening; one addressed the future mundane role of virtual reality and augmented reality, in that games and movies will become more ""real"", and our travels in the real world will have a digital overlay adding more information -- the ubiquity of screens dovetails with that rather nicely. One disturbing possibility Kelly mentions is having glasses or ocular implants with different apps installed; one can read people's faces and match them to a driver's license database. The other concepts in the book are extensions of minor things happening now, like remixing and filtering.As someone who can be both entranced and repelled by the promises of technological -- completely fascinated on a abstract level, distantly horrified at a human level -- I found The Inevitable enthralling reading. The author is sloppy with language, however, using ""socialism"" and ""collective"" when 'cooperative' would have been more accurate. For some reason he thinks libertarian individualism is contradicted by Wikipedia , when it's merely individuals voluntarily working together toward a common goal. Socialism makes me think more of involuntary mass actions, like taxes and slavery."

It’s touted as his “most readable book” but I now take that to mean his “most prosaic book”; having traded big, complex ideas, rigorous research, depth and detail for a conventional summarization of current digital trends based on his experience and observation. Typically, Kelly’s books are expansive, mind-expanding, and overflowing with synthesized research but this felt like (what I imagine it’s like to read) a  For Dummies  manual. Perhaps Current Digital Cultural Trends For Dummies.  The heart seems to be lacking.After starting excitedly, I read through the whole thing rather listlessly. This book is a lot more mainstream than any of his other books. It has a broader appeal but for someone who already enjoys his niche books (such as myself) this is much more watered down and straightforward. It’s a good book for the unacquainted/anyone hoping to get a solid understanding of the general direction that technology in culture is heading. However, for people already immersed in conversations and ideas about technology and our immediate future, don’t expect too much new information.Despite, ostensibly, being about “the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future,” it talks more about current trends and then extrapolates those trends vaguely into the near future. The predictions are not very exciting, nor are they bold or very risky —just like predicting the winner of a game in the 4th quarter: its safe and usually quite accurate. Although there are occasional interesting insights, seldom was it very fascinating. And only at the very end did it feel “provocative.” That being said, any book by Kevin Kelly is worth reading. I’m being too hard on this book because his previous books set my expectations WAY too high. Also, I’m constantly reading and listening to books/podcasts about technology, the future, and culture so that most of the ideas here were old hat for me.Kelly is always quite optimistic about where things are heading which is refreshing especially since he has been so completely immersed in the constantly changing field of digital technology for the last 30+ years. He knows his stuff and if anyone is in a place to tell us what is going to be “inevitable” in the near future likely there is no one better than Kelly. I almost gave this book four stars because the last two chapters were quite good (especially the final chapter on “Beginning” which is only, unfortunately, 7 pages) but the truth is I was not enthralled for the vast majority of the 297 pages so, realistically, it’s a fair three stars. I do greatly recommend Kevin Kelly’s other books: What Technology Wants and Out of Control"

In his 2016 book, Kevin Kelly provides a detailed and optimistic guide through twelve technological innovations/imperatives that will shape the next three decades, ultimately further transforming our lives.Why Should You Read This Book?You should read this book if you are interested in better understanding what our lives will look like over the next thirty years. And you should absolutely read this book if you are interested in understanding where the business or industry you currently work in may be headed.It’s simply amazing that much of the technology needed to drive these transformative changes are already in motion today. And if only half of what Kevin Kelly says comes true, these forces will revolutionize the way we work, learn, buy, communicate, and generally live with each other.Final Thoughts:If you embrace the optimistic side of the transformative force that is all things technology, you will love this book. If you take a more pessimistic view of what technology might eventually do to us and our world in the future, you will probably not like this book.

The concept of the holos as an integrated AI constructed of all devices connected to the internet (phones, IOT, servers, etc) forming one cogent supercomputer on the scale of trillions of that of current processing power). This AI to be trained on human data and interactions with the holos, through search data, total surveillance data, consumer preference data and the 100s of times we are logged daily. Just as the nature of the internet made Napster and Facebook inevitable, so too does it make infinite remixing and the holos inevitable. The technology for 99pc of future inventions already exists and it is simply remixing of preexisting technologies that will lead to these inventons. In the same way Facebook real ID + GPS location + like ranking lead inevitably to Grindr then Tinder, so too future inventions will come from remixes."

For the innovator, the curious and the skeptic. I went through three phases reading this book:1. Skepticism - Before starting to read: ""What kind of bullshit is this?""2. Obviosity - When starting to read: ""Well, duh!""3. Revelation - After reading for a while: ""Oh, shit - Yes! I can't believe I didn't see that one!""This might not make much sense, but to summarize I think this book is an amazing summary and ""prediction"" of what our world is currently moving towards. It describes not too much of specific technologies, but general principles and ""forces"" that are currently in motion (beneath current technological advances)."

A typical chapter provides a condensed history, a summary of the current situation replete with philosophical quips and staggering statistics, and caps off with a look at how the trend will change our lives in the future. I've read reviews that dismiss the book as pedestrian, and while I can understand hardcore tech geeks being disappointed with the offerings on hand, I still learned something in every chapter.Across all the trends covered, decentralization seems to be omnipresent. The author predicts much of the power we allocate to governments and corporations will inevitably be passed to the collective. While Kelly doesn't touch on the subject himself, I suspect this inexorability has corporations struggling to retain as much power as possible for as long as possible, giving way to phenomena such as the current endangerment of net neutrality.There were far too many thoughts, observations, musings and predictions to remember, but the one thing I could take from this book was Kelly's optimism about the future. This technology is going to make our lives better, not worse. As bad as things seem now with smartphone zombies and lethargic gamer kids, these trends are going to make the world a better place.**(reviewer's note) Unless of course climate change kills us all."

I don't want keyless entry on my front door, rarely use Siri, and only just upgraded to a smart thermostat. Still, I know we will not move back to life before these devices entered our lives. This book was a great insight into the possibilities of the near as well as not-to-distant future. The author thankfully avoided computer-speak so I easily understood all that he said. Still, I spent part of the book wide-eyed and mystified at what we are already capable of and a bit overwhelmed at how quickly much of what he predicts may come to us. "

But rarely have I heard anyone talk about digital technology with such a deep appreciation for how it affects all of us, outside of the context of 'early adopters', 'startups' etc. It is truly insightful, and it is changing my mind about what I think about this, which is my own industry that I've been in all my life. It is a fresh look at the recent history of technology written by someone who gets to see everything (and everyone). I think he has nailed it. "

Author draws a picture of the future based on his years of first-hand experience with tech and his knowledge of the technology as a co-founder of Wired magazine. Seems like lot of technologies are already here and prepared to change our life. The only obstacle is the slow adoption of these new technology by people. But according to the author all technology changes are targeting to improve our daily life as well as help to unleash the creativity power of everyone.Great language, easy and entertaining reading. "
50,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20616282-dale-callahan,4,Kevin covers 12 forces that will lead to more innovation in the future. The forces are not technologies (nouns) but instead actions we are taking and will be able to take from the tech shift (verbs). While some of the predictions he makes are already here - much of his thoughts are about the culture shift that will come from or drive the future. Some of the most interesting parts are his glimpses into the future life - where he will suddenly slide into a day in the life in the future (closer than we think). These are perhaps the most eye-opening parts of the book.

The parallels between the written word of previous centuries coming forward and digitization looking ahead are both fascinating and mind-boggling. Just the first couple chapters, properly and fully digested, ought to shake people up some as they contemplate that many jobs of today (think truck driver) could be superfluous in just a few decades. Creative destruction writ very large."

It's fun to muse, given the entire history of human civilization, that I have been lucky enough to live during the birth of the internet. A couple of key ideas stood out for me. I relish the idea of my refrigerator tracking its inventory and I being able to access it whenever and wherever convenient, such as while grocery shopping. And I too have fantasized about the potential gamification of real life: after a particularly harrowing drive to work during a snowstorm, I mused upon arrival that I ought to have received bonus points for my successful navigation under such adverse circumstances. Though the book is now four years old and technology writing ages faster than other topics, I'd say it's still worth a read."

If I would be an entrepreneur I would give it 4 as it showed me some good and interesting POVs and even named some of the cool products that I can use now.As a person somehow related to technology this book was like - yep, that may happen, but I did imagine that differently. Or yes it’s exactly how I imagine it. There are no _new_ things but everything it put into nice wording and some good stories. Something that some CEO can use to shape their plans.And mostly because of that I give 3 stars."

That's because this book was written before we lost all confidence on Facebook etc. Yes, the future painted here is one glimpsed through very rose tinted glasses. But I must say, precisely because there's so much here I don't (or no longer) agree with, it was a worthy reading. It made me think and argue. I'd assign this book for media undergrads, lots to discuss."

Furthermore, the whole stance of this brand of futurism just reeks of white superiority and systemic bias. Injustice is never addressed in the book. I just can't get on board with this line of thinking anymore. Opinions aside, the book is well written and the audiobook was well produced. "

Also, what I missed is the idea that we can (and should) give the future more conscious direction. There is a lot of talk about what direction we will take as a species, but little about how we can steer it towards an effective path. A missed opportunity."

The idea of AI being metered and sold like electricity was also fun."
60,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17367460-jim-angstadt,3,"The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our FutureKevin KellyThe author has been keeping track of technology developments for decades, and helping us understand just what changes are going on around us. In this book, he distills those changes into 12 forces that he thinks will change our world and us. He might be right. Most of his forecasts are reasonable projections of current trends. His ideas are thought provoking and worthy of attention; we can help shape the future rather than just let it happen.One minor nit. I sometimes wished the author was more direct. Don't build an elaborate construct around a simple idea. An economy of expression is better that too much.Notes while reading:===== IntroductionThe general trends are inevitable, not the specific details.===== 1. BecomingAs the pace of change increases, we are frequently/always learning something new or different. We are becoming a little different. New Operating Systems, devices, applications, opportunities, and the constant stream of updates for security, or bug fixes, or tracking, or privacy, compel us to keep learning, adapting.===== 2. CognifyingThe nature of thinking has changed with time. Memorization, spoken words, written words, science; now we have big data, algorithms, machine learning, search; new ways to understand ourselves and our context. What next? Well, maybe: cognified music, laundry, marketing, real estate, nursing, construction, ethics, toys, sports, ... chuckle, snarf, burp.Four categories for worker replacement:- Jobs that robots can do better then humans- Jobs that humans cannot do- Jobs we didn't know we wanted done- Jobs only humans can do - at first===== 3. FlowingWith old computers we had ""batch"" jobs; then daily tasks; now on-line, interactive, up-to-the-second. The flow has changed. So have the metaphores: desktops, folders, then web pages and links, now the flow of twitter, feeds, streaming video, and similar. We expect free, fast, and accurate.What is worth paying for?- Immediacy- Personalization- Interpretation- Authenticity- Accessibility- Embodiment- Patronage- Discoverability===== 4. ScreeningFrom hard-copy to screens, all around us, becoming more feature-full.===== 5. AccessingAccess replaces ownership. Dematerialization accelerates, and leads to more on-demand access. Decentralization, or flattening grows. Platforms enable more innovation and dematerialization but maybe centralize the underlying tech.===== 6. SharingNew, or at least in more use, are various forms of social interaction.- Sharing- Cooperation- Collaboration. eg: linux, 3D printer plans, ...- Collectivism. The power of the individual vs. the power of the state is not a zero sum game. Aim to ""maximize both the autonomy of the individual and the power of the people working together."" We want the government to be more ""open"". Organizations can be a hybrid of bottom-up and top-down. Let everybody be an editor. Wikipedia started as bottom-up and gradually added the top-down component, ie the senior editors.===== 7. FilteringWe simply cannot process everything. We must filter. Currently we can filter by gatekeepers, intermediates, curators, brands, government, culture, friends, and other methods. And it's getting harder. Recomendation systems help, but are not enough. Plus, we want just enough unusual, different inputs to keep us fresh.Our attention is a limiting factor. Should we be paid for our attention?===== 8. RemixingWe see plenty of examples of remix in every-day life: music, video, books, movies, and more. Some has a profit motive, some do not.===== 9. InteractingVirtual reality (VR) is now low cost, interactive, and provides a sense of being there, presence. We will be interacting with everything. Internet of Things, IoT.===== 10. TrackingSelf-tracking, first for fitness, later for lifestream. IoT will/could add more data. We can know ourselves better. When aggregated, we can know ""us"" much better. Medical studies could look at vastly more ""individuals"" that previous.Commercial and government tracking are another dimension. Data could come from: cars, highways, taxis, airlines and trains, drones, postal mail, utilities, phones, CCTV, smart homes, interactive devices, loyalty cards, IRS, credit cards, e-banking, photo recognition, and much more. Technological rather than social or cultural.Page 260. ""Ubiquitous surveillance is inevitable."" Shape the nature of tracking. More symmetrical or coveillance. ""... is there room for anonymity?"" Yes, but in very limited amounts. Eg: we need whistle-blowers.===== 11. QuestioningOur ability to get good quality answers to our questions leads to more questions. The nature of what is now possible leads to more questions. Answers are cheap, so ask away.===== 12. BeginningThe author says we are at the beginning of a new way of living. It might have been interesting to have the author contrast this time with other historic times, like the industrial revolution, or the invention of the printing press, or, much earlier, the ability to record our thoughts on paper, or its predecessors."

63,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,4,"I don't know how I found this book but it was exciting to read. I think my brother would enjoy it. Even if Kevin Kelly is dead wrong on his predictions (which is highly unlikely), you can't help but imagine what it'd be like if he was right. I wonder what he thinks of dumb solar roadways. I was surprised not to hear anything about that in this book. But note to self: reread this book in 2050 to see if and how much he was right. Basically think of Ironman's world and that's a glimpse of what we'd have in a few decades. I like the concept of renting everything in the future. With the rise of AirBnb and Uber it is certainly heading that way. Also it will be helpful because we won't take as many things for granite like we do. For example, the paintings/pictures we have on our walls will be exchanged every month or year or so. It will teach us to live a Minimalist lifestyle (click on that link and read that 11 minute article by Mark Manson. It's pretty neat). Smart Shirts are going to be coolo. All of this is happening because of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think that technology is like a Deity. In fact, I think if I weren't a traditional believer and if I were perhaps agnostic I would, indeed, believe that technology is God and He's slowly revealing Himself to us until we can fully realize and comprehend it. Almost like Optimus Prime. And why not?This book reminded me a lot of the first part of the book I, Robot when they're on Mars.We're resistant to upgrades and updates for our devices but he points out that they're like hygiene for our tech. I hadn't thought of it that way. And like we learn in The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century there is a higher call for greater honesty in our world. Especially as things progress towards the Cloud and everything becomes searchable. Time to start cleaning up your act people. If you haven't already. Vanity trumps privacy after all."
64,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton,4,"There is a major irony in reading a book like this in physical form - when it is full of statements espousing the future, probably without too many physical books. Like most books that are making a projection about what will happen in the future, this will probably have a short shelf life. But for now I think it is one of the better attempts to make sense of the trends in technology and their implications. This should not be taken to mean I agree with everything Kelly writes, far from it. But he writes well, thoughtfully and in an engaging way. So, it is at least enjoyable to read. Futurists have a tendency to 2 extremes - those seeing only Utopia and those seeing only doom. Kelly is more inclined to the Utopian viewpoint, although with occasional sections on the challenges of getting there. I have no doubt, to steal Kelly's title that the future is inevitable. That's the easy part, the hard bit is working out which future it will be. Kelly paints a believable picture from a technological perspective, but I think underplays the challenges in getting there and the social implications. A lot of people are going to push back, possibly in fairly assertive ways, on the future he suggests. I suspect if you are the sort of person who is constantly reading about or engaged in technology this book will tell you nothing new - other than being a nice, condensed summary. On the other hand, if you are like me, someone who feels I ought to be interested in understanding the future but generally find much which is written dull and naive, you may enjoy this book somewhat more. "
65,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"Veteran social commentator Kevin Kelly has written a new book about the future of technology that will be a primer for science fiction novelists going forward. Indeed, the title resonates with the final words of my own recent novel: “Destiny was inevitable now,” and the reason, as Kevin Kelly so carefully articulates, is that future trends have already been established! Proprietary AI systems already control what you see when you Google search, tailor what you view on Facebook, manipulate what you buy on Amazon, and make most of the money in the world. VR technology has now reached the tipping point necessary to create an interconnective virtual domain that will transform the primitive internet beyond our wildest dreams, and bring the price down to free. When corporate AI machines eventually converge and begin feeding on exponentially increasing global metadata, a new symbiotic holos will arise that will extend beyond human consciousness, (dubbed “mothership” in my sci-fi novel FREENET,) a tool that becomes an end in itself, and also the beginning. Kelly's twelve defining postulates may seem somewhat artificial, and perhaps overlap a bit, but his premises are solid and his inspiration undeniable. What I like most about Kelly's view is his optimism. He throws the reader into the future by reminding us that the net is just waking up now and learning to crawl. These are the glory days of youthful innovation that we will soon look back on with envy from a standing position. "

It is all happening now. You should be so excited to be alive!---The book discusses the major trends of this Beginning: end of privacy? VR and digitized human interactions, cognification of all matter, the transition from a static world to an always evolving, never finished, stream of ideas, memories, revelations.---4/5 Stars, as the book contains great and well ordered ideas, yet sometimes it's too lengthy.---https://www.instagram.com/p/BITIcozB8..."

Because it was both validating (I mean even by writing a Goodreads review I AM being the future) and challenging (I'm not ready for my AI overlords just yet). And reminded me of why I have a secret love of spec fic. And more than once I thought about my boy Joaquin in the excellent movie Her.On the other hand negative stars because, frankly, there is nothing about Kevin Kelly that seems woke and the back of the book was all testimonials fromWhite Men congratulating themselves basically. PASS THE BUCKET. Also Kevin Kelly was one time asked to help Steven Spielberg imagine the future for the average movie minority report and he mentions it in numerous chapters. So I guess even futurists can't get over their past glory days, ahe?"
68,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11001411-james-bender,4,"I love Kevin Kelly and have read all of his books. This one is an extrapolation of current trends and has a lot of interesting speculations and predictions. But like Yogi Berra said, ""it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future"". Or Jenny Holzer's Truism: ""The future is stupid"". Things may be veering more in the direction of the movie Idiocracy. With the current political situation it's probably worth rewatching as a counterpoint to The Inevitable. "
69,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"Kevin Kelly gives us a glimpse of the future organized around 12 technological trends that shape our world today, and obviously will shape the future. It is quite readable. To each trend he offers historical support to explain the idea, and in most cases offers a cautious, yet incredible, vision of where that might take us. In some chapters he gives us a vaguely disturbing vignette of how your day might go in the future. Both fantastic and credible at the same time.I really enjoyed this book. His method seems adequate, and he punctuates the explanations with relevant anecdotes. It introduced me to a few things happening now I was not aware of, and certainly feel more prepared to watch for these future trends. If you are in the position of needing to know where our culture is headed, you will find plenty of value in reading this book.My notes on the twelve trends:1. Becoming: We are all perpetual newbies. Things are changing continuously and automatically, and we can't anticipate the future, but the winner will be those who can adapt quickly. This is exactly the main point of Alvin Toffler's Future Shock written in 1970 -- strange he made no mention of it. (He starts with a common fallacy about thermodynamics, but it is unimportant to his thesis, see the details below.)2. Cognifying: ""The business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI."" AI is developing all around us, but not human intelligence but other KINDS of intelligence he calls alien intelligence. We might need to prevent consciousness to get the kind of intelligence we want. Many jobs will be replaced by robots, but humans will move into the job of training and running the robots. 3. Flowing: Digital tech copies everything it accesses, so the old ideas of purchase and ownership are going away. Spotify. Netflix. Instead 8 'generatives' that add value to a free stream: [1] immediacy: you get before others, [2] personalization: your copy is specialized, [3] interpretation: added meaning, [4] authenticity, yours is real and not just a copy, [5] accessibility: they organize it all for you, [6] embodiment: physically shared experience, [7] patronage: supporting the arts in new wasy, [8] discoverability (TV guide was worth more than the tv networks). There are four stages: (1) fixed rare things that get copied, (2) free ubiquitous availability (3) active sharing and services, (4) full engagement of flowing by all parties and co-creation.4. Screening: differences between book media, and screens as an interface to knowledge.5. Accessing: Uber is not about providing more cars, but easy access to cars and drivers that happen to be available at the moment. AirBnB. Why own anything? Why not just access what you need only when you need it?6. Sharing: (1) simple sharing moves to (2) cooperation toward common goals, to (3) collaboration which is organized and coordinated and finally to (4) collectivism: a self-organizing group of people who all receive benefit of their own initiative. Open source software projects are the best example. Not capitalist or communist but something new and different. Kickstart.7. Filtering: ""In a world of abundance, the only scarcity is human attention"" How to separate the wheat from the chafe? We might even be paid for our attention. 8. Remixing: mashups. fan fiction. Full blow video remixing, excerpting, referencing, etc need some inventions as we move into full video collectivism. Property and ownership problems. 9. Interacting: it is not just media, but two way communication as well. Second Life. VR interactions. Augmented reality. (1) we will have more sensors and senses, (2) hey will be increasingly intimate, (3) it will be increasingly immersive. And, yes, ""Goodreads"" was mentioned as an example.10. Tracking. Quantified self. Digital technology makes it cheap to record and then analyze. Surveillance is inevitable, but will the access be one-sided? Is coveillance possible? True anonymity always brings out the worst in people. ""Privacy can be gained only by trust, and trust requires persistent identity."" From tracking will come emergence of something new: ""There is no case in our experience where the difference of a factor of a trillion doesn't make a qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, difference."" 11. Questioning: Google and wikipedia answer 2 trillion questions every year, but something else: ""the impossible things happening now are in every case due to the emergence of a new level of organization that did not exist before."" We have more access to unusual things than ever before. Discoveries depend on asking ""good questions.""12. Beginning: we are becoming a planetary network of intelligence and artificial intelligence, he calls the ""holos."" What will become we can't even imagine. Today we have only the beginning.I can't let Kelly slip with a common misconception. He cites the 2nd law of thermodynamics, saying that it means that everything is flling apart slowly. This is NOT what the law says. The fallacy is thinking that there is a smooth distribution of the disorganization. Within a closed system, some parts will actually get MORE organized, while the overall net organization decreases. This is a nit that I have to pick because so many people make this same mistake. However, it is unimportant to Kelly's thesis in any way, so just a footnote here."
70,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"No one can say where exactly a ball thrown in the air will land, but at least on Earth it’s a certainty that a thrown ball will land. Kevin Kelly, formerly of Wired magazine, can’t say exactly what the future will look like, but he is confident enough to predict what trends will continue based on present technology. Our global civilizations have been radically transformed from the 1970s til now, but computers weren’t the catalyst for all the change we see around us. Networked computers were. By themselves, the first computers were house-sized calculators and overpriced filing cabinets; when they began exchanging information freely, magic happened. What world-changing wonders can we expect from the current trends in technology?First, says Kelly, is “becoming”: In the late eighties, Zygmunt Bauman introduced the term liquid modernity to our sociological lexicon. In previous generations, changes happened slowly enough that our societies were able to digest them and establish a new normal. As the 19th gave way to the 20th century, however, the rate of change has quickened to the point that a new normal is impossible: societiy is revolutionized multiple times within a single generation, with the effect that there is no stable ground to be had, no new normal to be reached. Now our products are no longer discrete products, but services that are continually being changed -- think of Office 365, or even Windows 10. Windows 10 is rumored to be the last Windows, not because Microsoft is retiring from the OS business, but because Windows 10's frequent updates constantly add new features that would have otherwise been developed and delivered in a new Windows. Our phones, too, are not merely the device that came out of the original box: as we add apps and accessories, we change their nature.The second big-ticket item in here is ""cognifying"", by which Kelly means using machine intelligence for everything. There won't be a master AI that controls every aspect of our lives, he says; instead, we''ll develop multiple machine intelligences for different suites of needs, and they''ll be utterly mundane -- and already are. When we execute a google search for recipes or ask it for directions, we are in fact helping train and benefit Google's machine-learning algorithisms: we are teaching them what we're most likely to be looking for. Those ""Related Products"" that Amazon helpfully shows you are also an early example of machine intelligence, as Amazon's database learns your shopping preferences and attempts to predict what you would like next.Two more concepts from the book worth sharing quickly here are Accessing and Tracking. Tracking sounds obvious, but Kelley isn't just talking about website cookies or Google & Apple recording your movements through your phone's GPS. By tracking, Kelly means that the door is open to quantifying every aspect of our lives. People can already use their phone's apps to track how much they walk per day, how well they asleep, and record their diets; they can already use phones to monitor their heartbeat; phones in the near future will be able to monitor blood pressure and blood sugar, as well. Cheap cameras and cloud storage mean that we can record more moments of our lives, and later poke through them at our leisure as if they were files in a drawer. The cloud is a key aspect of much of what Kelly covers, but it is especially prominent in the ""Accessing"" chapter, in which he writes that we're moving away from an ownership society. We no longer need to own a car; we just need access to one. Apps and tech allow us to share resources, and in some cases the resources are becoming so cheap that they can be offered for free: no one needs to struggle with an ersatz Office clone when they can use the freely available OfficeOnline.There are ten real concepts in total (there are two more chapters, ""questioning"" and ""becoming"", but they're less about content than thinking about our relationship with content), and the author purposely avoids mentioning any downsides. He takes it for granted that everything can be used to malicious purposes, but that would be another book entirely. (A book like Future Crimes II, perhaps...) I also liked the chapters on Interacting and Screening; one addressed the future mundane role of virtual reality and augmented reality, in that games and movies will become more ""real"", and our travels in the real world will have a digital overlay adding more information -- the ubiquity of screens dovetails with that rather nicely. One disturbing possibility Kelly mentions is having glasses or ocular implants with different apps installed; one can read people's faces and match them to a driver's license database. The other concepts in the book are extensions of minor things happening now, like remixing and filtering.As someone who can be both entranced and repelled by the promises of technological -- completely fascinated on a abstract level, distantly horrified at a human level -- I found The Inevitable enthralling reading. The author is sloppy with language, however, using ""socialism"" and ""collective"" when 'cooperative' would have been more accurate. For some reason he thinks libertarian individualism is contradicted by Wikipedia , when it's merely individuals voluntarily working together toward a common goal. Socialism makes me think more of involuntary mass actions, like taxes and slavery."

72,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69801085-lee-kuiper,3,"I’m a big fan of Kevin Kelly’s books but, honestly, this one was a little disappointing. It’s touted as his “most readable book” but I now take that to mean his “most prosaic book”; having traded big, complex ideas, rigorous research, depth and detail for a conventional summarization of current digital trends based on his experience and observation. Typically, Kelly’s books are expansive, mind-expanding, and overflowing with synthesized research but this felt like (what I imagine it’s like to read) a  For Dummies  manual. Perhaps Current Digital Cultural Trends For Dummies.  The heart seems to be lacking.After starting excitedly, I read through the whole thing rather listlessly. This book is a lot more mainstream than any of his other books. It has a broader appeal but for someone who already enjoys his niche books (such as myself) this is much more watered down and straightforward. It’s a good book for the unacquainted/anyone hoping to get a solid understanding of the general direction that technology in culture is heading. However, for people already immersed in conversations and ideas about technology and our immediate future, don’t expect too much new information.Despite, ostensibly, being about “the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future,” it talks more about current trends and then extrapolates those trends vaguely into the near future. The predictions are not very exciting, nor are they bold or very risky —just like predicting the winner of a game in the 4th quarter: its safe and usually quite accurate. Although there are occasional interesting insights, seldom was it very fascinating. And only at the very end did it feel “provocative.” That being said, any book by Kevin Kelly is worth reading. I’m being too hard on this book because his previous books set my expectations WAY too high. Also, I’m constantly reading and listening to books/podcasts about technology, the future, and culture so that most of the ideas here were old hat for me.Kelly is always quite optimistic about where things are heading which is refreshing especially since he has been so completely immersed in the constantly changing field of digital technology for the last 30+ years. He knows his stuff and if anyone is in a place to tell us what is going to be “inevitable” in the near future likely there is no one better than Kelly. I almost gave this book four stars because the last two chapters were quite good (especially the final chapter on “Beginning” which is only, unfortunately, 7 pages) but the truth is I was not enthralled for the vast majority of the 297 pages so, realistically, it’s a fair three stars. I do greatly recommend Kevin Kelly’s other books: What Technology Wants and Out of Control"

In his 2016 book, Kevin Kelly provides a detailed and optimistic guide through twelve technological innovations/imperatives that will shape the next three decades, ultimately further transforming our lives.Why Should You Read This Book?You should read this book if you are interested in better understanding what our lives will look like over the next thirty years. And you should absolutely read this book if you are interested in understanding where the business or industry you currently work in may be headed.It’s simply amazing that much of the technology needed to drive these transformative changes are already in motion today. And if only half of what Kevin Kelly says comes true, these forces will revolutionize the way we work, learn, buy, communicate, and generally live with each other.Final Thoughts:If you embrace the optimistic side of the transformative force that is all things technology, you will love this book. If you take a more pessimistic view of what technology might eventually do to us and our world in the future, you will probably not like this book. Personally, I embrace the prospects that today’s and tomorrow’s technology hold.

Obviosity - When starting to read: ""Well, duh!""3. Revelation - After reading for a while: ""Oh, shit - Yes! I can't believe I didn't see that one!""This might not make much sense, but to summarize I think this book is an amazing summary and ""prediction"" of what our world is currently moving towards.

A typical chapter provides a condensed history, a summary of the current situation replete with philosophical quips and staggering statistics, and caps off with a look at how the trend will change our lives in the future. I've read reviews that dismiss the book as pedestrian, and while I can understand hardcore tech geeks being disappointed with the offerings on hand, I still learned something in every chapter.Across all the trends covered, decentralization seems to be omnipresent. The author predicts much of the power we allocate to governments and corporations will inevitably be passed to the collective. While Kelly doesn't touch on the subject himself, I suspect this inexorability has corporations struggling to retain as much power as possible for as long as possible, giving way to phenomena such as the current endangerment of net neutrality.There were far too many thoughts, observations, musings and predictions to remember, but the one thing I could take from this book was Kelly's optimism about the future. This technology is going to make our lives better, not worse. As bad as things seem now with smartphone zombies and lethargic gamer kids, these trends are going to make the world a better place.**(reviewer's note) Unless of course climate change kills us all."

This book was a great insight into the possibilities of the near as well as not-to-distant future. The author thankfully avoided computer-speak so I easily understood all that he said.

90,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17367460-jim-angstadt,3,"The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our FutureKevin KellyThe author has been keeping track of technology developments for decades, and helping us understand just what changes are going on around us. In this book, he distills those changes into 12 forces that he thinks will change our world and us. He might be right. Most of his forecasts are reasonable projections of current trends. His ideas are thought provoking and worthy of attention; we can help shape the future rather than just let it happen.One minor nit. I sometimes wished the author was more direct. Don't build an elaborate construct around a simple idea. An economy of expression is better that too much.Notes while reading:===== IntroductionThe general trends are inevitable, not the specific details.===== 1. BecomingAs the pace of change increases, we are frequently/always learning something new or different. We are becoming a little different. New Operating Systems, devices, applications, opportunities, and the constant stream of updates for security, or bug fixes, or tracking, or privacy, compel us to keep learning, adapting.===== 2. CognifyingThe nature of thinking has changed with time. Memorization, spoken words, written words, science; now we have big data, algorithms, machine learning, search; new ways to understand ourselves and our context. What next? Well, maybe: cognified music, laundry, marketing, real estate, nursing, construction, ethics, toys, sports, ... chuckle, snarf, burp.Four categories for worker replacement:- Jobs that robots can do better then humans- Jobs that humans cannot do- Jobs we didn't know we wanted done- Jobs only humans can do - at first===== 3. FlowingWith old computers we had ""batch"" jobs; then daily tasks; now on-line, interactive, up-to-the-second. The flow has changed. So have the metaphores: desktops, folders, then web pages and links, now the flow of twitter, feeds, streaming video, and similar. We expect free, fast, and accurate.What is worth paying for?- Immediacy- Personalization- Interpretation- Authenticity- Accessibility- Embodiment- Patronage- Discoverability===== 4. ScreeningFrom hard-copy to screens, all around us, becoming more feature-full.===== 5. AccessingAccess replaces ownership. Dematerialization accelerates, and leads to more on-demand access. Decentralization, or flattening grows. Platforms enable more innovation and dematerialization but maybe centralize the underlying tech.===== 6. SharingNew, or at least in more use, are various forms of social interaction.- Sharing- Cooperation- Collaboration. eg: linux, 3D printer plans, ...- Collectivism. The power of the individual vs. the power of the state is not a zero sum game. Aim to ""maximize both the autonomy of the individual and the power of the people working together."" We want the government to be more ""open"". Organizations can be a hybrid of bottom-up and top-down. Let everybody be an editor. Wikipedia started as bottom-up and gradually added the top-down component, ie the senior editors.===== 7. FilteringWe simply cannot process everything. We must filter. Currently we can filter by gatekeepers, intermediates, curators, brands, government, culture, friends, and other methods. And it's getting harder. Recomendation systems help, but are not enough. Plus, we want just enough unusual, different inputs to keep us fresh.Our attention is a limiting factor. Should we be paid for our attention?===== 8. RemixingWe see plenty of examples of remix in every-day life: music, video, books, movies, and more. Some has a profit motive, some do not.===== 9. InteractingVirtual reality (VR) is now low cost, interactive, and provides a sense of being there, presence. We will be interacting with everything. Internet of Things, IoT.===== 10. TrackingSelf-tracking, first for fitness, later for lifestream. IoT will/could add more data. We can know ourselves better. When aggregated, we can know ""us"" much better. Medical studies could look at vastly more ""individuals"" that previous.Commercial and government tracking are another dimension. Data could come from: cars, highways, taxis, airlines and trains, drones, postal mail, utilities, phones, CCTV, smart homes, interactive devices, loyalty cards, IRS, credit cards, e-banking, photo recognition, and much more. Technological rather than social or cultural.Page 260. ""Ubiquitous surveillance is inevitable."" Shape the nature of tracking. More symmetrical or coveillance. ""... is there room for anonymity?"" Yes, but in very limited amounts. Eg: we need whistle-blowers.===== 11. QuestioningOur ability to get good quality answers to our questions leads to more questions. The nature of what is now possible leads to more questions. Answers are cheap, so ask away.===== 12. BeginningThe author says we are at the beginning of a new way of living. It might have been interesting to have the author contrast this time with other historic times, like the industrial revolution, or the invention of the printing press, or, much earlier, the ability to record our thoughts on paper, or its predecessors."

Even if Kevin Kelly is dead wrong on his predictions (which is highly unlikely), you can't help but imagine what it'd be like if he was right. I wonder what he thinks of dumb solar roadways. I was surprised not to hear anything about that in this book. But note to self: reread this book in 2050 to see if and how much he was right. Basically think of Ironman's world and that's a glimpse of what we'd have in a few decades. I like the concept of renting everything in the future. With the rise of AirBnb and Uber it is certainly heading that way. Also it will be helpful because we won't take as many things for granite like we do. For example, the paintings/pictures we have on our walls will be exchanged every month or year or so. It will teach us to live a Minimalist lifestyle (click on that link and read that 11 minute article by Mark Manson. It's pretty neat). Smart Shirts are going to be coolo. All of this is happening because of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think that technology is like a Deity. In fact, I think if I weren't a traditional believer and if I were perhaps agnostic I would, indeed, believe that technology is God and He's slowly revealing Himself to us until we can fully realize and comprehend it. Almost like Optimus Prime. And why not?This book reminded me a lot of the first part of the book I, Robot when they're on Mars.We're resistant to upgrades and updates for our devices but he points out that they're like hygiene for our tech. I hadn't thought of it that way. And like we learn in The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century there is a higher call for greater honesty in our world. Especially as things progress towards the Cloud and everything becomes searchable. Time to start cleaning up your act people. If you haven't already. Vanity trumps privacy after all."
94,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton,4,"There is a major irony in reading a book like this in physical form - when it is full of statements espousing the future, probably without too many physical books. Like most books that are making a projection about what will happen in the future, this will probably have a short shelf life. But for now I think it is one of the better attempts to make sense of the trends in technology and their implications. This should not be taken to mean I agree with everything Kelly writes, far from it. But he writes well, thoughtfully and in an engaging way. So, it is at least enjoyable to read. Futurists have a tendency to 2 extremes - those seeing only Utopia and those seeing only doom. Kelly is more inclined to the Utopian viewpoint, although with occasional sections on the challenges of getting there. I have no doubt, to steal Kelly's title that the future is inevitable. That's the easy part, the hard bit is working out which future it will be. Kelly paints a believable picture from a technological perspective, but I think underplays the challenges in getting there and the social implications. A lot of people are going to push back, possibly in fairly assertive ways, on the future he suggests. I suspect if you are the sort of person who is constantly reading about or engaged in technology this book will tell you nothing new - other than being a nice, condensed summary. On the other hand, if you are like me, someone who feels I ought to be interested in understanding the future but generally find much which is written dull and naive, you may enjoy this book somewhat more.

95,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"Veteran social commentator Kevin Kelly has written a new book about the future of technology that will be a primer for science fiction novelists going forward. Indeed, the title resonates with the final words of my own recent novel: “Destiny was inevitable now,” and the reason, as Kevin Kelly so carefully articulates, is that future trends have already been established! Proprietary AI systems already control what you see when you Google search, tailor what you view on Facebook, manipulate what you buy on Amazon, and make most of the money in the world. VR technology has now reached the tipping point necessary to create an interconnective virtual domain that will transform the primitive internet beyond our wildest dreams, and bring the price down to free. When corporate AI machines eventually converge and begin feeding on exponentially increasing global metadata, a new symbiotic holos will arise that will extend beyond human consciousness, (dubbed “mothership” in my sci-fi novel FREENET,) a tool that becomes an end in itself, and also the beginning. Kelly's twelve defining postulates may seem somewhat artificial, and perhaps overlap a bit, but his premises are solid and his inspiration undeniable. What I like most about Kelly's view is his optimism. He throws the reader into the future by reminding us that the net is just waking up now and learning to crawl. These are the glory days of youthful innovation that we will soon look back on with envy from a standing position. "

99,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"Kevin Kelly gives us a glimpse of the future organized around 12 technological trends that shape our world today, and obviously will shape the future. It is quite readable. To each trend he offers historical support to explain the idea, and in most cases offers a cautious, yet incredible, vision of where that might take us. In some chapters he gives us a vaguely disturbing vignette of how your day might go in the future. Both fantastic and credible at the same time.I really enjoyed this book. His method seems adequate, and he punctuates the explanations with relevant anecdotes. It introduced me to a few things happening now I was not aware of, and certainly feel more prepared to watch for these future trends. If you are in the position of needing to know where our culture is headed, you will find plenty of value in reading this book.My notes on the twelve trends:1. Becoming: We are all perpetual newbies. Things are changing continuously and automatically, and we can't anticipate the future, but the winner will be those who can adapt quickly. This is exactly the main point of Alvin Toffler's Future Shock written in 1970 -- strange he made no mention of it. (He starts with a common fallacy about thermodynamics, but it is unimportant to his thesis, see the details below.)2. Cognifying: ""The business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI."" AI is developing all around us, but not human intelligence but other KINDS of intelligence he calls alien intelligence. We might need to prevent consciousness to get the kind of intelligence we want. Many jobs will be replaced by robots, but humans will move into the job of training and running the robots. 3. Flowing: Digital tech copies everything it accesses, so the old ideas of purchase and ownership are going away. Spotify. Netflix. Instead 8 'generatives' that add value to a free stream: [1] immediacy: you get before others, [2] personalization: your copy is specialized, [3] interpretation: added meaning, [4] authenticity, yours is real and not just a copy, [5] accessibility: they organize it all for you, [6] embodiment: physically shared experience, [7] patronage: supporting the arts in new wasy, [8] discoverability (TV guide was worth more than the tv networks). There are four stages: (1) fixed rare things that get copied, (2) free ubiquitous availability (3) active sharing and services, (4) full engagement of flowing by all parties and co-creation.4. Screening: differences between book media, and screens as an interface to knowledge.5. Accessing: Uber is not about providing more cars, but easy access to cars and drivers that happen to be available at the moment. AirBnB. Why own anything? Why not just access what you need only when you need it?6. Sharing: (1) simple sharing moves to (2) cooperation toward common goals, to (3) collaboration which is organized and coordinated and finally to (4) collectivism: a self-organizing group of people who all receive benefit of their own initiative. Open source software projects are the best example. Not capitalist or communist but something new and different. Kickstart.7. Filtering: ""In a world of abundance, the only scarcity is human attention"" How to separate the wheat from the chafe? We might even be paid for our attention. 8. Remixing: mashups. fan fiction. Full blow video remixing, excerpting, referencing, etc need some inventions as we move into full video collectivism. Property and ownership problems. 9. Interacting: it is not just media, but two way communication as well. Second Life. VR interactions. Augmented reality. (1) we will have more sensors and senses, (2) hey will be increasingly intimate, (3) it will be increasingly immersive. And, yes, ""Goodreads"" was mentioned as an example.10. Tracking. Quantified self. Digital technology makes it cheap to record and then analyze. Surveillance is inevitable, but will the access be one-sided? Is coveillance possible? True anonymity always brings out the worst in people. ""Privacy can be gained only by trust, and trust requires persistent identity."" From tracking will come emergence of something new: ""There is no case in our experience where the difference of a factor of a trillion doesn't make a qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, difference."" 11. Questioning: Google and wikipedia answer 2 trillion questions every year, but something else: ""the impossible things happening now are in every case due to the emergence of a new level of organization that did not exist before."" We have more access to unusual things than ever before. Discoveries depend on asking ""good questions.""12. Beginning: we are becoming a planetary network of intelligence and artificial intelligence, he calls the ""holos."" What will become we can't even imagine. Today we have only the beginning.I can't let Kelly slip with a common misconception. He cites the 2nd law of thermodynamics, saying that it means that everything is flling apart slowly. This is NOT what the law says. The fallacy is thinking that there is a smooth distribution of the disorganization. Within a closed system, some parts will actually get MORE organized, while the overall net organization decreases. This is a nit that I have to pick because so many people make this same mistake. However, it is unimportant to Kelly's thesis in any way, so just a footnote here."
100,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"No one can say where exactly a ball thrown in the air will land, but at least on Earth it’s a certainty that a thrown ball will land. Kevin Kelly, formerly of Wired magazine, can’t say exactly what the future will look like, but he is confident enough to predict what trends will continue based on present technology. Our global civilizations have been radically transformed from the 1970s til now, but computers weren’t the catalyst for all the change we see around us. Networked computers were. By themselves, the first computers were house-sized calculators and overpriced filing cabinets; when they began exchanging information freely, magic happened. What world-changing wonders can we expect from the current trends in technology?First, says Kelly, is “becoming”: In the late eighties, Zygmunt Bauman introduced the term liquid modernity to our sociological lexicon. In previous generations, changes happened slowly enough that our societies were able to digest them and establish a new normal. As the 19th gave way to the 20th century, however, the rate of change has quickened to the point that a new normal is impossible: societiy is revolutionized multiple times within a single generation, with the effect that there is no stable ground to be had, no new normal to be reached. Now our products are no longer discrete products, but services that are continually being changed -- think of Office 365, or even Windows 10. Windows 10 is rumored to be the last Windows, not because Microsoft is retiring from the OS business, but because Windows 10's frequent updates constantly add new features that would have otherwise been developed and delivered in a new Windows. Our phones, too, are not merely the device that came out of the original box: as we add apps and accessories, we change their nature.The second big-ticket item in here is ""cognifying"", by which Kelly means using machine intelligence for everything. There won't be a master AI that controls every aspect of our lives, he says; instead, we''ll develop multiple machine intelligences for different suites of needs, and they''ll be utterly mundane -- and already are. When we execute a google search for recipes or ask it for directions, we are in fact helping train and benefit Google's machine-learning algorithisms: we are teaching them what we're most likely to be looking for. Those ""Related Products"" that Amazon helpfully shows you are also an early example of machine intelligence, as Amazon's database learns your shopping preferences and attempts to predict what you would like next.Two more concepts from the book worth sharing quickly here are Accessing and Tracking. Tracking sounds obvious, but Kelley isn't just talking about website cookies or Google & Apple recording your movements through your phone's GPS. By tracking, Kelly means that the door is open to quantifying every aspect of our lives. People can already use their phone's apps to track how much they walk per day, how well they asleep, and record their diets; they can already use phones to monitor their heartbeat; phones in the near future will be able to monitor blood pressure and blood sugar, as well. Cheap cameras and cloud storage mean that we can record more moments of our lives, and later poke through them at our leisure as if they were files in a drawer. The cloud is a key aspect of much of what Kelly covers, but it is especially prominent in the ""Accessing"" chapter, in which he writes that we're moving away from an ownership society. We no longer need to own a car; we just need access to one. Apps and tech allow us to share resources, and in some cases the resources are becoming so cheap that they can be offered for free: no one needs to struggle with an ersatz Office clone when they can use the freely available OfficeOnline.There are ten real concepts in total (there are two more chapters, ""questioning"" and ""becoming"", but they're less about content than thinking about our relationship with content), and the author purposely avoids mentioning any downsides. He takes it for granted that everything can be used to malicious purposes, but that would be another book entirely. (A book like Future Crimes II, perhaps...) I also liked the chapters on Interacting and Screening; one addressed the future mundane role of virtual reality and augmented reality, in that games and movies will become more ""real"", and our travels in the real world will have a digital overlay adding more information -- the ubiquity of screens dovetails with that rather nicely. One disturbing possibility Kelly mentions is having glasses or ocular implants with different apps installed; one can read people's faces and match them to a driver's license database. The other concepts in the book are extensions of minor things happening now, like remixing and filtering.As someone who can be both entranced and repelled by the promises of technological -- completely fascinated on a abstract level, distantly horrified at a human level -- I found The Inevitable enthralling reading. The author is sloppy with language, however, using ""socialism"" and ""collective"" when 'cooperative' would have been more accurate. For some reason he thinks libertarian individualism is contradicted by Wikipedia , when it's merely individuals voluntarily working together toward a common goal. Socialism makes me think more of involuntary mass actions, like taxes and slavery."

102,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69801085-lee-kuiper,3,"I’m a big fan of Kevin Kelly’s books but, honestly, this one was a little disappointing. It’s touted as his “most readable book” but I now take that to mean his “most prosaic book”; having traded big, complex ideas, rigorous research, depth and detail for a conventional summarization of current digital trends based on his experience and observation. Typically, Kelly’s books are expansive, mind-expanding, and overflowing with synthesized research but this felt like (what I imagine it’s like to read) a  For Dummies  manual. Perhaps Current Digital Cultural Trends For Dummies.  The heart seems to be lacking.After starting excitedly, I read through the whole thing rather listlessly. This book is a lot more mainstream than any of his other books. It has a broader appeal but for someone who already enjoys his niche books (such as myself) this is much more watered down and straightforward. It’s a good book for the unacquainted/anyone hoping to get a solid understanding of the general direction that technology in culture is heading. However, for people already immersed in conversations and ideas about technology and our immediate future, don’t expect too much new information.Despite, ostensibly, being about “the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future,” it talks more about current trends and then extrapolates those trends vaguely into the near future. The predictions are not very exciting, nor are they bold or very risky —just like predicting the winner of a game in the 4th quarter: its safe and usually quite accurate. Although there are occasional interesting insights, seldom was it very fascinating. And only at the very end did it feel “provocative.” That being said, any book by Kevin Kelly is worth reading. I’m being too hard on this book because his previous books set my expectations WAY too high. Also, I’m constantly reading and listening to books/podcasts about technology, the future, and culture so that most of the ideas here were old hat for me.Kelly is always quite optimistic about where things are heading which is refreshing especially since he has been so completely immersed in the constantly changing field of digital technology for the last 30+ years. He knows his stuff and if anyone is in a place to tell us what is going to be “inevitable” in the near future likely there is no one better than Kelly. I almost gave this book four stars because the last two chapters were quite good (especially the final chapter on “Beginning” which is only, unfortunately, 7 pages) but the truth is I was not enthralled for the vast majority of the 297 pages so, realistically, it’s a fair three stars. I do greatly recommend Kevin Kelly’s other books: What Technology Wants and Out of Control"

In his 2016 book, Kevin Kelly provides a detailed and optimistic guide through twelve technological innovations/imperatives that will shape the next three decades, ultimately further transforming our lives.Why Should You Read This Book?You should read this book if you are interested in better understanding what our lives will look like over the next thirty years. And you should absolutely read this book if you are interested in understanding where the business or industry you currently work in may be headed.It’s simply amazing that much of the technology needed to drive these transformative changes are already in motion today. And if only half of what Kevin Kelly says comes true, these forces will revolutionize the way we work, learn, buy, communicate, and generally live with each other.Final Thoughts:If you embrace the optimistic side of the transformative force that is all things technology, you will love this book. If you take a more pessimistic view of what technology might eventually do to us and our world in the future, you will probably not like this book. Personally, I embrace the prospects that today’s and tomorrow’s technology hold.

This AI to be trained on human data and interactions with the holos, through search data, total surveillance data, consumer preference data and the 100s of times we are logged daily. Just as the nature of the internet made Napster and Facebook inevitable, so too does it make infinite remixing and the holos inevitable.

For the innovator, the curious and the skeptic. I went through three phases reading this book:1. Skepticism - Before starting to read: ""What kind of bullshit is this?""2. Obviosity - When starting to read: ""Well, duh!""3. Revelation - After reading for a while: ""Oh, shit - Yes! I can't believe I didn't see that one!""This might not make much sense, but to summarize I think this book is an amazing summary and ""prediction"" of what our world is currently moving towards. It describes not too much of specific technologies, but general principles and ""forces"" that are currently in motion (beneath current technological advances)."

A typical chapter provides a condensed history, a summary of the current situation replete with philosophical quips and staggering statistics, and caps off with a look at how the trend will change our lives in the future. I've read reviews that dismiss the book as pedestrian, and while I can understand hardcore tech geeks being disappointed with the offerings on hand, I still learned something in every chapter.Across all the trends covered, decentralization seems to be omnipresent. The author predicts much of the power we allocate to governments and corporations will inevitably be passed to the collective. While Kelly doesn't touch on the subject himself, I suspect this inexorability has corporations struggling to retain as much power as possible for as long as possible, giving way to phenomena such as the current endangerment of net neutrality.There were far too many thoughts, observations, musings and predictions to remember, but the one thing I could take from this book was Kelly's optimism about the future. This technology is going to make our lives better, not worse. As bad as things seem now with smartphone zombies and lethargic gamer kids, these trends are going to make the world a better place.**(reviewer's note) Unless of course climate change kills us all."

This book was a great insight into the possibilities of the near as well as not-to-distant future. The author thankfully avoided computer-speak so I easily understood all that he said.

In this book, he distills those changes into 12 forces that he thinks will change our world and us. He might be right. Most of his forecasts are reasonable projections of current trends. His ideas are thought provoking and worthy of attention; we can help shape the future rather than just let it happen.One minor nit. I sometimes wished the author was more direct. Don't build an elaborate construct around a simple idea. An economy of expression is better that too much.Notes while reading:===== IntroductionThe general trends are inevitable, not the specific details.===== 1. BecomingAs the pace of change increases, we are frequently/always learning something new or different. We are becoming a little different. New Operating Systems, devices, applications, opportunities, and the constant stream of updates for security, or bug fixes, or tracking, or privacy, compel us to keep learning, adapting.===== 2. CognifyingThe nature of thinking has changed with time. Memorization, spoken words, written words, science; now we have big data, algorithms, machine learning, search; new ways to understand ourselves and our context. What next? Well, maybe: cognified music, laundry, marketing, real estate, nursing, construction, ethics, toys, sports, ... chuckle, snarf, burp.Four categories for worker replacement:- Jobs that robots can do better then humans- Jobs that humans cannot do- Jobs we didn't know we wanted done- Jobs only humans can do - at first===== 3. FlowingWith old computers we had ""batch"" jobs; then daily tasks; now on-line, interactive, up-to-the-second. The flow has changed. So have the metaphores: desktops, folders, then web pages and links, now the flow of twitter, feeds, streaming video, and similar. We expect free, fast, and accurate.What is worth paying for?- Immediacy- Personalization- Interpretation- Authenticity- Accessibility- Embodiment- Patronage- Discoverability===== 4. ScreeningFrom hard-copy to screens, all around us, becoming more feature-full.===== 5. AccessingAccess replaces ownership. Dematerialization accelerates, and leads to more on-demand access. Decentralization, or flattening grows. Platforms enable more innovation and dematerialization but maybe centralize the underlying tech.===== 6. SharingNew, or at least in more use, are various forms of social interaction.- Sharing- Cooperation- Collaboration. eg: linux, 3D printer plans, ...- Collectivism. The power of the individual vs. the power of the state is not a zero sum game. Aim to ""maximize both the autonomy of the individual and the power of the people working together."" We want the government to be more ""open"". Organizations can be a hybrid of bottom-up and top-down. Let everybody be an editor. Wikipedia started as bottom-up and gradually added the top-down component, ie the senior editors.===== 7. FilteringWe simply cannot process everything. We must filter. Currently we can filter by gatekeepers, intermediates, curators, brands, government, culture, friends, and other methods. And it's getting harder. Recomendation systems help, but are not enough. Plus, we want just enough unusual, different inputs to keep us fresh.Our attention is a limiting factor. Should we be paid for our attention?===== 8. RemixingWe see plenty of examples of remix in every-day life: music, video, books, movies, and more. Some has a profit motive, some do not.===== 9. InteractingVirtual reality (VR) is now low cost, interactive, and provides a sense of being there, presence. We will be interacting with everything. Internet of Things, IoT.===== 10. TrackingSelf-tracking, first for fitness, later for lifestream. IoT will/could add more data. We can know ourselves better. When aggregated, we can know ""us"" much better. Medical studies could look at vastly more ""individuals"" that previous.Commercial and government tracking are another dimension. Data could come from: cars, highways, taxis, airlines and trains, drones, postal mail, utilities, phones, CCTV, smart homes, interactive devices, loyalty cards, IRS, credit cards, e-banking, photo recognition, and much more. Technological rather than social or cultural.Page 260. ""Ubiquitous surveillance is inevitable."" Shape the nature of tracking. More symmetrical or coveillance. ""... is there room for anonymity?"" Yes, but in very limited amounts. Eg: we need whistle-blowers.===== 11. QuestioningOur ability to get good quality answers to our questions leads to more questions. The nature of what is now possible leads to more questions. Answers are cheap, so ask away.===== 12. BeginningThe author says we are at the beginning of a new way of living. It might have been interesting to have the author contrast this time with other historic times, like the industrial revolution, or the invention of the printing press, or, much earlier, the ability to record our thoughts on paper, or its predecessors."

Even if Kevin Kelly is dead wrong on his predictions (which is highly unlikely), you can't help but imagine what it'd be like if he was right. I wonder what he thinks of dumb solar roadways. I was surprised not to hear anything about that in this book. But note to self: reread this book in 2050 to see if and how much he was right. Basically think of Ironman's world and that's a glimpse of what we'd have in a few decades. I like the concept of renting everything in the future. With the rise of AirBnb and Uber it is certainly heading that way. Also it will be helpful because we won't take as many things for granite like we do. For example, the paintings/pictures we have on our walls will be exchanged every month or year or so. It will teach us to live a Minimalist lifestyle (click on that link and read that 11 minute article by Mark Manson. It's pretty neat). Smart Shirts are going to be coolo. All of this is happening because of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think that technology is like a Deity. In fact, I think if I weren't a traditional believer and if I were perhaps agnostic I would, indeed, believe that technology is God and He's slowly revealing Himself to us until we can fully realize and comprehend it. Almost like Optimus Prime. And why not?This book reminded me a lot of the first part of the book I, Robot when they're on Mars.We're resistant to upgrades and updates for our devices but he points out that they're like hygiene for our tech. I hadn't thought of it that way. And like we learn in The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century there is a higher call for greater honesty in our world. Especially as things progress towards the Cloud and everything becomes searchable. Time to start cleaning up your act people. If you haven't already. Vanity trumps privacy after all."
124,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton,4,"There is a major irony in reading a book like this in physical form - when it is full of statements espousing the future, probably without too many physical books. Like most books that are making a projection about what will happen in the future, this will probably have a short shelf life. But for now I think it is one of the better attempts to make sense of the trends in technology and their implications. This should not be taken to mean I agree with everything Kelly writes, far from it. But he writes well, thoughtfully and in an engaging way. So, it is at least enjoyable to read. Futurists have a tendency to 2 extremes - those seeing only Utopia and those seeing only doom. Kelly is more inclined to the Utopian viewpoint, although with occasional sections on the challenges of getting there. I have no doubt, to steal Kelly's title that the future is inevitable. That's the easy part, the hard bit is working out which future it will be. Kelly paints a believable picture from a technological perspective, but I think underplays the challenges in getting there and the social implications. A lot of people are going to push back, possibly in fairly assertive ways, on the future he suggests. I suspect if you are the sort of person who is constantly reading about or engaged in technology this book will tell you nothing new - other than being a nice, condensed summary. On the other hand, if you are like me, someone who feels I ought to be interested in understanding the future but generally find much which is written dull and naive, you may enjoy this book somewhat more. "
125,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"Veteran social commentator Kevin Kelly has written a new book about the future of technology that will be a primer for science fiction novelists going forward. Indeed, the title resonates with the final words of my own recent novel: “Destiny was inevitable now,” and the reason, as Kevin Kelly so carefully articulates, is that future trends have already been established! Proprietary AI systems already control what you see when you Google search, tailor what you view on Facebook, manipulate what you buy on Amazon, and make most of the money in the world. VR technology has now reached the tipping point necessary to create an interconnective virtual domain that will transform the primitive internet beyond our wildest dreams, and bring the price down to free. When corporate AI machines eventually converge and begin feeding on exponentially increasing global metadata, a new symbiotic holos will arise that will extend beyond human consciousness, (dubbed “mothership” in my sci-fi novel FREENET,) a tool that becomes an end in itself, and also the beginning. Kelly's twelve defining postulates may seem somewhat artificial, and perhaps overlap a bit, but his premises are solid and his inspiration undeniable. What I like most about Kelly's view is his optimism. He throws the reader into the future by reminding us that the net is just waking up now and learning to crawl. These are the glory days of youthful innovation that we will soon look back on with envy from a standing position. "

The time when the whole world, humans and machines, becomes one and connected. The time where general AI emerges. The time when machines will take most of our jobs, and we will prolong our lifespans perhaps ad infinitum. The time when more than ever, we will have to rethink: what we humans are. It is all happening now. You should be so excited to be alive!---The book discusses the major trends of this Beginning: end of privacy?

Because it was both validating (I mean even by writing a Goodreads review I AM being the future) and challenging (I'm not ready for my AI overlords just yet). And reminded me of why I have a secret love of spec fic. And more than once I thought about my boy Joaquin in the excellent movie Her.On the other hand negative stars because, frankly, there is nothing about Kevin Kelly that seems woke and the back of the book was all testimonials fromWhite Men congratulating themselves basically. PASS THE BUCKET. Also Kevin Kelly was one time asked to help Steven Spielberg imagine the future for the average movie minority report and he mentions it in numerous chapters. So I guess even futurists can't get over their past glory days, ahe?"
128,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11001411-james-bender,4,"I love Kevin Kelly and have read all of his books. This one is an extrapolation of current trends and has a lot of interesting speculations and predictions. But like Yogi Berra said, ""it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future"". Or Jenny Holzer's Truism: ""The future is stupid"". Things may be veering more in the direction of the movie Idiocracy. With the current political situation it's probably worth rewatching as a counterpoint to The Inevitable. "
129,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"Kevin Kelly gives us a glimpse of the future organized around 12 technological trends that shape our world today, and obviously will shape the future. It is quite readable. To each trend he offers historical support to explain the idea, and in most cases offers a cautious, yet incredible, vision of where that might take us. In some chapters he gives us a vaguely disturbing vignette of how your day might go in the future. Both fantastic and credible at the same time.I really enjoyed this book. His method seems adequate, and he punctuates the explanations with relevant anecdotes. It introduced me to a few things happening now I was not aware of, and certainly feel more prepared to watch for these future trends. If you are in the position of needing to know where our culture is headed, you will find plenty of value in reading this book.My notes on the twelve trends:1. Becoming: We are all perpetual newbies. Things are changing continuously and automatically, and we can't anticipate the future, but the winner will be those who can adapt quickly. This is exactly the main point of Alvin Toffler's Future Shock written in 1970 -- strange he made no mention of it. (He starts with a common fallacy about thermodynamics, but it is unimportant to his thesis, see the details below.)2. Cognifying: ""The business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI."" AI is developing all around us, but not human intelligence but other KINDS of intelligence he calls alien intelligence. We might need to prevent consciousness to get the kind of intelligence we want. Many jobs will be replaced by robots, but humans will move into the job of training and running the robots. 3. Flowing: Digital tech copies everything it accesses, so the old ideas of purchase and ownership are going away. Spotify. Netflix. Instead 8 'generatives' that add value to a free stream: [1] immediacy: you get before others, [2] personalization: your copy is specialized, [3] interpretation: added meaning, [4] authenticity, yours is real and not just a copy, [5] accessibility: they organize it all for you, [6] embodiment: physically shared experience, [7] patronage: supporting the arts in new wasy, [8] discoverability (TV guide was worth more than the tv networks). There are four stages: (1) fixed rare things that get copied, (2) free ubiquitous availability (3) active sharing and services, (4) full engagement of flowing by all parties and co-creation.4. Screening: differences between book media, and screens as an interface to knowledge.5. Accessing: Uber is not about providing more cars, but easy access to cars and drivers that happen to be available at the moment. AirBnB. Why own anything? Why not just access what you need only when you need it?6. Sharing: (1) simple sharing moves to (2) cooperation toward common goals, to (3) collaboration which is organized and coordinated and finally to (4) collectivism: a self-organizing group of people who all receive benefit of their own initiative. Open source software projects are the best example. Not capitalist or communist but something new and different. Kickstart.7. Filtering: ""In a world of abundance, the only scarcity is human attention"" How to separate the wheat from the chafe? We might even be paid for our attention. 8. Remixing: mashups. fan fiction. Full blow video remixing, excerpting, referencing, etc need some inventions as we move into full video collectivism. Property and ownership problems. 9. Interacting: it is not just media, but two way communication as well. Second Life. VR interactions. Augmented reality. (1) we will have more sensors and senses, (2) hey will be increasingly intimate, (3) it will be increasingly immersive. And, yes, ""Goodreads"" was mentioned as an example.10. Tracking. Quantified self. Digital technology makes it cheap to record and then analyze. Surveillance is inevitable, but will the access be one-sided? Is coveillance possible? True anonymity always brings out the worst in people. ""Privacy can be gained only by trust, and trust requires persistent identity."" From tracking will come emergence of something new: ""There is no case in our experience where the difference of a factor of a trillion doesn't make a qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, difference."" 11. Questioning: Google and wikipedia answer 2 trillion questions every year, but something else: ""the impossible things happening now are in every case due to the emergence of a new level of organization that did not exist before."" We have more access to unusual things than ever before. Discoveries depend on asking ""good questions.""12. Beginning: we are becoming a planetary network of intelligence and artificial intelligence, he calls the ""holos."" What will become we can't even imagine. Today we have only the beginning.I can't let Kelly slip with a common misconception. He cites the 2nd law of thermodynamics, saying that it means that everything is flling apart slowly. This is NOT what the law says. The fallacy is thinking that there is a smooth distribution of the disorganization. Within a closed system, some parts will actually get MORE organized, while the overall net organization decreases. This is a nit that I have to pick because so many people make this same mistake. However, it is unimportant to Kelly's thesis in any way, so just a footnote here."
130,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"No one can say where exactly a ball thrown in the air will land, but at least on Earth it’s a certainty that a thrown ball will land. Kevin Kelly, formerly of Wired magazine, can’t say exactly what the future will look like, but he is confident enough to predict what trends will continue based on present technology. Our global civilizations have been radically transformed from the 1970s til now, but computers weren’t the catalyst for all the change we see around us. Networked computers were. By themselves, the first computers were house-sized calculators and overpriced filing cabinets; when they began exchanging information freely, magic happened. What world-changing wonders can we expect from the current trends in technology?First, says Kelly, is “becoming”: In the late eighties, Zygmunt Bauman introduced the term liquid modernity to our sociological lexicon. In previous generations, changes happened slowly enough that our societies were able to digest them and establish a new normal. As the 19th gave way to the 20th century, however, the rate of change has quickened to the point that a new normal is impossible: societiy is revolutionized multiple times within a single generation, with the effect that there is no stable ground to be had, no new normal to be reached. Now our products are no longer discrete products, but services that are continually being changed -- think of Office 365, or even Windows 10. Windows 10 is rumored to be the last Windows, not because Microsoft is retiring from the OS business, but because Windows 10's frequent updates constantly add new features that would have otherwise been developed and delivered in a new Windows. Our phones, too, are not merely the device that came out of the original box: as we add apps and accessories, we change their nature.The second big-ticket item in here is ""cognifying"", by which Kelly means using machine intelligence for everything. There won't be a master AI that controls every aspect of our lives, he says; instead, we''ll develop multiple machine intelligences for different suites of needs, and they''ll be utterly mundane -- and already are. When we execute a google search for recipes or ask it for directions, we are in fact helping train and benefit Google's machine-learning algorithisms: we are teaching them what we're most likely to be looking for. Those ""Related Products"" that Amazon helpfully shows you are also an early example of machine intelligence, as Amazon's database learns your shopping preferences and attempts to predict what you would like next.Two more concepts from the book worth sharing quickly here are Accessing and Tracking. Tracking sounds obvious, but Kelley isn't just talking about website cookies or Google & Apple recording your movements through your phone's GPS. By tracking, Kelly means that the door is open to quantifying every aspect of our lives. People can already use their phone's apps to track how much they walk per day, how well they asleep, and record their diets; they can already use phones to monitor their heartbeat; phones in the near future will be able to monitor blood pressure and blood sugar, as well. Cheap cameras and cloud storage mean that we can record more moments of our lives, and later poke through them at our leisure as if they were files in a drawer. The cloud is a key aspect of much of what Kelly covers, but it is especially prominent in the ""Accessing"" chapter, in which he writes that we're moving away from an ownership society. We no longer need to own a car; we just need access to one. Apps and tech allow us to share resources, and in some cases the resources are becoming so cheap that they can be offered for free: no one needs to struggle with an ersatz Office clone when they can use the freely available OfficeOnline.There are ten real concepts in total (there are two more chapters, ""questioning"" and ""becoming"", but they're less about content than thinking about our relationship with content), and the author purposely avoids mentioning any downsides. He takes it for granted that everything can be used to malicious purposes, but that would be another book entirely. (A book like Future Crimes II, perhaps...) I also liked the chapters on Interacting and Screening; one addressed the future mundane role of virtual reality and augmented reality, in that games and movies will become more ""real"", and our travels in the real world will have a digital overlay adding more information -- the ubiquity of screens dovetails with that rather nicely. One disturbing possibility Kelly mentions is having glasses or ocular implants with different apps installed; one can read people's faces and match them to a driver's license database. The other concepts in the book are extensions of minor things happening now, like remixing and filtering.As someone who can be both entranced and repelled by the promises of technological -- completely fascinated on a abstract level, distantly horrified at a human level -- I found The Inevitable enthralling reading. The author is sloppy with language, however, using ""socialism"" and ""collective"" when 'cooperative' would have been more accurate. For some reason he thinks libertarian individualism is contradicted by Wikipedia , when it's merely individuals voluntarily working together toward a common goal. Socialism makes me think more of involuntary mass actions, like taxes and slavery."

132,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69801085-lee-kuiper,3,"I’m a big fan of Kevin Kelly’s books but, honestly, this one was a little disappointing. It’s touted as his “most readable book” but I now take that to mean his “most prosaic book”; having traded big, complex ideas, rigorous research, depth and detail for a conventional summarization of current digital trends based on his experience and observation. Typically, Kelly’s books are expansive, mind-expanding, and overflowing with synthesized research but this felt like (what I imagine it’s like to read) a  For Dummies  manual. Perhaps Current Digital Cultural Trends For Dummies.  The heart seems to be lacking.After starting excitedly, I read through the whole thing rather listlessly. This book is a lot more mainstream than any of his other books. It has a broader appeal but for someone who already enjoys his niche books (such as myself) this is much more watered down and straightforward. It’s a good book for the unacquainted/anyone hoping to get a solid understanding of the general direction that technology in culture is heading. However, for people already immersed in conversations and ideas about technology and our immediate future, don’t expect too much new information.Despite, ostensibly, being about “the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future,” it talks more about current trends and then extrapolates those trends vaguely into the near future. The predictions are not very exciting, nor are they bold or very risky —just like predicting the winner of a game in the 4th quarter: its safe and usually quite accurate. Although there are occasional interesting insights, seldom was it very fascinating. And only at the very end did it feel “provocative.” That being said, any book by Kevin Kelly is worth reading. I’m being too hard on this book because his previous books set my expectations WAY too high. Also, I’m constantly reading and listening to books/podcasts about technology, the future, and culture so that most of the ideas here were old hat for me.Kelly is always quite optimistic about where things are heading which is refreshing especially since he has been so completely immersed in the constantly changing field of digital technology for the last 30+ years. He knows his stuff and if anyone is in a place to tell us what is going to be “inevitable” in the near future likely there is no one better than Kelly. I almost gave this book four stars because the last two chapters were quite good (especially the final chapter on “Beginning” which is only, unfortunately, 7 pages) but the truth is I was not enthralled for the vast majority of the 297 pages so, realistically, it’s a fair three stars. I do greatly recommend Kevin Kelly’s other books: What Technology Wants and Out of Control"

And you should absolutely read this book if you are interested in understanding where the business or industry you currently work in may be headed.It’s simply amazing that much of the technology needed to drive these transformative changes are already in motion today. And if only half of what Kevin Kelly says comes true, these forces will revolutionize the way we work, learn, buy, communicate, and generally live with each other.Final Thoughts:If you embrace the optimistic side of the transformative force that is all things technology, you will love this book. If you take a more pessimistic view of what technology might eventually do to us and our world in the future, you will probably not like this book.

Obviosity - When starting to read: ""Well, duh!""3. Revelation - After reading for a while: ""Oh, shit - Yes! I can't believe I didn't see that one!""This might not make much sense, but to summarize I think this book is an amazing summary and ""prediction"" of what our world is currently moving towards.

A typical chapter provides a condensed history, a summary of the current situation replete with philosophical quips and staggering statistics, and caps off with a look at how the trend will change our lives in the future. I've read reviews that dismiss the book as pedestrian, and while I can understand hardcore tech geeks being disappointed with the offerings on hand, I still learned something in every chapter.Across all the trends covered, decentralization seems to be omnipresent. The author predicts much of the power we allocate to governments and corporations will inevitably be passed to the collective. While Kelly doesn't touch on the subject himself, I suspect this inexorability has corporations struggling to retain as much power as possible for as long as possible, giving way to phenomena such as the current endangerment of net neutrality.There were far too many thoughts, observations, musings and predictions to remember, but the one thing I could take from this book was Kelly's optimism about the future. This technology is going to make our lives better, not worse.

In this book, he distills those changes into 12 forces that he thinks will change our world and us. He might be right. Most of his forecasts are reasonable projections of current trends. His ideas are thought provoking and worthy of attention; we can help shape the future rather than just let it happen.One minor nit. I sometimes wished the author was more direct. Don't build an elaborate construct around a simple idea. An economy of expression is better that too much.Notes while reading:===== IntroductionThe general trends are inevitable, not the specific details.===== 1. BecomingAs the pace of change increases, we are frequently/always learning something new or different. We are becoming a little different. New Operating Systems, devices, applications, opportunities, and the constant stream of updates for security, or bug fixes, or tracking, or privacy, compel us to keep learning, adapting.===== 2. CognifyingThe nature of thinking has changed with time. Memorization, spoken words, written words, science; now we have big data, algorithms, machine learning, search; new ways to understand ourselves and our context. What next? Well, maybe: cognified music, laundry, marketing, real estate, nursing, construction, ethics, toys, sports, ... chuckle, snarf, burp.Four categories for worker replacement:- Jobs that robots can do better then humans- Jobs that humans cannot do- Jobs we didn't know we wanted done- Jobs only humans can do - at first===== 3. FlowingWith old computers we had ""batch"" jobs; then daily tasks; now on-line, interactive, up-to-the-second. The flow has changed. So have the metaphores: desktops, folders, then web pages and links, now the flow of twitter, feeds, streaming video, and similar. We expect free, fast, and accurate.What is worth paying for?- Immediacy- Personalization- Interpretation- Authenticity- Accessibility- Embodiment- Patronage- Discoverability===== 4. ScreeningFrom hard-copy to screens, all around us, becoming more feature-full.===== 5. AccessingAccess replaces ownership. Dematerialization accelerates, and leads to more on-demand access. Decentralization, or flattening grows. Platforms enable more innovation and dematerialization but maybe centralize the underlying tech.===== 6. SharingNew, or at least in more use, are various forms of social interaction.- Sharing- Cooperation- Collaboration. eg: linux, 3D printer plans, ...- Collectivism. The power of the individual vs. the power of the state is not a zero sum game. Aim to ""maximize both the autonomy of the individual and the power of the people working together."" We want the government to be more ""open"". Organizations can be a hybrid of bottom-up and top-down. Let everybody be an editor. Wikipedia started as bottom-up and gradually added the top-down component, ie the senior editors.===== 7. FilteringWe simply cannot process everything. We must filter. Currently we can filter by gatekeepers, intermediates, curators, brands, government, culture, friends, and other methods. And it's getting harder. Recomendation systems help, but are not enough. Plus, we want just enough unusual, different inputs to keep us fresh.Our attention is a limiting factor. Should we be paid for our attention?===== 8. RemixingWe see plenty of examples of remix in every-day life: music, video, books, movies, and more. Some has a profit motive, some do not.===== 9. InteractingVirtual reality (VR) is now low cost, interactive, and provides a sense of being there, presence. We will be interacting with everything. Internet of Things, IoT.===== 10. TrackingSelf-tracking, first for fitness, later for lifestream. IoT will/could add more data. We can know ourselves better. When aggregated, we can know ""us"" much better. Medical studies could look at vastly more ""individuals"" that previous.Commercial and government tracking are another dimension. Data could come from: cars, highways, taxis, airlines and trains, drones, postal mail, utilities, phones, CCTV, smart homes, interactive devices, loyalty cards, IRS, credit cards, e-banking, photo recognition, and much more. Technological rather than social or cultural.Page 260. ""Ubiquitous surveillance is inevitable."" Shape the nature of tracking. More symmetrical or coveillance. ""... is there room for anonymity?"" Yes, but in very limited amounts. Eg: we need whistle-blowers.===== 11. QuestioningOur ability to get good quality answers to our questions leads to more questions. The nature of what is now possible leads to more questions. Answers are cheap, so ask away.===== 12. BeginningThe author says we are at the beginning of a new way of living. It might have been interesting to have the author contrast this time with other historic times, like the industrial revolution, or the invention of the printing press, or, much earlier, the ability to record our thoughts on paper, or its predecessors."

153,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,4,"I don't know how I found this book but it was exciting to read. I think my brother would enjoy it. Even if Kevin Kelly is dead wrong on his predictions (which is highly unlikely), you can't help but imagine what it'd be like if he was right. I wonder what he thinks of dumb solar roadways. I was surprised not to hear anything about that in this book. But note to self: reread this book in 2050 to see if and how much he was right. Basically think of Ironman's world and that's a glimpse of what we'd have in a few decades. I like the concept of renting everything in the future. With the rise of AirBnb and Uber it is certainly heading that way. Also it will be helpful because we won't take as many things for granite like we do. For example, the paintings/pictures we have on our walls will be exchanged every month or year or so. It will teach us to live a Minimalist lifestyle (click on that link and read that 11 minute article by Mark Manson. It's pretty neat). Smart Shirts are going to be coolo. All of this is happening because of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think that technology is like a Deity. In fact, I think if I weren't a traditional believer and if I were perhaps agnostic I would, indeed, believe that technology is God and He's slowly revealing Himself to us until we can fully realize and comprehend it. Almost like Optimus Prime. And why not?This book reminded me a lot of the first part of the book I, Robot when they're on Mars.We're resistant to upgrades and updates for our devices but he points out that they're like hygiene for our tech. I hadn't thought of it that way. And like we learn in The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century there is a higher call for greater honesty in our world. Especially as things progress towards the Cloud and everything becomes searchable. Time to start cleaning up your act people. If you haven't already. Vanity trumps privacy after all."
154,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton,4,"There is a major irony in reading a book like this in physical form - when it is full of statements espousing the future, probably without too many physical books. Like most books that are making a projection about what will happen in the future, this will probably have a short shelf life. But for now I think it is one of the better attempts to make sense of the trends in technology and their implications. This should not be taken to mean I agree with everything Kelly writes, far from it. But he writes well, thoughtfully and in an engaging way. So, it is at least enjoyable to read. Futurists have a tendency to 2 extremes - those seeing only Utopia and those seeing only doom. Kelly is more inclined to the Utopian viewpoint, although with occasional sections on the challenges of getting there. I have no doubt, to steal Kelly's title that the future is inevitable. That's the easy part, the hard bit is working out which future it will be. Kelly paints a believable picture from a technological perspective, but I think underplays the challenges in getting there and the social implications. A lot of people are going to push back, possibly in fairly assertive ways, on the future he suggests. I suspect if you are the sort of person who is constantly reading about or engaged in technology this book will tell you nothing new - other than being a nice, condensed summary. On the other hand, if you are like me, someone who feels I ought to be interested in understanding the future but generally find much which is written dull and naive, you may enjoy this book somewhat more. "
155,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"Veteran social commentator Kevin Kelly has written a new book about the future of technology that will be a primer for science fiction novelists going forward. Indeed, the title resonates with the final words of my own recent novel: “Destiny was inevitable now,” and the reason, as Kevin Kelly so carefully articulates, is that future trends have already been established! Proprietary AI systems already control what you see when you Google search, tailor what you view on Facebook, manipulate what you buy on Amazon, and make most of the money in the world. VR technology has now reached the tipping point necessary to create an interconnective virtual domain that will transform the primitive internet beyond our wildest dreams, and bring the price down to free. When corporate AI machines eventually converge and begin feeding on exponentially increasing global metadata, a new symbiotic holos will arise that will extend beyond human consciousness, (dubbed “mothership” in my sci-fi novel FREENET,) a tool that becomes an end in itself, and also the beginning. Kelly's twelve defining postulates may seem somewhat artificial, and perhaps overlap a bit, but his premises are solid and his inspiration undeniable. What I like most about Kelly's view is his optimism. He throws the reader into the future by reminding us that the net is just waking up now and learning to crawl. These are the glory days of youthful innovation that we will soon look back on with envy from a standing position. "

It is all happening now. You should be so excited to be alive!---The book discusses the major trends of this Beginning: end of privacy?

And reminded me of why I have a secret love of spec fic. And more than once I thought about my boy Joaquin in the excellent movie Her.On the other hand negative stars because, frankly, there is nothing about Kevin Kelly that seems woke and the back of the book was all testimonials fromWhite Men congratulating themselves basically. PASS THE BUCKET. Also Kevin Kelly was one time asked to help Steven Spielberg imagine the future for the average movie minority report and he mentions it in numerous chapters.

This one is an extrapolation of current trends and has a lot of interesting speculations and predictions. But like Yogi Berra said, ""it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future"". Or Jenny Holzer's Truism: ""The future is stupid"". Things may be veering more in the direction of the movie Idiocracy. With the current political situation it's probably worth rewatching as a counterpoint to The Inevitable. "
159,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"Kevin Kelly gives us a glimpse of the future organized around 12 technological trends that shape our world today, and obviously will shape the future. It is quite readable. To each trend he offers historical support to explain the idea, and in most cases offers a cautious, yet incredible, vision of where that might take us. In some chapters he gives us a vaguely disturbing vignette of how your day might go in the future. Both fantastic and credible at the same time.I really enjoyed this book. His method seems adequate, and he punctuates the explanations with relevant anecdotes. It introduced me to a few things happening now I was not aware of, and certainly feel more prepared to watch for these future trends. If you are in the position of needing to know where our culture is headed, you will find plenty of value in reading this book.My notes on the twelve trends:1. Becoming: We are all perpetual newbies. Things are changing continuously and automatically, and we can't anticipate the future, but the winner will be those who can adapt quickly. This is exactly the main point of Alvin Toffler's Future Shock written in 1970 -- strange he made no mention of it. (He starts with a common fallacy about thermodynamics, but it is unimportant to his thesis, see the details below.)2. Cognifying: ""The business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI."" AI is developing all around us, but not human intelligence but other KINDS of intelligence he calls alien intelligence. We might need to prevent consciousness to get the kind of intelligence we want. Many jobs will be replaced by robots, but humans will move into the job of training and running the robots. 3. Flowing: Digital tech copies everything it accesses, so the old ideas of purchase and ownership are going away. Spotify. Netflix. Instead 8 'generatives' that add value to a free stream: [1] immediacy: you get before others, [2] personalization: your copy is specialized, [3] interpretation: added meaning, [4] authenticity, yours is real and not just a copy, [5] accessibility: they organize it all for you, [6] embodiment: physically shared experience, [7] patronage: supporting the arts in new wasy, [8] discoverability (TV guide was worth more than the tv networks). There are four stages: (1) fixed rare things that get copied, (2) free ubiquitous availability (3) active sharing and services, (4) full engagement of flowing by all parties and co-creation.4. Screening: differences between book media, and screens as an interface to knowledge.5. Accessing: Uber is not about providing more cars, but easy access to cars and drivers that happen to be available at the moment. AirBnB. Why own anything? Why not just access what you need only when you need it?6. Sharing: (1) simple sharing moves to (2) cooperation toward common goals, to (3) collaboration which is organized and coordinated and finally to (4) collectivism: a self-organizing group of people who all receive benefit of their own initiative. Open source software projects are the best example. Not capitalist or communist but something new and different. Kickstart.7. Filtering: ""In a world of abundance, the only scarcity is human attention"" How to separate the wheat from the chafe? We might even be paid for our attention. 8. Remixing: mashups. fan fiction. Full blow video remixing, excerpting, referencing, etc need some inventions as we move into full video collectivism. Property and ownership problems. 9. Interacting: it is not just media, but two way communication as well. Second Life. VR interactions. Augmented reality. (1) we will have more sensors and senses, (2) hey will be increasingly intimate, (3) it will be increasingly immersive. And, yes, ""Goodreads"" was mentioned as an example.10. Tracking. Quantified self. Digital technology makes it cheap to record and then analyze. Surveillance is inevitable, but will the access be one-sided? Is coveillance possible? True anonymity always brings out the worst in people. ""Privacy can be gained only by trust, and trust requires persistent identity."" From tracking will come emergence of something new: ""There is no case in our experience where the difference of a factor of a trillion doesn't make a qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, difference."" 11. Questioning: Google and wikipedia answer 2 trillion questions every year, but something else: ""the impossible things happening now are in every case due to the emergence of a new level of organization that did not exist before."" We have more access to unusual things than ever before. Discoveries depend on asking ""good questions.""12. Beginning: we are becoming a planetary network of intelligence and artificial intelligence, he calls the ""holos."" What will become we can't even imagine. Today we have only the beginning.I can't let Kelly slip with a common misconception. He cites the 2nd law of thermodynamics, saying that it means that everything is flling apart slowly. This is NOT what the law says. The fallacy is thinking that there is a smooth distribution of the disorganization. Within a closed system, some parts will actually get MORE organized, while the overall net organization decreases. This is a nit that I have to pick because so many people make this same mistake. However, it is unimportant to Kelly's thesis in any way, so just a footnote here."
160,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"No one can say where exactly a ball thrown in the air will land, but at least on Earth it’s a certainty that a thrown ball will land. Kevin Kelly, formerly of Wired magazine, can’t say exactly what the future will look like, but he is confident enough to predict what trends will continue based on present technology. Our global civilizations have been radically transformed from the 1970s til now, but computers weren’t the catalyst for all the change we see around us. Networked computers were. By themselves, the first computers were house-sized calculators and overpriced filing cabinets; when they began exchanging information freely, magic happened. What world-changing wonders can we expect from the current trends in technology?First, says Kelly, is “becoming”: In the late eighties, Zygmunt Bauman introduced the term liquid modernity to our sociological lexicon. In previous generations, changes happened slowly enough that our societies were able to digest them and establish a new normal. As the 19th gave way to the 20th century, however, the rate of change has quickened to the point that a new normal is impossible: societiy is revolutionized multiple times within a single generation, with the effect that there is no stable ground to be had, no new normal to be reached. Now our products are no longer discrete products, but services that are continually being changed -- think of Office 365, or even Windows 10. Windows 10 is rumored to be the last Windows, not because Microsoft is retiring from the OS business, but because Windows 10's frequent updates constantly add new features that would have otherwise been developed and delivered in a new Windows. Our phones, too, are not merely the device that came out of the original box: as we add apps and accessories, we change their nature.The second big-ticket item in here is ""cognifying"", by which Kelly means using machine intelligence for everything. There won't be a master AI that controls every aspect of our lives, he says; instead, we''ll develop multiple machine intelligences for different suites of needs, and they''ll be utterly mundane -- and already are. When we execute a google search for recipes or ask it for directions, we are in fact helping train and benefit Google's machine-learning algorithisms: we are teaching them what we're most likely to be looking for. Those ""Related Products"" that Amazon helpfully shows you are also an early example of machine intelligence, as Amazon's database learns your shopping preferences and attempts to predict what you would like next.Two more concepts from the book worth sharing quickly here are Accessing and Tracking. Tracking sounds obvious, but Kelley isn't just talking about website cookies or Google & Apple recording your movements through your phone's GPS. By tracking, Kelly means that the door is open to quantifying every aspect of our lives. People can already use their phone's apps to track how much they walk per day, how well they asleep, and record their diets; they can already use phones to monitor their heartbeat; phones in the near future will be able to monitor blood pressure and blood sugar, as well. Cheap cameras and cloud storage mean that we can record more moments of our lives, and later poke through them at our leisure as if they were files in a drawer. The cloud is a key aspect of much of what Kelly covers, but it is especially prominent in the ""Accessing"" chapter, in which he writes that we're moving away from an ownership society. We no longer need to own a car; we just need access to one. Apps and tech allow us to share resources, and in some cases the resources are becoming so cheap that they can be offered for free: no one needs to struggle with an ersatz Office clone when they can use the freely available OfficeOnline.There are ten real concepts in total (there are two more chapters, ""questioning"" and ""becoming"", but they're less about content than thinking about our relationship with content), and the author purposely avoids mentioning any downsides. He takes it for granted that everything can be used to malicious purposes, but that would be another book entirely. (A book like Future Crimes II, perhaps...) I also liked the chapters on Interacting and Screening; one addressed the future mundane role of virtual reality and augmented reality, in that games and movies will become more ""real"", and our travels in the real world will have a digital overlay adding more information -- the ubiquity of screens dovetails with that rather nicely. One disturbing possibility Kelly mentions is having glasses or ocular implants with different apps installed; one can read people's faces and match them to a driver's license database. The other concepts in the book are extensions of minor things happening now, like remixing and filtering.As someone who can be both entranced and repelled by the promises of technological -- completely fascinated on a abstract level, distantly horrified at a human level -- I found The Inevitable enthralling reading. The author is sloppy with language, however, using ""socialism"" and ""collective"" when 'cooperative' would have been more accurate. For some reason he thinks libertarian individualism is contradicted by Wikipedia , when it's merely individuals voluntarily working together toward a common goal. Socialism makes me think more of involuntary mass actions, like taxes and slavery."

162,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69801085-lee-kuiper,3,"I’m a big fan of Kevin Kelly’s books but, honestly, this one was a little disappointing. It’s touted as his “most readable book” but I now take that to mean his “most prosaic book”; having traded big, complex ideas, rigorous research, depth and detail for a conventional summarization of current digital trends based on his experience and observation. Typically, Kelly’s books are expansive, mind-expanding, and overflowing with synthesized research but this felt like (what I imagine it’s like to read) a  For Dummies  manual. Perhaps Current Digital Cultural Trends For Dummies.  The heart seems to be lacking.After starting excitedly, I read through the whole thing rather listlessly. This book is a lot more mainstream than any of his other books. It has a broader appeal but for someone who already enjoys his niche books (such as myself) this is much more watered down and straightforward. It’s a good book for the unacquainted/anyone hoping to get a solid understanding of the general direction that technology in culture is heading. However, for people already immersed in conversations and ideas about technology and our immediate future, don’t expect too much new information.Despite, ostensibly, being about “the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future,” it talks more about current trends and then extrapolates those trends vaguely into the near future. The predictions are not very exciting, nor are they bold or very risky —just like predicting the winner of a game in the 4th quarter: its safe and usually quite accurate. Although there are occasional interesting insights, seldom was it very fascinating. And only at the very end did it feel “provocative.” That being said, any book by Kevin Kelly is worth reading. I’m being too hard on this book because his previous books set my expectations WAY too high. Also, I’m constantly reading and listening to books/podcasts about technology, the future, and culture so that most of the ideas here were old hat for me.Kelly is always quite optimistic about where things are heading which is refreshing especially since he has been so completely immersed in the constantly changing field of digital technology for the last 30+ years. He knows his stuff and if anyone is in a place to tell us what is going to be “inevitable” in the near future likely there is no one better than Kelly. I almost gave this book four stars because the last two chapters were quite good (especially the final chapter on “Beginning” which is only, unfortunately, 7 pages) but the truth is I was not enthralled for the vast majority of the 297 pages so, realistically, it’s a fair three stars. I do greatly recommend Kevin Kelly’s other books: What Technology Wants and Out of Control"

And you should absolutely read this book if you are interested in understanding where the business or industry you currently work in may be headed.It’s simply amazing that much of the technology needed to drive these transformative changes are already in motion today. And if only half of what Kevin Kelly says comes true, these forces will revolutionize the way we work, learn, buy, communicate, and generally live with each other.Final Thoughts:If you embrace the optimistic side of the transformative force that is all things technology, you will love this book. If you take a more pessimistic view of what technology might eventually do to us and our world in the future, you will probably not like this book.

I've read reviews that dismiss the book as pedestrian, and while I can understand hardcore tech geeks being disappointed with the offerings on hand, I still learned something in every chapter.Across all the trends covered, decentralization seems to be omnipresent. The author predicts much of the power we allocate to governments and corporations will inevitably be passed to the collective. While Kelly doesn't touch on the subject himself, I suspect this inexorability has corporations struggling to retain as much power as possible for as long as possible, giving way to phenomena such as the current endangerment of net neutrality.There were far too many thoughts, observations, musings and predictions to remember, but the one thing I could take from this book was Kelly's optimism about the future. This technology is going to make our lives better, not worse.

That's because this book was written before we lost all confidence on Facebook etc. Yes, the future painted here is one glimpsed through very rose tinted glasses. But I must say, precisely because there's so much here I don't (or no longer) agree with, it was a worthy reading. It made me think and argue. I'd assign this book for media undergrads, lots to discuss."

180,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17367460-jim-angstadt,3,"The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our FutureKevin KellyThe author has been keeping track of technology developments for decades, and helping us understand just what changes are going on around us. In this book, he distills those changes into 12 forces that he thinks will change our world and us. He might be right. Most of his forecasts are reasonable projections of current trends. His ideas are thought provoking and worthy of attention; we can help shape the future rather than just let it happen.One minor nit. I sometimes wished the author was more direct. Don't build an elaborate construct around a simple idea. An economy of expression is better that too much.Notes while reading:===== IntroductionThe general trends are inevitable, not the specific details.===== 1. BecomingAs the pace of change increases, we are frequently/always learning something new or different. We are becoming a little different. New Operating Systems, devices, applications, opportunities, and the constant stream of updates for security, or bug fixes, or tracking, or privacy, compel us to keep learning, adapting.===== 2. CognifyingThe nature of thinking has changed with time. Memorization, spoken words, written words, science; now we have big data, algorithms, machine learning, search; new ways to understand ourselves and our context. What next? Well, maybe: cognified music, laundry, marketing, real estate, nursing, construction, ethics, toys, sports, ... chuckle, snarf, burp.Four categories for worker replacement:- Jobs that robots can do better then humans- Jobs that humans cannot do- Jobs we didn't know we wanted done- Jobs only humans can do - at first===== 3. FlowingWith old computers we had ""batch"" jobs; then daily tasks; now on-line, interactive, up-to-the-second. The flow has changed. So have the metaphores: desktops, folders, then web pages and links, now the flow of twitter, feeds, streaming video, and similar. We expect free, fast, and accurate.What is worth paying for?- Immediacy- Personalization- Interpretation- Authenticity- Accessibility- Embodiment- Patronage- Discoverability===== 4. ScreeningFrom hard-copy to screens, all around us, becoming more feature-full.===== 5. AccessingAccess replaces ownership. Dematerialization accelerates, and leads to more on-demand access. Decentralization, or flattening grows. Platforms enable more innovation and dematerialization but maybe centralize the underlying tech.===== 6. SharingNew, or at least in more use, are various forms of social interaction.- Sharing- Cooperation- Collaboration. eg: linux, 3D printer plans, ...- Collectivism. The power of the individual vs. the power of the state is not a zero sum game. Aim to ""maximize both the autonomy of the individual and the power of the people working together."" We want the government to be more ""open"". Organizations can be a hybrid of bottom-up and top-down. Let everybody be an editor. Wikipedia started as bottom-up and gradually added the top-down component, ie the senior editors.===== 7. FilteringWe simply cannot process everything. We must filter. Currently we can filter by gatekeepers, intermediates, curators, brands, government, culture, friends, and other methods. And it's getting harder. Recomendation systems help, but are not enough. Plus, we want just enough unusual, different inputs to keep us fresh.Our attention is a limiting factor. Should we be paid for our attention?===== 8. RemixingWe see plenty of examples of remix in every-day life: music, video, books, movies, and more. Some has a profit motive, some do not.===== 9. InteractingVirtual reality (VR) is now low cost, interactive, and provides a sense of being there, presence. We will be interacting with everything. Internet of Things, IoT.===== 10. TrackingSelf-tracking, first for fitness, later for lifestream. IoT will/could add more data. We can know ourselves better. When aggregated, we can know ""us"" much better. Medical studies could look at vastly more ""individuals"" that previous.Commercial and government tracking are another dimension. Data could come from: cars, highways, taxis, airlines and trains, drones, postal mail, utilities, phones, CCTV, smart homes, interactive devices, loyalty cards, IRS, credit cards, e-banking, photo recognition, and much more. Technological rather than social or cultural.Page 260. ""Ubiquitous surveillance is inevitable."" Shape the nature of tracking. More symmetrical or coveillance. ""... is there room for anonymity?"" Yes, but in very limited amounts. Eg: we need whistle-blowers.===== 11. QuestioningOur ability to get good quality answers to our questions leads to more questions. The nature of what is now possible leads to more questions. Answers are cheap, so ask away.===== 12. BeginningThe author says we are at the beginning of a new way of living. It might have been interesting to have the author contrast this time with other historic times, like the industrial revolution, or the invention of the printing press, or, much earlier, the ability to record our thoughts on paper, or its predecessors."

Even if Kevin Kelly is dead wrong on his predictions (which is highly unlikely), you can't help but imagine what it'd be like if he was right. I wonder what he thinks of dumb solar roadways. I was surprised not to hear anything about that in this book. But note to self: reread this book in 2050 to see if and how much he was right. Basically think of Ironman's world and that's a glimpse of what we'd have in a few decades. I like the concept of renting everything in the future. With the rise of AirBnb and Uber it is certainly heading that way. Also it will be helpful because we won't take as many things for granite like we do. For example, the paintings/pictures we have on our walls will be exchanged every month or year or so. It will teach us to live a Minimalist lifestyle (click on that link and read that 11 minute article by Mark Manson. It's pretty neat). Smart Shirts are going to be coolo. All of this is happening because of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think that technology is like a Deity. In fact, I think if I weren't a traditional believer and if I were perhaps agnostic I would, indeed, believe that technology is God and He's slowly revealing Himself to us until we can fully realize and comprehend it. Almost like Optimus Prime. And why not?This book reminded me a lot of the first part of the book I, Robot when they're on Mars.We're resistant to upgrades and updates for our devices but he points out that they're like hygiene for our tech. I hadn't thought of it that way. And like we learn in The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century there is a higher call for greater honesty in our world. Especially as things progress towards the Cloud and everything becomes searchable. Time to start cleaning up your act people. If you haven't already. Vanity trumps privacy after all."
184,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton,4,"There is a major irony in reading a book like this in physical form - when it is full of statements espousing the future, probably without too many physical books. Like most books that are making a projection about what will happen in the future, this will probably have a short shelf life. But for now I think it is one of the better attempts to make sense of the trends in technology and their implications. This should not be taken to mean I agree with everything Kelly writes, far from it. But he writes well, thoughtfully and in an engaging way. So, it is at least enjoyable to read. Futurists have a tendency to 2 extremes - those seeing only Utopia and those seeing only doom. Kelly is more inclined to the Utopian viewpoint, although with occasional sections on the challenges of getting there. I have no doubt, to steal Kelly's title that the future is inevitable. That's the easy part, the hard bit is working out which future it will be. Kelly paints a believable picture from a technological perspective, but I think underplays the challenges in getting there and the social implications. A lot of people are going to push back, possibly in fairly assertive ways, on the future he suggests. I suspect if you are the sort of person who is constantly reading about or engaged in technology this book will tell you nothing new - other than being a nice, condensed summary. On the other hand, if you are like me, someone who feels I ought to be interested in understanding the future but generally find much which is written dull and naive, you may enjoy this book somewhat more. "
185,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"Veteran social commentator Kevin Kelly has written a new book about the future of technology that will be a primer for science fiction novelists going forward. Indeed, the title resonates with the final words of my own recent novel: “Destiny was inevitable now,” and the reason, as Kevin Kelly so carefully articulates, is that future trends have already been established! Proprietary AI systems already control what you see when you Google search, tailor what you view on Facebook, manipulate what you buy on Amazon, and make most of the money in the world. VR technology has now reached the tipping point necessary to create an interconnective virtual domain that will transform the primitive internet beyond our wildest dreams, and bring the price down to free. When corporate AI machines eventually converge and begin feeding on exponentially increasing global metadata, a new symbiotic holos will arise that will extend beyond human consciousness, (dubbed “mothership” in my sci-fi novel FREENET,) a tool that becomes an end in itself, and also the beginning. Kelly's twelve defining postulates may seem somewhat artificial, and perhaps overlap a bit, but his premises are solid and his inspiration undeniable. What I like most about Kelly's view is his optimism. He throws the reader into the future by reminding us that the net is just waking up now and learning to crawl. These are the glory days of youthful innovation that we will soon look back on with envy from a standing position. "

And reminded me of why I have a secret love of spec fic. And more than once I thought about my boy Joaquin in the excellent movie Her.On the other hand negative stars because, frankly, there is nothing about Kevin Kelly that seems woke and the back of the book was all testimonials fromWhite Men congratulating themselves basically. PASS THE BUCKET. Also Kevin Kelly was one time asked to help Steven Spielberg imagine the future for the average movie minority report and he mentions it in numerous chapters.

This one is an extrapolation of current trends and has a lot of interesting speculations and predictions. But like Yogi Berra said, ""it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future"". Or Jenny Holzer's Truism: ""The future is stupid"". Things may be veering more in the direction of the movie Idiocracy. With the current political situation it's probably worth rewatching as a counterpoint to The Inevitable. "
189,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"Kevin Kelly gives us a glimpse of the future organized around 12 technological trends that shape our world today, and obviously will shape the future. It is quite readable. To each trend he offers historical support to explain the idea, and in most cases offers a cautious, yet incredible, vision of where that might take us. In some chapters he gives us a vaguely disturbing vignette of how your day might go in the future. Both fantastic and credible at the same time.I really enjoyed this book. His method seems adequate, and he punctuates the explanations with relevant anecdotes. It introduced me to a few things happening now I was not aware of, and certainly feel more prepared to watch for these future trends. If you are in the position of needing to know where our culture is headed, you will find plenty of value in reading this book.My notes on the twelve trends:1. Becoming: We are all perpetual newbies. Things are changing continuously and automatically, and we can't anticipate the future, but the winner will be those who can adapt quickly. This is exactly the main point of Alvin Toffler's Future Shock written in 1970 -- strange he made no mention of it. (He starts with a common fallacy about thermodynamics, but it is unimportant to his thesis, see the details below.)2. Cognifying: ""The business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI."" AI is developing all around us, but not human intelligence but other KINDS of intelligence he calls alien intelligence. We might need to prevent consciousness to get the kind of intelligence we want. Many jobs will be replaced by robots, but humans will move into the job of training and running the robots. 3. Flowing: Digital tech copies everything it accesses, so the old ideas of purchase and ownership are going away. Spotify. Netflix. Instead 8 'generatives' that add value to a free stream: [1] immediacy: you get before others, [2] personalization: your copy is specialized, [3] interpretation: added meaning, [4] authenticity, yours is real and not just a copy, [5] accessibility: they organize it all for you, [6] embodiment: physically shared experience, [7] patronage: supporting the arts in new wasy, [8] discoverability (TV guide was worth more than the tv networks). There are four stages: (1) fixed rare things that get copied, (2) free ubiquitous availability (3) active sharing and services, (4) full engagement of flowing by all parties and co-creation.4. Screening: differences between book media, and screens as an interface to knowledge.5. Accessing: Uber is not about providing more cars, but easy access to cars and drivers that happen to be available at the moment. AirBnB. Why own anything? Why not just access what you need only when you need it?6. Sharing: (1) simple sharing moves to (2) cooperation toward common goals, to (3) collaboration which is organized and coordinated and finally to (4) collectivism: a self-organizing group of people who all receive benefit of their own initiative. Open source software projects are the best example. Not capitalist or communist but something new and different. Kickstart.7. Filtering: ""In a world of abundance, the only scarcity is human attention"" How to separate the wheat from the chafe? We might even be paid for our attention. 8. Remixing: mashups. fan fiction. Full blow video remixing, excerpting, referencing, etc need some inventions as we move into full video collectivism. Property and ownership problems. 9. Interacting: it is not just media, but two way communication as well. Second Life. VR interactions. Augmented reality. (1) we will have more sensors and senses, (2) hey will be increasingly intimate, (3) it will be increasingly immersive. And, yes, ""Goodreads"" was mentioned as an example.10. Tracking. Quantified self. Digital technology makes it cheap to record and then analyze. Surveillance is inevitable, but will the access be one-sided? Is coveillance possible? True anonymity always brings out the worst in people. ""Privacy can be gained only by trust, and trust requires persistent identity."" From tracking will come emergence of something new: ""There is no case in our experience where the difference of a factor of a trillion doesn't make a qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, difference."" 11. Questioning: Google and wikipedia answer 2 trillion questions every year, but something else: ""the impossible things happening now are in every case due to the emergence of a new level of organization that did not exist before."" We have more access to unusual things than ever before. Discoveries depend on asking ""good questions.""12. Beginning: we are becoming a planetary network of intelligence and artificial intelligence, he calls the ""holos."" What will become we can't even imagine. Today we have only the beginning.I can't let Kelly slip with a common misconception. He cites the 2nd law of thermodynamics, saying that it means that everything is flling apart slowly. This is NOT what the law says. The fallacy is thinking that there is a smooth distribution of the disorganization. Within a closed system, some parts will actually get MORE organized, while the overall net organization decreases. This is a nit that I have to pick because so many people make this same mistake. However, it is unimportant to Kelly's thesis in any way, so just a footnote here."
190,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"No one can say where exactly a ball thrown in the air will land, but at least on Earth it’s a certainty that a thrown ball will land. Kevin Kelly, formerly of Wired magazine, can’t say exactly what the future will look like, but he is confident enough to predict what trends will continue based on present technology. Our global civilizations have been radically transformed from the 1970s til now, but computers weren’t the catalyst for all the change we see around us. Networked computers were. By themselves, the first computers were house-sized calculators and overpriced filing cabinets; when they began exchanging information freely, magic happened. What world-changing wonders can we expect from the current trends in technology?First, says Kelly, is “becoming”: In the late eighties, Zygmunt Bauman introduced the term liquid modernity to our sociological lexicon. In previous generations, changes happened slowly enough that our societies were able to digest them and establish a new normal. As the 19th gave way to the 20th century, however, the rate of change has quickened to the point that a new normal is impossible: societiy is revolutionized multiple times within a single generation, with the effect that there is no stable ground to be had, no new normal to be reached. Now our products are no longer discrete products, but services that are continually being changed -- think of Office 365, or even Windows 10. Windows 10 is rumored to be the last Windows, not because Microsoft is retiring from the OS business, but because Windows 10's frequent updates constantly add new features that would have otherwise been developed and delivered in a new Windows. Our phones, too, are not merely the device that came out of the original box: as we add apps and accessories, we change their nature.The second big-ticket item in here is ""cognifying"", by which Kelly means using machine intelligence for everything. There won't be a master AI that controls every aspect of our lives, he says; instead, we''ll develop multiple machine intelligences for different suites of needs, and they''ll be utterly mundane -- and already are. When we execute a google search for recipes or ask it for directions, we are in fact helping train and benefit Google's machine-learning algorithisms: we are teaching them what we're most likely to be looking for. Those ""Related Products"" that Amazon helpfully shows you are also an early example of machine intelligence, as Amazon's database learns your shopping preferences and attempts to predict what you would like next.Two more concepts from the book worth sharing quickly here are Accessing and Tracking. Tracking sounds obvious, but Kelley isn't just talking about website cookies or Google & Apple recording your movements through your phone's GPS. By tracking, Kelly means that the door is open to quantifying every aspect of our lives. People can already use their phone's apps to track how much they walk per day, how well they asleep, and record their diets; they can already use phones to monitor their heartbeat; phones in the near future will be able to monitor blood pressure and blood sugar, as well. Cheap cameras and cloud storage mean that we can record more moments of our lives, and later poke through them at our leisure as if they were files in a drawer. The cloud is a key aspect of much of what Kelly covers, but it is especially prominent in the ""Accessing"" chapter, in which he writes that we're moving away from an ownership society. We no longer need to own a car; we just need access to one. Apps and tech allow us to share resources, and in some cases the resources are becoming so cheap that they can be offered for free: no one needs to struggle with an ersatz Office clone when they can use the freely available OfficeOnline.There are ten real concepts in total (there are two more chapters, ""questioning"" and ""becoming"", but they're less about content than thinking about our relationship with content), and the author purposely avoids mentioning any downsides. He takes it for granted that everything can be used to malicious purposes, but that would be another book entirely. (A book like Future Crimes II, perhaps...) I also liked the chapters on Interacting and Screening; one addressed the future mundane role of virtual reality and augmented reality, in that games and movies will become more ""real"", and our travels in the real world will have a digital overlay adding more information -- the ubiquity of screens dovetails with that rather nicely. One disturbing possibility Kelly mentions is having glasses or ocular implants with different apps installed; one can read people's faces and match them to a driver's license database. The other concepts in the book are extensions of minor things happening now, like remixing and filtering.As someone who can be both entranced and repelled by the promises of technological -- completely fascinated on a abstract level, distantly horrified at a human level -- I found The Inevitable enthralling reading. The author is sloppy with language, however, using ""socialism"" and ""collective"" when 'cooperative' would have been more accurate. For some reason he thinks libertarian individualism is contradicted by Wikipedia , when it's merely individuals voluntarily working together toward a common goal. Socialism makes me think more of involuntary mass actions, like taxes and slavery."

It’s touted as his “most readable book” but I now take that to mean his “most prosaic book”; having traded big, complex ideas, rigorous research, depth and detail for a conventional summarization of current digital trends based on his experience and observation. Typically, Kelly’s books are expansive, mind-expanding, and overflowing with synthesized research but this felt like (what I imagine it’s like to read) a  For Dummies  manual. Perhaps Current Digital Cultural Trends For Dummies.  The heart seems to be lacking.After starting excitedly, I read through the whole thing rather listlessly. This book is a lot more mainstream than any of his other books. It has a broader appeal but for someone who already enjoys his niche books (such as myself) this is much more watered down and straightforward. It’s a good book for the unacquainted/anyone hoping to get a solid understanding of the general direction that technology in culture is heading. However, for people already immersed in conversations and ideas about technology and our immediate future, don’t expect too much new information.Despite, ostensibly, being about “the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future,” it talks more about current trends and then extrapolates those trends vaguely into the near future. The predictions are not very exciting, nor are they bold or very risky —just like predicting the winner of a game in the 4th quarter: its safe and usually quite accurate. Although there are occasional interesting insights, seldom was it very fascinating. And only at the very end did it feel “provocative.” That being said, any book by Kevin Kelly is worth reading. I’m being too hard on this book because his previous books set my expectations WAY too high. Also, I’m constantly reading and listening to books/podcasts about technology, the future, and culture so that most of the ideas here were old hat for me.Kelly is always quite optimistic about where things are heading which is refreshing especially since he has been so completely immersed in the constantly changing field of digital technology for the last 30+ years. He knows his stuff and if anyone is in a place to tell us what is going to be “inevitable” in the near future likely there is no one better than Kelly. I almost gave this book four stars because the last two chapters were quite good (especially the final chapter on “Beginning” which is only, unfortunately, 7 pages) but the truth is I was not enthralled for the vast majority of the 297 pages so, realistically, it’s a fair three stars. I do greatly recommend Kevin Kelly’s other books: What Technology Wants and Out of Control"

In his 2016 book, Kevin Kelly provides a detailed and optimistic guide through twelve technological innovations/imperatives that will shape the next three decades, ultimately further transforming our lives.Why Should You Read This Book?You should read this book if you are interested in better understanding what our lives will look like over the next thirty years. And you should absolutely read this book if you are interested in understanding where the business or industry you currently work in may be headed.It’s simply amazing that much of the technology needed to drive these transformative changes are already in motion today. And if only half of what Kevin Kelly says comes true, these forces will revolutionize the way we work, learn, buy, communicate, and generally live with each other.Final Thoughts:If you embrace the optimistic side of the transformative force that is all things technology, you will love this book. If you take a more pessimistic view of what technology might eventually do to us and our world in the future, you will probably not like this book. Personally, I embrace the prospects that today’s and tomorrow’s technology hold.

I can't believe I didn't see that one!""This might not make much sense, but to summarize I think this book is an amazing summary and ""prediction"" of what our world is currently moving towards. It describes not too much of specific technologies, but general principles and ""forces"" that are currently in motion (beneath current technological advances)."
196,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32232044-fraser,3,"Accessing, copying, sharing, tracking, etc etc...A dozen tech trends served up as easily digestible gerunds for the casual reader. A typical chapter provides a condensed history, a summary of the current situation replete with philosophical quips and staggering statistics, and caps off with a look at how the trend will change our lives in the future. I've read reviews that dismiss the book as pedestrian, and while I can understand hardcore tech geeks being disappointed with the offerings on hand, I still learned something in every chapter.Across all the trends covered, decentralization seems to be omnipresent. The author predicts much of the power we allocate to governments and corporations will inevitably be passed to the collective. While Kelly doesn't touch on the subject himself, I suspect this inexorability has corporations struggling to retain as much power as possible for as long as possible, giving way to phenomena such as the current endangerment of net neutrality.There were far too many thoughts, observations, musings and predictions to remember, but the one thing I could take from this book was Kelly's optimism about the future. This technology is going to make our lives better, not worse. As bad as things seem now with smartphone zombies and lethargic gamer kids, these trends are going to make the world a better place.**(reviewer's note) Unless of course climate change kills us all."

I don't want keyless entry on my front door, rarely use Siri, and only just upgraded to a smart thermostat. Still, I know we will not move back to life before these devices entered our lives. This book was a great insight into the possibilities of the near as well as not-to-distant future. The author thankfully avoided computer-speak so I easily understood all that he said. Still, I spent part of the book wide-eyed and mystified at what we are already capable of and a bit overwhelmed at how quickly much of what he predicts may come to us. "

But rarely have I heard anyone talk about digital technology with such a deep appreciation for how it affects all of us, outside of the context of 'early adopters', 'startups' etc. It is truly insightful, and it is changing my mind about what I think about this, which is my own industry that I've been in all my life. It is a fresh look at the recent history of technology written by someone who gets to see everything (and everyone). I think he has nailed it. "

But according to the author all technology changes are targeting to improve our daily life as well as help to unleash the creativity power of everyone.Great language, easy and entertaining reading. "

While some of the predictions he makes are already here - much of his thoughts are about the culture shift that will come from or drive the future. Some of the most interesting parts are his glimpses into the future life - where he will suddenly slide into a day in the life in the future (closer than we think).

I relish the idea of my refrigerator tracking its inventory and I being able to access it whenever and wherever convenient, such as while grocery shopping. And I too have fantasized about the potential gamification of real life: after a particularly harrowing drive to work during a snowstorm, I mused upon arrival that I ought to have received bonus points for my successful navigation under such adverse circumstances.

210,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17367460-jim-angstadt,3,"The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our FutureKevin KellyThe author has been keeping track of technology developments for decades, and helping us understand just what changes are going on around us. In this book, he distills those changes into 12 forces that he thinks will change our world and us. He might be right. Most of his forecasts are reasonable projections of current trends. His ideas are thought provoking and worthy of attention; we can help shape the future rather than just let it happen.One minor nit. I sometimes wished the author was more direct. Don't build an elaborate construct around a simple idea. An economy of expression is better that too much.Notes while reading:===== IntroductionThe general trends are inevitable, not the specific details.===== 1. BecomingAs the pace of change increases, we are frequently/always learning something new or different. We are becoming a little different. New Operating Systems, devices, applications, opportunities, and the constant stream of updates for security, or bug fixes, or tracking, or privacy, compel us to keep learning, adapting.===== 2. CognifyingThe nature of thinking has changed with time. Memorization, spoken words, written words, science; now we have big data, algorithms, machine learning, search; new ways to understand ourselves and our context. What next? Well, maybe: cognified music, laundry, marketing, real estate, nursing, construction, ethics, toys, sports, ... chuckle, snarf, burp.Four categories for worker replacement:- Jobs that robots can do better then humans- Jobs that humans cannot do- Jobs we didn't know we wanted done- Jobs only humans can do - at first===== 3. FlowingWith old computers we had ""batch"" jobs; then daily tasks; now on-line, interactive, up-to-the-second. The flow has changed. So have the metaphores: desktops, folders, then web pages and links, now the flow of twitter, feeds, streaming video, and similar. We expect free, fast, and accurate.What is worth paying for?- Immediacy- Personalization- Interpretation- Authenticity- Accessibility- Embodiment- Patronage- Discoverability===== 4. ScreeningFrom hard-copy to screens, all around us, becoming more feature-full.===== 5. AccessingAccess replaces ownership. Dematerialization accelerates, and leads to more on-demand access. Decentralization, or flattening grows. Platforms enable more innovation and dematerialization but maybe centralize the underlying tech.===== 6. SharingNew, or at least in more use, are various forms of social interaction.- Sharing- Cooperation- Collaboration. eg: linux, 3D printer plans, ...- Collectivism. The power of the individual vs. the power of the state is not a zero sum game. Aim to ""maximize both the autonomy of the individual and the power of the people working together."" We want the government to be more ""open"". Organizations can be a hybrid of bottom-up and top-down. Let everybody be an editor. Wikipedia started as bottom-up and gradually added the top-down component, ie the senior editors.===== 7. FilteringWe simply cannot process everything. We must filter. Currently we can filter by gatekeepers, intermediates, curators, brands, government, culture, friends, and other methods. And it's getting harder. Recomendation systems help, but are not enough. Plus, we want just enough unusual, different inputs to keep us fresh.Our attention is a limiting factor. Should we be paid for our attention?===== 8. RemixingWe see plenty of examples of remix in every-day life: music, video, books, movies, and more. Some has a profit motive, some do not.===== 9. InteractingVirtual reality (VR) is now low cost, interactive, and provides a sense of being there, presence. We will be interacting with everything. Internet of Things, IoT.===== 10. TrackingSelf-tracking, first for fitness, later for lifestream. IoT will/could add more data. We can know ourselves better. When aggregated, we can know ""us"" much better. Medical studies could look at vastly more ""individuals"" that previous.Commercial and government tracking are another dimension. Data could come from: cars, highways, taxis, airlines and trains, drones, postal mail, utilities, phones, CCTV, smart homes, interactive devices, loyalty cards, IRS, credit cards, e-banking, photo recognition, and much more. Technological rather than social or cultural.Page 260. ""Ubiquitous surveillance is inevitable."" Shape the nature of tracking. More symmetrical or coveillance. ""... is there room for anonymity?"" Yes, but in very limited amounts. Eg: we need whistle-blowers.===== 11. QuestioningOur ability to get good quality answers to our questions leads to more questions. The nature of what is now possible leads to more questions. Answers are cheap, so ask away.===== 12. BeginningThe author says we are at the beginning of a new way of living. It might have been interesting to have the author contrast this time with other historic times, like the industrial revolution, or the invention of the printing press, or, much earlier, the ability to record our thoughts on paper, or its predecessors."

Even if Kevin Kelly is dead wrong on his predictions (which is highly unlikely), you can't help but imagine what it'd be like if he was right. I wonder what he thinks of dumb solar roadways. I was surprised not to hear anything about that in this book. But note to self: reread this book in 2050 to see if and how much he was right. Basically think of Ironman's world and that's a glimpse of what we'd have in a few decades. I like the concept of renting everything in the future. With the rise of AirBnb and Uber it is certainly heading that way. Also it will be helpful because we won't take as many things for granite like we do. For example, the paintings/pictures we have on our walls will be exchanged every month or year or so. It will teach us to live a Minimalist lifestyle (click on that link and read that 11 minute article by Mark Manson. It's pretty neat). Smart Shirts are going to be coolo. All of this is happening because of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think that technology is like a Deity. In fact, I think if I weren't a traditional believer and if I were perhaps agnostic I would, indeed, believe that technology is God and He's slowly revealing Himself to us until we can fully realize and comprehend it. Almost like Optimus Prime. And why not?This book reminded me a lot of the first part of the book I, Robot when they're on Mars.We're resistant to upgrades and updates for our devices but he points out that they're like hygiene for our tech. I hadn't thought of it that way. And like we learn in The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century there is a higher call for greater honesty in our world. Especially as things progress towards the Cloud and everything becomes searchable. Time to start cleaning up your act people. If you haven't already. Vanity trumps privacy after all."
214,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton,4,"There is a major irony in reading a book like this in physical form - when it is full of statements espousing the future, probably without too many physical books. Like most books that are making a projection about what will happen in the future, this will probably have a short shelf life. But for now I think it is one of the better attempts to make sense of the trends in technology and their implications. This should not be taken to mean I agree with everything Kelly writes, far from it. But he writes well, thoughtfully and in an engaging way. So, it is at least enjoyable to read. Futurists have a tendency to 2 extremes - those seeing only Utopia and those seeing only doom. Kelly is more inclined to the Utopian viewpoint, although with occasional sections on the challenges of getting there. I have no doubt, to steal Kelly's title that the future is inevitable. That's the easy part, the hard bit is working out which future it will be. Kelly paints a believable picture from a technological perspective, but I think underplays the challenges in getting there and the social implications. A lot of people are going to push back, possibly in fairly assertive ways, on the future he suggests. I suspect if you are the sort of person who is constantly reading about or engaged in technology this book will tell you nothing new - other than being a nice, condensed summary. On the other hand, if you are like me, someone who feels I ought to be interested in understanding the future but generally find much which is written dull and naive, you may enjoy this book somewhat more.

215,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"Veteran social commentator Kevin Kelly has written a new book about the future of technology that will be a primer for science fiction novelists going forward. Indeed, the title resonates with the final words of my own recent novel: “Destiny was inevitable now,” and the reason, as Kevin Kelly so carefully articulates, is that future trends have already been established! Proprietary AI systems already control what you see when you Google search, tailor what you view on Facebook, manipulate what you buy on Amazon, and make most of the money in the world. VR technology has now reached the tipping point necessary to create an interconnective virtual domain that will transform the primitive internet beyond our wildest dreams, and bring the price down to free. When corporate AI machines eventually converge and begin feeding on exponentially increasing global metadata, a new symbiotic holos will arise that will extend beyond human consciousness, (dubbed “mothership” in my sci-fi novel FREENET,) a tool that becomes an end in itself, and also the beginning. Kelly's twelve defining postulates may seem somewhat artificial, and perhaps overlap a bit, but his premises are solid and his inspiration undeniable. What I like most about Kelly's view is his optimism. He throws the reader into the future by reminding us that the net is just waking up now and learning to crawl. These are the glory days of youthful innovation that we will soon look back on with envy from a standing position. "

It is all happening now. You should be so excited to be alive!---The book discusses the major trends of this Beginning: end of privacy?

And reminded me of why I have a secret love of spec fic. And more than once I thought about my boy Joaquin in the excellent movie Her.On the other hand negative stars because, frankly, there is nothing about Kevin Kelly that seems woke and the back of the book was all testimonials fromWhite Men congratulating themselves basically. PASS THE BUCKET. Also Kevin Kelly was one time asked to help Steven Spielberg imagine the future for the average movie minority report and he mentions it in numerous chapters.

Or Jenny Holzer's Truism: ""The future is stupid"". Things may be veering more in the direction of the movie Idiocracy. With the current political situation it's probably worth rewatching as a counterpoint to The Inevitable. "
219,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"Kevin Kelly gives us a glimpse of the future organized around 12 technological trends that shape our world today, and obviously will shape the future. It is quite readable. To each trend he offers historical support to explain the idea, and in most cases offers a cautious, yet incredible, vision of where that might take us. In some chapters he gives us a vaguely disturbing vignette of how your day might go in the future. Both fantastic and credible at the same time.I really enjoyed this book. His method seems adequate, and he punctuates the explanations with relevant anecdotes. It introduced me to a few things happening now I was not aware of, and certainly feel more prepared to watch for these future trends. If you are in the position of needing to know where our culture is headed, you will find plenty of value in reading this book.My notes on the twelve trends:1. Becoming: We are all perpetual newbies. Things are changing continuously and automatically, and we can't anticipate the future, but the winner will be those who can adapt quickly. This is exactly the main point of Alvin Toffler's Future Shock written in 1970 -- strange he made no mention of it. (He starts with a common fallacy about thermodynamics, but it is unimportant to his thesis, see the details below.)2. Cognifying: ""The business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI."" AI is developing all around us, but not human intelligence but other KINDS of intelligence he calls alien intelligence. We might need to prevent consciousness to get the kind of intelligence we want. Many jobs will be replaced by robots, but humans will move into the job of training and running the robots. 3. Flowing: Digital tech copies everything it accesses, so the old ideas of purchase and ownership are going away. Spotify. Netflix. Instead 8 'generatives' that add value to a free stream: [1] immediacy: you get before others, [2] personalization: your copy is specialized, [3] interpretation: added meaning, [4] authenticity, yours is real and not just a copy, [5] accessibility: they organize it all for you, [6] embodiment: physically shared experience, [7] patronage: supporting the arts in new wasy, [8] discoverability (TV guide was worth more than the tv networks). There are four stages: (1) fixed rare things that get copied, (2) free ubiquitous availability (3) active sharing and services, (4) full engagement of flowing by all parties and co-creation.4. Screening: differences between book media, and screens as an interface to knowledge.5. Accessing: Uber is not about providing more cars, but easy access to cars and drivers that happen to be available at the moment. AirBnB. Why own anything? Why not just access what you need only when you need it?6. Sharing: (1) simple sharing moves to (2) cooperation toward common goals, to (3) collaboration which is organized and coordinated and finally to (4) collectivism: a self-organizing group of people who all receive benefit of their own initiative. Open source software projects are the best example. Not capitalist or communist but something new and different. Kickstart.7. Filtering: ""In a world of abundance, the only scarcity is human attention"" How to separate the wheat from the chafe? We might even be paid for our attention. 8. Remixing: mashups. fan fiction. Full blow video remixing, excerpting, referencing, etc need some inventions as we move into full video collectivism. Property and ownership problems. 9. Interacting: it is not just media, but two way communication as well. Second Life. VR interactions. Augmented reality. (1) we will have more sensors and senses, (2) hey will be increasingly intimate, (3) it will be increasingly immersive. And, yes, ""Goodreads"" was mentioned as an example.10. Tracking. Quantified self. Digital technology makes it cheap to record and then analyze. Surveillance is inevitable, but will the access be one-sided? Is coveillance possible? True anonymity always brings out the worst in people. ""Privacy can be gained only by trust, and trust requires persistent identity."" From tracking will come emergence of something new: ""There is no case in our experience where the difference of a factor of a trillion doesn't make a qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, difference."" 11. Questioning: Google and wikipedia answer 2 trillion questions every year, but something else: ""the impossible things happening now are in every case due to the emergence of a new level of organization that did not exist before."" We have more access to unusual things than ever before. Discoveries depend on asking ""good questions.""12. Beginning: we are becoming a planetary network of intelligence and artificial intelligence, he calls the ""holos."" What will become we can't even imagine. Today we have only the beginning.I can't let Kelly slip with a common misconception. He cites the 2nd law of thermodynamics, saying that it means that everything is flling apart slowly. This is NOT what the law says. The fallacy is thinking that there is a smooth distribution of the disorganization. Within a closed system, some parts will actually get MORE organized, while the overall net organization decreases. This is a nit that I have to pick because so many people make this same mistake. However, it is unimportant to Kelly's thesis in any way, so just a footnote here."
220,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"No one can say where exactly a ball thrown in the air will land, but at least on Earth it’s a certainty that a thrown ball will land. Kevin Kelly, formerly of Wired magazine, can’t say exactly what the future will look like, but he is confident enough to predict what trends will continue based on present technology. Our global civilizations have been radically transformed from the 1970s til now, but computers weren’t the catalyst for all the change we see around us. Networked computers were. By themselves, the first computers were house-sized calculators and overpriced filing cabinets; when they began exchanging information freely, magic happened. What world-changing wonders can we expect from the current trends in technology?First, says Kelly, is “becoming”: In the late eighties, Zygmunt Bauman introduced the term liquid modernity to our sociological lexicon. In previous generations, changes happened slowly enough that our societies were able to digest them and establish a new normal. As the 19th gave way to the 20th century, however, the rate of change has quickened to the point that a new normal is impossible: societiy is revolutionized multiple times within a single generation, with the effect that there is no stable ground to be had, no new normal to be reached. Now our products are no longer discrete products, but services that are continually being changed -- think of Office 365, or even Windows 10. Windows 10 is rumored to be the last Windows, not because Microsoft is retiring from the OS business, but because Windows 10's frequent updates constantly add new features that would have otherwise been developed and delivered in a new Windows. Our phones, too, are not merely the device that came out of the original box: as we add apps and accessories, we change their nature.The second big-ticket item in here is ""cognifying"", by which Kelly means using machine intelligence for everything. There won't be a master AI that controls every aspect of our lives, he says; instead, we''ll develop multiple machine intelligences for different suites of needs, and they''ll be utterly mundane -- and already are. When we execute a google search for recipes or ask it for directions, we are in fact helping train and benefit Google's machine-learning algorithisms: we are teaching them what we're most likely to be looking for. Those ""Related Products"" that Amazon helpfully shows you are also an early example of machine intelligence, as Amazon's database learns your shopping preferences and attempts to predict what you would like next.Two more concepts from the book worth sharing quickly here are Accessing and Tracking. Tracking sounds obvious, but Kelley isn't just talking about website cookies or Google & Apple recording your movements through your phone's GPS. By tracking, Kelly means that the door is open to quantifying every aspect of our lives. People can already use their phone's apps to track how much they walk per day, how well they asleep, and record their diets; they can already use phones to monitor their heartbeat; phones in the near future will be able to monitor blood pressure and blood sugar, as well. Cheap cameras and cloud storage mean that we can record more moments of our lives, and later poke through them at our leisure as if they were files in a drawer. The cloud is a key aspect of much of what Kelly covers, but it is especially prominent in the ""Accessing"" chapter, in which he writes that we're moving away from an ownership society. We no longer need to own a car; we just need access to one. Apps and tech allow us to share resources, and in some cases the resources are becoming so cheap that they can be offered for free: no one needs to struggle with an ersatz Office clone when they can use the freely available OfficeOnline.There are ten real concepts in total (there are two more chapters, ""questioning"" and ""becoming"", but they're less about content than thinking about our relationship with content), and the author purposely avoids mentioning any downsides. He takes it for granted that everything can be used to malicious purposes, but that would be another book entirely. (A book like Future Crimes II, perhaps...) I also liked the chapters on Interacting and Screening; one addressed the future mundane role of virtual reality and augmented reality, in that games and movies will become more ""real"", and our travels in the real world will have a digital overlay adding more information -- the ubiquity of screens dovetails with that rather nicely. One disturbing possibility Kelly mentions is having glasses or ocular implants with different apps installed; one can read people's faces and match them to a driver's license database. The other concepts in the book are extensions of minor things happening now, like remixing and filtering.As someone who can be both entranced and repelled by the promises of technological -- completely fascinated on a abstract level, distantly horrified at a human level -- I found The Inevitable enthralling reading. The author is sloppy with language, however, using ""socialism"" and ""collective"" when 'cooperative' would have been more accurate. For some reason he thinks libertarian individualism is contradicted by Wikipedia , when it's merely individuals voluntarily working together toward a common goal. Socialism makes me think more of involuntary mass actions, like taxes and slavery."

222,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69801085-lee-kuiper,3,"I’m a big fan of Kevin Kelly’s books but, honestly, this one was a little disappointing. It’s touted as his “most readable book” but I now take that to mean his “most prosaic book”; having traded big, complex ideas, rigorous research, depth and detail for a conventional summarization of current digital trends based on his experience and observation. Typically, Kelly’s books are expansive, mind-expanding, and overflowing with synthesized research but this felt like (what I imagine it’s like to read) a  For Dummies  manual. Perhaps Current Digital Cultural Trends For Dummies.  The heart seems to be lacking.After starting excitedly, I read through the whole thing rather listlessly. This book is a lot more mainstream than any of his other books. It has a broader appeal but for someone who already enjoys his niche books (such as myself) this is much more watered down and straightforward. It’s a good book for the unacquainted/anyone hoping to get a solid understanding of the general direction that technology in culture is heading. However, for people already immersed in conversations and ideas about technology and our immediate future, don’t expect too much new information.Despite, ostensibly, being about “the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future,” it talks more about current trends and then extrapolates those trends vaguely into the near future. The predictions are not very exciting, nor are they bold or very risky —just like predicting the winner of a game in the 4th quarter: its safe and usually quite accurate. Although there are occasional interesting insights, seldom was it very fascinating. And only at the very end did it feel “provocative.” That being said, any book by Kevin Kelly is worth reading. I’m being too hard on this book because his previous books set my expectations WAY too high. Also, I’m constantly reading and listening to books/podcasts about technology, the future, and culture so that most of the ideas here were old hat for me.Kelly is always quite optimistic about where things are heading which is refreshing especially since he has been so completely immersed in the constantly changing field of digital technology for the last 30+ years. He knows his stuff and if anyone is in a place to tell us what is going to be “inevitable” in the near future likely there is no one better than Kelly. I almost gave this book four stars because the last two chapters were quite good (especially the final chapter on “Beginning” which is only, unfortunately, 7 pages) but the truth is I was not enthralled for the vast majority of the 297 pages so, realistically, it’s a fair three stars. I do greatly recommend Kevin Kelly’s other books: What Technology Wants and Out of Control"

In his 2016 book, Kevin Kelly provides a detailed and optimistic guide through twelve technological innovations/imperatives that will shape the next three decades, ultimately further transforming our lives.Why Should You Read This Book?You should read this book if you are interested in better understanding what our lives will look like over the next thirty years. And you should absolutely read this book if you are interested in understanding where the business or industry you currently work in may be headed.It’s simply amazing that much of the technology needed to drive these transformative changes are already in motion today. And if only half of what Kevin Kelly says comes true, these forces will revolutionize the way we work, learn, buy, communicate, and generally live with each other.Final Thoughts:If you embrace the optimistic side of the transformative force that is all things technology, you will love this book. If you take a more pessimistic view of what technology might eventually do to us and our world in the future, you will probably not like this book. Personally, I embrace the prospects that today’s and tomorrow’s technology hold.

For the innovator, the curious and the skeptic. I went through three phases reading this book:1. Skepticism - Before starting to read: ""What kind of bullshit is this?""2. Obviosity - When starting to read: ""Well, duh!""3. Revelation - After reading for a while: ""Oh, shit - Yes! I can't believe I didn't see that one!""This might not make much sense, but to summarize I think this book is an amazing summary and ""prediction"" of what our world is currently moving towards.

A typical chapter provides a condensed history, a summary of the current situation replete with philosophical quips and staggering statistics, and caps off with a look at how the trend will change our lives in the future. I've read reviews that dismiss the book as pedestrian, and while I can understand hardcore tech geeks being disappointed with the offerings on hand, I still learned something in every chapter.Across all the trends covered, decentralization seems to be omnipresent. The author predicts much of the power we allocate to governments and corporations will inevitably be passed to the collective. While Kelly doesn't touch on the subject himself, I suspect this inexorability has corporations struggling to retain as much power as possible for as long as possible, giving way to phenomena such as the current endangerment of net neutrality.There were far too many thoughts, observations, musings and predictions to remember, but the one thing I could take from this book was Kelly's optimism about the future. This technology is going to make our lives better, not worse. As bad as things seem now with smartphone zombies and lethargic gamer kids, these trends are going to make the world a better place.**(reviewer's note) Unless of course climate change kills us all."

This book was a great insight into the possibilities of the near as well as not-to-distant future. The author thankfully avoided computer-speak so I easily understood all that he said.

In this book, he distills those changes into 12 forces that he thinks will change our world and us. He might be right. Most of his forecasts are reasonable projections of current trends. His ideas are thought provoking and worthy of attention; we can help shape the future rather than just let it happen.One minor nit. I sometimes wished the author was more direct. Don't build an elaborate construct around a simple idea. An economy of expression is better that too much.Notes while reading:===== IntroductionThe general trends are inevitable, not the specific details.===== 1. BecomingAs the pace of change increases, we are frequently/always learning something new or different. We are becoming a little different. New Operating Systems, devices, applications, opportunities, and the constant stream of updates for security, or bug fixes, or tracking, or privacy, compel us to keep learning, adapting.===== 2. CognifyingThe nature of thinking has changed with time. Memorization, spoken words, written words, science; now we have big data, algorithms, machine learning, search; new ways to understand ourselves and our context. What next? Well, maybe: cognified music, laundry, marketing, real estate, nursing, construction, ethics, toys, sports, ... chuckle, snarf, burp.Four categories for worker replacement:- Jobs that robots can do better then humans- Jobs that humans cannot do- Jobs we didn't know we wanted done- Jobs only humans can do - at first===== 3. FlowingWith old computers we had ""batch"" jobs; then daily tasks; now on-line, interactive, up-to-the-second. The flow has changed. So have the metaphores: desktops, folders, then web pages and links, now the flow of twitter, feeds, streaming video, and similar. We expect free, fast, and accurate.What is worth paying for?- Immediacy- Personalization- Interpretation- Authenticity- Accessibility- Embodiment- Patronage- Discoverability===== 4. ScreeningFrom hard-copy to screens, all around us, becoming more feature-full.===== 5. AccessingAccess replaces ownership. Dematerialization accelerates, and leads to more on-demand access. Decentralization, or flattening grows. Platforms enable more innovation and dematerialization but maybe centralize the underlying tech.===== 6. SharingNew, or at least in more use, are various forms of social interaction.- Sharing- Cooperation- Collaboration. eg: linux, 3D printer plans, ...- Collectivism. The power of the individual vs. the power of the state is not a zero sum game. Aim to ""maximize both the autonomy of the individual and the power of the people working together."" We want the government to be more ""open"". Organizations can be a hybrid of bottom-up and top-down. Let everybody be an editor. Wikipedia started as bottom-up and gradually added the top-down component, ie the senior editors.===== 7. FilteringWe simply cannot process everything. We must filter. Currently we can filter by gatekeepers, intermediates, curators, brands, government, culture, friends, and other methods. And it's getting harder. Recomendation systems help, but are not enough. Plus, we want just enough unusual, different inputs to keep us fresh.Our attention is a limiting factor. Should we be paid for our attention?===== 8. RemixingWe see plenty of examples of remix in every-day life: music, video, books, movies, and more. Some has a profit motive, some do not.===== 9. InteractingVirtual reality (VR) is now low cost, interactive, and provides a sense of being there, presence. We will be interacting with everything. Internet of Things, IoT.===== 10. TrackingSelf-tracking, first for fitness, later for lifestream. IoT will/could add more data. We can know ourselves better. When aggregated, we can know ""us"" much better. Medical studies could look at vastly more ""individuals"" that previous.Commercial and government tracking are another dimension. Data could come from: cars, highways, taxis, airlines and trains, drones, postal mail, utilities, phones, CCTV, smart homes, interactive devices, loyalty cards, IRS, credit cards, e-banking, photo recognition, and much more. Technological rather than social or cultural.Page 260. ""Ubiquitous surveillance is inevitable."" Shape the nature of tracking. More symmetrical or coveillance. ""... is there room for anonymity?"" Yes, but in very limited amounts. Eg: we need whistle-blowers.===== 11. QuestioningOur ability to get good quality answers to our questions leads to more questions. The nature of what is now possible leads to more questions. Answers are cheap, so ask away.===== 12. BeginningThe author says we are at the beginning of a new way of living. It might have been interesting to have the author contrast this time with other historic times, like the industrial revolution, or the invention of the printing press, or, much earlier, the ability to record our thoughts on paper, or its predecessors."

Even if Kevin Kelly is dead wrong on his predictions (which is highly unlikely), you can't help but imagine what it'd be like if he was right. I wonder what he thinks of dumb solar roadways. I was surprised not to hear anything about that in this book. But note to self: reread this book in 2050 to see if and how much he was right. Basically think of Ironman's world and that's a glimpse of what we'd have in a few decades. I like the concept of renting everything in the future. With the rise of AirBnb and Uber it is certainly heading that way. Also it will be helpful because we won't take as many things for granite like we do. For example, the paintings/pictures we have on our walls will be exchanged every month or year or so. It will teach us to live a Minimalist lifestyle (click on that link and read that 11 minute article by Mark Manson. It's pretty neat). Smart Shirts are going to be coolo. All of this is happening because of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think that technology is like a Deity. In fact, I think if I weren't a traditional believer and if I were perhaps agnostic I would, indeed, believe that technology is God and He's slowly revealing Himself to us until we can fully realize and comprehend it. Almost like Optimus Prime. And why not?This book reminded me a lot of the first part of the book I, Robot when they're on Mars.We're resistant to upgrades and updates for our devices but he points out that they're like hygiene for our tech. I hadn't thought of it that way. And like we learn in The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century there is a higher call for greater honesty in our world. Especially as things progress towards the Cloud and everything becomes searchable. Time to start cleaning up your act people. If you haven't already. Vanity trumps privacy after all."
244,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton,4,"There is a major irony in reading a book like this in physical form - when it is full of statements espousing the future, probably without too many physical books. Like most books that are making a projection about what will happen in the future, this will probably have a short shelf life. But for now I think it is one of the better attempts to make sense of the trends in technology and their implications. This should not be taken to mean I agree with everything Kelly writes, far from it. But he writes well, thoughtfully and in an engaging way. So, it is at least enjoyable to read. Futurists have a tendency to 2 extremes - those seeing only Utopia and those seeing only doom. Kelly is more inclined to the Utopian viewpoint, although with occasional sections on the challenges of getting there. I have no doubt, to steal Kelly's title that the future is inevitable. That's the easy part, the hard bit is working out which future it will be. Kelly paints a believable picture from a technological perspective, but I think underplays the challenges in getting there and the social implications. A lot of people are going to push back, possibly in fairly assertive ways, on the future he suggests. I suspect if you are the sort of person who is constantly reading about or engaged in technology this book will tell you nothing new - other than being a nice, condensed summary. On the other hand, if you are like me, someone who feels I ought to be interested in understanding the future but generally find much which is written dull and naive, you may enjoy this book somewhat more.

245,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"Veteran social commentator Kevin Kelly has written a new book about the future of technology that will be a primer for science fiction novelists going forward. Indeed, the title resonates with the final words of my own recent novel: “Destiny was inevitable now,” and the reason, as Kevin Kelly so carefully articulates, is that future trends have already been established! Proprietary AI systems already control what you see when you Google search, tailor what you view on Facebook, manipulate what you buy on Amazon, and make most of the money in the world. VR technology has now reached the tipping point necessary to create an interconnective virtual domain that will transform the primitive internet beyond our wildest dreams, and bring the price down to free. When corporate AI machines eventually converge and begin feeding on exponentially increasing global metadata, a new symbiotic holos will arise that will extend beyond human consciousness, (dubbed “mothership” in my sci-fi novel FREENET,) a tool that becomes an end in itself, and also the beginning. Kelly's twelve defining postulates may seem somewhat artificial, and perhaps overlap a bit, but his premises are solid and his inspiration undeniable. What I like most about Kelly's view is his optimism. He throws the reader into the future by reminding us that the net is just waking up now and learning to crawl. These are the glory days of youthful innovation that we will soon look back on with envy from a standing position. "

249,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"Kevin Kelly gives us a glimpse of the future organized around 12 technological trends that shape our world today, and obviously will shape the future. It is quite readable. To each trend he offers historical support to explain the idea, and in most cases offers a cautious, yet incredible, vision of where that might take us. In some chapters he gives us a vaguely disturbing vignette of how your day might go in the future. Both fantastic and credible at the same time.I really enjoyed this book. His method seems adequate, and he punctuates the explanations with relevant anecdotes. It introduced me to a few things happening now I was not aware of, and certainly feel more prepared to watch for these future trends. If you are in the position of needing to know where our culture is headed, you will find plenty of value in reading this book.My notes on the twelve trends:1. Becoming: We are all perpetual newbies. Things are changing continuously and automatically, and we can't anticipate the future, but the winner will be those who can adapt quickly. This is exactly the main point of Alvin Toffler's Future Shock written in 1970 -- strange he made no mention of it. (He starts with a common fallacy about thermodynamics, but it is unimportant to his thesis, see the details below.)2. Cognifying: ""The business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI."" AI is developing all around us, but not human intelligence but other KINDS of intelligence he calls alien intelligence. We might need to prevent consciousness to get the kind of intelligence we want. Many jobs will be replaced by robots, but humans will move into the job of training and running the robots. 3. Flowing: Digital tech copies everything it accesses, so the old ideas of purchase and ownership are going away. Spotify. Netflix. Instead 8 'generatives' that add value to a free stream: [1] immediacy: you get before others, [2] personalization: your copy is specialized, [3] interpretation: added meaning, [4] authenticity, yours is real and not just a copy, [5] accessibility: they organize it all for you, [6] embodiment: physically shared experience, [7] patronage: supporting the arts in new wasy, [8] discoverability (TV guide was worth more than the tv networks). There are four stages: (1) fixed rare things that get copied, (2) free ubiquitous availability (3) active sharing and services, (4) full engagement of flowing by all parties and co-creation.4. Screening: differences between book media, and screens as an interface to knowledge.5. Accessing: Uber is not about providing more cars, but easy access to cars and drivers that happen to be available at the moment. AirBnB. Why own anything? Why not just access what you need only when you need it?6. Sharing: (1) simple sharing moves to (2) cooperation toward common goals, to (3) collaboration which is organized and coordinated and finally to (4) collectivism: a self-organizing group of people who all receive benefit of their own initiative. Open source software projects are the best example. Not capitalist or communist but something new and different. Kickstart.7. Filtering: ""In a world of abundance, the only scarcity is human attention"" How to separate the wheat from the chafe? We might even be paid for our attention. 8. Remixing: mashups. fan fiction. Full blow video remixing, excerpting, referencing, etc need some inventions as we move into full video collectivism. Property and ownership problems. 9. Interacting: it is not just media, but two way communication as well. Second Life. VR interactions. Augmented reality. (1) we will have more sensors and senses, (2) hey will be increasingly intimate, (3) it will be increasingly immersive. And, yes, ""Goodreads"" was mentioned as an example.10. Tracking. Quantified self. Digital technology makes it cheap to record and then analyze. Surveillance is inevitable, but will the access be one-sided? Is coveillance possible? True anonymity always brings out the worst in people. ""Privacy can be gained only by trust, and trust requires persistent identity."" From tracking will come emergence of something new: ""There is no case in our experience where the difference of a factor of a trillion doesn't make a qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, difference."" 11. Questioning: Google and wikipedia answer 2 trillion questions every year, but something else: ""the impossible things happening now are in every case due to the emergence of a new level of organization that did not exist before."" We have more access to unusual things than ever before. Discoveries depend on asking ""good questions.""12. Beginning: we are becoming a planetary network of intelligence and artificial intelligence, he calls the ""holos."" What will become we can't even imagine. Today we have only the beginning.I can't let Kelly slip with a common misconception. He cites the 2nd law of thermodynamics, saying that it means that everything is flling apart slowly. This is NOT what the law says. The fallacy is thinking that there is a smooth distribution of the disorganization. Within a closed system, some parts will actually get MORE organized, while the overall net organization decreases. This is a nit that I have to pick because so many people make this same mistake. However, it is unimportant to Kelly's thesis in any way, so just a footnote here."
250,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"No one can say where exactly a ball thrown in the air will land, but at least on Earth it’s a certainty that a thrown ball will land. Kevin Kelly, formerly of Wired magazine, can’t say exactly what the future will look like, but he is confident enough to predict what trends will continue based on present technology. Our global civilizations have been radically transformed from the 1970s til now, but computers weren’t the catalyst for all the change we see around us. Networked computers were. By themselves, the first computers were house-sized calculators and overpriced filing cabinets; when they began exchanging information freely, magic happened. What world-changing wonders can we expect from the current trends in technology?First, says Kelly, is “becoming”: In the late eighties, Zygmunt Bauman introduced the term liquid modernity to our sociological lexicon. In previous generations, changes happened slowly enough that our societies were able to digest them and establish a new normal. As the 19th gave way to the 20th century, however, the rate of change has quickened to the point that a new normal is impossible: societiy is revolutionized multiple times within a single generation, with the effect that there is no stable ground to be had, no new normal to be reached. Now our products are no longer discrete products, but services that are continually being changed -- think of Office 365, or even Windows 10. Windows 10 is rumored to be the last Windows, not because Microsoft is retiring from the OS business, but because Windows 10's frequent updates constantly add new features that would have otherwise been developed and delivered in a new Windows. Our phones, too, are not merely the device that came out of the original box: as we add apps and accessories, we change their nature.The second big-ticket item in here is ""cognifying"", by which Kelly means using machine intelligence for everything. There won't be a master AI that controls every aspect of our lives, he says; instead, we''ll develop multiple machine intelligences for different suites of needs, and they''ll be utterly mundane -- and already are. When we execute a google search for recipes or ask it for directions, we are in fact helping train and benefit Google's machine-learning algorithisms: we are teaching them what we're most likely to be looking for. Those ""Related Products"" that Amazon helpfully shows you are also an early example of machine intelligence, as Amazon's database learns your shopping preferences and attempts to predict what you would like next.Two more concepts from the book worth sharing quickly here are Accessing and Tracking. Tracking sounds obvious, but Kelley isn't just talking about website cookies or Google & Apple recording your movements through your phone's GPS. By tracking, Kelly means that the door is open to quantifying every aspect of our lives. People can already use their phone's apps to track how much they walk per day, how well they asleep, and record their diets; they can already use phones to monitor their heartbeat; phones in the near future will be able to monitor blood pressure and blood sugar, as well. Cheap cameras and cloud storage mean that we can record more moments of our lives, and later poke through them at our leisure as if they were files in a drawer. The cloud is a key aspect of much of what Kelly covers, but it is especially prominent in the ""Accessing"" chapter, in which he writes that we're moving away from an ownership society. We no longer need to own a car; we just need access to one. Apps and tech allow us to share resources, and in some cases the resources are becoming so cheap that they can be offered for free: no one needs to struggle with an ersatz Office clone when they can use the freely available OfficeOnline.There are ten real concepts in total (there are two more chapters, ""questioning"" and ""becoming"", but they're less about content than thinking about our relationship with content), and the author purposely avoids mentioning any downsides. He takes it for granted that everything can be used to malicious purposes, but that would be another book entirely. (A book like Future Crimes II, perhaps...) I also liked the chapters on Interacting and Screening; one addressed the future mundane role of virtual reality and augmented reality, in that games and movies will become more ""real"", and our travels in the real world will have a digital overlay adding more information -- the ubiquity of screens dovetails with that rather nicely. One disturbing possibility Kelly mentions is having glasses or ocular implants with different apps installed; one can read people's faces and match them to a driver's license database. The other concepts in the book are extensions of minor things happening now, like remixing and filtering.As someone who can be both entranced and repelled by the promises of technological -- completely fascinated on a abstract level, distantly horrified at a human level -- I found The Inevitable enthralling reading. The author is sloppy with language, however, using ""socialism"" and ""collective"" when 'cooperative' would have been more accurate. For some reason he thinks libertarian individualism is contradicted by Wikipedia , when it's merely individuals voluntarily working together toward a common goal. Socialism makes me think more of involuntary mass actions, like taxes and slavery."

252,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69801085-lee-kuiper,3,"I’m a big fan of Kevin Kelly’s books but, honestly, this one was a little disappointing. It’s touted as his “most readable book” but I now take that to mean his “most prosaic book”; having traded big, complex ideas, rigorous research, depth and detail for a conventional summarization of current digital trends based on his experience and observation. Typically, Kelly’s books are expansive, mind-expanding, and overflowing with synthesized research but this felt like (what I imagine it’s like to read) a  For Dummies  manual. Perhaps Current Digital Cultural Trends For Dummies.  The heart seems to be lacking.After starting excitedly, I read through the whole thing rather listlessly. This book is a lot more mainstream than any of his other books. It has a broader appeal but for someone who already enjoys his niche books (such as myself) this is much more watered down and straightforward. It’s a good book for the unacquainted/anyone hoping to get a solid understanding of the general direction that technology in culture is heading. However, for people already immersed in conversations and ideas about technology and our immediate future, don’t expect too much new information.Despite, ostensibly, being about “the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future,” it talks more about current trends and then extrapolates those trends vaguely into the near future. The predictions are not very exciting, nor are they bold or very risky —just like predicting the winner of a game in the 4th quarter: its safe and usually quite accurate. Although there are occasional interesting insights, seldom was it very fascinating. And only at the very end did it feel “provocative.” That being said, any book by Kevin Kelly is worth reading. I’m being too hard on this book because his previous books set my expectations WAY too high. Also, I’m constantly reading and listening to books/podcasts about technology, the future, and culture so that most of the ideas here were old hat for me.Kelly is always quite optimistic about where things are heading which is refreshing especially since he has been so completely immersed in the constantly changing field of digital technology for the last 30+ years. He knows his stuff and if anyone is in a place to tell us what is going to be “inevitable” in the near future likely there is no one better than Kelly. I almost gave this book four stars because the last two chapters were quite good (especially the final chapter on “Beginning” which is only, unfortunately, 7 pages) but the truth is I was not enthralled for the vast majority of the 297 pages so, realistically, it’s a fair three stars. I do greatly recommend Kevin Kelly’s other books: What Technology Wants and Out of Control"

In his 2016 book, Kevin Kelly provides a detailed and optimistic guide through twelve technological innovations/imperatives that will shape the next three decades, ultimately further transforming our lives.Why Should You Read This Book?You should read this book if you are interested in better understanding what our lives will look like over the next thirty years. And you should absolutely read this book if you are interested in understanding where the business or industry you currently work in may be headed.It’s simply amazing that much of the technology needed to drive these transformative changes are already in motion today. And if only half of what Kevin Kelly says comes true, these forces will revolutionize the way we work, learn, buy, communicate, and generally live with each other.Final Thoughts:If you embrace the optimistic side of the transformative force that is all things technology, you will love this book. If you take a more pessimistic view of what technology might eventually do to us and our world in the future, you will probably not like this book. Personally, I embrace the prospects that today’s and tomorrow’s technology hold.

For the innovator, the curious and the skeptic. I went through three phases reading this book:1. Skepticism - Before starting to read: ""What kind of bullshit is this?""2. Obviosity - When starting to read: ""Well, duh!""3. Revelation - After reading for a while: ""Oh, shit - Yes! I can't believe I didn't see that one!""This might not make much sense, but to summarize I think this book is an amazing summary and ""prediction"" of what our world is currently moving towards. It describes not too much of specific technologies, but general principles and ""forces"" that are currently in motion (beneath current technological advances)."

A typical chapter provides a condensed history, a summary of the current situation replete with philosophical quips and staggering statistics, and caps off with a look at how the trend will change our lives in the future. I've read reviews that dismiss the book as pedestrian, and while I can understand hardcore tech geeks being disappointed with the offerings on hand, I still learned something in every chapter.Across all the trends covered, decentralization seems to be omnipresent. The author predicts much of the power we allocate to governments and corporations will inevitably be passed to the collective. While Kelly doesn't touch on the subject himself, I suspect this inexorability has corporations struggling to retain as much power as possible for as long as possible, giving way to phenomena such as the current endangerment of net neutrality.There were far too many thoughts, observations, musings and predictions to remember, but the one thing I could take from this book was Kelly's optimism about the future. This technology is going to make our lives better, not worse. As bad as things seem now with smartphone zombies and lethargic gamer kids, these trends are going to make the world a better place.**(reviewer's note) Unless of course climate change kills us all."

This book was a great insight into the possibilities of the near as well as not-to-distant future. The author thankfully avoided computer-speak so I easily understood all that he said.

In this book, he distills those changes into 12 forces that he thinks will change our world and us. He might be right. Most of his forecasts are reasonable projections of current trends. His ideas are thought provoking and worthy of attention; we can help shape the future rather than just let it happen.One minor nit. I sometimes wished the author was more direct. Don't build an elaborate construct around a simple idea. An economy of expression is better that too much.Notes while reading:===== IntroductionThe general trends are inevitable, not the specific details.===== 1. BecomingAs the pace of change increases, we are frequently/always learning something new or different. We are becoming a little different. New Operating Systems, devices, applications, opportunities, and the constant stream of updates for security, or bug fixes, or tracking, or privacy, compel us to keep learning, adapting.===== 2. CognifyingThe nature of thinking has changed with time. Memorization, spoken words, written words, science; now we have big data, algorithms, machine learning, search; new ways to understand ourselves and our context. What next? Well, maybe: cognified music, laundry, marketing, real estate, nursing, construction, ethics, toys, sports, ... chuckle, snarf, burp.Four categories for worker replacement:- Jobs that robots can do better then humans- Jobs that humans cannot do- Jobs we didn't know we wanted done- Jobs only humans can do - at first===== 3. FlowingWith old computers we had ""batch"" jobs; then daily tasks; now on-line, interactive, up-to-the-second. The flow has changed. So have the metaphores: desktops, folders, then web pages and links, now the flow of twitter, feeds, streaming video, and similar. We expect free, fast, and accurate.What is worth paying for?- Immediacy- Personalization- Interpretation- Authenticity- Accessibility- Embodiment- Patronage- Discoverability===== 4. ScreeningFrom hard-copy to screens, all around us, becoming more feature-full.===== 5. AccessingAccess replaces ownership. Dematerialization accelerates, and leads to more on-demand access. Decentralization, or flattening grows. Platforms enable more innovation and dematerialization but maybe centralize the underlying tech.===== 6. SharingNew, or at least in more use, are various forms of social interaction.- Sharing- Cooperation- Collaboration. eg: linux, 3D printer plans, ...- Collectivism. The power of the individual vs. the power of the state is not a zero sum game. Aim to ""maximize both the autonomy of the individual and the power of the people working together."" We want the government to be more ""open"". Organizations can be a hybrid of bottom-up and top-down. Let everybody be an editor. Wikipedia started as bottom-up and gradually added the top-down component, ie the senior editors.===== 7. FilteringWe simply cannot process everything. We must filter. Currently we can filter by gatekeepers, intermediates, curators, brands, government, culture, friends, and other methods. And it's getting harder. Recomendation systems help, but are not enough. Plus, we want just enough unusual, different inputs to keep us fresh.Our attention is a limiting factor. Should we be paid for our attention?===== 8. RemixingWe see plenty of examples of remix in every-day life: music, video, books, movies, and more. Some has a profit motive, some do not.===== 9. InteractingVirtual reality (VR) is now low cost, interactive, and provides a sense of being there, presence. We will be interacting with everything. Internet of Things, IoT.===== 10. TrackingSelf-tracking, first for fitness, later for lifestream. IoT will/could add more data. We can know ourselves better. When aggregated, we can know ""us"" much better. Medical studies could look at vastly more ""individuals"" that previous.Commercial and government tracking are another dimension. Data could come from: cars, highways, taxis, airlines and trains, drones, postal mail, utilities, phones, CCTV, smart homes, interactive devices, loyalty cards, IRS, credit cards, e-banking, photo recognition, and much more. Technological rather than social or cultural.Page 260. ""Ubiquitous surveillance is inevitable."" Shape the nature of tracking. More symmetrical or coveillance. ""... is there room for anonymity?"" Yes, but in very limited amounts. Eg: we need whistle-blowers.===== 11. QuestioningOur ability to get good quality answers to our questions leads to more questions. The nature of what is now possible leads to more questions. Answers are cheap, so ask away.===== 12. BeginningThe author says we are at the beginning of a new way of living. It might have been interesting to have the author contrast this time with other historic times, like the industrial revolution, or the invention of the printing press, or, much earlier, the ability to record our thoughts on paper, or its predecessors."

Even if Kevin Kelly is dead wrong on his predictions (which is highly unlikely), you can't help but imagine what it'd be like if he was right. I wonder what he thinks of dumb solar roadways. I was surprised not to hear anything about that in this book. But note to self: reread this book in 2050 to see if and how much he was right. Basically think of Ironman's world and that's a glimpse of what we'd have in a few decades. I like the concept of renting everything in the future. With the rise of AirBnb and Uber it is certainly heading that way. Also it will be helpful because we won't take as many things for granite like we do. For example, the paintings/pictures we have on our walls will be exchanged every month or year or so. It will teach us to live a Minimalist lifestyle (click on that link and read that 11 minute article by Mark Manson. It's pretty neat). Smart Shirts are going to be coolo. All of this is happening because of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us.As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think that technology is like a Deity. In fact, I think if I weren't a traditional believer and if I were perhaps agnostic I would, indeed, believe that technology is God and He's slowly revealing Himself to us until we can fully realize and comprehend it. Almost like Optimus Prime. And why not?This book reminded me a lot of the first part of the book I, Robot when they're on Mars.We're resistant to upgrades and updates for our devices but he points out that they're like hygiene for our tech. I hadn't thought of it that way. And like we learn in The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century there is a higher call for greater honesty in our world. Especially as things progress towards the Cloud and everything becomes searchable. Time to start cleaning up your act people. If you haven't already. Vanity trumps privacy after all."

Like most books that are making a projection about what will happen in the future, this will probably have a short shelf life. But for now I think it is one of the better attempts to make sense of the trends in technology and their implications. This should not be taken to mean I agree with everything Kelly writes, far from it. But he writes well, thoughtfully and in an engaging way. So, it is at least enjoyable to read. Futurists have a tendency to 2 extremes - those seeing only Utopia and those seeing only doom. Kelly is more inclined to the Utopian viewpoint, although with occasional sections on the challenges of getting there. I have no doubt, to steal Kelly's title that the future is inevitable. That's the easy part, the hard bit is working out which future it will be. Kelly paints a believable picture from a technological perspective, but I think underplays the challenges in getting there and the social implications. A lot of people are going to push back, possibly in fairly assertive ways, on the future he suggests. I suspect if you are the sort of person who is constantly reading about or engaged in technology this book will tell you nothing new - other than being a nice, condensed summary. On the other hand, if you are like me, someone who feels I ought to be interested in understanding the future but generally find much which is written dull and naive, you may enjoy this book somewhat more. "
275,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134111-steve-stanton,5,"Veteran social commentator Kevin Kelly has written a new book about the future of technology that will be a primer for science fiction novelists going forward. Indeed, the title resonates with the final words of my own recent novel: “Destiny was inevitable now,” and the reason, as Kevin Kelly so carefully articulates, is that future trends have already been established! Proprietary AI systems already control what you see when you Google search, tailor what you view on Facebook, manipulate what you buy on Amazon, and make most of the money in the world. VR technology has now reached the tipping point necessary to create an interconnective virtual domain that will transform the primitive internet beyond our wildest dreams, and bring the price down to free. When corporate AI machines eventually converge and begin feeding on exponentially increasing global metadata, a new symbiotic holos will arise that will extend beyond human consciousness, (dubbed “mothership” in my sci-fi novel FREENET,) a tool that becomes an end in itself, and also the beginning. Kelly's twelve defining postulates may seem somewhat artificial, and perhaps overlap a bit, but his premises are solid and his inspiration undeniable. What I like most about Kelly's view is his optimism. He throws the reader into the future by reminding us that the net is just waking up now and learning to crawl. These are the glory days of youthful innovation that we will soon look back on with envy from a standing position. "

Because it was both validating (I mean even by writing a Goodreads review I AM being the future) and challenging (I'm not ready for my AI overlords just yet). And reminded me of why I have a secret love of spec fic. And more than once I thought about my boy Joaquin in the excellent movie Her.On the other hand negative stars because, frankly, there is nothing about Kevin Kelly that seems woke and the back of the book was all testimonials fromWhite Men congratulating themselves basically. PASS THE BUCKET. Also Kevin Kelly was one time asked to help Steven Spielberg imagine the future for the average movie minority report and he mentions it in numerous chapters. So I guess even futurists can't get over their past glory days, ahe?"

This one is an extrapolation of current trends and has a lot of interesting speculations and predictions. But like Yogi Berra said, ""it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future"". Or Jenny Holzer's Truism: ""The future is stupid"". Things may be veering more in the direction of the movie Idiocracy. With the current political situation it's probably worth rewatching as a counterpoint to The Inevitable. "
279,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,4,"Kevin Kelly gives us a glimpse of the future organized around 12 technological trends that shape our world today, and obviously will shape the future. It is quite readable. To each trend he offers historical support to explain the idea, and in most cases offers a cautious, yet incredible, vision of where that might take us. In some chapters he gives us a vaguely disturbing vignette of how your day might go in the future. Both fantastic and credible at the same time.I really enjoyed this book. His method seems adequate, and he punctuates the explanations with relevant anecdotes. It introduced me to a few things happening now I was not aware of, and certainly feel more prepared to watch for these future trends. If you are in the position of needing to know where our culture is headed, you will find plenty of value in reading this book.My notes on the twelve trends:1. Becoming: We are all perpetual newbies. Things are changing continuously and automatically, and we can't anticipate the future, but the winner will be those who can adapt quickly. This is exactly the main point of Alvin Toffler's Future Shock written in 1970 -- strange he made no mention of it. (He starts with a common fallacy about thermodynamics, but it is unimportant to his thesis, see the details below.)2. Cognifying: ""The business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI."" AI is developing all around us, but not human intelligence but other KINDS of intelligence he calls alien intelligence. We might need to prevent consciousness to get the kind of intelligence we want. Many jobs will be replaced by robots, but humans will move into the job of training and running the robots. 3. Flowing: Digital tech copies everything it accesses, so the old ideas of purchase and ownership are going away. Spotify. Netflix. Instead 8 'generatives' that add value to a free stream: [1] immediacy: you get before others, [2] personalization: your copy is specialized, [3] interpretation: added meaning, [4] authenticity, yours is real and not just a copy, [5] accessibility: they organize it all for you, [6] embodiment: physically shared experience, [7] patronage: supporting the arts in new wasy, [8] discoverability (TV guide was worth more than the tv networks). There are four stages: (1) fixed rare things that get copied, (2) free ubiquitous availability (3) active sharing and services, (4) full engagement of flowing by all parties and co-creation.4. Screening: differences between book media, and screens as an interface to knowledge.5. Accessing: Uber is not about providing more cars, but easy access to cars and drivers that happen to be available at the moment. AirBnB. Why own anything? Why not just access what you need only when you need it?6. Sharing: (1) simple sharing moves to (2) cooperation toward common goals, to (3) collaboration which is organized and coordinated and finally to (4) collectivism: a self-organizing group of people who all receive benefit of their own initiative. Open source software projects are the best example. Not capitalist or communist but something new and different. Kickstart.7. Filtering: ""In a world of abundance, the only scarcity is human attention"" How to separate the wheat from the chafe? We might even be paid for our attention. 8. Remixing: mashups. fan fiction. Full blow video remixing, excerpting, referencing, etc need some inventions as we move into full video collectivism. Property and ownership problems. 9. Interacting: it is not just media, but two way communication as well. Second Life. VR interactions. Augmented reality. (1) we will have more sensors and senses, (2) hey will be increasingly intimate, (3) it will be increasingly immersive. And, yes, ""Goodreads"" was mentioned as an example.10. Tracking. Quantified self. Digital technology makes it cheap to record and then analyze. Surveillance is inevitable, but will the access be one-sided? Is coveillance possible? True anonymity always brings out the worst in people. ""Privacy can be gained only by trust, and trust requires persistent identity."" From tracking will come emergence of something new: ""There is no case in our experience where the difference of a factor of a trillion doesn't make a qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, difference."" 11. Questioning: Google and wikipedia answer 2 trillion questions every year, but something else: ""the impossible things happening now are in every case due to the emergence of a new level of organization that did not exist before."" We have more access to unusual things than ever before. Discoveries depend on asking ""good questions.""12. Beginning: we are becoming a planetary network of intelligence and artificial intelligence, he calls the ""holos."" What will become we can't even imagine. Today we have only the beginning.I can't let Kelly slip with a common misconception. He cites the 2nd law of thermodynamics, saying that it means that everything is flling apart slowly. This is NOT what the law says. The fallacy is thinking that there is a smooth distribution of the disorganization. Within a closed system, some parts will actually get MORE organized, while the overall net organization decreases. This is a nit that I have to pick because so many people make this same mistake. However, it is unimportant to Kelly's thesis in any way, so just a footnote here."
280,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"No one can say where exactly a ball thrown in the air will land, but at least on Earth it’s a certainty that a thrown ball will land. Kevin Kelly, formerly of Wired magazine, can’t say exactly what the future will look like, but he is confident enough to predict what trends will continue based on present technology. Our global civilizations have been radically transformed from the 1970s til now, but computers weren’t the catalyst for all the change we see around us. Networked computers were. By themselves, the first computers were house-sized calculators and overpriced filing cabinets; when they began exchanging information freely, magic happened. What world-changing wonders can we expect from the current trends in technology?First, says Kelly, is “becoming”: In the late eighties, Zygmunt Bauman introduced the term liquid modernity to our sociological lexicon. In previous generations, changes happened slowly enough that our societies were able to digest them and establish a new normal. As the 19th gave way to the 20th century, however, the rate of change has quickened to the point that a new normal is impossible: societiy is revolutionized multiple times within a single generation, with the effect that there is no stable ground to be had, no new normal to be reached. Now our products are no longer discrete products, but services that are continually being changed -- think of Office 365, or even Windows 10. Windows 10 is rumored to be the last Windows, not because Microsoft is retiring from the OS business, but because Windows 10's frequent updates constantly add new features that would have otherwise been developed and delivered in a new Windows. Our phones, too, are not merely the device that came out of the original box: as we add apps and accessories, we change their nature.The second big-ticket item in here is ""cognifying"", by which Kelly means using machine intelligence for everything. There won't be a master AI that controls every aspect of our lives, he says; instead, we''ll develop multiple machine intelligences for different suites of needs, and they''ll be utterly mundane -- and already are. When we execute a google search for recipes or ask it for directions, we are in fact helping train and benefit Google's machine-learning algorithisms: we are teaching them what we're most likely to be looking for. Those ""Related Products"" that Amazon helpfully shows you are also an early example of machine intelligence, as Amazon's database learns your shopping preferences and attempts to predict what you would like next.Two more concepts from the book worth sharing quickly here are Accessing and Tracking. Tracking sounds obvious, but Kelley isn't just talking about website cookies or Google & Apple recording your movements through your phone's GPS. By tracking, Kelly means that the door is open to quantifying every aspect of our lives. People can already use their phone's apps to track how much they walk per day, how well they asleep, and record their diets; they can already use phones to monitor their heartbeat; phones in the near future will be able to monitor blood pressure and blood sugar, as well. Cheap cameras and cloud storage mean that we can record more moments of our lives, and later poke through them at our leisure as if they were files in a drawer. The cloud is a key aspect of much of what Kelly covers, but it is especially prominent in the ""Accessing"" chapter, in which he writes that we're moving away from an ownership society. We no longer need to own a car; we just need access to one. Apps and tech allow us to share resources, and in some cases the resources are becoming so cheap that they can be offered for free: no one needs to struggle with an ersatz Office clone when they can use the freely available OfficeOnline.There are ten real concepts in total (there are two more chapters, ""questioning"" and ""becoming"", but they're less about content than thinking about our relationship with content), and the author purposely avoids mentioning any downsides. He takes it for granted that everything can be used to malicious purposes, but that would be another book entirely. (A book like Future Crimes II, perhaps...) I also liked the chapters on Interacting and Screening; one addressed the future mundane role of virtual reality and augmented reality, in that games and movies will become more ""real"", and our travels in the real world will have a digital overlay adding more information -- the ubiquity of screens dovetails with that rather nicely. One disturbing possibility Kelly mentions is having glasses or ocular implants with different apps installed; one can read people's faces and match them to a driver's license database. The other concepts in the book are extensions of minor things happening now, like remixing and filtering.As someone who can be both entranced and repelled by the promises of technological -- completely fascinated on a abstract level, distantly horrified at a human level -- I found The Inevitable enthralling reading. The author is sloppy with language, however, using ""socialism"" and ""collective"" when 'cooperative' would have been more accurate. For some reason he thinks libertarian individualism is contradicted by Wikipedia , when it's merely individuals voluntarily working together toward a common goal. Socialism makes me think more of involuntary mass actions, like taxes and slavery."

282,0143110373,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69801085-lee-kuiper,3,"I’m a big fan of Kevin Kelly’s books but, honestly, this one was a little disappointing. It’s touted as his “most readable book” but I now take that to mean his “most prosaic book”; having traded big, complex ideas, rigorous research, depth and detail for a conventional summarization of current digital trends based on his experience and observation. Typically, Kelly’s books are expansive, mind-expanding, and overflowing with synthesized research but this felt like (what I imagine it’s like to read) a  For Dummies  manual. Perhaps Current Digital Cultural Trends For Dummies.  The heart seems to be lacking.After starting excitedly, I read through the whole thing rather listlessly. This book is a lot more mainstream than any of his other books. It has a broader appeal but for someone who already enjoys his niche books (such as myself) this is much more watered down and straightforward. It’s a good book for the unacquainted/anyone hoping to get a solid understanding of the general direction that technology in culture is heading. However, for people already immersed in conversations and ideas about technology and our immediate future, don’t expect too much new information.Despite, ostensibly, being about “the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future,” it talks more about current trends and then extrapolates those trends vaguely into the near future. The predictions are not very exciting, nor are they bold or very risky —just like predicting the winner of a game in the 4th quarter: its safe and usually quite accurate. Although there are occasional interesting insights, seldom was it very fascinating. And only at the very end did it feel “provocative.” That being said, any book by Kevin Kelly is worth reading. I’m being too hard on this book because his previous books set my expectations WAY too high. Also, I’m constantly reading and listening to books/podcasts about technology, the future, and culture so that most of the ideas here were old hat for me.Kelly is always quite optimistic about where things are heading which is refreshing especially since he has been so completely immersed in the constantly changing field of digital technology for the last 30+ years. He knows his stuff and if anyone is in a place to tell us what is going to be “inevitable” in the near future likely there is no one better than Kelly. I almost gave this book four stars because the last two chapters were quite good (especially the final chapter on “Beginning” which is only, unfortunately, 7 pages) but the truth is I was not enthralled for the vast majority of the 297 pages so, realistically, it’s a fair three stars. I do greatly recommend Kevin Kelly’s other books: What Technology Wants and Out of Control"

In his 2016 book, Kevin Kelly provides a detailed and optimistic guide through twelve technological innovations/imperatives that will shape the next three decades, ultimately further transforming our lives.Why Should You Read This Book?You should read this book if you are interested in better understanding what our lives will look like over the next thirty years. And you should absolutely read this book if you are interested in understanding where the business or industry you currently work in may be headed.It’s simply amazing that much of the technology needed to drive these transformative changes are already in motion today. And if only half of what Kevin Kelly says comes true, these forces will revolutionize the way we work, learn, buy, communicate, and generally live with each other.Final Thoughts:If you embrace the optimistic side of the transformative force that is all things technology, you will love this book. If you take a more pessimistic view of what technology might eventually do to us and our world in the future, you will probably not like this book. Personally, I embrace the prospects that today’s and tomorrow’s technology hold.

This AI to be trained on human data and interactions with the holos, through search data, total surveillance data, consumer preference data and the 100s of times we are logged daily. Just as the nature of the internet made Napster and Facebook inevitable, so too does it make infinite remixing and the holos inevitable. The technology for 99pc of future inventions already exists and it is simply remixing of preexisting technologies that will lead to these inventons.

For the innovator, the curious and the skeptic. I went through three phases reading this book:1. Skepticism - Before starting to read: ""What kind of bullshit is this?""2. Obviosity - When starting to read: ""Well, duh!""3. Revelation - After reading for a while: ""Oh, shit - Yes! I can't believe I didn't see that one!""This might not make much sense, but to summarize I think this book is an amazing summary and ""prediction"" of what our world is currently moving towards. It describes not too much of specific technologies, but general principles and ""forces"" that are currently in motion (beneath current technological advances)."

A typical chapter provides a condensed history, a summary of the current situation replete with philosophical quips and staggering statistics, and caps off with a look at how the trend will change our lives in the future. I've read reviews that dismiss the book as pedestrian, and while I can understand hardcore tech geeks being disappointed with the offerings on hand, I still learned something in every chapter.Across all the trends covered, decentralization seems to be omnipresent. The author predicts much of the power we allocate to governments and corporations will inevitably be passed to the collective. While Kelly doesn't touch on the subject himself, I suspect this inexorability has corporations struggling to retain as much power as possible for as long as possible, giving way to phenomena such as the current endangerment of net neutrality.There were far too many thoughts, observations, musings and predictions to remember, but the one thing I could take from this book was Kelly's optimism about the future. This technology is going to make our lives better, not worse. As bad as things seem now with smartphone zombies and lethargic gamer kids, these trends are going to make the world a better place.**(reviewer's note) Unless of course climate change kills us all."

This book was a great insight into the possibilities of the near as well as not-to-distant future. The author thankfully avoided computer-speak so I easily understood all that he said.
