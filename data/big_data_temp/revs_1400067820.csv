0,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5472385-val-delane,5,"Taleb seems constitutionally angry, dismissive, and contrarian--sometimes to the point of being an asshole. However, one cannot deny his talent of conveying crucially important concepts in a clear and entertaining fashion. I would rather have every one of my biases and heuristics kicked around so I will reconsider where they came from--and whether to keep them--than be coddled and comforted.Perhaps the best heuristic reminders I received from this book: 1/ Invest (trust) in people, not plans. 2/ Favor broad diversification so as to reduce negative exposure to any given event. 3/ Look for optionality; rank things according to optionality, preferably with open-ended payoffs. 4/ Options that benefit from volatility, disruption, and entropy are the best--but keep your ""skin in the game;"" never transfer your fragility to someone else. 5/ Eschew intervention unless it is completely obvious that lack of intervention in a given critical case is much more dangerous. 6/ If you generate more than one* reason to do something, you're trying to convince yourself; this is a strong sign to wait or even reject the plan; that said, if you have a single excellent reason, go for it and don't be afraid of failure. 7/ You learn more from failure (""subtractive knowledge"") than success anyway.(* My personal threshold is three reasons.)Favorite quote from this book: ""The worst problem of modernity lies in the malignant transfer of fragility and antifragility from one party to the other, with one getting the benefits, the other (unwittingly) getting the harm, with such transfer facilitated by the growing wedge between the ethical and the legal.""My own aphorisms inspired by this book: 1/ To add is folly; to abstain, wise; subtract, divine. 2/ All models have at least one too many degrees of freedom, and all models have at least one wrong premise. Therefore, every model can be optimized to a single-variable function that doesn't work. "
1,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2797164-andrew-shaffer,1,"The author goes to extreme lengths to make up new words or turn common sense wisdom on its head. ""Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder and stressors.... Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile."" Really? The word ""adaptable"" wouldn't suffice? ""Antifragile"" is not the last word he makes up, either. Instead of writing the word ""brave,"" for instance, he substitutes ""nonmeek."" In the future, I would suggest the author try using a thesaurus, or as he probably calls it, an ""antidictionary.""Elsewhere, the author launches into lengthy diatribes against academia, which he ""tried"" but found university life filled with ""petty obsessions, envy, and icy-cold hatreds."" He says that business, in contrast, ""brings out the best in people...[and makes people] forgiving, honest, loving, and trusting."" It was at this point, on page 17, that I contemplated throwing the book against the wall (for the first, but not last time). I ultimately never threw it, because at nearly 500 pages, I was worried about damaging my apartment's drywall."
2,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10909889-pete-welter,5,"""Antifragile"" is a book that is difficult to summarize. I'll try to mention a few major ideas. If they come out confusing, it's my fault - read the book :)Unlike many books of this genre, which spend 200 pages padding a 5 page idea, Antifragile is a fractal of a book, taking it's central ideas and examining and applying them in myriad ways. In that way, it as rich on page 400 as it is on page 2.Taleb is an independent thinker who is almost impossible to categorize. In fact he revels in question some of the most basic assumptions of modern life. There are times I find him pompous and nearly conceited, and times when you realize that in going after the people and ideas that he does that he needs a very thick skin a quite a bit of confidence. He backs up views with layers of research and technical material. When I find him at his best though, is when he takes an idea that you've taken for granted and finds a dozen ways to show you why it's farcical.If you've ever seen him on television or on video, do not take that persona as the one in this book. Although he defends his style, I've found his public appearances on the whole pretty awful. I saw him on Fareed Zakaria's show the other day, and even though I was 3/4 through his book, I could still barely understand his points. Taleb though, would say that's by design - that by having to work for understanding, his viewers are forced to stay for cognitively engaged - I don't buy it. He is a much better author than he is a speaker, and he probably likes it that way.""Antifragile"" is about fragility and it's converse, antifragility. In fragile systems the benefits are small and visible, and the the side effects are potentially severe and invisible.Taleb illustrates the basics of fragile/antifragile with the example of package to be shipped. If you were to pack glasses in the box, even carefully, you would still know that the box would not respond well to disturbances like being dropped or mishandled. Glasses are fragile. If you were to pack a steel cube in the box, you would have no such problem. Drop it or whatever, the cube is ""robust"", not changed by disturbances. However, imagine if there was an item you put in the box that was improved by disturbances, that was made stronger or more capable by being mishandled. That is the true opposite of fragile, or as Taleb refers to this property - antifragile.What are real life examples of antifragility? Evolution for one, functions better when being put under stress. Entrepreneurial ventures too, are made better by an uncertain environment, because they are organizations designed to learn and change from stresses. Sometimes, a system is antifragile, even though it's components aren't; organisms might die because of stress, but the entire ecosystem is made stronger over the long run.A key point he makes is that in our rush to help, fix, or support system - in short, *do something*, we often make systems more fragile in the long run. One of his primary examples is medicine. In our efforts to make relatively small improvements to peoples lives through intervention, our health in the long run becomes more fragile, subject to the long term effects of drugs and therapies, and by the lifestyles that continue to enable.His point is that you bet on the most tested system, and the most tested system we know of is Mother Nature and evolution. Anything we do needs to be judged against systems that had millions of years of stresses. This is not to say that modern medicine is a bad thing, because when it is helpful, it is *very* helpful, but when it it used for relatively minor improvements, the risks outweigh the rewards.Because of this, he is a strong advocate of intervention by subtraction. Instead of finding better cures for diabetes, modify diets to remove sugary foods. Indeed, stopping smoking has been one of the most successful medical interventions of the last 40 years. He introduced me to the term iatrogrenic - making things worse by doing something.The essence of the Black Swan - the event that is so rare that it's never been observed (or maybe maybe never occurred) before, is the fallacy that the absence of evidence is evidence of absence. These are not the same thing. However, we often treat them as synonymous, until something totally unforseen happens. And that's part of the point. Unforseen events are not failures of prediction - they are simply unforseeable. We need to ready our systems that we cannot anticipate - that is, built systems that are at least robust, and that are hopefully antifragile.Finally, he feels that the major cause of fragility in modern life is lack of ""skin in the game"" when one set of people become antifragile and transfer the fragility to another set of people. Some examples include managers of large corporations who do well no matter how their company does or the effect it has on the general economy. Writers and pundits who push views but have are in no way affected no matter if they are right or wrong. Politicians who enact complex policies but who are in no way affected by them, and who in fact use this complexity to become highly compensated once they leave office. This last point should especially be taken to heart. Keep an eye out for who is saying and doing things, and how much stake they personally have in whether they are correct. If the answer is zero, or even worse, they are betting against themselves, then they are not to be taken seriously.Overall, this was a book that made me re-evaluate who sets of assumptions I've made about how the world works, which for me is the ultimate test of any book of this type. It's not an easy read, and there is material in there to challenge almost any reader (philosophy, mathematics, business, economics to name a few), but it is well worth the trip."
3,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914137-jay,1,"Taleb has some great ideas. Unfortunately, he also has what he calls ""FU money,"" which allows him to do what he wants without suffering fools. Which, for Taleb, includes pretty much anyone, including editors, whose help he could use.When are two similar ideas not really the same? Taleb takes the human immune response and the muscle hypertrophy response to resistance training as examples of the same thing--systems responding to stress by getting better able to handle the stress. And they do have that in common. But they are different--and very specialized--systemic responses. What do they have in common? What can we learn from them, apart from the fact that solving problems is good?Taleb later argues that avoiding stress is bad--that it prevents the organism from developing the ability to manage the stress that will eventually return in a stronger form. But it's not clear how the good system designed to deal with stress differ from the bad ones. If exposure to small stresses is good because it allows you to overcome the stress, why is overcoming the stress bad? The famously complex immune system, with its unfortunate side effects (allergies, auto-immune disease) looks a lot like the sort of overengineered over-protective solution with unintended consequences Taleb later mocks.Moving on from the organism, Taleb's next example is evolution. He does acknowledge that the organism and the species have very different views on what is good. The species is antifragile, and it thrives, often, when particular organisms do not. Selection pressures kill individuals, but they strengthen the group, argues Taleb. But selection pressures also wipe out species. And genera. And orders. And so on. And they'll wipe out all of life, possibly. Meanwhile, they do create conditions that result in the magic of evolution, but the awards go to the survivors, those most successful at avoiding or handling stress, not those who subject themselves to the most stress. There is no ""Nature"" that ""likes"" stress (one of Taleb's more troublesome figures of speech). I don't have time to pick apart every example and argument he makes, nor would it be possible, as each one reappears several times in a vague skein of association that prevents the clear development of any single idea. Here is where we most feel the absence of the editor. Didn't he already say that? Didn't he define that term before? No? Could this book be boiled down by about 70%?I do have to mention the use of math. He often suggests that the reader skip a section (would that I had) as it is more ""technical."" But there was no difference that I could see between the ""technical"" and ""non-technical"" parts: both were vague and repetitive. There's even a ""technical"" appendix, which I turned to quite avidly, hoping for more concrete development of Taleb's ideas. But no. All I found was a brilliant exhibit of how to detect math BS: if an author provides an equation that includes variables that are not defined anywhere in the text, then the equation is meaningless and the author is blowing smoke. In the economic world, Taleb is a bit more persuasive. The law of unintended consequences is well-known, and it's no surprise that efforts to protect this market or that industry are usually lobbyist-hatched schemes to assist those least in need of assistance. Where firms are able to succeed in spite of challenges, they have often grown strong enough to challenge firms grown in the hothouse environment of closed markets. If Taleb had written about this, it might have been as good a book as The Black Swan. But, with his FU money and his goal of becoming a philosopher, he must have decided that was too pedestrian."
4,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3591281-alfredo,1,"This book has been such a disappointment...It started absolutely great and has an idea (antifragility) that is worthy and notable and interesting. Wait, let me back up from the beginning: I could not finish this book.When I read non fiction I tend to stick to certain rules:1) I want to learn from the books I read. I tend not to read Mathematics, for example, except in formal context, since normally when I read Math being exposed to the general public I noticed how poorly they are really explaining the concepts.2) I don't read books if I agree with the conclusion. For example, since I am an atheist, I seldom read books on the subject of why we should be atheists, I enjoy the rest of Richard Dawkins works.3) I refused to be bored. Despite the previous points I do not read books on astrology, for example, because I am certain they will not convince me of their truth (I won't learn from them), but even more certain I will find them utterly and completely boring.This book started as an amazing jewel. A book where I was reaching for the, thankfully virtual, dictionary almost in every page. When I read the page, almost at the beginning of the book, that said:""Now we aim--after some work--to connect in the reader's mind, with a single thread, elements seemingly far apart, such as Cato the Elder, Nietzsche, Thales of Miletus, the potency of the system of city-states, the sustainability of artisans, the process of discovery, the onesidedness of opacity, financial derivatives, antibiotic resistance, bottom-up systems, Socrates' invitation to overrationalize, how to lecture birds, obsessive love, Darwinian evolution, the mathematical concept of Jensen's inequality, optionality and option theory, the idea of ancestral heuristics, the works of Joseph de Maistre and Edmund Burke, Wittgenstein's antirationalism, the fraudulent theories of the economics establishment, tinkering and bricolage, terrorism exacerbated by death of its members, an apologia for artisanal societies, the ethical flaws of the middle class, Paleo-style workouts (and nutrition), the idea of medical iatrogenics, the glorious notion of the magnificent (megalopsychon), my obsession with the idea of convexity (and my phobia of concavity), the late-2000s banking and economic crisis, the misunderstanding of redundancy, the difference between tourist and flâneur, etc. All in one single--and, I am certain, simple--thread.""I thought I was in for the biggest treat in reading since Wittgenstein.Alas, though the book starts in a wonderful way and the idea of antifragility is an amazing idea, at some point you realize something is happening. At first, the author criticizes pseudo scientificism, then stars swearing for Baal. That is followed by an exposition of the trivial truth that there are options outside finance that are poorly priced, as if that was a hidden, previously unknown idea. And finally, around the middle of the book, he dismisses science all together. He claims, and, unfortunately, fails to prove, that science does not produce most of the technological (and others? Not clear) innovations through history. He does this through the simple method of claiming we got it backwards, then claiming that in some cases some people claim we got it backwards, then admitting that there may be a few cases where we got it right, but that those are not important. All this starts with some academicians giving birds lectures on how to fly... Before you continue reading this review, may I remind you again that I could not finish this book? It became boring. Furthermore, if you agree with the author, I should point out that I am, of course, a sworn enemy of what he exposes, having a PhD in mathematics and all. Never lectured birds though, just taught some calculus and functional analysis to non flying human beings.Case in point. He claims Euclid results aren't used in Architecture. Then admits that the Pythagorean Theorem is used somewhat in architecture. Who has claim Euclid was central to architecture is not clear... But this represents an ignorance of what Euclid did. He was formalizing previous knowledge. This knowledge was not all original, though some was. To say that people knew some of the things Euclid did before he wrote his books, through trial and error is trivial. Before Pythagoras, the Chinese and the Babylonians knew examples of Pythagorean Triangles, the Chinese may even have known the theorem. What we appreciate from Pythagoras is the proof, which Euclid wrote, not claiming it was being written for the first time. To claim that the pythagorean theorem or trigonometry wasn't used in architecture or engineering before the renaissance is just mere blindness. Go ahead, attempt to build a tunnel or measure a distance or calculating how many stones you need for that door, without anything in the books of Euclid. I'll wait. Yes, people didn't cite or knew Euclid, but they were using the results, not referencing scientific literature.To say that academic research is not based on trial and error is not just a mistake. but not having and inkling of what is involved in any type of academic research, at least in the hard sciences. Academic research, even in mathematics, consist of nothing but trial and error! Yes, afterwards we write the papers as if we knew everything all along, but that is not the practice of science, but its result.To then say that academic research has not contributed to innovations in technology and to try to claim that ""drop outs' have innovated more is confusing the business of technology with technology itself, is ignoring what cryptography is, and how it developed, is ignoring the irony of the applicability of Hardy's mathematical results, is ignoring the history of the World Wide Web, Netscape, Sun Microsystems, NASA, HP, and a million others. It's, simply, claiming as true what you wanted to be true, without examining it honestly. To use the internet as an example of academic research not contributing in technology is to deny a reality that I lived.At the end, this book is dishonest and boring. Yes, it may have something to be learned from it, but it is an injustice to try to pass crummy thinking as if it was part of a great idea."
5,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6977804-dmitri,3,"What a frustrating book.10% of it was brilliant and original ideas - I was very glad to learn about antifragility and optionality as it relates to life and business.Unfortunately, the other 90% of it was spent whining (I can't describe it any other way) and moralizing, of the most weaksauce variety. Ugh.Still worth reading, if you're patient, or if you can skim heavily through his ""modern society sucks, the Romans were awesome!"" diatribes. "
6,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,5,"I've been reading this book, Antifragile, for almost four weeks. I call it reading. I've turned all the pages. I've read all the words. That's reading, right?Or is it?I started off pretty well, somehow managing to get my brain around the whole idea of antifragile, a word the author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, admits he made up. There is no real word in English that properly names this idea. Everyone understands the idea of fragile, something that is destroyed when stressed. But the opposite of fragile is more than just something that survives difficulties. Antifragility, Taleb tells us, is the idea of a phenomenon that goes beyond mere resilience; antifragility is the idea of something that actually improves with difficulties and uncertainty.Taleb gives us lots of great examples of things that are antifragile: ""...evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes (say, chicken soup or steak tartare with a drop of cognac), the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance...even our own existence as a species on this planet.""I'm high-five-ing him, right and left...love this idea of antifragile, Taleb.That was the Prologue, however. Round about the second or third page of Chapter 1, I find that I'm reading along, with no idea what Mr. Taleb is explaining. He tries, he really does, and now and then I read a paragraph and think I'm back on the highway. The Soviet-Harvard Department of Ornithology, for example. (How well do I know that department, the people who lecture to birds about proper techniques for flying, observe and write reports about the birds' flying abilities, and then seek funding to ensure that the lectures will continue!) But, soon I'm back driving in the dark again.I don't know if I really read this book. Can I add it to my 2013 Book Log? Does it count? Please don't ask me to summarize it or outline it or (heaven forbid!) don't test me on it.But if I didn't really read it, why did I like it so much? And why can't I stop thinking about it?Maybe what I did when I read Antifragile was antireading. Maybe antireading is the kind of reading where you turn the pages and read the words, but understand only a smidgen of what's there, and then you think about it for weeks, and come back to the book again and again, and maybe try to reread it, and it tweaks your map about this life, even through you really didn't understand much of what you read to begin with.Maybe antireading is the best kind of reading of all."
7,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6514081-james-johnson,1,The author somehow is able to pull off sounding like an arrogant prick and simultaneously like an insecure whiner. The rare examples when the author wrote something that was true or significant do not offset the hundred of pages of unsubstantiated assertions and purely fabricated nonsense.
8,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"I had previously read Nassim Taleb's The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable; I enjoyed it, and this book is definitely better. Taleb has a very non-traditional style of writing--often conversational, historical, philosophical, and scientific--all at the same time. Taleb's basic thesis is that people and institutions are either fragile, robust, or antifragile. A fragile person is one who thinks he can predict the future--and when things go very sour, he is sorely hurt, usually in a financial way. A robust person is one who has set himself up so that he is neutral to downturn episodes. An antifragile person knows that he cannot predict the future, especially outliers and catastrophic downturns. So, he has situated himself so that in normal times he may lose a little, but when a downturn occurs, he stands to gain--a lot.Taleb writes,In short, the fragilista (medical, economic, social planning) is one who makes you engage in policies and actions, all artificial, in which the benefits are small and visible, and the side effects potentially severe and invisible.He writes a lot about the policy fragilista ""... who mistakes the economy for a washing machine that continuously needs fixing (by him) and blows it up ..."" and ""... financial fragilista who makes people use risk models that destroy the banking system (then uses them again."" And the fragile financial people will claim that all is right with the world. Then, after a financial disaster they will try to rewrite history, claiming that they predicted the disaster, and tried to avert it.Taleb is very outspoken in his opinions. When he published The Black Swan he was the recipient of many attacks. With this book, he should be the recipient of many more, stronger attacks. He is definitely against academics who do not have any ""skin in the game"", and comes out heavily in favor of small businesses; he believes that ""...small commerce is door to tolerance"".Taleb is extremely critical of fragile institutions. He considers the Office of Management and Budget to be a bunch of scam artists, who are arrogant to believe they can predict the future.Taleb is against much of the scientific basic research as practiced by academics. He uses a metaphor of academics using arcane jargon and mathematics, lecturing birds on how to fly. Then the birds actually fly, so the academics take credit for successfully teaching them, and get government grants. Of course the metaphor sounds silly, but replace ""birds"" with ""men"", and you get the picture. Taleb mentions the Yiddish saying, ""If the student is smart, the teacher takes the credit."" Furthermore, Taleb criticizes academics who use statistics to prove a hypothesis. He accuses them of ""cherry picking"" with statistics. Sciences that do not use statistics for proofs (like physics) are not so prone to this approach.It is obvious, too, that Taleb had a lot of fun writing this book. For example, he proposed a rather simple financial concept that the experts considered to be too trivial to be true. So he writes, According to the wonderful principle that one should use people's stupidity to have fun, I invited my friend Raphael Douady to collaborate in expressing this simple idea using the most opaque mathematical derivations, with incomprehensible theorems that would take half a day (for a professional) to understand. Then the experts started to agree with him!Taleb is a moralist, and has lots of ethical lessons to give. For example, he writes that one of the purposes of religion is to protect us from scientism. He hates futurists like Ray Kurzweill, who he calls the ""anti-me"". He also detests people who greedily use invisible ""optionality"" to get ahead at the expense of others. I won't explain optionality here, other than to say that it is the use of asymmetry that only has an upside (for oneself) and no downside (except perhaps for others). He also hates journalists who help to instigate violence and wars, with no negative consequences when the outcomes are horrific.The two appendices are quite unique for a book like this. The first appendix uses graphs to portray all of the interesting concepts that he introduced throughout the book. The second appendix uses some rather technical mathematics to illustrate his ideas. At a few places in the book, especially with the philosophical topics, the writing becomes a bit tedious and sometimes strays off-topic. But overall, this is a marvelous book that is both entertaining and profound."
9,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3269664-matt,1,"I sat on this review for a long time, because this book bothered me. I really disliked both the author and his work. The writing is punchy, blustery, privileged, and utterly without charm. Taleb barely dips his toe into each topic before asserting that he has proven another point. Antifragile is very weak on evidence.You have to worry about an author that thinks he can vocalize an argument through Tony Soprano that defeats Socrates(!!!). Further, he is on Al-Ghazali's side, a Spanish Muslim who is the chief evil responsible for Islam falling from its tolerant golden age into its present dark age. Big time warning bells!!!No serious proof or consideration of counterexamples enters into a discussion of the superiority of city-states over today's political arrangements. Taleb argues that war is more prevalent today for a couple of pages and considers the argument won (something Steven Pinker argues against for 832 pages in Better Angels of our Nature). He says that there were no dental cavities in the past; Jared Diamond says that primitive man often died because of dental issues. Taleb calls the Code of Hammurabi ""more advanced"" (381). Really? A code of laws that calls for the innocent son of a builder to be killed for the builder's shortcomings is more advanced?He argues that, in the medical world, the ""iatrogenics of the last century"" is a detriment, acting as if is he unaware of the vast improvements in real-world medical results (vaccines, pregnancy-related care, life expectancy...). The quacks that Taleb loves so well have accomplished none of this.When Taleb thinks he is making an argument he is usually making a weak excuse instead of a legitimate point. Often his arguments take the form of insults (he often calls his opponents ""nerds"", he uses ""businessmen"" is a bad word, he uses negative physical characteristics to describe opponents - he likes to suggest that they are fat slobs).I would not recommend this to anyone. Don't read it."
10,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925436-annie,2,"Antifagile points out the value of systems that gain from disorder, chaos, or volatility. For example, a fragile state is catching a disease, a neutral state is avoiding exposure to anyone infected with the disease, and antifragile state is being vaccinated (where a small dosage produces immunity to the disease). There are many examples in the book, like lack of physical exertion, walking, and jogging. The rigorous activity of jogging increases health benefits, whereas no stressors to the body make it fragile.After the point is made, the rest of the book is filled with a lot ranting about others being wrong and the author being right. I stopped reading the book after halfway through."
11,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944510-mario-tomic,5,"This is one of the most important books I've ever read, it opened my eyes to entire new mindset and gave me a new framework for understanding the world. I know some of you reading this book will find the cocky tone of the author unbearable but just keep plowing through, the ideas shared inside are based on a very powerful logic that's hard to argue against. If I had to pick the 2 big ideas of the book I would say they are: 1. Design your life around anti-fragility (allow the stress of life to strengthen you) rather than breaking (being fragile) or being robust (denying change, not improving). Example: If you pick a glass jar off the floor and drop it, it will break if you drop from enough height, it's fragile. If you pick up a rubber ball off the floor and drop it, it will bounce instead of breaking, it's robust and will be unchanged. The third category most people don't know about is being anti fragile. If you jump off the floor and land again, your legs are becoming stronger. Stress with proper dosage is therefor good for the body and will improve you over time.2. The world is mostly non-linear. Example: There's a height from which you can drop that glass jar and it won't break but just go a bit height than that it will break. Those 2 outcomes are entirely different. So only a small difference can have a large impact on the outcome. Avoid situations with limited upside and very large non-linear downside which are as the author says ""sucker’s bets"" and instead seek situations which have limited downside and very large non-linear upside.One thing about this book is that it's not easy to digest, it took me longer than usual to read it because of the complexity of ideas presented inside and my suggestion is don't rush it. Think about how this applies in your life and the world around you. Bottom-line: finish whatever book you are currently reading (assuming you like it) and then read Antifragile next, you will not regret it."
12,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3289614-janet-eshenroder,1,"I really tried to finish this e-book (I might not have picked it if I had realized it was so long and would be so hard to stomach). I hate to give an opinion on any book until I've finished and given it every possible chance of redeeming itself. I struggled through more than a third of the 500+ pages before calling it quits. It is just not worth wasting the time. The author has such a pompous view of himself that the first quarter of the book left me positively nauseated. I tried to put personal feelings aside, giving the benefit of the doubt (perhaps he was ""challenging"" my old mindsets), and focusing on the ideas. I read on because of so many positive reviews. For a while the book did get better. There was less of the author talking about himself as brilliant and misunderstood (or resented) and more about his actual ideas. There were some good ideas, though I found little that has not been put forth before, using other terms of definition. Perhaps some of these concepts aren't common knowledge, but neither is it the first time anybody had an insight on these points. He liked keeping most systems simple and unregulated. No big business or big government. He usually railed on government regulations, though he believed in ""staunch intervention in some areas, such as ecology or to limit the economic distortions and moral hazards caused by large corporations."" Since no one can even out the ups and downs of life, his advice to individuals was a ""dumbbell approach"" of balancing stability with risks, rather than trying for safety in the middle. Anticipate the worst and build in redundant or independent systems,quit relying on past history and ""tweaking"" the established system if you want true safety in a changing and unpredictable world. No problem with many of his points, but they are not radically new.I find it annoying that the author makes up his own words to identify concepts already adequately defined elsewhere.Reading this book was like being stuck on vacation with a know-it-all conspiracy theorist who never lets up. The nicest way another reviewer put it was that he was like Crazy Uncle Fred who's decided he sees the answer to the big problem but people in general are too stupid to see and acknowledge true genius when they meet it in person. There you are, stuck at the table, unable to politely slip away.  The author rambles, he rants, he sees no reason to let an editor review his work (it needed a good editor). There are good ideas that could have been covered using far less ""ink.""I'd suggest reading the reviews and gleaning the few interesting ideas presented, rather than buying the book and struggling through 500+ pages."
13,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502841-mark-galassi,1,"I could not point to a worse book that I have read.The author is disorganized and throws a bunch of random factoids together with an unconvincing unifying theme. The lack of clarity in thinking is reminiscent of the kind of pseudo-intellectual numerology or fact-correlating that you find in works of fiction, but it is made even worse by the fact that the author seems to have a long list of axes to grind, and fills the book with petty name calling. Why is he so obsessed with the ""soviet-harvard complex""?I have the impression that good reviews of this book must come from people who felt they were supposed to ""get it"", but I think there is nothing to ""get"" in the book, starting from the introduction of a new word ""antifragile"", an awkward word to describe as a single phenomenon something that remains unconvincing.As a saving grace: the author clearly has a vast culture, and a few factoids were cute when taken individually, like his pointing out that Homer used similes to describe the color of the sea because Greek at his time did not have a word for ""blue"". Still, I would prefer to slog through a bulleted list of factoids than to read them in his ""I'm grinding an axe"" framework. Reading random Wikipedia pages would be a better use of time.For people who know Italian, here is a fantasy of how to treat people who write such poor and pretentious works -- a film critic is forced to listen to someone reading his critique:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruv2M..."
14,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5072847-will-ansbacher,2,"I sometimes receive emails from demented would-be Nobel prizewinners with titles like “the Fallacy of Einsteinian Hadronic Universes” that academics have apparently conspired to have suppressed. They’re incomprehensible of course, and I don’t read them. But I did read Antifragile. All of it, including the appendix.Oh, god, where to begin? This is one big ol’ mess of a book. It would be mildly entertaining as an autobiography, and bears a resemblance to Monty Python in places, but it isn’t supposed to be either of those. Reading between the lines (rather easy because he is disarmingly frank about his emotions and reactions) Mr Taleb was clearly outraged and humiliated by a rejection from a prestigious Ivy-League university, (probably Harvard), as the book drips with contempt for academics in general, and the economic fraternity in particular. With good reason perhaps – economics is not called The Dismal Science for nothing. Despite that, he is now an international celebrity. But I don’t know why -this is the most demented, scatter-brained mixture of blindingly-obvious platitudes, mis-applied analogies, extended references to the Greek and Roman Classics, and homespun truths that I have ever waded through. Yes, I read the whole thing because I still believe there are some grains of truth here. In fact, I have a lot of sympathy with many of his views – the financial sector (where previously he worked as a derivatives trader) IS a self-serving, bombastic, bloated time bomb of greed. That seems to have been a shock to the young Taleb. He was a naive graduate in the mathematical theory of Derivatives trading (I think) when he first discovered that colossal fortunes were being made by the pit traders who knew nothing about theory or even the products they were trading. (His friend Fat Tony, who appears throughout the book, was one of those traders). From this initial shock he formulated the idea that the theories themselves were crap, but there must be something systematic you could extract from the underlying variances (ie, uncertainties). So, “Antifragile” is NOT a theory -- he thinks they’re all crap, (except physics theories – yay, physics! ) let’s just say it’s a mantra or shibboleth -- that you don’t need to know anything to profit from randomness; indeed knowledge itself is inhibiting. But wait, there’s more! In addition to this non-theory, he actually does have a theory that all economists ignore “non-linear” effects that lie at the heart of his Antifragile mantra. Got that? No, nor did I. But he does go on (and on) about non-linear responses, and the “graphs” don’t help. Oh, god, the graphs – they could be anything. Didn’t anyone tell him that the axes at least need labels? It all reminds me of Monty Python’s manic economists: “this graph represents 56% of the population, while this graph represents 73% of the population!”Had he stopped there it would have been a well-meaning but rather incomprehensible rant against conventional economics. But he went on to apply his grand idea to everything else. So the message of this book, if I can condense its 500+ pages, is this: “The World’s a Crazy Place, but someone has to profit. Be one of those people (the AntiFragile)”. That takes about, oh, the first ten pages. The rest is basically one long and repetitive rant against the opposing camp. For in this bipolar world of his, the fragile – the boring and controlling “fragilistas” - are cowed by uncertainty, grasp at the illusion of stability and are generally hostile to the exciting, life-giving antifragile opportunists. The fragile include the dastardly “Soviet-Harvard” system (I did not make that up) that locked him out of academia, and is mentioned more than a few times. They are also suckers that the antifragile can and should take for a ride (this does seem to be a bit too revealing on Taleb’s part).  But, though long and rambling, it is not actually a dull book. For in many places it is unintentionally hilarious. I rolled my eyes many times, and J. did say that she had never heard me laugh out loud at anything connected with economics or politics before – e.g., there is what one could call the Parable of the Women who Marry Economists but have the Love-child of Rock Stars. This was to illustrate the concept that you should be heavily invested in safety but have the audacity to gamble on a long shot that could make you fabulously rich. Provided you did not care about being rich. At least I think that was the message.He is also not a mean person. In fact, he does have his heart in the right place as far as recognizing that certain people need a helping hand in life. But the boundary between legitimate help and smothering control is razor-thin and never defined, and woe betide you if you cross it, you fragilista! I’m talking to you, economist/town planner/big pharma/scientist/academic/soccer mom! Soccer moms?? Yes, you are guilty of “touristification” of your young charges.Taleb loves bathetic lists and invented words like this. I am not sure if they are supposed to be an attempt at humour, but they tend to reveal more about Mr T than anything else. There is a delightful table of various grand human enterprises – science, medicine, education, literature, town planning and so on – and the ills that result from excessive control by the fragilista. My favourite is “literature”, for which the controlling evil is ... “copy editors trying to change your text.""  Antifragile covers everything - Wisdom of the Ancients, Traditional Ways of Knowing and Grandmothers figure prominently. (These are Grandmothers from the Old Country, not those who were Soccer Moms some 20 years ago, obviously!). So does Fat Tony who at one point has a verbal sparring match with Socrates. (spoiler alert – Fat Tony wins, of course, and that is pure Monty Python). There are also rather too many comparisons showing the Mafia in an uncomfortably favourable light. One such passage contrasts the neurotic persona (typical fragilista) with one who is quietly confident and in control: the antifragile example he uses is a Mafia thug who has just eliminated some 18 of his opponents.  OK, joking aside, it is very easy to mock this bloated book. But the message in AF is profoundly disturbing. As Taleb points out, our complex interconnected society is very definitely fragile, while what he is advocating is only an individual opportunistic response. But it was just this unregulated trading in products that were either not understood (by his venerated Fat Tony) or intentionally misrepresented (by Goldman-Sachs) that was the direct cause of the recent financial chaos and collapse. And Taleb himself recognizes that the financial institutions that he loathes so much were, by his definition, superbly antifragile in the sense that they were handsomely bailed out by the suckers – taxpayers like Mr T. So that makes us all, um, “fragile”. Oops. So in short, this book would be a rather sick prescription for the future if it actually made any sense, and it is a bit depressing that so many seem to have been taken in by Antifragile."
15,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10784896-thomas,1,"A truly dreadful text.The author is an extremely poor writer, both in command of language (see ""non-sissy risk"") and in general structure. He is also rather egomaniacal. The claims made are either commonsensical (see other reviews) or simply wrong. Take the argument that the consolidation of the banking sector caused the recent financial crisis. The Canadian and Australian banking sectors are extremely concentrated in a handful of firms, yet both countries did not endure systemic banking crises (and haven't for quite some time).Avoid this book at all costs."
16,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6392144-herve,5,"Here’s probably one of the toughest review I ever had to write and I am not sure it is a good one, even if the topic I am addressing is great and important. But it’s been a challenge to summarize what I learnt: Nicholas Nassim Taleb gives in this follow-up to the Black Swan a very interesting analysis of how the world can be less exposed to Black Swans, not by becoming more robust only, but by becoming antifragile, i.e. by benefiting from random events. His views include tensions between the individual and the groups, how distributed systems are more robust than centralized ones, how small unites are less fragile than big ones. This does not mean Taleb is against orgamizations, governments or laws as too little intervention induces totally messy situations. It is about putting the cursor at the right level. Switzerland represents for Taleb a good illustration of good state organizations with little central government, a lot of local responsibility. He has similar analogies for the work place, where he explains that an independent worker, who knows well his market, is less fragile to crises than big corporations and their employees. One way to make systems less fragile is to put some noise, some randomness which will stabilize them. This is well-known in science and also in social science. Just remember Athens was randomly nominating some of its leaders to avoid excess!Now let me quote the author. These are notes only but for serious reviews, visit the author’s website, fooledbyrandomness. First Taleb is, as usual, unfair but maybe less than in the Black Swan. Here is an example: “Academics (particularly in social science) seem to distrust each other, […] not to mention a level of envy I have almost never seen in business… My experience is that money and transactions purify relations; ideas and abstract matters like “recognition” and “credit” warp them, creating an atmosphere of perpetual rivalry. I grew to find people greedy for credentials nauseating, repulsive, and untrustworthy.” [Page 17] Taleb is right about envy and rivalry but wrong in saying it is worse in academia; I think it is universal! In politics for example. But when money is available, maybe rivalry counts less than where there is little.Now a topic close to my activity: “This message from the ancients is vastly deeper than it seems. It contradicts modern methods and ideas of innovation and progress on many levels, as we tend to think that innovation comes from bureaucratic funding, through central planning, or by putting people through a Harvard Business School class by one Highly Decorated Professor of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (who never innovated anything) or hiring a consultant (who never innovated anything). This is a fallacy – note for now the disproportionate contribution of uneducated technicians and entrepreneurs to various technological leaps, from the Industrial Revolution to the emergence of Silicon Valley, and you will see what I mean.” [Page 42] [Extreme and unfair again, even if not fully wrong!]“The antifragility of some comes necessarily at the expense of the fragility of others. In a system, the sacrifices of some units – fragile units, that is, or people – are often necessary for the well-being of other units or the whole. The fragility of every start-up is necessary for the economy to be antifragile, and that’s what makes, among other things, entrepreneurship work: the fragility of the individual entrepreneurs and their necessarily high failure rate”. [Page 65] What surprised me later is that Taleb shows that this is true of restaurants (not many succeed) as much as of high-tech start-ups. So it is not only about the uncertainty of new markets, but about uncertainty above all. Mathematics of convexityI have to admit Taleb is not easy to read. Not because it is complex (sometimes his ideas are pure common sense), but because it is dense with different even if consistent ideas. The book is divided in 25 chapters, but also in 7 books. In fact, Taleb insists on it, he might have written 7 different books! Even his mathematics is simple. His definition of convexity is a little strange though I found it interested (I teach convex optimization, and you might not know, it was the topic of my PhD!).Jensen inequality is interesting [Pages 342, 227 – Jensen was an amateur mathematician!]– the convex transformation of a mean is less or equal than the mean after convex transformation. Again individual (concave, we die) vs. collective (convex, antifragile, benefits from individual failures). So risk taking is good for collectivity if with insurance mechanisms. Risk taking + insurance vs. speculation with no value added. An example of a short and deep idea: “Decision making is based on payoffs, not knowledge”. [Page 337]“Simply, small probabilities are convex to errors of computation. One needs a parameter, called standard deviation, but uncertainty about standard deviation has the effect of making the small probabilities rise. Smaller and smaller probabilities require more precision in computation. In fact small probabilities are incomputable, even if one has the right model – which we of course don’t.” [Taleb fails to mention Poincare yet he quoted him in the Black Swan, but whatever.]A visible tension between individual and collective interestsQuotes again: “What the economy, as a collective, wants [business school graduates] to do is not to survive, rather to take a lot, a lot of imprudent risks themselves and be blinded by the odds. Their respective industries improve from failure to failure. Natural and nature-like systems want some overconfidence on the part of the individual economic agents, i.e., the overestimation of their chances of success and underestimation of the risks of failure in their business, provided their failure does not impact others. In other words, they want local, but not global overconfidence”. […] In other words, some class of rash, even suicidal, risk taking is healthy for the economy – under the conditions that not all people take the same risks and that these risks remain small and localized. Now, by disrupting the model, as we will see, with bailouts, governments typically favor a certain class of firms that are large enough to require being saved in order to avoid contagion to other businesses. This is the opposite of healthy risk taking; it is transferring fragility from the collective to the unfit. […] Nietzsche’s famous expression “what does not kill me makes me stronger” can be easily implemented as meaning Mithridatization or Hormesis but it may also mean “what did not kill me did not make me stronger, but it spared me because I am stronger than others; but it killed others and the average population is now stronger because the weak are gone”. […] This visible tension between individual and collective interests is new in history. […] Some of the ideas about fitness and selection are not very comfortable to this author, which makes the writing of some sections rather painful – I detest the ruthlessness of selection, the inexorable disloyalty of Mother Nature. I detest the notion of improvement thanks to harm to others. As a humanist, I stand against the antifragility of systems at the expense of individuals, for if you follow the reasoning, this makes us humans individually irrelevant. ” [Pages 75-77]A National Entrepreneur Day “Compare the entrepreneurs to the bean-counting managers of companies who climb the ladder of hierarchy with hardly ever any real downside. Their cohort is rarely at risk. My dream – the solution – is that we would have a National Entrepreneur Day, with the following message: Most of you will fail, disrespected, impoverished, but we are grateful for the risks you are taking and the sacrifices you are making for the sake of the economic growth of the planet and pulling others out of poverty. You are the source of our antifragility. Our nation thanks you.” [Page 80] Local distributed systems, randomness and modernity “You never have a restaurant crisis. Why? Because it is composed of a lot of independent and competing small units that do not individually threaten the system and make it jump from one state to another. Randomness is distributed rather than concentrated.” [Page 98] “Adding a certain number of randomly selected politicians to the process can improve the functioning of the parliamentary system.” [Page 104] “Modernity is the humans’ large-scale domination of the environment, the systematic smoothing of the world’s jaggedness, and the stifling of volatility and stressors. We are going into a phase of modernity marked by the lobbyist, the very, very limited liability corporation, the MBA, sucker problems, secularization, the tax man, fear of the boss…” [Page 108] “Iatrogenics means literally “caused by the healer”. Medical error still currently kills between three times (as accepted by doctors) and ten times as many people as car accidents in the United States, it is generally accepted that harm from doctors – not including risks from hospitals germs – accounts for more deaths than any single cancer. Iatrogenics is compounded by the “agency problem” which emerges when one party (the agent) has personal interested that are divorced from those of the one using his services (the principal). An agency problem is present with the stockbroker and medical doctor whose ultimate interest is their own checking account, not your financial and medical health.” [Pages 111-112] Theories and intervention.“Theories are super-fragile outside physics. The very designation “theory” is even upsetting. In social science, we should call these constructs “chimeras” rather than theories. [Now you understand why Taleb has many enemies.] A main source of the economic crisis started in 2007 in the Iatrogenics of the attempt by […] Alan Greenspan to iron out the “boom-bust” cycle which caused risks to go hide under the carpet. The most depressing part of the Greenspan story is that the fellow was a libertarian and seemingly convinced of the idea of leaving systems to their own devices; people can fool themselves endlessly. […] The argument is not against the notion of intervention; in fact I showed above that I am equally worried about under-intervention when it is truly necessary. […] We have a tendency to underestimate the role of randomness in human affairs. We need to avoid being blinded to the natural antifragility of systems, their ability to take care of themselves and fight our tendency to harm and fragilize them by not giving them a chance to do so. […] Alas, it has been hard for me to fit these ideas about fragility within the current US political discourse. The democratic side of the US spectrum favors hyper-intervention, unconditional regulation and large government, while the Republican side loves large corporations, unconditional deregulation and militarism, both are the same to me here. Let me simplify my take on intervention. To me it is mostly about having a systematic protocol to determine when to intervene and when to leave systems alone. And we may need to intervene to control the iatrogenics of modernity – particularly the large-scale harm to the environment and the concentration of potential (though not yet manifested) damage, the kind of thing we only notice when it is too late. The ideas advanced here are not political, but risk-management based. I do not have a political affiliation or allegiance to a specific party; rather, I am introducing the idea of harm and fragility into the vocabulary so we can formulate appropriate policies to ensure we don’t end up blowing up the planet and ourselves.” [Pages 116-118] “To conclude, the best way to mitigate interventionism is to ration the supply of information. The more data you get, the less you know.” [Page 128] “Political and economic “tail” events are unpredictable and their probabilities are not scientifically measurable.” [Page 133] The barbell strategy and optionality“The Barbell strategy is a way to achieve anti-fragility, by decreasing downside rather than increasing upside, by lowering exposure to negative Black Swans. So just as Stoicism is the domestication, not the elimination, of emotions, so is the barbell a domestication, not the elimination, of uncertainty.” [Page 159] “It is a combination of two extremes, one safe and one speculative, deemed more robust than a monomodal strategy. In biological systems, the equivalent of marrying an accountant and having an occasional fling with a rock star; for a writer, getting a stable sinecure and writing without the pressures of the market. Even trial and error are a form of barbell.” [Glossary page 428] “The strength of the computer entrepreneur Steve Jobs was precisely in distrusting market research and focus groups – those based on asking people what they want – and following his own imagination, his modus was that people don’t know what they want until you provide them with it.” [Page 171] “America’s asset is simply risk taking and the use of optionality, the remarkable ability to engage in rational forms of trial and error, with no comparative shame in failing, starting again and repeating failure. In modern Japan, by contrast, shame comes, with failure, which causes people to hide risks under the rug, financial or nuclear.”“Nature does a California-style “fail early” – it has an option and uses it. Nature understands optionality effects better than humans. […] The idea is voiced by Steve Jobs in a famous speech: “Stay hungry, stay foolish.” He probably meant “Be crazy but retain the rationality of choosing the upper bound when you see it.” Any trial and error can be seen as the expression of an option, so long as one is capable of identifying a favorable result and exploiting it.” [Page 181] “Option is a substitute for knowledge- actually I don’t understand what sterile knowledge is, since it is necessarily vague and sterile. So I make the bold speculation that many things we think are derived by skill come largely from options, but well-used options, much like Thales’s situation [who had an option with olive presses – pages 173-174] rather than from what we claim to be understanding.” [Page 186] Taleb is skeptical with experts, with anyone believing in a linear model academia -> applied science ->practice (“lecturing birds how to fly”); he believes in tinkering, heuristics, apprenticeship, and makes again many enemies for free! He claims the jet engine, financial derivatives, architecture, medicine were first developed by practitioners and then theorized by scientists, not invented or discovered by them. Tinkering vs. research“There has to be a form of funding that works. By some vicious turn of events, governments have gotten huge payoffs from research, but not as intended – just consider the Internet. It is just that functionaries are too teleological in the way they look for things and so are large corporations. Most large companies, such as Big Pharma, are their own enemies. Consider blue sky research, whereby grants and funding are given to people, not projects, and spread in small amounts across many researchers. It’s been reported that in California, venture capitalists tend to back entrepreneurs, not ideas. Decisions are largely a matter of opinion, strengthened with who you know. Why? Because innovations drift, and one needs flâneur-like abilities to keep capturing the opportunities that arise. The significant venture capital decisions were made without real business plans. So if there was any analysis, it had to be of a backup, confirmatory nature. Visibly the money should go to the tinkerers, the aggressive tinkerers who you trust will milk the option.” [Page 229] “Despite the commercial success of several companies and the stunning growth in revenues for the industry as a whole, most biotechnology firms earn no profit.” [Page 237] [Optionality again]“(i) Look for optionality; in fact, rank things according to optionality, (ii) preferably with open-ended, not closed-ended, payoffs; (iii) do not invest in business plans but in people, so look for someone capable of changing six or seven times over his career, or more (an idea that is part of the modus operandi of the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen); one gets immunity from the backfit narratives of the business plan by investing in people. Make sure you are barbelled, whatever that means in your business.” [Page 238] “I did here just debunk the lecturing-Birds-How-to-Fly epiphenomenon and the “linear model”, suing simple mathematical properties of optionality. There Is no empirical evidence to support the statement that organized research in the sense it is currently marketed leads to great things promised by universities. [Cf also Peter Thiel lamentations about the promise of technologies] Education is an institution that has been growing without external stressors; eventually the thing will collapse.” [A conclusion to book IV, page 261] Why is fragility non linear?“For the fragile, the cumulative effect of small shocks is smaller than the single effect of an equivalent single large shock. For the antifragile, shocks bring more benefits (equivalently, less harm) as their intensity increases (up to a point).” Via negativa“We may not need a name for or even an ability to express anything. We may just say something about what it is not. Michelangelo was asked by the pope about the secret of his genius, particularly how he carved the statue of David. His answer was: It’s simple, I just remove everything that is not David.” [Page 302-304] […] “Charlatans are recognizable in that they will give you positive advice. Yet in practice, it is the negative that’s used by the pros. One cannot really tell if a successful person has skills, or if a person with skills will succeed – but we can pretty much predict the negative, that a person totally devoid of skills will eventually fail.” […] “The greatest – most robust – contribution to knowledge consist in removing what we think is wrong. We know a lot more what is wrong than what is right. Negative knowledge is more robust to error than positive knowledge. […] Since one small observation can disprove a statement, while millions can hardly confirm it [The Black Swan!], disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation. […] Let us say that, in general, failure (and disconfirmation) are more informative than success and confirmation.”[Funnily, I remember the main critics against my book were the lack of [positive] proposal in the end. I should have said there we many about what not to do!]“Finally, consider this modernized version in a saying from Steve Jobs: “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” [Page 302-304] Less is more“Simpler methods for forecasting and inference can work much, much better than complicated ones. “Fast and frugal” heuristics make good decisions despite limited time. First extreme effects: there are domains in which the rare event (good or bad) plays a disproportionate share and we tend to be blind to it. Just worry about Black Swan exposures and life is easy. There may not be an easily identifiable cause for a large share of the problems, but often there is an easy solution, sometimes with the naked eye rather than the use of the complicated analyses. Yet people want more data to solve problems.” [Page 305-306]... more on my blog..."
17,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1258773-douglas-wilson,5,"I really enjoyed Taleb’s book The Black Swan, and picked up his Antifragile shortly after it came out. I started it, and was enjoying it, but stalled out for some reason. I don’t remember. It was dark. They were big. His book found itself in my lamentably large and scattered collection of partly read books. But somewhere in my mind was the thought of finishing it, which I just did a short time ago. Really glad I did.There are places here and there where you have to tolerate some dogmatic bombast from Taleb—he is the kind of guy, as the saying goes, who is “sometimes wrong, but never in doubt”—but the central thesis of this book is pure gold.Some might want to dismiss his central thesis as a glib attempt to prove that when the going gets tough, the tough get going. Taleb knows this, but so did your grandmother. The real point of the book has to do with what toughness actually looks like, how it behaves, how it configures itself before the going gets tough—in short, how does it anticipate the inevitable tough times? And this is where Taleb’s point gets really interesting and is entirely counterintuitive.Institutions, corporations, management systems, biological organisms can be fragile, robust, or antifragile. According to Taleb, fragile systems require predictability. They want the environment to be placid, and they want as much protection as possible from external stressors. Robust systems do okay when they are in trouble; they are resilient. But antifragile systems are complicated, and they positively thrive in the midst of chaos. Chaos is the soil in which they grow and flourish.In peaceful times, a fragile system can give out the appearance of stability, but this is just a mask for the fragility. And because it is easy to be foolish, many people strive for just that appearance. Not many people know that the house built on sand had a five-star rating.“Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it” (Matt. 7:24–27).That’s your fragile system, right there. Two historical examples of fragile systems that did not appear to be at all fragile were the Soviet Union prior to its collapse, and medieval Christendom prior to the Reformation. When subsequent events overtook them—the kind of rare but extreme happening that Taleb calls a Black Swan—their fragility was exposed.Fragile systems are cowardly, and function in a CYA mode much of the time. Because the world is filled with risk, the way that fragile systems manage this is by trying to outsource the risk. But the best way to cultivate an antifragile system is not through recklessness, but by means of a carefully thought-through “skin in the game” approach.A lot of pastors could benefit from gleaning the principles found in this book. They want to build a peaceful church that is free of controversy, and so instead they build a fragile one that is entirely vulnerable to controversy. In the name of fighting off infections, they put their immune system under a ban. The elders issue a chin-stroking statement that antibodies are the troublers of the body.In case anybody is still curious about it, the applications for the Reformed evangelical network in North America are numerous. I can’t tell you how many times I have heard pastors insisting on fragility as though it were one of the fruits of the Spirit. They demand cultivation of fragility as though it were a cardinal virtue. And because this is how the world works, what they have insisted upon they have certainly gotten. Fragility is our middle name. “And he gave them their request; But sent leanness into their soul” (Psalm 106:15). "

20,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289730-jeffrey-akiva-savett,3,"In the conclusion of this book, Taleb reports that a friend of his asked him to explain his core argument while standing on one foot. Obviously an allusion to the famous story in which a gentile promises to convert if Rabbi Hillel can explain Judaism while standing on one foot, Taleb offers, ""the best way to verify if you are alive is to check whether you like variations."" I'll admit at the beginning of this review: there were sections of this book I had to skip. More on why in a bit.Taleb's thesis is that modernity is the attempt of human beings to turn the random into the predictable and stable, and that this attempt ironically causes MORE randomness and disorder. Taleb demonstrates that in evolution, economics, philosophy, ethics, politics and elsewhere, the ""Antifragile,"" things which BENEFIT and get STRONGER due to stressors are the rule, not the exception. He believes that modernity, and our attempts to make our lives predictable and orderly only bring FRAGILITY, which either gets WEAKER with stressors or at best, barely survives stressors intact.This seems very compelling. Given my personal medical history as a Crohn's sufferer who has undergone five surgeries, the prospect that all of this suffering is actually making me STRONGER and more resilient rather than broken and weaker is inspiring. Taleb doesn't pretend that this theory is novel; indeed, much of his evidence is derived from ancient and classical wisdom and cultures. He notes that the maxim ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger,"" isn't NEW, just that it's almost completely ignored by policy makers, economists, parents who try to protect their children from all harm, and his previous colleagues in risk management positions.HOWEVER, and this is a big however, I find Taleb's tone and style incredibly off-putting. It's clear that he has an axe to grind with Ivy League educated leaders and policy makers. He even coins a particularly destructive pattern of fragile thought ""Harvard/Soviet"" something or other. In constantly trying to position himself as an Everyman speaking in the voice ""Fat Tony"" from Brooklyn, Taleb fails at every turn to NOT sound like an arrogant, long winded, elitist. Anyone whose short bio on the back flap describes him as ""a flaneur meditating in cafes,"" is going to have trouble connecting with the reader. Don't be ashamed, I had to look up ""flaneur"" as well. It's someone who spends his or her time WALKING in a meditative and philosophical manner in the spirit of Montaigne. Wow. Another reviewer, who actually LIKED the book, described Taleb as an asshole. Unlike her, I find his personal ""ass-holier-than-thou-ness"" inseparable from his argument.So Taleb is QUITE in love with the sound of his own voice and his verbosity, intentionally obscure chapter titles, and inability to maintain a straightforward argument free of bombast is the reason I found it impossible to read this book from cover to cover. Perhaps the problem is as simple as this: Taleb's central thesis about antifragility is written on the cover. It's interesting. It's a compelling idea. And really, Taleb could have devoted 35 concentrated pages advising us how to better embrace random events and stressors (Black Swans he calls them in his previous book) at work, in raising our children, and with regard to our own health. That would have been a five star endeavor and could have appeared as a lengthy New Yorker feature. But the room that a book length work gives Taleb to stretch out his legs is to his detriment. He is in dire need of editor unafraid to be called ""too stupid to understand"" to rein in his oversized ego and overwrought style.I am left interested and disappointed. Not a pleasant feeling after devoting so much time and concentration following Taleb's circuitous verbal ""flaneur-ing."""

I should give it 5 stars though just because it's nice to read a book that makes your blood boil and that helps you crystalize your world view. Let me say up front that I wholeheartedly agree with the nugget of his thesis, which is basically (though he would claim it's much more original than this): what doesn't kill you makes your stronger. Basically, we need to embrace certain kinds of shocks and risks and that developing anti-fragility is key. I also wholeheartedly agree with his whole section on medicine and and drug interventions. But the nuggets of useful advice are delivered in a shit sandwich of anti-intellectualism, cockiness and so much snark. He hates ""fragilistas"" and basically all academics, especially economists. And don't get me wrong--academics are super petty and often wrong. But then he goes on to make his case by citing a ton of academic research and studies (some done by him and co-authors). So it's not academics he hates--it's anyone who disagrees with him. Then there's the absurd self-regard. The part where I laughed out loud was not when he said he could bench press 330 and looked like a bodyguard, it's when he imagines a dialogue with socrates and he totally stumps him! Oh and no one understands Seneca the way Taleb does. Also, he and he alone (and I guess his fat Jersey trader buddies) all predicted the financial crisis. HHe hates every body except ""real men"" who are business bros. He definitely hates soccer moms. In fact, I think this can best be lumped in with all the other screeds against ""feminization"" and if you read ""academic"" as ""girly men,"" this book just sounds like a schoolyard taunt and a chest thumping screed that we stop being sissies and go back to the world where we were all real men. And you knew he'd be all about cross fit and paleo, right? It's too bad because I really did like his other books Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan."
30,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9496879-michael-o-brien,4,"Another thought-provoking book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in the succession of his prior books, ""Fooled by Randomness"" and ""The Black Swan"", where, well before the 2008 Great Recession, his analysis of the limitations of statistical methods predicted such an event. Such events occur, ones with low predicted probability but high consequence, largely because of a misplaced confidence in the reliability of estimates and forecasts on complex systems with multiple variables --- in which a small variation on the prediction of any one of them can result in profoundly different, unexpected outcomes.From Taleb's previous works, we learn of the fallibility and limitations in our ability to predict and, therefore, anticipate the rare, extreme event. ""Antifragile"" attempts to build on this. In this, Taleb is moderately successful. I was thinking, before I read this, that Taleb might point out ways in which we can eliminate fragility in a system, and, better yet, create a system or situation where one can actually gain from volatility --- becoming ""antifragile"". But ""Antifragile"" doesn't really do this in my opinion. What it does better is helping one identify situations that are ""fragile"" --- ones that produce only modest gains, but, with volatility or chaos, can has disastrous outcomes.For example, Taleb points out the agency problem -- one such as in major corporations or in large governments --- where the manager is not the true owner so he follows a cosmetically sound strategy, but in a hidden way benefits him and makes him antifragile at the expense (fragility) of the true owners or society. Limited liability corporations and big bureaucracies do not come off well in Taleb's analysis --- he shows that organizations with the agency problem do not flourish long term in comparison with others such privately held companies and entrepreneurs. The degree of ""skin in the game"" of those taking the risks are a good way to assess the level of fragility or antifragility of a system --- and such as entrepreneurs, because they are all in on the risks they take, are, therefore, more likely to respond better to volatility than these others.Another original term in this book that Taleb coins is ""neomania"" --- that tendency in human nature to embrace the new for its own sake --- often without sufficient regard for the added complexity to systems that may be added. And, as Taleb shows throughout his work, as complexity increases, so do the variables, each with its own added unknown level of uncertainties. As I read this, I reflected on the replacement in most vehicles of mechanical windows with power windows --- the mechanical window reliable and cheap to repair if it fails. On the other hand, the power window, in return for a modest convenience and novelty, being very expensive to repair when it inevitably fails to work.Another interesting concept Taleb discusses is the ""green lumber fallacy"" --- mistaking the source of important or even necessary knowledge for another less visible from the outside, less tractable one. Taleb uses as an illustration a well-known, highly successful trader on green lumber on the commodity exchange who flourished for decades --- yet thought through his career that he was trading lumber painted green instead of green timber --- yet whose use of heuristics and trial and error knowledge gained by experience made him brilliant in trading, notwithstanding his lack of knowledge about the actual commodity in which he traded.So, in reading this book, no, I did not actually learn how to implement antifragility --- which in many cases is not possible, but I did learn from reading this book how better to recognize situations in which antifragility exists and ones vulnerable to fragility. Very thought-provoking --- especially where America's future is concerned. One major indicator of fragility --- high indebtedness!"

32,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724256-p,5,"The Black Swan is one of the three books that have influenced me the most so my expectations for this book could not be higher. This exceeded my expectations. I half-expected to see Kanye West listed among his acknowledgements because this book has swagger. Taleb calls out those he disapproves by name (Tom Friedman, Alan Greenspan, and Joseph Stiglitz receive direct criticism), and takes full credit for what he gets right. In The Black Swan, Taleb makes an offhand reference to how an aside in an earlier book (Fooled by Randomness) about planes hitting NYC financial district office buildings correctly predicted certain events. This time, Taleb makes an effort to build up a footnote in The Black Swan about Fannie Mae “sitting on a barrel of dynamite” into how he was “telling everyone, including cab drivers” about the collapse of the banking sector. He contradicts himself when discussing his prohibition to read any books written in the last 50 years, because he recommends recent works, by, among others, Guy Deutscher and John Gray. It would be more effective if Taleb’s advice on this front was simply, “Kill your television, read everything, and think for yourself.”“Antifragile” is a term Taleb invented to mean the exact opposite of fragile. The key binary in The Black Swan was Extremistan/Mediocristan, and the key triad here is fragile/robust/antifragile. The easiest way for me to conceptualize the triad is through comic book characters. (Taleb does not do this, but I find that the following example explains the idea.) Bruce Wayne is fragile (He loses his parents, girlfriend, and all his money), Superman is robust (nothing can hurt him), and Batman is antifragile (He learns from his mistakes, adapts to his surroundings, and is most valuable when there is a crisis).A useful element of antifragility is captured in the phrase “post-traumatic growth.” An example of this is the famous Nike commercial where Michael Jordan says, “I have failed over and over again in my life, and that is why I succeed.” The core concept, of getting better from being exposed to changes, is more intuitive, less technical, and possibly more generally applicable than the concept of “Black Swans” (rare, high-impact events that are only able to be explained after they occur). Taleb deftly addresses the relationship between “antifragile” and the maxim “What does not kill me makes me stronger.”Going into specifics, Taleb discusses the mental health industry, and proudly admits to what a soccer mom would quickly diagnose as a combination of ADD and manic depression. This makes this book either constantly entertaining or impenetrably disjointed. As someone with a similar mental makeup to the author, I find it falls in the former category. Taleb fearlessly takes his idea wherever he wants, which allows a reader with a sprinkle of ADD to draw connections on top of Taleb’s connections. Three stood out to me. First, his idea of ever-increasing fragility is similar to the model created by Hyman Minsky. Second, his argument in favor of old pieces of art mirrors that of George Orwell, who wrote that the test for the value of art was survival. I don’t know if my descendants will have access to Apple products (despite Taleb’s love for Steve Jobs and Silicon Valley), but they will have access to Seneca and Montaigne. Finally, like Tyler Durden, Taleb advocates starting street fights (preferably with people in suits), rejecting mindless consumerism, the downfall of major corporations (especially credit card corporations), dying for one’s ideas, and behaving like you have nothing to lose. Just like I felt when I read The Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness for the first time, I look forward to rereading this book."

34,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12197491-bill,1,"I gave up on this book after reading the prolog and the first 2 chapters. Taleb's writing style is aggressively egotistical and anti-scholastic. This might be tolerable if he had something to say that justified a 500-page book. His thesis is that risk-avoidance leads to weakness; that it is better to focus on growing stronger through our experience of the inevitable hardships we encounter. He would have us believe (at least, in the first couple of chapters) that since there are some negative outcomes that are impossible to predict (see his earlier book, ""The Black Swan""), all risk management is futile and leads only to fragility. Better to be Anti-fragile - to grow stronger through adversity - than to work at avoiding risk. This is not entirely bad advice, which many people have given before, but Taleb manages to deliver the message in a tone that I found intolerably off-putting."
35,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,4,"This is not an easy book to review so let us start with the basics. I recommend it despite its flaws. There is a lot of truth, albeit approached with a dose of healthy scepticism, in Taleb's critical view of how our society has developed and how we lack courage in facing our own condition within it.The basic thesis is not as simple as he likes to pretend in his Conclusion but suffice it to say that he sees our total existence as enhanced in the long run in every way by disorder - you could call it a civilised disquisition on Nietzsche's aphorism that what does not kill, stengthens. As someone who seems naturally to have evolved (not without difficulty) into the position that Taleb thinks ideal - essentially independent if not particularly rich - I can nevertheless see where his view could be seen as simplistic. This book is a polemic and should be treated as such.But let's get the flaws out of the way first. They come down to the fact that we are dealing with a colossal ego. He may be right but we know the type - somewhat self-absorbed without realising just how self-absorbed they are, just a little full of themselves but undoubtedly clever.There are three books struggling to get out of this single text: a distillation of some serious work on risk management that is frankly above my pay grade; an account of our social and human condition; and an autobiographical, anecdotal and self-indulgent attempt to entertain.The first can be put aside for the nerds. Fortunately, Taleb restricts his technical material to very short and occasional bursts and to the glossary, appendices and notes. You can skip these (and clearly he does not mind if you do). It is as if he cannot stop competing with the people he despises.The third is amusing enough. Taleb is a palaeo-conservative of sorts. He is also a creature of his background and the book is none the worse for that. Perhaps you can take the Christian Arab out Lebanon but you can't take the Lebanese Christian Arab out of Taleb.I know the world. Just over the border, Syrian friends will expostulate at length on their Graeco-Hellenistic heritage and look on the Britons as something close to barbarian. Taleb does much the same (modernity is barbarism in this case) but with style and often with wisdom. He uses the friendship of an autodidactic flaneur and a trader/mafia player to illustrate complex ideas in ways that hit home quickly. In this zone, he writes well and amusingly to the point where you think you are actually reading a rather good (unusually) self help book.But the meat is in the second zone (his account of our current condition). By the end, I wished he had dropped the technicals, cut back the somewhat narcissistic attempt to entertain us and just concentrated on this raw steak, giving us an analysis that I would like to have given to my kids.Trouble is - 500 pages, where some 200 pages is self indulgence and technical stuff, is not really the way to get ideas into the heads of twenty-somethings. The book seemed, by the end, less an education in reality more a status game with 'peers' with whom Taleb was very angry.Nevertheless the core of the book is worth the effort because, in essence, what he is saying is that highly complex systems like nature, humanity, the individual and the market have certain rules inbuilt into them from the very nature of their complexity.Survival in the long term (barring the accidental) requires that we be more than resilient, that we be 'antifragile' - that is, that we embrace small errors and complexity, not seek to control everything, and concentrate on what he calls 'optionality'. 'Optionality' is effectively taking small low value bets on large events and not making the mistake of believing either that these events will never happen or must necessarily happen. However, all large systems usually have failure inbuilt in them and we should recognise that.Small businesses come and go but the learning process of multiple entities competing and failing strengthens the social and encourages innovation. The system is not merely resilient, it is antifragile. Big corporations collapse periodically causing far more social damage.The specialist corporate manager who has 'security' and then is unemployable when his company goes under is contrasted with the insecure but flexible small business person, in which he includes the sex worker as much as the restaurateur. Taleb is at heart a libertarian.Well, I have some doubts about his picture of things. He underestimates the value of 'firebreaks' within the social system which stop cataclysmic collapses of even his anti-fragile systems. Nation states can be firebreaks protecting the anti-fragile systems that operate within them.Nevertheless, although all this apparently acts as argument for a somewhat conservative agenda, there is merit in his argument when it applies to the bureaucratisation that has become the hall mark of modernity. The bureaucrat has, in his term, 'no skin in the game' of life.He becomes quite the little Savonarola towards the end when he starts looking into the ethics that arise out of his antifragile analysis and he has a point. Contempt and anger for people with no skin in the game of life gets down, dirty and personal with direct attacks on individuals.Written in 2012 and perhaps seen then as retrospectively concerned with the rotten state of managerial capitalism as one Obama term merged into a second, the book now seems prescient of the more intelligent element in the Trump revolution.Since the media (the essence of those with no skin in the game of life) have pictured Trump as some kind of atavistic illiberal monster, this book, without mentioning him once, acts as a source for understanding why he arose and why many libertarian intellectuals backed him.Interesingly, Taleb in November 2016 was saying that people should not worry about Trump and that he was not 'scary' (which is and was pretty well my view) although he also made it clear that he was not backing either candidate.The point I want to make is that this book and Trump are symptoms of something deeper - a conflict between entrepreneurial finance capitalism and the ethics of trust on the one side and corporate managerial capitalism and a deep-seated moral corruption on the other.Dear old Lenin wrote of a 'split in the ruling order' as one of the three pre-conditions for a revolution. We see that split emerging in this book. Taleb is and was not alone in despising a class of persons who take risks with other people's money yet benefit personally win or lose.These ideas are free market capitalist to the bone - they have none of my libertarian socialism which Taleb almost certainly thinks to be wrong-headed - but his criticism of late liberal capitalism's corporatist exploitation of ordinary people fellow travels with that of the Sanders Left.Taleb, in essence, if perhaps not entirely wittingly, writes here a tract of profound ideological resistance to the entire system that was apparently overturned (albeit only partially) in November 2016. Trump's Executive Order on lobbyists could have come from the Taleb play book.It is not that Taleb and Trump are in cahoots - they are not - but that both are drawing from similar well springs of outrage at what they see as the perversion of society by special interests who take no risks but merely offload them on to the little guy. I get that. Any real Leftist would too.At the time of writing the 'liberal' wing of American society (and their fellow travellers elsewhere) are in full deontological outrage mode at the man elected by their constitutional democracy. Yet there is still little public critique of why they lost half the population to a populist outsider.These rumpelstilstkins, leaping up and down at their frustration with a challenge to their reality, seem to possess no self-knowledge. While not agreeing with some of his analyses on 'what is to be done', they could learn much from Taleb.The most outraged and angry seem to be those who have got used to the patronage of the state, the foundations and the corporations - the universities, the media, the NGOs, the public service trades unions, 'activists' - who seem to lack anything but a shameful self interest at the moment.No, Trump is not an apocalypse or a monster but, more to the point (as Taleb stated in November), nor was he a 'black swan'. The liberal system in America under Obama was long riding for a fall because its response to 2008 lacked morality and fairness from the very beginning.On balance, if you can tolerate the intellectual arrogance and be prepared to ignore the limited but intrusive technical material, Antifragile, with its praise for acceptance of disorder as a positive good in society, is well worth reading. I learned something and even adjusted some of my behaviours. I only wish he had been a little less self-indulgent and a little less inclined to pay off old scores. A tighter 300-page version would otherwise now have been circulating within my family."
36,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7990720-jonathan-barry,2,"I'm a sucker. I sat through this entire book holding on to that glimmer of hope that the first few chapters offered. As I read on, I picked up hints from Taleb that I shouldn't be reading this book (focus on the classics, and don't read modern-day bullshit by people who don't know what they're talking about). I should've listened. He isn't the first person to bring up the idea of antifragility (you might know it in the guise of ""what doesn't kill me makes me stronger""), but he does a great job of defining it and giving some preliminary examples of how works in everyday life. He even manages to convince me that antifragility is something to strive for. The rest of the book, though, isn't worth the paper it's printed on (especially mine, because I spilled salsa all over it). I'll spare you most of his arguments, but there are structural issues with a lot of them. Foremost is his frequent rant that people tend to cherrypick the positives of doing (a fair point). In classic fashion, he cherrypicks the negatives of doing and ignores most of the rational arguments for why people do things. Economics is a good example of this. Economists have a bad reputation for the impracticality of their work, but Taleb doesn't acknowledge that one often has to try new things - even if the effects are unknown - to make progress. Taleb makes this trial and error or tinkering argument throughout, but doesn't apply it evenly. This type of erratic writing doesn't stop there, and one can find numerous inconsistencies throughout the text. My last gripe is that he's a bad writer. I appreciate warnings about technical parts and his use of metaphor, but the positives pretty much stop there. Taleb is shrill, unnecessarily verbose, and has a bewildering structure to the book. His book is a prime example of antifragility. It was good enough in the beginning to keep me reading far enough until it was worth it to write a review. At that point, my negative review doesn't actually hurt, because the negative publicity can will only increase his books sales, not decrease it. If you get a hold of this book, do yourself a favour and stop after the first few chapters. "

To take one example, risk management professionals look in the past for information on the so-called worst-case scenario and use it to estimate future risks—this method is called “stress testing.” They take the worst historical recession, the worst war, the worst historical move in interest rates, or the worst point in unemployment as an exact estimate for the worst future outcome. But they never notice the following inconsistency: this so-called worst-case event, when it happened, exceeded the worst case at the time."" "
38,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14482104-bradley,1,"Confession : Been looking forward to reading this book. Have been reading it a few days and I am not going to finish it. I only have so much willpower to go around and I need it for more constructive things.So is it fair to review a book you have not completed?I think so if the reason for lack of completion is you find it terrible.This is like being in a student common room after too much cider has been consumed. The problem of the world has been identified and an all embracing theory has turned up to solve it. Unfortunately what seemed obvious at first has turned into a rambling mess which only those that have drunk the most seem still able to understand, needing increasingly long words to explain it too the less intelligent.It seems the good old days of risk is the answer to most of it. Looks like we took a wrong turn a little after a particularly virulent strain of Roman stoic philosopher dropped dead (possibly of not being shocked enough and dying of boredom. I am not sure about this, it was not explained).In a nutshell being antifragile is the answer. It is a word made up by the author presumably because he eventually ran of long words in his thesaurus to impress us with.Antifragile is the opposite of fragile (it is so much more than robust) and fragile is where we are all heading in our risk averse world. This has what has caused us to be increasingly unwell, unlike all those medieval peasants who famously lived hearty and healthy lives well into their second century (think I have that right, fact checking might be in order but why ruin a good story).Evolution is anti-fragile, it grows stronger with ""shocks"" apparently. Indeed it seems the poster child for the theory.If I remember enough of my museum visits over the years evolution has only been marginally successful at the anti-fragile game itself.There is always a shock big enough to make anything fragile and so the best we can hope for is to create a less fragile world and I tend to look upon the modern world as a very much less fragile version of what it once was.So with this in mind the rest of the book just became pointless, it is an all encompassing theory using largely undefined terms in an unclear way to prove something that probably is common sense.My drunken common room debate days are long gone and I have no wish to return to them."

Nassim Taleb has achieved things in his life that I have been dreaming of for a long while, namely:1. He has wall-to-wall book-shelves.2. He has a physique like that of a body-guard.3. He is a mathematician who makes money.He is also very big on Chamomile tea. But I prefer my desi chai.I usually rate meta-books like this based on how many ""wow""-ideas it contains---generalizable ideas that I did not see coming. On that count Antifragile has one solid wow-idea---the idea of (anti)fragility. But the book does not end there. In fact more than two-thirds of the book is about everything else under the sun---domains as diverse as finance, medicine and ethics, all the while cursing most of the ""intellectuals"" of these fields and ranting about the depravations humanity has suffered as it descended into modernity from the good-old days of the ancients (read Hammurabi, Seneca, Xenophon et. al.).If that sounds like what your grandmother would say, you are not totally off the mark. In fact, Taleb laments that, ""My sadness is that we are moving further and further away from grandmothers.""The most original idea Taleb proposes is that some things (like your porcelain cup) are allergic to randomness and uncertainly. He calls them fragile. Certain other things (like a tank) are un-affected by and robust to these. Finally, whatever remains ""gains"" from randomness and uncertainly. Examples would be evolution (more the gene mutations the better), human immunity to diseases, physical fitness. What is fragile needs to worry about the future and needs to predict it to survive. The bulk of modern science (and philosophy) believes that all we need to do to protect our fragile modern belongings (objects, systems) is to be able to predict the future better ever so slightly. But anyone who is familiar with Chaos theory knows that even very simple systems are capable of displaying unpredictable behaviour.So, Taleb takes the opposite stand. He proposes that we stop trying to predict the future because it is simply impossible to do so and instead build systems that gain from uncertainly. In practice, this boils down to taking decisions which have obvious but bounded risks (downside) but unbounded upside. For example, if you are looking for jobs, it is better (antifragile) to apply to two companies than to one because the former has clear and bounded cost but unbounded upside. Note that this is not a new idea---it is something our elders tell us to do all the time.What Taleb does in this book is show why many of the heuristics that have been arrived at over the centuries by our ancestors are valid using the notion of anti-fragility and unpredictability of life.Appendix: For those of you who are into rationality and follow the writings of philosophers like Eliezer Yudhowsky, Taleb presents a very interesting counterpoint to the idea that rationality is supreme. Many philosophers (but no AI researchers) ""predict"" an AI singularity sometime in future when an AI will become incomparably more intelligent than a human and trigger runaway technological growth (endangering humanity in the process). Perhaps, life is so complex that this won't be possible?"

I bought a hard copy for my brother, listened to the audioboook and then bought a kindle version so I can easily search for terms when I want to reference something.Taleb is harsh to the point of abrasive, especially toward theories and people he sees fragilizing others. (He's actually harsh to theories altogether and makes a convincing argument for Empiricism's superiority). But it wakes you up and shakes you up, testing to see whether you need to 'be handle'd with care. If so, the book is not for you. Young-ish and early in my career, I appreciate learning from Taleb now. I don't want to be a 'sucker' slave to a career that is not fulfilling. Self-respecting honest persons, according to Taleb, must MAKE, produce and live in the fullest sense, not TAKE, capitalizing on the complex systems we work in these days to extract pittances from arbitraging transactions even they don't understand- all the while corroding and eroding financial structures the world's commerce runs on.In a sense he has both validated and challenged my wonderings about the true value and usefulness of certain career paths under current consideration. At least now I have the Taleb-test to give more honest vetting of my options.A novice in philosophical thought, this book is also serving as primer on where to start my self-learning of philosophy... long-overdue.Taleb calls Antifragile his magnum opus with his other books playing supportive (though essential in connection) roles. After reading it, I must agree.There is no one else out there like this vociferously erudite present day philosopher. It is hard to spend available free thinking time better than reading and thinking about Antifragile."
43,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6645592-mark-seemann,4,"Was I ever ambivalent about this book while reading it?In the beginning, I plain-out hated it, and expected to give it a one-star rating. The 25 pages long prologue is close to unreadable, but fortunately it turns out that the rest of the book is both easier to read, and makes sense most of the time.The language used is very personal, but quite annoying:- There are many sentences throughout where I had to re-read them multiple times, mentally adding commas, dashes, or semicolons here and there, before I understood what was being said. A better copy edit job could have made the book more readable without detriment to the contents, but from the book I get the impression that mr. Taleb dislikes such practices.- There's a lot of name-calling and (made-up?) jargon, such as Fragilista, Mediocristan, Soviet-Harvard, which, in my opinion, detracts from the reading experience. The arguments in the text are well enough made that it shouldn't be necessary to put others down, but unfortunately, a lot of anger, or impatience with people less gifted than mr. Taleb, shines through the pages.That said, I found myself frequently reflecting on the points of the book when I wasn't reading, but rather getting on with my life. It turns out to be a rather thought-provoking book, if you give it a chance.Ultimately, I think this is one of those books that are going to change how I think. Only time will tell, but I think I can already feel it rearranging my brain."
44,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,4,"I always struggle with Taleb's books. On the one hand, they are full of insights and interesting ideas; on the other, they are poorly structured and full of tangents and mean, spiteful, and largely unnecessary attacks against various groups of people (e.g., economists, academics, etc). Taleb, at least from his writing, strikes me as the classic brilliant asshole. I'm not sure I'd ever want to work with him, but kept at arms length, his books do offer lots of interesting learning. This book in particular is tough to get into. The first ~40% is just (a) defining and repeating the definition of antifragile over and over again and (b) vicious insults hurled towards people he dislikes. The last ~60% of the book covers a variety of interesting topics, though they all feel a bit disconnected. This book could've delivered all the same information in a much smoother and more accessible package if he just worked with his editors, but he prefers to hurl insults at them too, assuming he knows better than them—and the book suffers for it.If you can get passed his abrasive personality, then you'll find a number of interesting ideas here. It's worth mentioning that I don't fully agree with many of those ideas, but all of them made me stop and think, which to me is a huge win from a book. I took a lot of notes while reading. Here are a few of the highlights:* Taleb talks a lot about asymmetries where you have the potential for a small upside but almost unlimited downside or the opposite, with the potential for almost unlimited upside, but only small downsides. Obviously, we should prefer the latter. However, many systems end up using the former. For example, many financial instruments are built around the potential to make small percentage gains over time, but there is also a small risk of being completely wiped out by a Black Swan event. Even if the upside was moderate or large, if there is a nontrivial risk of having all of your gains wiped out by a catastrophic loss, it's usually not worth it. Instead, we should seek systems where the maximal loss is limited to something small, but rare Black Swan events can lead to massive wins. In such systems, you can lose 1,000 times, but if you win once, it more than makes up for it.* One of the main places where you have such asymmetries is with ""options,"" where you have the option of doing something (e.g., buying stock), but not the obligation. If things look good you use (""exercise"") the option. If things don't look good, you do nothing. The key point is that with such options, it isn't necessary to try to guess the future (e.g., predict how stocks will rise or fall). You just need to look at what has happened and make a decision. As long as the options are free or cheap, you can do this over and over again, with very very limited and small losses, and you only need one of those options to work out well to get a potentially huge win.* When you have options of this sort, the more volatility there is, the better you do. That's because the more frequent swings downward do very little damage but the more frequent swings upward make it more likely that you'll win big. In a sense, you are ""antifragile,"" getting stronger the more random variation / damage you take. Taleb also discusses how most natural systems—those that have survived for a long time—are inherently antifragile. For example, when you do damage to your body through exercise, you get stronger. Of course, the damage must be within some limit (if I drop a 10,000 lb barbell on you, you probably won't get stronger), but we should strive to build systems that mimic this property. * Taleb says he believes people who work in the financial industry are more noble than those to those who work in academia. His explanation for this contrarian stance is that, for the most part, the only way to succeed in the financial industry is to make money by taking smart actions (e.g., by buying stocks), whereas in academia, the main way to succeed is via posturing, reputation, schmoozing, politics, connections, fancy speeches and writing, etc. In other words, he sees the market as an unbiased measure of merit/ability, whereas academia is all about artificial and biased measures. As with much of what Taleb says, there is some truth here—academia really does involve a lot of BS—but it overstates the merit of the market (e.g., based on his own book ""Fooled by Randomness,"" how much of market success is accidental?) and understates the merit of important works of scholarship. * We often hear the expression ""what doesn’t kill me makes me stronger,"" but Taleb offers a possible alternative interpretation. Perhaps the reality is that you’re _already_ stronger and it just kills all the weaker people around you. So it seems like you came out stronger, and on average, the overall population does end up stronger, but no individual has actually improved. If anything, it may have left you with scars and weakened you! * Randomness/variation is not the same as risk. The example Taleb uses is that of a taxi driver vs a typical office worker. Most people would say the taxi driver has less ""stability"" (has more risk) than the office worker due to the randomness of taxi fares (some days you do well, some days you get no rides at all). But on a long-enough timeline, the taxi worker is likely to get a fairly steady stream of business with few major interruptions, whereas the business worker may be steady for a while, but then face a huge interruption: getting laid off. There's very little randomness in the office worker's life, but when something does happen, it's a massive, catastrophic event (a ""Black Swan"" event). Whereas the tax driver has lots of randomness, but, supposedly, less risk of Black Swan events. I get the purpose of this analogy—variation is not the same as risk, and some variation can actually be good for a system—but the analogy breaks down badly when you consider things like Uber and self-driving cars, either of which could be a Black Swan event for taxi drivers. So does Taleb's idea merely not take into account all types of Black Swan events? Is he underestimating these extremely rare events just as much as everyone else? Or was this a single bad analogy?* Following on the previous idea, Taleb argues that, somewhat counterintuitively, a small amount of constant variation is often necessary to stabilize and smooth out a system. For example, small, periodic fires in a forest are better than no fires at all, as in the latter case, the amount of dead leaves grows over time, and when a fire does break out, it's a massive and catastrophic one (again, a ""Black Swan"" event). If you clamp down too hard on variation, as humans tend to do, you actually end up destablizing that system. Clamping down on the banking or currency system to minimize small fluctuations makes everyone hyper-sensitive to small fluctuations, so when one eventually happens, everyone over reacts, and the result is catastrophic; whereas if there had always been small fluctuations, everyone would've been used to it, and another small fluctuation would've done no damage. In other words, noise can be used to stabilize a system. Side note: you see this in distributed systems programming too, with using ""jitter"" to avoid the ""stampeding herd"" problem (e.g., small outage leads to all other systems retrying; if they all retry simultaneously, it'll make the outage worse, so you add random noise to retry intervals so the retries all happen at different times).* Another contrarian view: despite all the reports that show that crime, war, poverty, etc are at all-time lows, Taleb believes now is the most dangerous time in history. He believes that a catastrophic Black Swan event (e.g., nuclear war) wouldn't even be an outlier at this stage. The key thing to remember, is that almost every time there is a catastrophe, it is always bigger and worse than anything that came before. So looking at our past now and being prepared for the catastrophes we saw before is irrelevant, as future Black Swans will be bigger and different in ways we cannot guess. The ethical dilemma he brings up is if some amount of ""noise"" (e.g., small scale conflicts to avoid big ones)—and therefore, some amount of sacrifice—is worth it to prevent the bigger disasters. * We need to take into account the idea of ""iatrogenics"" more, which is when an attempt to treat something (e.g., medically) ends up doing damage (perhaps more damage than the original issue). Many modern disciplines, such as governments and medicine, do not take iatrogenics into account as much as they should. For example, Taleb describes an experiment where 200 people went to the doctor and about half of them got a recommendation for a tonsillectomy. The remaining half then went to another doctor and again, about half of them got a recommendation for a tonsillectomy. Repeat this again and again, and there can be no doubt that a large percentage of those tonsillectomies are totally unnecessary. And, of course, an operation or procedure always carries a risk of harm.* One of the major gotchas with iatrogenics is that humans are biased towards action and intervention. Taking an action to resolve a situation is often rewarded; taking inaction to resolve a situation (even if inaction is the best decision!) is rarely rewarded. So whenever we see a problem, we are biased to do something to solve the problem, and rarely take into account the negative side effects that may happen from our intervention, some of which are worse than the original problem. For example, frequent visits to the doctor are harmful. That's because a doctor can easily be fooled by noise—e.g., your blood pressure randomly happens to be higher on some visit—and may end up prescribing treatments you don't need (the action bias says, we can't do _nothing_, right?). But medication may have all sorts of harmful side effects, and if you don't need that medication, it's a bad idea for you to take it! The conclusion is that doctors should mainly be used only for severe cases, such as a car accident or deadly disease, where the risk of iatrogenics is low, as with no action, the patient is likely to suffer or die. We should not use medicine on marginal or healthy people as that will do more harm than good. * Taleb brings up the idea that what matters for society is not the middle (the average), but the tails (the extremes). That is, society advances when we get more people towards the tails: the crazy ones that are imaginative, brave, and come up with the incredible ideas that revolutionize everything. If you just build a society that favors the average at the expense of the extremes, he claims we never move forward. Again, there's some truth here, but the reality with most innovation is that it has very little to do with lone, crazy geniuses. The hero narrative is a convenient storytelling device, but just about all new ideas are actually built from old ones, and the process is usually incremental. There's a long history of ""multiple discovery,"" where the same idea is discovered independently at nearly the same time (e.g, Newton and Liebniz discovering Calculus) that sometimes makes new discovery seem like an almsot inevitable outcome of the environment, rather than the work of a lone genius. We certainly need a society where it's safe to try crazy new ideas, but I'm not sure that's the same as saying only the tails matter.* There's an interesting discussion of how many innovations were ""discovered"" long before we figured out how to apply them. For example, the Mayans apparently never knew how to use the wheel... even though we found Mayan children's toys that did have wheels. They had the technology in front of their eyes, but never figured out how to apply it to the rest of life. Similarly, even though we've had wheels for thousands of years now, it was only recently that someone figured out to put wheels on suitcases. Before that, everyone painfully lugged luggage in their hands or on their backs, even though a better solution was right in front of us. * Taleb argues that only results from practitioners—those that have ""skin in the game"" and real world experience—should be believed. Anyone who writes about topics they learned solely through research and deduction/theories/derivation should be ignored (note: he does exclude some disciplines, such as physics and pure mathematics from this analysis). The reasoning is that if you have nothing to lose from your predictions and theories, then you may put out a lot of bullshit, and lead people astray, which will harm them, but not you (a negative asymmetry). He talks of the economists and stock analysts who put out all sorts of theories that are totally wrong, leading people to making terrible financial decisions, but those analysts face no negative consequences as a result. The solution is to pay less attention to what people say and more attention to what they do: that is, does the research follow their own advice in their own life? If not, that says much more than any paper or research. * Taleb argues that education (presumably he mainly means university education) and purely theoretical work doesn’t advance society. Instead, he argues that society mostly advances through trial and error by practitioners. For example, he talks about how much of architecture, for a long time, was developed not through mathematics, but by rules of thumb and heuristics that had been proven effective over many years. The jet engine was apparently developed through trial and error and for a long time, we had no real understanding of how it worked (I guess flight in general could be tossed into this bucket too). In other words, Taleb argues that theory typically follows practice. And in many cases, theory isn't all that necessary: e.g., you can learn to ride a bike without knowing the theories of physics and you can learn to cook amazing food without knowing the chemistry of taste. In fact, the empirical evidence and phenomenology are more reliable, as they always stay the same, while our theories change all the time. For example, in the past, we had a theory that people with more muscle mass kept fat off better because the muscles burned more calories; nowadays, we have a theory that weight lifting makes you more sensitive to insulin; in the future, there may be yet another theory. The theories keep changing, but the empirical result is the same—more muscle means less fat—and that's what really matters. I agree wholeheartedly with Taleb that trial and error plays a MASSIVE role in all innovation and discovery. The systems we deal with in the real world are complicated and few people can simply think their way to solutions that can deal with all this complexity (this is another reason the lone genius and outliers being responsible for innovation isn't accurate; it's less about genius and more about effort). That said, I suspect Taleb is cherry picking his examples, and that many innovations followed directly from theoretical results. Moreover, many experiments would've never been tried in the first place without a theoretical framework that hints at what experiments to try. So, my guess is that both practitioners and theoreticians are critical to advancing society, and obsessing too much with one or the other is not helpful.* There is a really compelling discussion of the idea that negative knowledge (knowledge of what isn't) is more robust than positive knowledge (e.g., knowledge of what is). For example, seeing a single black swan is enough to disprove the theory that there are no black swans. On the other hand, seeing 1 million white swans is not enough to confirm the theory that there are no black swans. Neither type of knowledge is perfect (e.g., it's possible that the black swan you saw was an optical illusion), but you should have far more confidence in negative claims than positive ones.* Things that have been around longer are generally more robust and have a _longer_ life expectancy (which is the opposite of how people age, where older people have shorter life expectancies). For example, a book that is still popular after 40 years is likely to remain popular another 40 years. A book that survived 100 years is likely to survive another 100 years. And books we've been reading for 1,000 years are far more likely to remain relevant for another 1,000 years than something that just came out last week. In other words, survival of something shows you that there is inherent value there. * Following from the last concept, when new ideas are compared to old (or new books to old), the burden of proof is on the new ideas. The old ones have some degree of proof simply because they have survived a long time. It's up to the new ones to show you they are worth something. This is useful in picking books (the classics will typically be better than new stuff!) but even more so when picking between artificial options and natural ones. Natural items have accumulated _millions_ of years of survival value, so there is a very high burden of proof to claim anything artificial or man-made wants is better. For example, highly-padded shoes with giant soles vs going barefoot; the burden of proof is on the shoes (and there is little to no research showing shoes are better)! Similarly, allowing an injury to swell naturally vs using anti-inflammatories (e.g., ice or ibuprofen); the burden of proof is on the anti-inflammatories (and again, there is little to no research showing those are better). I agree with all of this, but I think Taleb takes it a little too far with his love of ""the ancients"" (as he calls them). He seems to revere them as if they were somehow better than us simply because they lived a long time ago, which is NOT the same as revering ideas that survived a long time. * Random, but interesting tidbit on diet: we all accept that the stress of exercise helps make you healthier, but what about the stress of different types of diets? For example, intermittent fasting seems to make you healthier. Perhaps the stress of not eating for periods of time (or not eating certain types of food, such as meat) are good for you? Perhaps that's how we evolved (e.g., famine and feast cycles). Or some combination of factors: e.g., you need to exercise right before you eat, as we evolved in a world where we always had to chase down (or at least walk long distances) to find food.OK, phew, that's a lot of notes!In short, this book gets 5 stars for the ideas—not because I agree with all of them, but they do all make you think—but 1 star for the nasty attitude and meandering structure. Reducing how I feel about a dense book of several hundred pages to a single digit on a 5-point scale, that somehow works out to 4 stars."
45,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2812336-jacques-de-villiers,5,"Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder is a great follow on from Taleb's The Black Swan. The Impact of the Highly Improbable. I've learned a lot from Antifragile, but will only cover one or two aspects. I know if I read Antifragile again, (and I will), I will get even more (disturbing) insights that will disrupt my status quo.I love the barbell approach in Antifragile. On the left side you should get your 'house in order' so that you have a safety net (this is the safe zone) and this then allows you to take risks on the right hand side. So, if you should fail on the right hand side, it won't impact on your safety net.I love the idea that the safety net gives you the opportunity to sit and be creative because you have the time and space to do it. This is probably the zone where you'll come up with those 'good' black swan ideas that allude us all.Both Black Swan and Antifragile have turned my world upside down because what they essentially are saying is that no matter how hard you work, no matter how brilliant you are and no matter how long you carry on, you may never become 'successful' (whatever that means to you). What I heard Taleb saying was that randomness (luck if you will) plays a major role in success. And, you may never get lucky. This is a similar message to Malcolm Gladwell in Outliers - Do your 10 000 hours on perfecting your craft and hope to get lucky.If you've only read Antifragile and not Black Swan, you've got to get to Black Swan. Then you'll see how beautifully both books dovetail and give you a not altogether palatable answer to coming to grips with a world we don't understand.So, I suppose I'm actually reviewing both books ;-). Here's what I've got out of them. Build a safety net on the one end of the barbell which will allow you to take risks on the other end. And, perhaps we shouldn't be spending our time trying to find out the secrets of success but rather the secrets to getting lucky."
46,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,3,"A lot of work and brilliant thinking clearly went into this book, and I regret having to assign it a lukewarm 3-star rating. But it was simply too easy for me to put down and not particularly tempting to pick up, wisdom nuggets notwithstanding. I'm sure the problem is me, not the book, but I'm the one rating it so there you go.This book, which read like a longwinded intellectual blog with years of wide-ranging posts, discussed the concept that many things in life (parenting, economics, and more) fall into the category of ""antifragile."" Whereas fragile items are delicate and can be threatened by random (uncontrolled/unpredicted) events, and robust items are unaffected by random events, antifragile items actually benefit from the unexpected and unplanned for. One simple example would be allowing kids to handle stressors independently as a means of learning coping skills and therefore becoming stronger (treating them as antifragile), as opposed to smoothing out the road for them (thereby creating a self-fulfilling prophecy where the kid is assumed to be too fragile to handle stress, and the kid then internalizes and lives up to that expectation). Another example would be allowing the body to build resistance to germs (antifragility) rather than immediately blasting the germs with antibiotics so that the body doesn't develop this resistance. In so doing we then create antibiotic-resistant bacteria, i.e., strains of bacteria which are antifragile.I wasn't sure I agreed with every point the author made. I sometimes felt he was being intellectually dishonest or overstating his case, or engaging in the same cherry-picking and other fallacies of which he so roundly accused others. He clearly had an agenda, or several (anti-academic, statistics remove you from the truth, etc., etc.), and was not presenting his views objectively although they were certainly provocative. Unfortunately it's hard to cite specific examples because the book was just so damn long that I can't even remember the details any more.Hopefully the more intelligent goodreaders out there have thoughts on this book that are better formulated than mine. My main emotion at this point is relief at finally being finished with it."
47,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5883715-kevin,3,"Where to begin? So, yes, Taleb is very smart, and Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan were great books, which is why I looked forward to this one. Overall, I think I agree with or at least find interesting his theory about how the value of antifragility and/or convexity and/or anything else he wants to call it. But this book is a bit much. Taleb's arrogance seems to have reached a new high. He reminds me of Jonathan Franzen who seems to have decided that he has achieved the perfect balance in life and therefore will let us peasants get a glimpse of how he does it. For example, I appreciate Taleb's skepticism about modern medicine and agree with many of his observations, but I don't care what he eats or how he lifts weights. On and on we hear how stupid everyone else is and how brilliant Taleb is. He's the anti-Socrates. Yes, he professes humility, but he doesn't practice it. More than either of his previous books, this book suffered from a higher ratio of Taleb's self-love to new, interesting ideas."

The first half was five stars and the second fourish as he goes into more detail about his views. Part of my euphoria may have come from him being pro Ron Paul (also Ralph Nader), paleo (well paleo/vegan/fasting), salt, and a bunch other things I already liked. Is there any practical application for you or me in here; I think so, if only that I started doing my pull-ups with a backpack with 8.5L of water in it, Taleb says lift really heavy weights, which I knew but had forgotten. Even if you hate his personality I don't think you would think the first half wasn't a good use of your time, and yes I realize this was a worthless review."

50,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"Fragile refers to things that break when exposed to shock. Robustness refers to things that are resistant to shock. Antifragile refers to systems that become stronger as a consequence of exposure to shock. Living systems (including people) are Antifragile. In the mental health field we talk about resilience a lot. But it's not always clear weather resilience means being 1: Robust i.e. resistant to shock and therefore less sensitive, or 2: Antifragile i.e. optimized to learn and grow from life's inevitable stresses. The second would view willingness to experience intensity as prerequisite to personal growth. I see the need for both, but I vote for stepping to the Antifragile when ever possible.Antifragile is a ""game changer"" (please excuse the tiered phrase) for me, particularly for introducing me to the term: iatrogenic - loosely defined as harm caused via medical treatments, but more broadly applied to harm caused by any sort of intervention. The authors point in elaborating on the term is that living things (including people) often benefit from exposure to appropriate stressors. Interfering with said stressors (via medical or other types of intervention) however well intended, can be harmful in the long term. I could smooch Talb for digging up these ol chestnuts: Mollification, Mithridatism and Hormesis. Mollification means intervening with the intent to calm, sooth or pacify a symptom e.g. palliative medicine and pain management. Mithridatism is the practice of protecting oneself against a stressor by gradually administering non-lethal amounts e.g. exposure therapy for trauma and phobia. Hormesis is the practice of impelling a generally favorable biological response via exposure to stressors e.g. any kind of athletic training, weight lifting, running etc. Currently psychotherapy tends to promote the agenda of Mollification. In my ideal world, psychotherapy and psychological training promotes the agenda of Mithridatism and ideally Hormesis.The author is ""refreshingly irreverent"" (please excuse the tiered phrase) towards fancy, overly complex explanations and practices, and particularly skeptical (even hostile) regarding the too often unchallenged status and claims of academia. You have to love that even (no especially) if your an ivory tower resident. Taleb pits ""tinkerers"" (inventors and entrepreneurs) e.g. Steve Jobs against ""thinkers"" (philosophers and economists - so fashionable to bash lately) e.g. Paul Krugman, and asserts that tinkerers drive innovation while thinkers hitchhike and claim the credit. A neat observation, but similar to the equally brilliant and bombastic Matt Ridley, Taleb goes too far when dismissing the contributions of scholars and researchers to the greater good. Taleb posits ""Fat Tony"" as the archetypical Brooklynite, smash mouth, nobel savage, anti-philosopher who makes money by the bushel while the ""Harvard Fragilistas"" sit on their tweed asses and blah, blah, blah. The observation has merit, but much of reality simply doesn't conform to this caricature.For instance characters like Robert Oppenheimer, Richard Feynman and John von Neumann. Can you honestly call these guys effete intellectuals? They were all great humanists, theorists and hard drinking, bare knuckled men of action. They dreamed up and built the A-bomb and the ""thinking machines"" that facilitated it's creation, and then wrestled with the monster ethical and political issues that emerged as a result of its use. Let's see Fat Tony do that!As someone who has spent the better part of 30 years doing blue collar jobs, ones that entail mopping floors, swinging hammers and lifting lots of heavy things on and off of big ass trucks, I'm here to tell ya, despite what Dr Taleb says, sometimes those Fat Tony types are actually idiots. As someone who is also a college professor and community mental health clinician, some academics are not petty leaches. A few of them do good things and are actually kinda generous and smart.It takes all kinds of people to innovate. Some people push the ball forward from the arm chair e.g. Einstein. Some people push the ball forward from the wheel chair e.g. Stephin Hawking. Some people push the ball forward from someone else's sofa e.g. Paul Erdos, and sadly some great thinkers are ""regular guys"" who never get their due, but that doesn't mean that our celebrated intellectuals are all a pack of frauds.Additionally, Taleb lets his libertarian intuitions get the better of him when he try's to reframe the accomplishments of Denmark and Sweden as not in fact examples of effective centralized government, but rather cleverly disguised confederations of small, independent micro municipalities. Oh really? Now who's being all fancy pants? Call it what you want, but Denmark and Sweden have some of the highest tax rates and most top down interventionist social policies of anywhere, and still manage to squeak out a decent little standard of living for their citizens (Ooops, I mean the highest standard of living on the planet). Not the most innovative countries granted. But not exactly the gulag either.And as far as education failing to pay out in terms of higher income and opportunity. Would Dr Taleb like to explain his theory to the some of the first generation Mexican Americans that are students at the university I teach at? I'd be willing to venture that finishing college will equate to enhanced ""optionality"" for at least a few of those individuals. Maybe a few others.Don't get me wrong. I love the book. It's brilliant and it fully lives up to the hype. But as Dr Taleb says, Antifragile things love criticism, so here's a little love and criticism for him and Fat Tony."

He does spend some time giving definitions and examples to illustrate what he is referring to. That was much appreciated. I also liked his sense of humor. I now can use ""chamomile tea"" as a punch line. This is what I got out of this book. Adapt quickly. If someone cuts off your head, grow two back. Don't take anything for granted. There might have been a few more things but this was mostly entertaining for my daily read. It didn't change my life or rock my world. The author seemed to pick a fight with almost everyone/organization. But it was still entertaining, so 3 stars."
52,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2729963-duffy-pratt,3,"I started this book after Christmas with a great deal of excitement, put it down for reasons I can't remember, and then read the whole thing over the last three days. So while it looks like it took me months to get through this, it actually only took a few days. Taleb several times makes a similar point about averages. For example, suppose you were told by a nursing home that your grandma would be kept nicely in a room where the average temperature was a pleasant 70 degrees. What they don't tell you is that, half the time it will be at zero degrees, and the other half at 140 degrees. Sometimes knowing the average isn't particularly relevant.I liked this book. I've like all of Taleb's books, but I thought this one was less focused than its predecessors. Worse, having popularized the phrase ""Black Swan,"" which now seems to have fallen into the venacular, Taleb seems to have taken a scholastic turn and fallen in love with his own jargon and neologisms. Quite a bit of the book takes illustrative stories from classic sources, and then restates the point of the story in Taleb's own language, using neologisms like ""anti-fragile"", ""negative convexity"", and ""optionality."" Having made the Taleb restatement, he then asserts that we truly understand the point of these stories. For me, I like the stories and, for the most part, the lessons he draws from the stories, but I could really do without the jargon he seems bent on creating.Take ""anti-fragile."" Taleb insists that there is no word for the opposite of fragile. A thing is fragile when it breaks under stress. Ask most people for the opposite and they might suggest ""strong"" or ""robust."" But the strong simply has a higher breaking point. The true opposite actually changes and becomes more resistant to breaking when it is placed under stress. And Taleb says that there is no word for this, so he invents ""anti-fragile."" How about ""adaptable."" Something adapts when it makes changes so that it can better respond to stresses. That strikes me as being very much what he is going for with ""anti-fragile."" Indeed, Taleb's great system of anti-fragility is evolution, but the story of evolution is the story of adaptation.United by this central theme of adaptability, the book was a series of essays making forays into different fields to either illustrate or digress from the main topic. Most of it I enjoyed, and I agree with much of what Taleb has to say, even (or perhaps especially) when he flouts current conventional wisdom. He has a long discussion on the mistaken idea that technology tends to flow from scientific knowledge. The growth of technology actually tended to happen alongside, and apart from, the growth of scientific knowledge. This was a point that was central to a class I took on the History of Science and Technology in my freshman year at college. Taleb insists that the University, to establish its own importance, has hidden this basic aspect of history. Funny, then, that I should have learned it in a university, and as a lowly freshman. (In Taleb's defense, whenever I have tried to make this point with people in conversation, they tend to look at me cross-eyed: of course technology comes from science, how could it be otherswise. At that point I tended to tell them to read Nightfall by Isaac Asimov.)The last troubling point I will mention here is Taleb's love for telling us how the ancients had it right. He will support one of his ideas by some quote from an ancient text, often an obscure one. Here, I suspect Taleb is cherry picking. He's definitely better read in the ancients than I am, and I'm not going to try to come up with examples to support my point. But I know that people are very adept at supporting whatever point they want to by going back to the Bible. Both the abolitionists and the slaveowners knew for certain that the Bible was on their side. And here, I think if Taleb wanted to, he could fairly easily come up with some ancient author who has a saying that would support the denial of whatever point he is trying to make. Voila! The ancients had it right! This strikes me as very funny, because it is exactly the kind of thing that Taleb railed against in Fooled by Randomness.What this book did present, in a slightly clearer fashion than The Black Swan, is a practical approach that one might take in response to radical uncertainty. And like all of his books, it immersed me in a way of thinking that I find quite refreshing (despite the annoying tendencies toward scholasticism and self-congratulation). My guess is that Taleb is a guy I would find extremely unpleasant in person (though perhaps not, he does seem to favor Mini Coopers), but I'm grateful for his books and will almost certainly read anything that follows."
53,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5836830-ian-robertson,5,"Nassim Taleb has written a very worthy companion to his previous two popular books – Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan Taleb tells us that the three books “are non-overlapping chapters from [a] central idea, a main corpus focused on uncertainty, randomness, probability, disorder, and what to do in a world we don’t understand.” One need not have read the other two to enjoy this book, but those who haven’t will likely find themselves back in the bookstore to catch up once they’ve finished Antifragile. The three books can stand alone, but as Taleb points out, are extremely complimentary.Readers who enjoyed the previous two books will love this one, and as before Taleb’s writing is long on narrative and short on formulas (the technical writing can be accessed free online in short, supporting documents); complex ideas served in easily digestible bites. His familiar, erudite (some would say high falutin’) style is rich in stories, anecdotes, and of course philosophy and Mediterranean history. He is as cranky as ever, taking liberal shots at economists, bankers, MBAs and in particular Harvard (though he does reserve a soft spot for grandmothers, Steve Jobs and the Sopranos). He is also unusually frank in criticising well known thinkers and economists, though always from a point of principle rather than maliciously, sometimes by position and other times by name.Taleb is also more thoughtful and philosophical in this book, exploring to the fullest his central ideas noted above and their impacts on systems and entities. Specifically, Taleb contends that entities or systems are either fragile, robust or – in his words – antifragile. Fragile is the china collection in the display case (or our financial or economic system); robust is a rock; and antifragile is, well, the opposite of fragile, where a random knock strengthens rather than harms (or eliminates) the entity. Nature is the ultimate antifragile system, made stronger and more robust via stresses. Nature values diversity between organisms more than within organisms, though even within there are stabilizing redundancies - both larger scale (two kidneys) and genetic (duplicative and unused code) - developed through trial and error. A key point is that nature’s ‘system’ has developed in a ‘bottom-up’ series of trial and error, and not like many man-made systems (economics, finance, nation states) that are ‘top down’. In the same way, Taleb contends that a system of city-states will be more robust over time than will be a system of nations; that there is a more natural lifeblood to city-states and therefore better longevity when stresses appear. The long history of Taleb’s native Lebanon seems to prove well his point.Time is an enemy to fragility and friend to antifragility - something that options traders in capital markets know explicitly, as the value of an option increases with the time to expiration. Taleb’s earlier professional work with options and non-linear payoffs, and his more recent years of thinking and writing about the subject has of course produced his trilogy, but it has also produced some thought provoking guidance. For example, Taleb tells us he values the worth of a book by how long it has been in print; that books that have stood the test of time are much worthier of his and our attention than the ephemeral best-sellers (Jonathan Livingston Seagull anyone?) that capture our attention and quickly fade.In a narrative irony, Taleb tells of the fallibility of history and the biases of victors (or vanquished, if they’re telling the story) when they cherry pick examples to support their story, but of course Taleb does the same with his (well told) examples from his life, childhood, and ancestral home. And while Taleb’s stories and opinions are generally entertaining and appropriate, he does digress occasionally, for example when he extols the virtues of imperial measures versus those of metric. Small quibbles for a great work.While Taleb’s ideas do translate to the world of finance – his professional background – Antifragile is neither a finance book nor a blueprint on how to profit from markets with options. It is a book of philosophy and logic, well reasoned and applicable to the world in general. It will make you think and question not just your day to day life, but also the society we’ve built around us. An important and thought provoking book, and using Taleb’s measure, likely to stand the test of time. "
54,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510944-anima,5,"I deeply enjoyed reading this very well reasoned book . The abundance of witty ideas combined with examples from real life made me understand clearly the meaning of being ‘fragile’. I’ve been fascinated by Taleb’s flexibility of thought which connects a multitude of uni- and multi-dimensional events to natural “fragile and antifragile” behavioral tendencies. Here are few excerpts (few of the many that I very much liked).""How do we innovate? First, try to get in trouble. I mean serious, but not terminal, trouble....innovation and sophistication spark from initial situations of necessity, in ways that go far beyond the satisfaction of such necessity...'""..having an intense emotional shock from seeing a snake coming out of my keyboard or a vampire entering my room...would be beneficial for my health, provided of course that I manage to overcome the snake or vampire after an arduous, hopefully heroic fight..Such a stressor would be certainly better than the mild but continuous stress of a boss, mortgage, tax problems, guilt over procrastinating.., exam pressures, chores, emails to answer...things that make you feel trapped in life. In fact, neurobilogists show that the former type of stressor is necessary, the second harmful , for one's health"""" My friend Chad benefited from the kind of disorder that is less and less prevalent thanks to the modern disease of touristification. This is my term for an aspect of modern life that treats humans as washing machines, with simplified mechanical responses-and a detailed user's manual. It is the systematic removal of uncertainty and randomness from things, trying to make matters highly predictable in their smallest details. all that for the sake of comfort, convenience, and efficiency. What a tourist is in a relation to an adventurer,..., touristification is to life; it consist in converting activities, and not just travel, into the equivalent of a script like those followed by actors...""""...If you are not a washing machine or a cuckoo clock-in other words, if you are alive- something deep in your soul likes a certain measure of randomness and disorder""“We should pause a little when we hear ‘happiness’ defined as an economic or otherwise puny materialistic condition. You can imagine how distraught I feel when hear about the glorifies heroism-free “middle class values” which, thanks to globalization and the Internet, have spread to any place easily reached by British Air, enshrining the usual opiates of the deifying classes..”“I am even more distraught for the future of the human race when I see a nerd behind a computer in a DC suburb, walking distance from a Starbucks coffeehouse, or a shopping mall, capable of blowing up an entire battalion in a remote place...and afterward going to the gym for a “workout (compare his culture to that of knights or samurai). Cowardice enhanced by technology is all connected: society is fragilized by spineless politicians, draft dodgers afraid of polls, and journalists building narratives , who create explosive deficits and compound agency problems because they want to look good in the short term.”“The Problem of Frequency, or How to lose ArgumentsRecall that Fat Tony was in favor of just ”making a buck” as opposed to being “proven right.” The point has a statistical dimension....The frequency, i.e., how often someone is right is largely irrelevant in the real world, but alas, one needs to be a practitioner, not a talker, to figure it out...This means that one makes pennies to lose dollars in the fragile case; makes dollars to loose pennies in the antifragile one. So the antifragile can lose for a long time with impunity, so long as he happens to be right once; for the fragile, a single loss can be terminal.”“Wealth Without IndependenceThere is a phenomenon called the ‘treadmill effect’, similar to what we saw with neomania: you need to make more and more to stay in the same place. Greed is antifragile- though not its victims.”"
55,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9767799-anagh,4,"Angry, acerbic and ultimately correct about his most central tenets, Taleb offers an alternate take on everything ranging from finance, biology, healthcare, morality and innovation. In this season of politics, the reader is often reminded of parallels between him and Donald Trump as close to 90% of the book is written with an adversarial tone though unlike the future president, Taleb is ultimately correct on almost every front(no wall building etc.). Like most of his books, Taleb's alter-egos, Fat Tony and Nero Tulip star in cameos, taking the entertainment quotient through the roof. As always, name calling is the order of the day, as anyone with divergent views gets labelled a 'fragilista'(Stiglitz, Krugman, empty suits, federal reserve etc.) or worse.His criticisms are crafted under the framework of how systems react to stochastic perturbations. To illustrate the point, consider the response of a porcelain cup to movement. In the space of possible mechanical perturbations, most outcome states are unfavourable to the structural sanctity of the cup. In contrast, a rubber ball is likely to maintain its structure under most conceivable perturbations. Taking the analogy further, systems that reap benefits from random fluctuations are categorized as 'anti-fragile'(the author takes great delight in pointing out that he coined the term while acknowledging that the idea pre-dates him by centuries.). The airline industry, human physiology, Fat Tony's trading strategies etc. are cited as examples of anti fragility in action. Along the way, Taleb advises a barbelled strategy that aims at gaining from disorder while staying safe in the long run. For instance, a scientist should invest most of his funding in low-risk, tried and tested research areas while reserving some amount for high risk, high payoff research, thereby putting himself in a position that shields him from volatility while providing exposure to some of its beneficial aspects. For Taleb, top-down, theory driven intervention often has the effect of fragilizing systems. He cites(or rather rails against) medical iatrogenics as an example of how naive theorising often fails miserably when confronted with extremely complex systems such as the human body. The take home message is simple - focus less on calculating probability distributions and more on the consequences of those distributions.For me, the most enlightening of all are his views on exercise, particularly weight-training.In line with his ideas on 'convex-transformation', Taleb advocates moderate intensity workouts on most days, punctuated by episodic bursts of high intensity, one-rep maximum power-lifting(he claims to deadlift 300+ pounds once a week), effectively mimicking the paleo-ancestor regimen. His deference to everything old can be questioned, but this is tempered by the fact that Taleb expends a lot of pages(and insults) explaining how crisp rules of thumb often trump formal theories when it comes to decision making under uncertainty in complex systems such as medicine,biology and finance. Taleb rails incessantly against neo-mania, with its insistence on via-positiva instead of the more organic via-negativa. Replete with witty aphorisms, neologisms and barbs, Taleb is at his confrontational and pedagogical best in this book."
56,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10931405-ardyn,3,"This is a tricky book to review. The author looks at the world from a very interesting perspective and points out things that are often totally overlooked so you can really learn a lot from reading it. However, the tone of this book is frustrating. The author is cynically critical of so many things that you have to take what he says with a grain of salt. In some examples it feels like he's been so blinded by his dislike for certain things that he's incapable of being rational. The tone he puts forward prevents you from being able to take him totally seriously. Which is unfortunate because it has so much valuable content. That aside, it's still a remarkable book. He emphasizes the need for experimentation and making mistakes - it's very similar to Black Box Thinking, but with a societal (and slightly less practical) approach. I'd recommend you read this book slowly, so you can really reflect on what you're being presented. The author can be so adamant about his arguments that it can be difficult to be able to properly process them if you're reading it too quickly. It's not a highly practical book, but it's a provocative and insightful review of many of our institutions and the way we've organized as a society. "
57,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4427139-nathan-sudds,5,"The title of the book 'antifragile "" has really stuck with me since the first day I heard of it. The concept of something gaining from disorder or not just surviving but thriving in times of adversity and challenge really resonated with me. Maybe that's because it reminds me of having ADHD - some call it a disorder, but I feel like with the right attitude you can thrive in the midst of those challenges too. I ended up finishing the book via audio and really enjoyed that format. I rarely show any interest in reading or listening to a book a second time right away but I can definitely see myself dropping back in to sections of this book again soon for another listen."

So much so, I now have a serious author-crush on Nassim Nicholas Taleb.This book is really interesting and challenges traditional beliefs held across different disciplines such as finance, economics, politics, general life decisions, health, etc. It's difficult to write a review because there's so much information to consider and digest.Taleb's writing is straightforward, although some might describe him as brash - but I love that about him. He's not afraid to state his ideas and conclusions, even if they're unpopular among certain groups (i.e. bankers, academics, economists)."

While Antifragile is a best seller the premise of the book could be written on a napkin. ""The world is uncertain and unexpected things happen. Complex systems can fail from unplanned events. Robust systems that are flexible are better."" However, the author wrote an entire book where (a) his real world examples are none to interesting and (b) do really provide guidance on policy choices in the world. Don't see the attraction to this book and cannot recommend."

Most importantly, it is a book on ethics and morals, and Taleb will offer ideas from the classics (Seneca, for example), which you will begin to admire.Whatever you think of Taleb and his antics, he is a master thinker and doer, who talks the talk, but more importantly, walks the walk. "
61,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51843580-jess,1,"Man, I wanted to like this. When I started the book and read his initial statements about ""things"" (""systems?"" I thought - ""organisms?"") that ""like"" or ""hate"" disorder, my first impression was that use of the terms ""like"" and ""hate"" seemed like loose, imprecise words for a work that was going to be expounding on theories of risk and antifragility (and possibly making detours through philosophy). But I thought maybe he's going for a specific effect here and gave him the benefit of the doubt. But imprecise writing --and that's putting it mildly-- characterizes this book. I was terribly disappointed with this --the book could be aptly paired with a (short, devastating) drinking game based on spotting logical fallacies. It's rife with false dichotomies, begging the question, and global terms (""all top-down systems [...] no bottom-up systems,"" for example, and blanket statements that things are ""always"" or ""never"" the case without any supporting evidence beyond the vehemence with which he asserts them, etc.). It doesn't stand up well to a critical reading. Now, I don't write reviews. I write notes about books for my own memory/reference and keep them to myself. So normally I'd have rated this one or two stars for my own purposes and moved along, but when I saw how many people piled onto someone who wrote a negative review, accusing him of either being a plant by another author (seriously?) or just not intelligent enough to grasp the highly advanced, revolutionary concepts of Taleb's book (oh, my dears), I decided I should lend my voice in support. Yes, the author comes across (loudly, clearly) as a pompous ass in this book; he expresses contempt for so many other people, groups, and institutions, and does so in such cartoonish language, that you may periodically find yourself checking the cover to remind yourself that you're not reading a screed by a conspiracy theorist but a purportedly serious work --and that's unfortunate, because it takes away from some interesting ideas. Rants by the author characterizing himself as some kind of noble martyr of intellectual integrity (see also: the only one who understands what true science is), embattled by the simpleminded, the ""Soviet-Harvards,"" and the ""fragilistas"" (I did not make these up) that populate the sciences and academia... They distract from the work, to say the least. Combine his self-importance and derision with writing that's full of appeals to emotion, unsubstantiated assertions, and rhetoric in lieu of clean arguments, and the whole is a ratio of slog-to-payoff that I wouldn't recommend to anyone I liked."

Not that order isn't good, but it's comforting in a way to know it's not all us, takes the pressure off a little...Divine Providence would have it thus..."
63,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"Antifragile is a closed and extreme economic theory - something the author despises with venom in everything else.There are many positives strewn across the book. The author's over-aggressive style notwithstanding, what kills the book is his inability to see the massive limitations of his own philosophies - something he vehemently criticises in others.No theory or a partial model can explain the whole; this is understood by almost all thinking giants in physical sciences too let alone in social sciences or economic/financial world. Linearity (or much broader polynomial equations or equations involving standard irrationals/non-polynomials) or formulaic/rational ""modelling"" of reality is after all an assumption in all sciences to develop understanding. The founders in all sciences knew there are limitations to such assumptions but some of the most basic or complex assumptions are required particularly when the computing powers were small. Some of the practitioners forgot about the assumptions when they used the end equations but that does not mean Taleb is the first one to realize that ours is a non-linear world or Gaussian or other standard mathematical concepts do not completely fit almost anything we do.The point is that proving that the world can not be explained using standard precepts or concepts is not sufficient as there are infinite non-standard possibilities. For example, in physical sciences, one still can not explain in detail how water would move precisely in a narrow pipe. To debunk mathematics or formal study is one option in all such cases and this is what Taleb again does with his antifragility without realising how devastating it would be if all of begin to use mere words and impressions to describe the world.Antifragility is a good concept but an extremely narrow part of a broad economic theory of some Talebian kind even in the best case. It would be good to find systems or things that turn stronger in circumstances where most real life things suffer. Conceptually, such hedges are great as any financial market professional would claim. The author uses myriads of powerful words to provide handful of possible such items but they are so scarce and few in reality that most in the wider world cannot use them in most circumstances.For example, we all would want glasses that only don't break (resilient) but become stronger with shocks. Like human bodies that grow strong not just with regular viral attacks but every heart attack or cancer or over time. Or same thing with economic items. This point is good and accepted. But except in the author's financial world (where he could use the derivative instruments and shorts), and possibly not even there as so many traders have known through experiences, how many such things truly exist?And despite the author's abhorrence to anything precise or systematic, what is truly antifragile? The author's rant against so many things with phenomenal positive impact on life (for example education and medicine to name just two) is so ridiculous that it is laughable. If the author was just talking about the excesses, it would have been understandable. However, when he begins to use the personal and anecdotal benefits of things as simple as grandmother's teachings to trash college education or walking on a terrain to speak against the gym exercises (to name just two out of possibly tens of such examples), he reveals his own lack of preparation, knowledge inadequacies, biases, a closed mind and his main theory loses a lot of remaining validity for any knowledge-seekers. In the end, the theory is too close and too much fundamentalist that starts with one core assumption - ""this theory is right and anything that tries to say otherwise is wrong."" Something at the core of most philosophies that have inflicted a lot of harm on this world as the author himself rightly notes."
64,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10141232-fred-kohn,5,"For those that gave up on this book: I sympathize. About 100 pages in I was ready to tear my hair out, going back and forth between mental cheering and physical eye-rolling. It was about that point that I realized that the book itself was written as a demonstration of the author's main point. It was (deliberately, I would guess) filled with random noise: foreign phrases and words (mostly Latin, but also French, Chinese, Arabic, etc.), obscure terms and neologisms, often introduced but not fully explained until later (sometimes 100s of pages later), humor in strange places, etc. etc. Once I figured this out, the going was a lot better. I don't know if the noise actually lessened around page 100, or whether I was feeling the effects of hormesis (a concept explained early and fully in the book, thank God!) I did not find the author so much arrogant as nutty in a somewhat charming way. But that may be only because my dad was an inveterate neologismist, a property my wife tells me I have inherited. Perhaps I come off as arrogant as well? For sure I am a nut, but at least I have a diagnosis, and am therefore excused.If I detected any arrogance in the book, it was the characterizing of academics, especially economists, as leeches on society. Perhaps it is personal on my part; my brother is an academic (geology and climatology). I didn't mind Taleb going after Bernanke and Greenspan so much. It is fashionable to do so these days, even though what I have read of their writing convinces me they are not near the numskulls they are made out to be. But it really burned my buttons when he went after Joseph Stiglitz, who is kind of a personal hero of mine:(view spoiler)[ One day in 2003, Alex Berenson, a New York Times journalist, came into my office with the secret risk reports of Fanny Mae, given to him by a defector. It was the kind of report getting into the guts of the methodology for risk calculation that only an insider can see — Fannie Mae made its own risk calculations and disclosed what it wanted to whomever it wanted, the public or someone else. But only a defector could show us the guts to see how the risk was calculated... So we immediately saw that their blowup was inevitable... But around the same period, Joseph Stiglitz, with two colleagues... looked at the same Fannie Mae. They assessed, in a report, that ""on the basis of historical expectence, the risk to the government from a potential default on GSE debt is effectively zero."" They also said that the probability of a default was found to be ""so small as to be difficult to detect.""The main fallacy is evident. Stiglitz was not looking at the same Fannie Mae, because Taleb had access to insider information that probably was not made available to Stiglitz. Furthermore, the risk estimated by Stiglitz was qualified in the report:[T]o the extent that the risk-based capital standard is not enforced effectively [by Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), which regulates the GSEs], [my] approach would underestimate the expected risk to the government.Of course, we now know that lack of regulation was exactly the problem. Ironically, it was G. W. Bush who proposed a new regulatory agency for Freddie and Fannie, in part because ""A report by outside investigators in July [2003] concluded that Freddie Mac manipulated its accounting to mislead investors."" ~ New York Times, 9/11/2003I also think the idea that Stiglitz made his report ""around the same time"" as Taleb made his evaluation is a bit of a stretch. Stiglitz' report was published March 2002. Taleb evaluated Fannie Mae ""sometime in 2003."" So there was a gap of a year, give or take. (hide spoiler)]To be fair, I am nitpicking on this last point. Taleb did acknowledge that Stiglitz is a top notch economist. Taleb just thinks so little of economists that this fact doesn't mean much to him."

He comes across as arrogant, condescending, and prone to egregious overstatements. He's also a so-so writer and definitely could have used an editor to pare down this book. But the quality of his ideas in this book are simply off the charts. If you can get over the personaility behind the words, this is a trasure trove of quality insights into how to improve our mental models of how the world works.There's no succinct way to summarize all of the ideas in Antifragile. The main points cannot be categorized linearly, but seem to flow outward in many directions from the central idea of antifragility. In his own words ""Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile."" Taleb takes this idea of something that gains from disorder and volatility, and chases it in a bunch of directions, coming up with some very interesting insghts. Here are a few of my favorites:- The concept of antifragility is mathematically captured by an asymmetry. Things that are fragile have more to lose than to gain from randomness, and antifragile, the reverse. In this way, we can rigorously test things for fragility. Instead of trying to build systems depending on accurate predictions, we can simply try to design systems that are antifragile. - Using the concepts of fragility vs antifragility, we can design systems to be ""non-predictive"". That is, systems that do not rely on us having accurate predictions. ""More technically, we may never get to know [some future event] x, but we can play with the exposure to x, we can control a function of x, f(x), even if x remains vastly beyond our understanding. We can keep changing f(x) until we are comfortable with it... The answer to the question ""what do you do in a world you don't understand?"" is, simply, work on the undesirable states of f(x)."" ""The hidden benefit of antifragility is that you can guess worse than random and still end up outperforming.""- In the long run, things that gain from randomness should tend to dominate - this is exactly the case. Evolution and Mother Nature have endured because they exhibit antifragile tendencies. Shocks and randomness create diversity and redundancy, which allow the system to be resilient. What we should learn from this is that the natural does not need to be proven. It has proven itself by its longevity and resilience. It is the non-natural the needs to prove its benefits, before disrupting or interveneing in a natural system. "

I'll give it 3, averaging out my enthusiasm and irritation.Antifragile is a sequel and elaboration of his timely Black Swan, more than just a thesis fleshed out -- full of references to his classical self-education, and charmingly and appallingly personal in his personal dogmatism of anti-dogmatism. Never shying from an insult when he feels it deserved (and he usually does), he has equal scorn for the Harvard-Soviet academic establishment, Wall Street bankers, pretty much anyone who wears a tie or sees a personal doctor, or gives a TED talk. He has a Luddite streak, noting that time is the ultimate stress test for survivability and that if something has been around for a long time and you don't know why, you probably don't understand it correctly, and you'd be foolish to bet against it. He's one of those people who won't admit that any issue might have another side than his, but gives you an opportunity to reassess why you disagree when you think maybe you should. He professes to drink only water, coffee and wine, beverages known for thousands of years in his ancestral region, and likely to be good for you. He thinks the Orthodox fast and feast cycles provide the dietary stress that strengthens the body and spirit, and elevates hormesis to his central metaphor of what it takes to survive and prosper: not strength and resistance, which will eventually be overcome by an outsized trial, but nonlinear response to random stress, in a way that extreme events can induce unbounded success. Evolution, for example, or the way muscular exertion leads to increased strength rather than accumulated wear. Artisans instead of corporations, city states instead of centralized megastates, taxi drivers instead of salaried managers, the souk instead of the suburban mall-- all the former with a diversified set of options within their experience, accustomed to boom and bust, able to find a new niche in a time of chaos. Read this for insights into more than financial risk assessment, but be prepared to smile and shake your head as one bit after another of personal invective soars past the absent editor this book badly needs."
67,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6809550-ahmad-abugosh,4,"Taleb gives you a lot to think about and comes up with another phrase that's permeated discussions on statistics ""Antifragile systems"". The basic premise of the book is that there are 2 types of systems you'll see in life, systems that are fragile (subject to substantial loss), and antifragile (subject to stability and ultimately convex gains). Examples given in the book on fragile systems are: most standard predictive economic models, assumptions that people have (for example that education produces a higher standard of living ), and institutions that need to be propped up, like the banking system. Anti-fragile systems on the other hand are ones that have stood the test of time, and that produce practical results, mostly natural processes (eating organically, straightforward exchanges, focusing on practical real world knowledge etc.)Although I liked the book, there are a couple of things I didn't fully agree with:1) When he speaks about fragile systems, I don't recall him giving many solutions to modern problems. He talks about ways that the modern world sucks, but doesn't have many solutions except to criticize, and say how we should be going back to simpler times. He derails any tactic or person that tries to fix or move society in a positive direction. I understand that the world is very hard if not impossible to control, but don't we have to do something?2) This book is full of ad hominem attacks calling a number of people ""fraglistas"" that in theory I agree with him on, but if I recall his public feud with Steven Pinker on ""The Better Angels of Our Nature"", I'm sure a lot of these have more to the story than he's letting on. Besides that, I found the book thought provoking and interesting. One thing that I'm still thinking about days later (that doesn't apply everywhere, but is suitable for many choices in life) is how if you need to write a list about something, then you probably shouldn't do it, since usually one reason is enough to do something, and if you need to make a list of reasons, then you probably are trying to justify things to yourself."
68,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5069466-paul-mullen,3,"It's a very interesting idea: What robust is not anti-fragile, it's just limited fragility. Anti-fragile refers to things that like abrupt changes. Think of a teacup that would stay together more consistently if it were occasionally dropped on a concrete floor. I like Taleb's irreverent writing style, but I think at times his shock value exceeds his delivered value. His rant against marketing and big business lacks the same rigor that he applies to other areas of statistical analysis, for instance. Nevertheless, it makes for a fun walk through the occasionally technical elements of his forest of arguments.Taleb leaves me with a couple of thoughts: Big=fragile. Fast=fragile. New=fragile. Anything non-organic/natural=fragile. If this is true, then there is little that innovation can do to develop antifragile solutions... we just need the randomness of creation to occasionally give us a better solution that is then tested over millennia. Interestingly, large systems like earth, and nature, and biology become anti-fragile in this way, but small systems like me only benefit marginally due to my limited time and limited exposure to variance. It is kind of anti-anti-big, but that's part of the fun of reading Taleb.I am just too curious about life and too motivated to be creative to leave it to the arbitrary variance of a stochastic universe for the improvement of our lot. Though Taleb hints at the rationality of religion when it comes to solace, it is mostly the time-worn wisdom of the disciplines of fasting, and the last resort hospice of religious care that he credits with religious life. I am most fully me when I am creative and I see the same correlation in many others. To sit back and wait for antifragile to happen is not enough for me. I'm going to go look for ways to put the idea to work.Anybody need some broken teacups?"
69,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68529396-emily,4,"This is a big book, both in length and in scope, with an extremely simple and important idea at its core. It's also a frustrating book, riddled with small pieces of nonsense and meaningless fodder for the author's ego. I would have expected no more and no less of Taleb, and I think he might even appreciate this characterisation, seeing as it places the book itself into the ""antifragile"" category: it ultimately doesn't matter how many of the details you get wrong, if your central point is both unassailable and crucial.Despite having taken copious notes, it's a struggle for me to marshal my overall thoughts on the book, perhaps partly because of its strange, meandering organisation and unfortunate dumping of all the technical ideas into appendices. (Taleb blames this divorce of the actually useful details from their surrounding context on an editor, but I suspect him of complicity out of some weird aesthetic sense and condescension towards people who don't really believe an idea is rigorous until they see it expressed in mathematical notation. It's the sort of opinion I feel he'd have.) Therefore, here are some rather disjointed comments.First, some of the overarching messages suffer from what looks to me like a bit of the classic is/ought fallacy. As a firm believer in progressive ideals (that statement would be sure to elicit a sneer from Taleb, I feel), I find many of his inferences make for very uncomfortable reading. For example, he is very concerned about the risks (not to mention snooty about the effects) of globalisation, a process rendering human society continually more fragile, in his opinion, as redundancy is whittled away, trust becomes untenable as a foundation for economic exchanges, and vital infrastructures become too complex for anyone to make out who really has what ""skin in the game"", as he calls it. These are all very valid concerns whose importance I have only recently come to appreciate (this book helped, but is not the only exposure I've recently had to this type of argument, and I'm not sure it would have convinced me if it had been). Taleb seems to believe this means globalisation will either simply fail, or succeed all too well and doom civilisation to fragility and inevitable demise in the process. But if increasing globalisation is either inevitable or desirable (I believe it is both), I think the focus should be on trying to mitigate these problems, not on declaring it an ill-conceived violation of the natural state of being. I don't buy the (implicit) argument that an antifragile but globalised society is an inherent contradiction, and I'm intensely suspicious of worldviews that look backwards in time, rather than forwards, for ideals. Personally, I don't want to buy antifragility at the cost of barbarity and deep injustice of the kinds that have been historically the norm, and I'd like to think humanity can avoid making this trade without dooming ourselves to succumb to the first black swan of globalisation that crops up.Second, I was inevitably irked by Taleb's cavalier attitude towards science. Grousing about perverse incentives in acadaemia is a perpetual hobby of mine, so it's funny how defensive I get when somebody else tries it! I do think he fails to give enough credit where it's due, though: the system is surely extremely imperfect, but it works (slowly and non-monotonically). Taleb claims that any arguments along the lines of ""but look at all this stuff science has achieved!"" are fallacious because it's impossible to tell whether individuals would have accomplished this work anyway without the support of academic institutions, etc.; he claims they would. However, I'm not sure how he proposes to allow the scientific model to continue working its magic in their absence. He likes the notion of the gentleman natural philosopher of a couple of hundred years ago, seeking out interesting lines of inquiry because he literally has nothing better to do with his intellect and lack of need to earn an income, but times have moved on and this is a good thing (see above paragraph!). Not only is this vision incompatible with certain highly beneficial social developments, it's an inefficient way of selecting groundbreaking scientists (in this setup, one's opportunity to do the work is almost totally independent of one's ability to succeed at it) and it fails to account for the fact that precisely because science is so good at what it does, the low-hanging fruit that can be picked in a part-time clergyman's back garden and the inside of his brain are gone. Big institutions supporting big laboratories and big research projects are part of the game. I also believe that science is nowhere near as blind to its incentive problems as Taleb makes out; they're a near-constant topic of discussion in my own field, and although change is slow, I think a bit of momentum is gathering.Finally, a woolier point that I am less sure about: it bothers me that some of Taleb's arguments about longevity (that which survives will probably continue to do so) have a whiff of the dangers associated with the anthropic principle, or some generalisation of it, about them. This doesn't apply to all such arguments, but I think there are a few where it is relevant. To the extent that the occurrence (or lack of occurrence) of some event is necessary for me to have ended up existing today and reading this book, I have trouble trusting deductions the book proposes about how cosmically likely it was to have happened. It may have been incredibly unlikely, but if it had failed to occur, this argument wouldn't be taking place. This means that there are some classes of entities, including those where evolution is a relevant consideration, where I have a hard time accepting the notion that lengthy survival indicates strength; it might just be attributable to survivorship bias.These notes barely touch on a few of the thoughts this book caused me to have, but this is already very long, so I will close with a gripe that angered me out of all proportion and yet would have been so easy to fix. This book has some of the very worst diagrams I have ever had the misfortune of encountering. Actually, ""diagrams"" is too nice a word for many of them. They are ugly pictures that add no information and sometimes sow confusion. Don't even get me started on Taleb's bizarre ideas about how to use tables to present ideas. If you read the book, I recommend not even looking at any of the figures outside the appendices. I do recommend reading the book, but try to do better than I did at avoiding enmeshment in the frequent and irritating tangles of local wrongheadedness: the global point is both thought-provoking and vital."
70,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6917235-samcwright,4,"Taleb is a flawed vessel for carrying these super-important insights...and that’s OK. The central idea of this book, that many things benefit from volatility and disorder, is fascinating. And I agree that our efforts to protect economies and society often make them more fragile. He is an original thinker and should be encouraged. We need more people that think outside the norm and that likely means they will be outside the norm in other ways. What are his flaws?Like Taleb’s other books, this is 25% interesting insights and 75% “screw academia, the Establishment, philosophers, and journalism, I’m smarter than all of them!” That’s unfortunate. His inability to get over the “I’m rich and a practitioner and know more than everyone else” obscures his important ideas. I happen to share a similar disdain for many of these institutions. Not that I don’t think they do some good. But that they produce 1 unit of benefit to society for 99 units of self-congratulatory self-promoting protectionist intellectually-simplistic silliness.Should you read this book? You should at least become acquainted with his arguments. The book could be 75% shorter. That’s a much better “gold to dirt” ratio than most books (particularly business and self-improvement books which should be 3 bullet-points on average). Consider at least watching a few lectures of Taleb talking about the book on YouTube or listening to a couple podcasts about it."
71,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22489589-bryan,1,"I find the notion of antifragility fascinating, and so was looking forward to reading this book. However, I ran away after only a few pages.I admit a bias -- when I see blurbs from the Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Harvard Business Review, etc., my interest generally plummets. They've been so right about so much the last few decades, I don't feel a strong need to absorb yet more of anything they care to recommend. But I tried anyway.Then, after finding Taleb's clotted writing style a bit of a slog, in the first few pages I read: ""While in the past people of rank or status were those and only those who took risks, who had the downside for their actions, and heroes were those who did so for the sake of others...""Which makes me wonder what planet he's been living on where only the cream rises to (or is born at) the top.And later that same page I see that the ""inverse heroes"" who have displaced our former ranked and status-bearing worthies are bureaucrats, bankers, Davos-attendees, and academics, I'm fairly satisfied that his planet has little enough to do with this one that I can safely set his book far, far aside."

The world is a much better place for this book having been written, and it will bode well for the world if this book is still on the shelves (whether they be physical shelves or electronic shelves) one hundred years from now.I'd classify this book as one of the books that takes me forever to read because it will inspire a thought I've never had, or rekindle thoughts I had a long time ago, and stare into the sky and think for a few minutes. I will then go back to the book, and repeat that process. That's the type of book I want to read. "
73,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60222708-nati-s,4,"In this book Taleb introduces the concept of Antifragility. Although, at a first glance, you might think that antifragile is the opposite of fragile, it is not really the case. One might think of it as dichotomous rather than opposite. So just in the same way as there is positive to negative, heads to tails, up to down, love to indifference, we have fragility to antifragility.An antifragile object gains when exposed to volatility, just in the same way as a fragile object gains from stability. This concept applies to systems such as physical and biological objects. Take the body, for example, it becomes sort of ‘better’ when it’s exposed to volatility like physical exercise or caloric limitation.In this book, Taleb discusses the concept of antifragility and how it relates to our daily life. He uses examples from medicine, academics, economics, and more to make the point that we must not ignore antifragility if we want to gain from volatility and disorder, which inevitably arises as consequence of interaction with complex inter-dependent systems.After reading this book, I became less likely to pursue a PhD."
74,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,4,"If you like well thought-out, contrarian ideas, Taleb is for you. His thinking is unique. Unlike most economists, who think in terms of ""optimizing rational choice,"" and rely on statistical modelling that assumes a bell curve and predictability (he calls these economists ""fragilistas""), Taleb thinks in terms of unique, ""black-swan"" events. Like the ""unforeseen"" impacts of AIG's reinsurance failure nearly killing the economy in 2007 as packaged mortgages and unscrupulous lenders who duped their customers, who were often ignorant and uneducated, caused a dangerous bubble. That bubble burst. What makes Taleb unique is that he sees this randomness as natural. Disruption is a fact of life. You pay off your car, and it gets damaged in a flood. You build a thriving local restaurant, and a single case of bad lettuce infected with E. Coli brings your business to bankruptcy. Etc. These events are just bursting bubbles, albeit on a smaller scale. Taleb sees the key to surviving these bubbles not as diversification... that makes you resilient, but the turmoil caused by the crash will still hurt you. Sure, you's lose less. Say you invested $1500 in an S&P 500 index fund in Jan. 2008, you'd have....... about $1,000 on election day (-$500, for a return of -33% since inception)... about $890 in November of 2009 (-$610, a return of -41% since inception)But a return on the same $1500 invested in the financial sector would have returned about -$810, a return of -56%. And if you had those in investment banks or AIG, you could have have lost over 75% of your value. So while a diversified portfolio is better, it is still fragile. Black swan events still hurt. The key is thinking in terms of ""options."" Not as in choices, but like an investor who purchase an ""option"" to sell a stock at a fixed price for pennies to the stock's value. If that investor thought the financial sector was going to crumble in 2008 due to the mortgage crisis, they'd buy a ""put"" option, which allows a holder to sell a stock at the face value to the option's seller. So if a market craters (like the $1500 losing $810 in the example above), the ""optioned"" investor will be able to purchase the stocks at the lower price ($690) and sell them at $1500, pocketing the $810 the stock lost. This is what Taleb calls ""antifragile,"" since a person employing ""optionality"" benefits from turbulence. He expands this thinking into every day reality. For instance, assume two brothers, Fragile and Antifragile. Fragile goes to business school, has a massive student loan debt, and works in an office in a finance department. He works long hours and makes really good money, but odds of him rising to a CEO position are slim. And his life is dull (a trade-off). He has a McMansion in a bed and breakfast suburb that cost him a mint. Problem is if the company he works for goes out of business, he'd be forced to scramble. Odds are, his skills are rare, so he'd need to cast a wide net to find a job. Odds are, if he's high enough up the ladder, he's have to sell his house to move, disrupting his family. Worse, he may have to sell during a down-market. Or take a pay cut. Etc. So while Fragile's life looks decent, it's rife with boredom and it's not sure. Antifragile, on the other hand, attended culinary school at local community college. He worked his way through college, and has no loans. He owns a small bungalow with a modest mortgage. Thing is, he has worked in dozens of kitchens over the years. His skills have broadened, so he can work in most places, from being a short-order cook to working as a sous chef in a gourmet restaurant. So when the restaurant he works for shuts down, he'll have another job in a few days due to his skills. He can stay in place. Better still, the new job will teach him new recipes and new skills which will make him even more valuable.Typical American culture embraces Fragile. The prepared brother, the guy on to corporate ladder. While Taleb's convinced that Antifragile has the better life. His occupation is more interesting, he's always learning a skill that never goes out of style... and he eats better at his craft every day. Better yet, he benefits from the inevitable turmoil... the type of stuff that threatens to crater Fragile's life. That said, Taleb is sure to alternately appeal-to and piss-off Libertarians, Right-wingers, Liberals, Socialists, etc. He loves market-based solutions, but has no stomach for Wall Street pandering CEO's who buy Washington influence that enables them to hog the upsides when their enterprises gain, and yet off-load their failures like Wall Street did after the crash. He also has a solid idea: If a business is ""too big to fail,"" and its failure would damage the economy beyond repair (like the Big-Three pulling out of Michigan and Ohio and moving operations overseas, bankrupting workers while execs got bonuses or Wall Street execs failing and taking bailout TARP money while earning $1 M/ year), those businesses should be tightly regulated. Period. Sounds sortof like Bernie Sanders.On the other hand, if you run a mom and pop... you know, a real Free Market, not a bought (via political contributions)-and-sold monopoly... you should be free to keep your upsides. Period. So long as you're willing to brave the down-side. Period. Since this sort of creative churning creates things of value that can stand the test of time if done well. Which sounds an awful lot like Gary Johnson. And Taleb further muddies the waters. He advocates for a Scandinavian-style social safety net. Sure, it's partly classic Lefty ""it's justice."" But also because that would free people up to take risks, to create even more value in a greedy, Free-Market, winner-takes-all feeding frenzie. All told, ""Antifragile"" is a great book to mull over. Not as good as some of Taleb's previous works, and often contradictory... but the guy's always interesting. Sort of like that interesting guy who sits at the bar, talking to the cranks with quite glee, but far from a crank himself. Four stars. "

Once you grasp the elegance of Taleb's thesis -- that everything gains or loses from volatility -- the rest is just a semi-autobiographical collection of aphorisms meditating on the nature of the world and our place in it. I found myself reading it in small chunks, just to remind myself of the at once profound and hilariously true-to-life wisdoms within. Taleb's concept of anti-fragility (or convexity) is simple, yet not easily grasped thanks to our default Western way of thinking about things. Taleb's willingness to engage with his critics in his characteristically lively manner makes an otherwise unfortunate (and serious) matter as enjoyable as it can be empowering (or depressing, as you care to look at it).Not simply worth the read -- this should be mandatory.

He is likable yet solipsistic, intelligent yet pedantic, compassionate yet abrupt. Antifragile: Things that Gain from Disorder is the second of his books I’ve read (actually listened to the audio version), the first was The Black Swan back in 2007-08. Taleb’s influence was critical to my reassessment of the capital markets in 2008 and his admonitions supported some gainful personal decisions at that time.Antifragility is defined as the quality of something to benefit from disorder. Unlike a poorly constructed UPS package of wine glasses that will shatter if disturbed, something that is antifragile will actually gain strength if disturbed. This is not to be confused with robust, which is merely something that is less likely to be damaged with disorder, ie, a well-constructed UPS package of wine glasses. Antifragile takes it a step further to an entity that is actually improved with disorder.Nassim Taleb says that great thinkers have only one great idea which is refined and adapted over time. Darwin had natural selection, Einstein had relativity, and presumably, Taleb includes himself with the idea he now calls antifragility. I did mention he has an ego, right? Putting Taleb’s high self-opinion aside for a moment, I’ll grant that Antifragility as a followup to the Black Swan does deserve a place at least in the minor pantheon of cultural memes, albeit a few notches below Darwinism, but yeah.As an example in nature, Taleb refers to the ability of any species to adapt to environmental stressors as antifragile. Antifragility is everywhere in nature: the weak succumb while the strong survive and reproduce. Cultural examples are depicted by Adam Smith’s idea of the “invisible hand” that guides markets opaquely by rewarding beneficial actors and punishing the weak. For the record, Taleb later notes that the right-wing corporatist understanding of Adam Smith is incorrect and Smith never used the word “capitalist”, but that is another issue.Platonic, or top-down, management is differentiated from bottom-up, or empiric, reality. Plato’s idea of a philosopher-king, like a soviet style central planner who has some special understanding, does not jibe with what we observe in the world. Rather, the world is populated with adapting individuals and evolving ideas, some of which will die off and others that will survive. Taleb extends this notion from business and banking to other fields as wide-ranging as medical care and even religion.Upon listening to a short interview of Taleb regarding this book, I was a bit unsure if I’d agree with his assessment of health care, but having finished the book, I’ll accept that he has it mostly correct. Medicine is best when it embraces the empiric, guided by what we see that actually works….what Taleb calls the heuristic: the rule of thumb. Treating numbers, like mildly elevated cholesterol levels or arbitrary blood pressure “abnormals” with medication can lead to iatrogenic (ie, doctor-induced) harm and needless cost. The best examples of pharmaceutical development are rare-- eg, antibiotics and vaccines-- while things like cholesterol-lowering statin medication, developed for only the worst hereditary hypercholesterolemias, are now prescribed to lower mildly elevated levels without evidence of benefit. The human body, much like capital markets, is too complex to adhere to such top-down models since such things as long term sequelae and side effects are impossible to predict a priori. The best medical practice comes from time-tested heuristics, otherwise known as rules of thumb empirically shown to be effective. All else is waste and danger.The asymmetry of information in medical care is what renders it complex, not only the asymmetry of knowledge between doctor and patient, but also--especially-- the asymmetry of resources between corporate actors and those of us in the trenches. If Big DrugCo floods the evening news shows with advertisements for their latest wonder drug, there isn’t a whole lot that will keep that drug from making it into medicine cabinets around the country. Eventually enough patients and practitioners will succumb to the influence of the moneyed interests. Restless Leg Syndrome has no less than six FDA-approved remedies. Taleb was an options trader back in the 1980’s, buying mostly out-of-the-money puts and calls on various asset classes, which earned him enough money to retire at an early age to philosophize. He develops the concept of antifragility and how to achieve it, what he calls optionality, by placing a bet on a perturbation in the system. A small bet can become a big winner if that perturbation is large enough. For example, a put option (a bet on a crash) on the stock market would have lost small amounts every year from 2001 to 2007, but then would have resulted in a windfall if held through the debacle of 2008. Options are insurance for when the rare cataclysm, ie, Black Swan event, occurs.Antifragility is not a how-to investment book, it is a philosophy book. Taleb rails against those individuals in business and government he calls “fragilisitas” who engage in activity and promote policies that increase fragility in the economic system. Alan Greenspan, Robert Rubin, Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz are his favorite foils because they call for supporting weak actors who make bad decisions while ignoring the possibility of fat-tail events, those rare but devastating occurrences that can destroy entire systems. Taleb, however, reserves special disdain for Alan Blinder, a former Vice-Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, who took the cynicism a step further. As a bank official, he enacted all manner of confusing regulations and then parlayed his “inside expertise” into a cottage industry upon leaving office, advising clients how to navigate these regulations. Furthermore, Blinder started a company that took advantage of FDIC deposit insurance for large corporations by splitting their colossal capital accounts into smaller accounts that would qualify for the FDIC protection. When asked if this were ethical, Blinder replied only that it was perfectly legal, while he collected prodigious fees from his clients. Taleb uses this as an example of the introduction of fragility into the economic system by cynical application of asymmetric knowledge and influence.I enjoy Taleb’s passion and ranting, but it occurs to me that much of his self-admitted “anger” is misplaced. This fragility is inevitable. Relax and be entertained. For the vast majority of us the opportunity or inclination to act unethically is nonexistent, but a few sociopaths will always exist, so why bother fretting about the inevitable? Herb Stein, a Nixon White House economic advisor in the 1970’s, when dismissing the two-pronged dangers of the budget deficit and the trade deficit, coined Stein’s Law. To wit: ""If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” While Taleb never mentions this particular maxim, I think he would embrace it nonetheless. In fact, for all Taleb’s withering banter about fragilisitas and fat-tails and black swans, I sense that he is all too aware of the inexorable nature of humans to embrace harrowing fallacies that lead to destruction. It’s what we do. After all, Taleb successfully navigated the options markets to make a bundle of cash, so while luck likely played a role he does have some concept of risk management and the human propensity to ignore risk. Taleb’s first book was a technical tome on financial options called “Dynamic Hedging”, so he definitely gets it.On a more personal note, I enjoy listening to the spoken word versions of Taleb’s books, and I search my podcast app for any interviews of Nassim Taleb. One interview on some economic webcast actually took my breath away because of the eerie similarity of Taleb’s personality to that of my father, Vince. The passion, the erudition and even the speech cadence is uncannily similar (the audio books, unfortunately, are read by a polished professional actor.) Not many people can expound on Seneca one moment and the next give a fairly accurate description of how skeletal muscle fibers function. This is like my father, who could explain how Jungian symbols of the collective unconscious correspond to the three levels of consciousness of the Huna religion one day and the next would give a textbook explanation of quantum mechanics and radioactive decay (he was a radiologist, later turned psychiatrist, by profession). As they say, all that plus $8 will get you a six-pack of Anchor Steam.Individuals who have such profound and wide-ranging interests are rare and usually misunderstood. Their humility is masked by their intellectualism. Taleb’s humility is manifest in his admission that specific predictions about almost anything are impossible, hence the concept of Black Swan events and the importance of protecting yourself against any and all major cataclysms. He notes that financial commentators are forever trying to predict the “next Black Swan”, completely bolloxing the concept that such things are inherently unpredictable. You cannot know, so be humble. Optionality in a broad sense is the only mitigation available. My father also had a firm grasp of this idea that increasing fragility, or entropy, is natural and he gave excellent advice about becoming antifragile, although he had different terminology. Amidst all the discussions about the Caeser’s Gallic Wars or conjecture about whether he could harness the noosphere to control a roll of the dice, pearls of wisdom would occasionally wiggle out. Unlike Taleb, Vince didn’t have an editor so it usually took effort by the listener to keep the conversation focused. Eventually, I gleaned that economic disasters occur once every generation or so, for Vince it was the Great Depression and World War II, and at the time of our discussions it was the crushing inflation of the 1970’s that followed Vietnam. Shit WILL happen. The Great Recession of 2008 was inevitable in some form, and the next crisis is already in development somewhere. The best protection, the optionality, is to learn a useful skill that even the Russians or Red Chinese will need. Fix furnaces or cars, or deliver babies; that will never go out of style and you will have insurance against fat-tail events. Be thrifty, be skeptical, pay off your mortgage. Relax, the rest is entertainment.Nassim Taleb’s Antifragility synthesizes several fields of interests into an overarching theme. He discusses the problems of agency, actors who lack skin in the game, the failure of even the best economic and biologic models, the human tendency toward bias, etc. My short review cannot do it justice. As a sequel to his previous works, Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan, this book successfully depicts the nature of the human condition, culturally and biologically. Read it, you’ll be richer for it. "

""Nothing convinces us of our capacity to make choices — nothing sustains our illusion of freedom — more than our ability to regularise our behaviour. nothing is more capable of destroying our interest and our pleasure in what we do.If it is the predictable that stupifies us and the unpredictable that terrorises us, what should we do? If we are always caught between risk and resignation, between confidence and catastrophe, how can we decide what to do next?""— Adam Phillips
My problem is what my mother kept telling me: I'm too messianic in my views.— Taleb

The most ambitious and messy book in his idiosyncratic four-volume work of evolutionary epistemology, the 'Incerto'. (It is 
Fooled By Randomness
, 
Black Swan
, 
Bed of Procrustes
, and yonder.) The former three books are largely critical, hacking away at theory-blindness, model error, and the many kinds of people he sees as possessing unearned status (economists, journalists, consultants, business-book writers): this is the upswing, a chaotic attempt to give general positive advice in a world that dooms general positive advice.Every other page has something worth hearing, for its iconoclasm, or a Latin gobbet, or catty anecdote, if not something globally and evidently true. I think he is right about 30% of the time, which is among the highest credences I have for anyone. I only think I am 35% right, for instance.* But a core point of his system is that his approach should work even given our huge and partially intractable ignorance.The core point, repeated a hundred times for various domains: 

In real life, many systems deteriorate without an irregular supply of stressors (non-fatal negative events), and actually benefit from them by constructively overreacting. By robbing such 'antifragile' systems of stressors, modern approaches to managing them do damage in the guise of helping out.**
This observation leads to his grand theory of everything: every system is either fragile (damaged by volatility), robust (resistant to damage from volatility), or antifragile. This isn't a trivial distinction, because each has formal properties that allow us to change arrangements to, firstly, prevent explosions, and then to gain from chance volatility. Biology is definitely one of these antifragile systems***; his case that, absent gross financialisation, the global economy would be one is convincing too; and the idea's at least plausible when applied to the cultivation of virtue or existential strength in a single person. The danger with this - an indissoluble danger because there can be no general strategy to avoid it - is that in welcoming constructive stress we'll miss the point at which the welcomed dose turns destructive (where fasting starts to atrophy, where training becomes masochism, where critique becomes pogrom, where sink-or-swim encouragement turns abuse). 
* This claim is remarkable for both its extreme vagueness and apparent arrogance. Here is a post to handle the former fact. And the latter:It might strike you as beyond arrogant to assume that you just so happen to be the most reliable inference device in the world, but that doesn't (have to) follow from my claim above, which results from the trivial thought “I believe my own beliefs most”, instead.(Consider the converse: if I came to view anyone as more reliable than me, the rational thing to do would be to incorporate their truer views (and, better, their methods) until I again thought of myself as at least their equal. So, either one believes the superficially arrogant position “I believe my beliefs most” – or else one must believe that one is incapable of adapting enough to superior methods when faced with them, or else one must believe that one cannot know which methods are best. So the above assumption is more about having a high opinion of rational adjustment than impossible egotism, I think. Good news! We can now calibrate ourselves, at least for the most sensational and available predictions using this cool thing.^Finally!: The fully-unpacked, properly defensible assumption might be something more like: “I am the agent that I know to be most transparently reliable or unreliable; I assume I’m adjusting properly to better methods; as such I have at least equal confidence in my own belief set, compared to the best known alternative agent's.”)^ You might wonder if this argument suggests that I should have 100% confidence in my beliefs. No; even if I was the best inferrer, I would suffer uncertainty because of the opacity of my errors: that is, I know I'm often not right but don't know exactly whereabouts I'm not right. Also from the unsystematic internal PredictionBook every non-psychopath has (""wisdom is knowing you'll be an idiot in the future""). And another source of uncertainty is down to the unknowable (like what stocks will crash next week).I do worry that, whatever my particular self-credence estimate is, the whole approach is subtly wrong somewhere – since ""40%"" gives the impression that I think of myself as a worse guide to the world than dumb chance^^ – but I think it works. Particularly if much of the missing 60% is made of safe scepticism rather than errors.^^ For binary event spaces – but, really, how many of those are there in real life?

** He credits the formal basis of all this to Jensen's inequality, in a chapter which might be the clearest expression of the idea there is.*** (In particular species-level evolution, but also organism-level health.) 

************************************************************* Some pigeonholes you might think to put all this in: *  Conservative? Yes; but a good-hearted Burkean (“Antifragility implies that the old is superior to the new… What survives must be good at serving some purpose that time can see but our eyes and logical faculties can’t capture…”). Most people are conservative over some things (e.g. the natural world; we just happen to call that conservationism instead). Also approves of any high technology that removes anything he views as a disease of civilisation, like these things were supposed to be. So, in general, conservative only in the sense that existential risk people are.* *  Economic conservatism. Only sort of; he's a trader, and would have speculation free to flow provided that deposit banks were nationalised first, and prioritises deficit reduction in a way we associate with conservatives but which e.g. Sweden pulled off without any lasting social justice sting. More formally he is against centralisation on both moral and technical grounds; that is likely a principle with some conservative effects, justified, in theory, by its keeping us alive. (Life-critical politics.)  Laissez faire? No: he recommends radical change to e.g. science funding, but no decrease. Big fan of Switzerland’s government, read into that what you will. He sees “optionality”, an originally financial concept, as the solution to fragility risks and the key to success in every domain there is. This isn’t at all as economistic as it sounds; the sacred and the humane somehow fit perfectly into his core rationalist agenda, persistence through change. *  Social conservatism? No sign; no discussion of discrimination. Some people think such abstention is oppressive, but they are probably wrong. *  Social Darwinist? Nah. *  Bioconservative? Absolutely; he describes himself as the ‘diametric’ opposite of Ray Kurzweil, and he’s in full uproar over the global risk posed by synthetic biology (and recently fleshed out this horror in highly rigorous terms). *  Anti-intellectual? Not at all! Only anti-academia, and they still do not represent the whole of quality intellectual life. Hates irresponsible ‘canned methods of inference’ too (statistical significance, etc). *  Lacrimist? (That is, does he glorify suffering?) Not quite. He certainly views comfort as vitiating. His opposition to transhumanism is too quick and doesn't take the moral challenge of a world of pained beings seriously enough, for me. *  Macho? Hm. Well, nature has made certain challenging actions optimal. Amusing proto-paleo attitude, too: * I, for my part, resist eating fruits not found in the ancient Eastern Mediterranean (I use “I” here in order to show that I am not narrowly generalizing to the rest of humanity). I avoid any fruit that does not have an ancient Greek or Hebrew name, such as mangoes, papayas, even oranges. Oranges seem to be the postmedieval equivalent of candy; they did not exist in the ancient Mediterranean.  * His work fits the x-risk paradigm very well, but he developed his edifice in complete isolation from them, and has an uncompromising scepticism about expected value that might not make cross-overs all that fruitful.
************************************************************* How original is the core point, really?Well, who cares? His claim is that he had to invent the word 'antifragile', not the idea. He says, idiosyncratically, that Seneca and Nietzsche had the nub of the idea, and Jensen the formal essence; Darwin certainly did too. ""Resilience engineering"" and in computing, 'defensive programming' (b. 1998) and 'self-healing systems' (b. 2001) are at least on the same track, though not getting beyond a lively sort of robustness. But I doubt that most systems can become antifragile - e.g. it's hard to imagine an antifragile jet engine (one that harvests bird strikes for fuel, or soot cleaning)? So maybe it's only the grand generalisation to all design that's new.
************************************************************* Gripes: His footnotes are collected by theme rather than linked to his claims directly, which makes it so difficult to follow up his sources that his credibility suffers. He namedrops, which is not the same as showing his working. I would really like to see his backing for his cool claims (about e.g. an irregular sleep pattern as a good thing, or things like ‘I suspect that thermal comfort ages people’), but it’s hidden away and often one-study. (Again: apparently one-study, since his working is not easily on show.)He has a surprisingly high opinion of Steve Jobs – who I view as a grand example of an empty suit: there are 9 references to Jobs’ hokey shark-wisdom, (where Gigerenzer and Mandelbrot get 8, Jensen gets 7, Marx 7). Does Jobs really count as a ‘practitioner’ with ‘skin in the game’? Eh.His homebrew jargon starts to drag – some sentences are wholly composed of his neologisms plus a barrel of articles and prepositions. (I used the glossary early and often.) Repetitive: tells what he’ll tell you, tells you he’s told you. Some passages really suffer from his wholesale hostility to copy-editing; there are some flatly bad sentences here. And he namedrops a lot, more than fair attribution of ideas – there are several passages that are just lists of people he likes (e.g. p.257-8). I don't see that it's worthwhile to criticise his arrogant style; it's what animates his points, and he never uses it on weak targets.Lastly, he sometimes makes of a system’s persistence the highest good. (Where its persistence is to be contrasted with mere stability.) This is in tension with his wonderful emphasis on artistic and quasi-sacred values elsewhere in the book.But it talks about everything, is historically wide-eyed, relentlessly rational, and often funny. And the method-worldview-style it suggests might stop life crushing us utterly."

Human bodies are complex systems. Depriving systems of stressors, vital stressors is not necessarily a good thing, and can be downright harmful.Fragilistas (or naive rationalists) believe that the reasons behind things are automatically accessible to him.New perspectives:Less is more, and usually more effective. (via negativa)On wealth:The richer we become, the harder it becomes to live within our means. Abundance is harder for us to handle than scarcity.Excess wealth, if you don't need it, is a heavy burden.F*** you money - A sum of money at which you gain the advantages of wealth (being independence and the ability to only occupy your mind with matters that interest you) but not its side effects, such as having to attend a black tie charity event and being forced to listen to a polite exposition of the details of a marble-rich house renovation.If true wealth consists in worriless sleeping, clear conscience, reciprocal gratitude, absence of envy, good appetite, muscle strength, physical energy, frequent laughs, no meals alone, no gym class, some physical labour (or hobby), good bowel movements, no meeting rooms, and periodic surprises, then it is largely subtractive (elimination of iatrogenics).Criticism, for a book, is a truthful, unfaked badge of attention, signalling that it is not boring; and boring is the only very bad thing for a book.When you don't have debt you don't care about your reputation in economics circles - and somehow it is only when you don't care about your reputation that you tend to have a good one.One should have enough self-control to make the audience work hard to listen, which causes them to switch into intellectual overdrive.The solution to the bailout model is building a system in which nobody's fall can drag others down - for continuous failures work to preserve system.Procrastination as a message from my inner self and my deep evolutionary past to resist interventionismDebunking the effectiveness of planning: It makes the corporation option-blind, as it gets locked into a non-opportunistic course of action.In spite of what is studied in business schools concerning economies of scale, size hurts you in times of stress; it is not a good idea to be large during difficult times.Small segments in projects go one small error at a time, with no serious role for squeezes (forced choices with outsized costs).Heuristics are simplified rules of thumb that make things simple and easy to implement. But their main advantage is that the user knows that they are not perfect, just expedient, and is therefore less fooled by their powers. They become dangerous when we forget that.The rule of having skin in the game, of eating one's cooking: It does not mean that one's personal experiences constitute a sufficient sample to derive a conclusion about an idea, it is just that one's personal experience gives the stamp of authenticity and sincerity of opinion.Domain dependence: We are all similarly handicapped, unable to recognise the same idea when it is presented in a different context.Nobody worries that a child ignorant of aerodynamics and incapable of solving an equation of motion would be unable to ride a bicycle. So why don't people transfer this point from one domain to another?Much of aging comes from a misunderstanding of the effect of comfort - a disease of civilisation: make life longer and longer, while people are more and more sick.Much of modern life is preventable chronic stress injury.Writing is only worth it when it provides us with the tingling effect of adventure, which is why I enjoy the composition of books and dislike the straitjacket of the 750 word op-ed, which, even without the philistinism of the editor, bores me to tears. And, remarkably, what the author is bored writing bores the reader.""I have noticed that the more people glorify the entrepreneur as an abstraction, the more they will scorn an actual one they meet.""You only know about someone's character after you harm them with an error for which you are solely responsible - I have been astonished at the generosity of some persons in the way they forgave me for my mistakes.The problem is that by creating bureaucracies, we put civil servants in a position to make decisions based on abstract and theoretical matters, with the illusion that they will be making them in a rational, accountable way.AphorismsBe careful not to confuse catalysts for causes.Provide for the worst, the best can take care of itself.If the student is smart, the teacher takes the credit. These illusions of contribution result largely from confirmation fallacies: in addition to the sad fact that history belongs to those who can write about it (whether winners or losers), a second bias appears, as those who write the accounts can deliver confirmatory facts (what has worked) but not a complete picture of what has worked and what has failed.What I was given to study in school I have forgotten, what I decided to read on my own, I still remember.Anything one needs to market heavily is either an inferior product or an evil one.Marketing beyond conveying information is insecurity.Never ask a doctor what you should do, ask him what he would do in your place. You might be surprised at the difference.Intelligent nuclear firms are now realising that they should focus on exposure to failure, making prediction or non-prediction of failure irrelevant.Fat Tony was allergic to the empty suit: someone who has a command of all the superfluous and administrative details of things but misses the essential (and isn't even aware of it) so his conversation becomes mere chitchat around the point, never getting to the central idea.An intelligent life is all about such emotional positioning to eliminate the sting of harm, which as we saw is done by mentally writing off belongings so one does not feel any pain from losses. The volatility of the world no longer affects you negatively.Even when an economic theory makes sense, its application cannot be imposed from a model, in a top-down manner, so one needs the organic self-driven trial and error to get us to it.An idea does not survive because it is better than the competition, but rather because the person who holds it has survived.An answer is planted in every question. Never respond with a straight answer to a question that makes no sense to you.Iatrogenics, being a cost-benefit situation, usually results from the treacherous condition in which the benefits are small, and visible, and the costs very large, delayed and hidden. And of course, the potential costs are much worse than the cumulative gains.Since one small observation can disprove a statement, while a million can hardly confirm it, disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation.It does not mean that one reason is better than two, just that by invoking more than one reason you are trying to convince yourself to do something. Obvious decisions (robust to error) require no more than a single reason."

94,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"In this book the author presents the idea of antifragileness. The best way to understand this is with the tricotomy he gives: fragile-robust-antifragile. Fragile things or people are adversely affected by large random events that are not anticipated. Robust things or people are those that can weather the storm so to speak. Antifragile things or people actual gain significantly from the same events that break the fragile things and people. An example of antifragileness that the author gives early on is options. To illustrate these he gives the story of Thales, sometimes said to be the first philosopher, who bought up all the olive presses in his part of Asia Minor, then part of the Greek sphere in 600 BC. The cost was small, but he became rich when there was a bumper crop of olives, and people all around came to rent his olive presses, for which he made a handsome profit. The idea is that you can take small risks with big payoffs, hence making you antifragile. Some other aspects of antifragileness are: the use of via negativa, which contains the idea of substracting to things, instead of adding (e.g. in medicine, quit smoking); having variety and varying intensity; hormoses, exposure to a little of something to build up resistance to it (e.g. germs so the immune system can be primed); negative (fragile) and positive (antifragile) convexity; and relying on empiricism instead of theory. As far as his empiricism is concern I have some qualms. While one should always have evidence for ones actions without theory observation is lame. He also seems to require valid experiment for the benefit of things, while he does not think it is necessary for things dealing with the antifragile because it is deemed broadly applicable. This seems like a double standard and being reliant on theory or methodology instead of evidence. His basic ethical approach is admirable. This involves never gaining antifragileness at the expense of somone elses fragileness. He believes that compensation in employment should include negative compensation. Hence, if an executive is on the job when that company falters, that person should be docked compensation, so that he or she can be held responsible for the negative consequences he or she brought about. This makes the person have “skin in the game,” as he would say. Or, don't cause risk for others without causing risk to oneself.Another thing that the author claims is that education does not lead a nation to riches, but it goes the other way; riches leads to education. I can buy this up to a point. After all, the United States gained wealth before it became the center of world class university education. However, on a personal level education leads to better job prospects in the modern world. So, my agreement is mixed on this point.I felt that I connected with the author on a number of points. He counsels diversity, which my activities in life certainly are at the present time. We also seem similar in our reading habits; we both read what is interesting and refuse to finish a book that bores us. Another link is that our ideas spring from our active pursuit of knowledge, such as reading. This is in contrast to others, who propose an idea, and then go looking for confirmation.Overall, I give the book high marks. It was interesting throughout and the author's writing is fluid. As you can guess from some of my comments above, I do not agree with him on all points. But, that's okay. Agreement is not necessarily a criteria for what makes a good book for me. I suggest this book for someone who is interested in a different approach to economics and other social sciences. Although it might be useful as a challenge to a person's entrenched view point on these subjects. I would also recommend the book for those interested in relatively new ideas. He claims that parts of the book are on the technical side, and I do not agree. The only part that is definitely technical is appendix 2. If you find graphs and simple, in words, equations a challenge, you would consider these parts technical as well."

Some things are robust - they're resilient to small random things happening to them. But the best things are antifragile - small random things happening to them make them stronger. Good examples are things like your immune system, since being exposed to weak viruses makes it stronger.So far so good. Unfortunately the rest of the book was painful to read, even as there were some good ideas sprinkled within. Here are some reasons why!- The author is, to put it delicately, an egocentric asshole. He calls things ""sissy"" and ""wussy"", because he's apparently a fifth grader. Some choice quotes:A friend who writes books remarked that painters like painting but authors like ""having written."" I suggested he stop writing, for his sake and the sake of his readers. Charming, no? He also goes on about people who just don't understand his ideas (which I'm a little skeptical of...it's possible that they do understand and disagree, which I'm sure the author would consider the same as not ""really"" understanding) and gives the example of a time when he was doing a radio interview and the journalist didn't understand something, so he walked out of the studio.- The book is extremely prone to overstating things for dramatic effect (I assume?), which made me not trust it in a lot of cases. The author says ""I realized school was a plot designed to deprive people of erudition by squeezing their knowledge into a narrow set of authors."" (and then has a long list of authors that he's read) He says depression is a made-up disease! Here, look:But when you medicate a child for an imagined or invented psychiatric disease, say, ADHD or depression, instead of letting him out of the cage, the long-term harm is largely unaccounted for.I mean, I don't disagree that ADHD is probably overdiagnosed and we need to be careful about prescribing medication, especially if it isn't proven to work better than counseling. But I think it's pretty unreasonable and insulting to say depression is ""imagined or invented"". To me, this shows a lack of empathy or a belief that since he doesn't feel depressed, other people are just ""sad"" or faking it or something. Sigh.- He has a giant chip on his shoulder. In retrospect this isn't terribly surprising, because in ""The Black Swan"" he talks about betting for the market to crash and being wrong every day for a long time, until he was right. (it also isn't surprising because he's an egocentric asshole - see above) But he attacks people mercilessly, some of whom seem like they don't deserve it. He keeps calling people ""Fragilista"" (which I never was entirely clear what that meant) and he talks about about ""Soviet-Harvard"" people. He is extremely condescending towards ""book learning"" and claims that most innovations came from tinkering without understanding what was going on, which I find a bit implausible.- The book is extremely hedgehog like (see The Hedgehog and the Fox) - he tries to apply this principle of antifragility across a wide range of topics, some of which he (proudly!) doesn't know much about.He also hates the metric system because the imperial measures are ""intuitive"". For example, a furlong is the distance one can sprint before running out of breath, which is really stretching the definition of intuitive...Anyway, with most books I try to ignore the parts I don't like and get what I can out of it. In this case the whole reading experience was pretty unpleasant, and 90% of the good parts were in ""The Black Swan"" anyway, so I'd recommend reading that instead."
97,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"== Second Read ==The second run-through was just as good as the first. Key keys reinforced: optionality, ""via negativa"" (subtractive > additive), iatrogenics (harm done by the healer, or more generally naive interventions), asymmetric risks (so topical). Understanding a bit more about risk asymmetries is so interesting - it changes the way you think about many questions and problems (be it finance, pollution, medicine, forecasting, estimating, planning, policy-making, etc). I want to re-emphasize what a cool ""idea book"" I think this is. If you haven't read NNT it's probably unlike anything you've read before. It's not an airport business book, and it doesn't fit into a neat genre. The narrative is nonlinear and challenging (in a good way) and to me, very refreshing. Since Taleb is an unapologetic asshole he writes unfiltered and that pisses off some readers (esp. those ""charlatans and wage slaves"" in academia and huge corporations), he takes a jab at virtually every audience likely to be reading the book. I highly recommend this book (above all other NNT works), just ignore the jabs and don't miss a chance to learn something and explore new ideas via a great modern thinker, storyteller and philosopher. == First Read ==My head is spinning - this is such an interesting book. The key concept is in the title, which is not necessarily intuitive without a whole book beating the idea into you. Here's the thought experiment: If someone asked you to name the opposite of fragile - not knowing this book - you'd say robust, strong, or another synonym. But fragile (think: a teacup) implies a terrific failure in the face of volatility (shocks), whereas robust (think: a travel mug) just implies durability, but little change in state. Antifragile is a different idea: something that gets stronger with volatility/shocks (cup metaphor fails here). A real-life example would be forest fire management: forests are fragile due to fire management and the enormous buildup of underbrush, but are antifragile to fires (they get stronger) in their natural, unmanaged state. The same idea applies to the human body; we get stronger with shocks to our system. We are missing this word, antifragile, from our vocabulary. Taleb carries the concept of antifragility through finance, business, medicine, personal ethics, the human body and more. Like The Black Swan, this book is filled with his trademark side stories, aphorisms, examples, and philosophical musings. However, Antifragile is more focused, the side stories are more off track, the aphorisms are better (much of academia = lecturing birds on how to fly), everything is just BETTER. After my first read, I think this is simply a better book than The Black Swan; equally challenging and entertaining, and well put-together. Still, Taleb's style and I'm-definitely-smarter-than-you tone is not for everyone. Whoever borrowed this from the library before me was triggered enough to add about a dozen put-downs and call-outs in the margins, for reasons I don't quite understand. This is definitely a book I want to re-read (and expand my review, and hone the ideas). 5 easy stars. Me: ""I loved it"" Robyn: ""Well you didn't stop talking about it""Lastly here is a much better review than my own: https://unherd.com/2018/12/why-antifr..."
98,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807377-jon,5,"Nassim Taleb has coined a useful word, antifragile—a word that will be permanently lodged in our lexicon. Here's how to explain it. When you send a box of glasses in the mail, you write fragile on the box. When you send something robust, you write nothing. So robust isn't the opposite of fragile, as some might suppose. The opposite of fragile is something that gets stronger when it's broken—something antifragile. It's a useful word for many reasons, but I'm primarily interested in how it applies to politics because it allows us to bypass many typical (boring) partisan arguments about whether regulation is inherently good or bad. Taleb starts with the premise that we will never eliminate volatility (i.e. Black Swan events, or random unforeseen changes). From that premise it follows that we should only pass regulations which will make the economy more antifragile (that is, stronger after the inevitable future volatility).That may sound simple-minded, but the implications are important. For instance, this rule of thumb would eliminate endlessly complicated regulation like the Dodd-Frank Act (which may eventually sprawl to 30,000 pages of rules—creating loopholes ripe for cronyism), but it would leave open the possibility for simple, market-wide regulations like breaking up the banks, or banning credit-default swaps. In other words, an antifragile economy is one that implements only regulations that aren't needlessly complex, don't pick winners and losers, and never add hosts of bureaucrats. By this token an antifragile economy also favors diverse, simple, small and medium-sized governments over the concentrated hive of bureaucrats that Washington has become. (Taleb's uses early America and Switzerland as models to follow, and I agree.)What's more, an antifragile economy is full of entrepreneurs and small/medium-sized businesses instead of megacorporations. We know that entrepreneurs fail frequently, over and over, but each failure makes the future economy stronger as it quickly learns from their/our mistakes (thus, it's antifragile). This is the opposite of ""too big to fail,"" a system where each recurring failure weakens the future economy for years to come, with losses spilling over to unrelated parties (i.e. taxpayers).So here's a word that breaks the pro-regulation/anti-regulation dichotomy: antifragile. It provides us with a useful rule of thumb, a new and better way to frame debates about the intersection of business and government. It's a word we should start using.And the book? The book is sprawling and aggravating(!) and wonderful. "
99,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7140517-sam-rhodes,5,"Having just finished Mr. Taleb's Antifragile, I find myself dazed to the point of saying something as trite and stupid as, ""Thank God. You're here. Where have you been?"" At 63, I would like to say that Antifragile has been, not the read of the day, not the read of the week or the month, nor, not even that more revered and honored award, book of the year. Antifragile, for me, has been the read of a lifetime. It has helped me, in ways that no other book has heretofore been able, understand the way, and the ways, in which I have always thought. Mr. Taleb's words serve as a flashlight (actually more like a beacon) to present, past, and future segments of my journey through this life. Just because a book somehow finds itself assigned to such meaning in one particular life, does not make it a great book, even though it may be that it has done so for many others as well. That would only mean there are many particular others connecting, just as I have, to Mr. Taleb's vast understanding of chaotic thoughts and principles.The true greatness in Mr. Taleb's writing is in its allowance for abstract thought to find life and become visualized on the page. His writing style cradles great truths and facetious little innuendos sprinkled within single sentences. His depiction of Fat Tony's bumbling and stumbling along into a massive collection of wealth through the common sense, Snooki-like, captured and fed only in New Jersey logic is incredible, especially when pulled, in full character, into conversations with Nero and debates with Socrates. His apt, and brutally honest, descriptions and characterizations of the people with whom we mingle everyday, whom we too see in such light but are afraid to talk about it, seem to come from a complete undressing of all things sacred, safe, and secret by Superman like eyes while we look on.It would be easy to drone on and on about Mr' Taleb's acute awareness and observational skills, or his psychologically and historically sound philosophical unpatterns of antifragile thought, but that would be an attempt to grease the skids of antifragility through the use of fragility, so I will stop here, and if nothing else, pretend that the simplicity of you alone with a book is something I want to see."

While we're on the subject of failings, let me make clear that the main insights, and theories, of the book are neither as original nor as immediately useful as the author wants you to believe.There. That's two pretty big failings - I can see the point of all those 2- and 1-star reviews.However, you've got to be kidding me if you place so much value on such trivial things. The worth of a conversation or an argument does not lie in its social palatability or political correctness. (Often, in fact, quite the opposite.) I would, in fact, recommend you approach to the author like a jester, a joker, a comedian - and not take the things he says too seriously. Calling some people ""sissies"" and ""a**holes"" is useful if politically incorrect Mediterranean advice, or life lessons, for non-Mediterranean people (the author is Lebanese, and he is recommending an Italian Mafia style solution to problems).And you wouldn't call Steve Jobs's inventions terrible just because he was a terrible human being.Nassim Taleb's insights and conversations can be quite good - well worth the trouble of forgiveness.Finally, to prove my point, here are five (5) great insights that can be gained from Taleb's account:1) The interconnection between all fields of life - from institutions and science to the economy. 2) We need external stressors, optionality, variability and evolutionary growth in order to strive.3) The vital importance of ""via negativa"" as a general life strategy: call BS BS and avoid comfort.4) The importance of the long view of things; a short-view perspective leads to too much fragility.5) The mutual importance of risk-averse conservatism and risk-loving radicalism as coeval paths.Most importantly, the book is fun, daring, obscene, ugly, egotistical, important, crazy, and good. The great lesson is that we don't all need to be Mother Theresa - even terrible people can be right."
101,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"It is not hard to see why Nassim Nicholas Taleb ticks a lot of people off. On top of being heterodox, he's also brash, confrontational, and--by the standards of academic decorum--a barbarian. I love the guy.I'm not sure that I believe everything that he says, but his theories and ideas are fascinating and definitely have merit. What's more--although I wouldn't take personal swipes at people the way he does--I really think he's utterly sincere in his quest for knowledge. That's something that's desperately rare in professional academia, where the incentives make sure we have plenty of provocation and novelty and complexity but tend to leave truth as a neglected concept. And that's the best case scenario.I listened to this book on Audible and took so many notes that my back-of-the-envelope calculation tells me I can reread the entire book in Kindle faster than I can transcribe the notes. (Cursed Google Books won't let me find most of the passages I want to transcribe. Which is obnoxious, since I already own the book in audio and digital format, but not at the right venues. How many times do I have to buy the same book just to be able to search the text? The 21st century still has some things to figure out.)Anyway, I'm going to reread the book and then automatically import the notes into Evernote and then update this review with more info on the actual, you know, content.But the short version? Taleb is an interesting adversary to the complex systems guys at the Santa Fe Institute. They're both tackling real problems (like institutional fragility, which matters a lot when the institutions in question are stock markets and governments) with a genuine 21st century paradigm while almost all of our contemporary policy and political debates are still basically mired in the 19th century. Maybe 20th, on a good day.This stuff matters. I'm just a little worried that we're going to have a lot more avoidable catastrophes (like the Great Recession) before public discourse catches up with the relevant research into complex systems."
102,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10708119-pieter,5,"This book is the third (and hence last) part of Mr Taleb's trilogy, of which the world famous The Black Swan is the second.His thesis is that all in the world is either fragile, robust or antifragile. Volatility harms fragile products/ people/.... (e.g. glass), while robustness is neutral to volatily. But antifragility thrives on risk. Although this may sound contra-intuitive, the author gives loads of examples in many domains. Typically, entrepreneurs are by definition fond of ""opportunities"" (a term preferred to ""problems""). Bureaucrats and managers on the other hand are not only risk adverse, they have no skin in the game. For the latter, there is no incentive to make the right decisions and their bonuses are only focused on the short term.Also in the field of biology, many examples of antifragility are alive. Why use medicins (sleeping pills, antibiotics,...) which are expensive and make the body weak and fragile? Or muscles that are trained in the gym are made stronger by challenging them a little. ""What does not kill you, makes you stronger"", indeed.Mr. Taleb is skeptical when it comes to human hubris. Urbanisation a la Le Corbusier has created alienation and unsafe cities, big states have made the political system unstable and fragile (EU, China, USA) while smaller countries are more robust, even antifragile (Switzerland, Hong Kong,...). A lot of theories in social sciences have been built from trial-and-error and do not come out of the blue.From a philosophical point of view, the author does not agree with Socrates that what one does not know is senseless. He rather believes in the Nietzschean Dionysus, the positive nihilism that favours creative destruction.Politically, I was pleasantly surprised to discover some conservative opinions: ""small is beautiful"", a dislike for the bureaucrats that are risk-adverse, importance of tradition (Lindy-effect).The best book I have read in the last years!"
103,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,5,"Nassim Taleb is cultural Heretic, and I say that with the most respect that I can. It is not easy being a skeptic when not just the masses of so-called 'experts' are against you, but the sheer force of an entire culture. Like the proverbial Emperor's New Clothes, the author calls into question many of the basic assumptions that our modern society today is based on. The ideas of bigger is better, or too-big to fail, or even the responsibility of Government to protect and bail out companies from hardship. He instead advocates that chaos, that stress are not only natural but great for making companies stronger, better and killing off the ones that don't deserve to survive. Capitalism isn't the problem, its when Government gets too involved with it that it becomes so warped and mutated that companies become shielded from natural consequences of bad practices. They are able to run a muck and then have the government come in and clean up behind them.This author hits his thesis so hard he believes Federal governments are unnatural and beyond the scope of human ability to safely utilize. He instead believes in City-States and small businesses, where the damage done from poor leadership are limited and small and not colossal in scale. For example if a city-state fails it would only affect a few thousand people, but if the Federal government fails the effects would be globally catastrophic. His ideas are very intriguing and forces the reader to really think and question almost all basic assumptions especially if they come from the ""Experts"". His tone might come across as arrogant to some, but I find that he needs to adopt such a tone merely because his thesis is so contentious that if he wasn't confident to the point of being cocky so many would simply dismiss him.

Your enjoyment will be amplified by reading his other books beforehand.At this point Taleb has removed all shackling limitations - both financial and psychological - on his ability to live in accordance with his ingenious philosophy.

A book full of new and fresh perspectives. I also liked it especially since it explains so well and confirms and demonstrates certain facts about the world that coincide with my intuitions of how the world works and how common approaches do not usually work in complex systems. Of course, mine are just intuitions from experience, and the author does a great job of explaining very well in words this complexity of systems, hormesis, heuristics, non-linearity, and many other concepts (naive rationalism, the soviet-harvard complext - that was a good one - etc.)that's why I think this should be read by mostly everyone but specially those in the public sector or in decision-making positions. It's good to read things that challenge the placid status quo and ""authorized"" modes of thinking.I also found the challenge and criticism of naive rationalism and the interventionism it justify very entertaining; being a fan of classic liberalism, it's great to see a vindication of autonomy and freedom in system and somebody with a sane mind, claim the need to stop pretending we can control all variables in a complex system (the collapse of the Soviet Union apparently was not enough for many to be convinced that these manipulated systems did not work)"

Fortunately ""Antifragile"" doesn't repeat the same mistakes: it's much more ""readable"", examples are more much more diverse & author approaches the concept of fragility & anti-fragility from far more ""angles"".It's not perfect of course - sometimes it gets too egocentric, sometimes author dives too deeply in his personal beliefs that are not backed with any hard facts, sometimes he flows a bit too far (e.g. by reaching to examples from mythology ...), but it truly succeeds in MAKING READER THINK. It's not that easy as the topic ain't really very tangible, but for me it really worked well.It may be one of the most important books of the decade (at least)."

It's one thing to disagree with the established way of thinking in various fields, but it's quite another thing not only to be utterly contemptuous of many people (Taleb's list is long: economists, bankers, academics, MBAs, doctors, journalists, politicians, bureaucrats, etc.), but also continuously and proudly show off your contempt as a badge of honor. Taleb is cocky in a very unpleasant way. He feels the need to tell us a few times throughout the book about his bodybuilding and how he now looks like a bodyguard and can tell people to fuck off. He tells us that when he goes to a ski resort he feels good knowing that he's richer than those other ""rich farts"" who don't know that he's richer than them! As for the book - Taleb has a few good ideas, but the book is disorganized and long-winded and can get repetitive. "

I heard about this before when someone explained the chaos monkey software that randomly interfered with a complex IT system to improve its fault tolerance. I hoped to learn more about such systems but was badly disappointed.This book is even worse than Fooled by Randomness. Taleb mixes his anecdotes with dropping the names of philosophers and mythical figures. He uses footnotes as if he would write a scientific paper while using every chance he has to explain how stupid academia is and that they haven’t the slightest clue.

124,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"In this book the author presents the idea of antifragileness. The best way to understand this is with the tricotomy he gives: fragile-robust-antifragile. Fragile things or people are adversely affected by large random events that are not anticipated. Robust things or people are those that can weather the storm so to speak. Antifragile things or people actual gain significantly from the same events that break the fragile things and people. An example of antifragileness that the author gives early on is options. To illustrate these he gives the story of Thales, sometimes said to be the first philosopher, who bought up all the olive presses in his part of Asia Minor, then part of the Greek sphere in 600 BC. The cost was small, but he became rich when there was a bumper crop of olives, and people all around came to rent his olive presses, for which he made a handsome profit. The idea is that you can take small risks with big payoffs, hence making you antifragile. Some other aspects of antifragileness are: the use of via negativa, which contains the idea of substracting to things, instead of adding (e.g. in medicine, quit smoking); having variety and varying intensity; hormoses, exposure to a little of something to build up resistance to it (e.g. germs so the immune system can be primed); negative (fragile) and positive (antifragile) convexity; and relying on empiricism instead of theory. As far as his empiricism is concern I have some qualms. While one should always have evidence for ones actions without theory observation is lame. He also seems to require valid experiment for the benefit of things, while he does not think it is necessary for things dealing with the antifragile because it is deemed broadly applicable. This seems like a double standard and being reliant on theory or methodology instead of evidence. His basic ethical approach is admirable. This involves never gaining antifragileness at the expense of somone elses fragileness. He believes that compensation in employment should include negative compensation. Hence, if an executive is on the job when that company falters, that person should be docked compensation, so that he or she can be held responsible for the negative consequences he or she brought about. This makes the person have “skin in the game,” as he would say. Or, don't cause risk for others without causing risk to oneself.Another thing that the author claims is that education does not lead a nation to riches, but it goes the other way; riches leads to education. I can buy this up to a point. After all, the United States gained wealth before it became the center of world class university education. However, on a personal level education leads to better job prospects in the modern world. So, my agreement is mixed on this point.I felt that I connected with the author on a number of points. He counsels diversity, which my activities in life certainly are at the present time. We also seem similar in our reading habits; we both read what is interesting and refuse to finish a book that bores us. Another link is that our ideas spring from our active pursuit of knowledge, such as reading. This is in contrast to others, who propose an idea, and then go looking for confirmation.Overall, I give the book high marks. It was interesting throughout and the author's writing is fluid. As you can guess from some of my comments above, I do not agree with him on all points. But, that's okay. Agreement is not necessarily a criteria for what makes a good book for me. I suggest this book for someone who is interested in a different approach to economics and other social sciences. Although it might be useful as a challenge to a person's entrenched view point on these subjects. I would also recommend the book for those interested in relatively new ideas. He claims that parts of the book are on the technical side, and I do not agree. The only part that is definitely technical is appendix 2. If you find graphs and simple, in words, equations a challenge, you would consider these parts technical as well."

Fragility is what loses from volatility and uncertainty""I have been reading it slowly over last 3 months as there are so many ideas compressed in the book which will make you ponder for a while.Taleb fan forever now!"
126,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,2,"Maaaan this book was frustrating to read.His main point is that some things are fragile - small random things happening to them make them break. Some things are robust - they're resilient to small random things happening to them. But the best things are antifragile - small random things happening to them make them stronger. Good examples are things like your immune system, since being exposed to weak viruses makes it stronger.So far so good. Unfortunately the rest of the book was painful to read, even as there were some good ideas sprinkled within. Here are some reasons why!- The author is, to put it delicately, an egocentric asshole. He calls things ""sissy"" and ""wussy"", because he's apparently a fifth grader. Some choice quotes:A friend who writes books remarked that painters like painting but authors like ""having written."" I suggested he stop writing, for his sake and the sake of his readers. Charming, no? He also goes on about people who just don't understand his ideas (which I'm a little skeptical of...it's possible that they do understand and disagree, which I'm sure the author would consider the same as not ""really"" understanding) and gives the example of a time when he was doing a radio interview and the journalist didn't understand something, so he walked out of the studio.- The book is extremely prone to overstating things for dramatic effect (I assume?), which made me not trust it in a lot of cases. The author says ""I realized school was a plot designed to deprive people of erudition by squeezing their knowledge into a narrow set of authors."" (and then has a long list of authors that he's read) He says depression is a made-up disease! Here, look:But when you medicate a child for an imagined or invented psychiatric disease, say, ADHD or depression, instead of letting him out of the cage, the long-term harm is largely unaccounted for.I mean, I don't disagree that ADHD is probably overdiagnosed and we need to be careful about prescribing medication, especially if it isn't proven to work better than counseling. But I think it's pretty unreasonable and insulting to say depression is ""imagined or invented"". To me, this shows a lack of empathy or a belief that since he doesn't feel depressed, other people are just ""sad"" or faking it or something. Sigh.- He has a giant chip on his shoulder. In retrospect this isn't terribly surprising, because in ""The Black Swan"" he talks about betting for the market to crash and being wrong every day for a long time, until he was right. (it also isn't surprising because he's an egocentric asshole - see above) But he attacks people mercilessly, some of whom seem like they don't deserve it. He keeps calling people ""Fragilista"" (which I never was entirely clear what that meant) and he talks about about ""Soviet-Harvard"" people. He is extremely condescending towards ""book learning"" and claims that most innovations came from tinkering without understanding what was going on, which I find a bit implausible.- The book is extremely hedgehog like (see The Hedgehog and the Fox) - he tries to apply this principle of antifragility across a wide range of topics, some of which he (proudly!) doesn't know much about.He also hates the metric system because the imperial measures are ""intuitive"". For example, a furlong is the distance one can sprint before running out of breath, which is really stretching the definition of intuitive...Anyway, with most books I try to ignore the parts I don't like and get what I can out of it. In this case the whole reading experience was pretty unpleasant, and 90% of the good parts were in ""The Black Swan"" anyway, so I'd recommend reading that instead."
127,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"== Second Read ==The second run-through was just as good as the first. Key keys reinforced: optionality, ""via negativa"" (subtractive > additive), iatrogenics (harm done by the healer, or more generally naive interventions), asymmetric risks (so topical). Understanding a bit more about risk asymmetries is so interesting - it changes the way you think about many questions and problems (be it finance, pollution, medicine, forecasting, estimating, planning, policy-making, etc). I want to re-emphasize what a cool ""idea book"" I think this is. If you haven't read NNT it's probably unlike anything you've read before. It's not an airport business book, and it doesn't fit into a neat genre. The narrative is nonlinear and challenging (in a good way) and to me, very refreshing. Since Taleb is an unapologetic asshole he writes unfiltered and that pisses off some readers (esp. those ""charlatans and wage slaves"" in academia and huge corporations), he takes a jab at virtually every audience likely to be reading the book. I highly recommend this book (above all other NNT works), just ignore the jabs and don't miss a chance to learn something and explore new ideas via a great modern thinker, storyteller and philosopher. == First Read ==My head is spinning - this is such an interesting book. The key concept is in the title, which is not necessarily intuitive without a whole book beating the idea into you. Here's the thought experiment: If someone asked you to name the opposite of fragile - not knowing this book - you'd say robust, strong, or another synonym. But fragile (think: a teacup) implies a terrific failure in the face of volatility (shocks), whereas robust (think: a travel mug) just implies durability, but little change in state. Antifragile is a different idea: something that gets stronger with volatility/shocks (cup metaphor fails here). A real-life example would be forest fire management: forests are fragile due to fire management and the enormous buildup of underbrush, but are antifragile to fires (they get stronger) in their natural, unmanaged state. The same idea applies to the human body; we get stronger with shocks to our system. We are missing this word, antifragile, from our vocabulary. Taleb carries the concept of antifragility through finance, business, medicine, personal ethics, the human body and more. Like The Black Swan, this book is filled with his trademark side stories, aphorisms, examples, and philosophical musings. However, Antifragile is more focused, the side stories are more off track, the aphorisms are better (much of academia = lecturing birds on how to fly), everything is just BETTER. After my first read, I think this is simply a better book than The Black Swan; equally challenging and entertaining, and well put-together. Still, Taleb's style and I'm-definitely-smarter-than-you tone is not for everyone. Whoever borrowed this from the library before me was triggered enough to add about a dozen put-downs and call-outs in the margins, for reasons I don't quite understand. This is definitely a book I want to re-read (and expand my review, and hone the ideas). 5 easy stars. Me: ""I loved it"" Robyn: ""Well you didn't stop talking about it""Lastly here is a much better review than my own: https://unherd.com/2018/12/why-antifr..."
128,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807377-jon,5,"Nassim Taleb has coined a useful word, antifragile—a word that will be permanently lodged in our lexicon. Here's how to explain it. When you send a box of glasses in the mail, you write fragile on the box. When you send something robust, you write nothing. So robust isn't the opposite of fragile, as some might suppose. The opposite of fragile is something that gets stronger when it's broken—something antifragile. It's a useful word for many reasons, but I'm primarily interested in how it applies to politics because it allows us to bypass many typical (boring) partisan arguments about whether regulation is inherently good or bad. Taleb starts with the premise that we will never eliminate volatility (i.e. Black Swan events, or random unforeseen changes). From that premise it follows that we should only pass regulations which will make the economy more antifragile (that is, stronger after the inevitable future volatility).That may sound simple-minded, but the implications are important. For instance, this rule of thumb would eliminate endlessly complicated regulation like the Dodd-Frank Act (which may eventually sprawl to 30,000 pages of rules—creating loopholes ripe for cronyism), but it would leave open the possibility for simple, market-wide regulations like breaking up the banks, or banning credit-default swaps. In other words, an antifragile economy is one that implements only regulations that aren't needlessly complex, don't pick winners and losers, and never add hosts of bureaucrats. By this token an antifragile economy also favors diverse, simple, small and medium-sized governments over the concentrated hive of bureaucrats that Washington has become. (Taleb's uses early America and Switzerland as models to follow, and I agree.)What's more, an antifragile economy is full of entrepreneurs and small/medium-sized businesses instead of megacorporations. We know that entrepreneurs fail frequently, over and over, but each failure makes the future economy stronger as it quickly learns from their/our mistakes (thus, it's antifragile). This is the opposite of ""too big to fail,"" a system where each recurring failure weakens the future economy for years to come, with losses spilling over to unrelated parties (i.e. taxpayers).So here's a word that breaks the pro-regulation/anti-regulation dichotomy: antifragile. It provides us with a useful rule of thumb, a new and better way to frame debates about the intersection of business and government. It's a word we should start using.And the book? The book is sprawling and aggravating(!) and wonderful. "
129,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7140517-sam-rhodes,5,"Having just finished Mr. Taleb's Antifragile, I find myself dazed to the point of saying something as trite and stupid as, ""Thank God. You're here. Where have you been?"" At 63, I would like to say that Antifragile has been, not the read of the day, not the read of the week or the month, nor, not even that more revered and honored award, book of the year. Antifragile, for me, has been the read of a lifetime. It has helped me, in ways that no other book has heretofore been able, understand the way, and the ways, in which I have always thought. Mr. Taleb's words serve as a flashlight (actually more like a beacon) to present, past, and future segments of my journey through this life. Just because a book somehow finds itself assigned to such meaning in one particular life, does not make it a great book, even though it may be that it has done so for many others as well. That would only mean there are many particular others connecting, just as I have, to Mr. Taleb's vast understanding of chaotic thoughts and principles.The true greatness in Mr. Taleb's writing is in its allowance for abstract thought to find life and become visualized on the page. His writing style cradles great truths and facetious little innuendos sprinkled within single sentences. His depiction of Fat Tony's bumbling and stumbling along into a massive collection of wealth through the common sense, Snooki-like, captured and fed only in New Jersey logic is incredible, especially when pulled, in full character, into conversations with Nero and debates with Socrates. His apt, and brutally honest, descriptions and characterizations of the people with whom we mingle everyday, whom we too see in such light but are afraid to talk about it, seem to come from a complete undressing of all things sacred, safe, and secret by Superman like eyes while we look on.It would be easy to drone on and on about Mr' Taleb's acute awareness and observational skills, or his psychologically and historically sound philosophical unpatterns of antifragile thought, but that would be an attempt to grease the skids of antifragility through the use of fragility, so I will stop here, and if nothing else, pretend that the simplicity of you alone with a book is something I want to see."
130,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"The Fragility of Braggadocio: Taleb's Bullied BrainIt takes a certain kind of mind to tolerate a man who thinks so highly of himself, and whose main hobby seems to be to badmouth other intellectuals, businesspeople and politicians. While we're on the subject of failings, let me make clear that the main insights, and theories, of the book are neither as original nor as immediately useful as the author wants you to believe.There. That's two pretty big failings - I can see the point of all those 2- and 1-star reviews.However, you've got to be kidding me if you place so much value on such trivial things. The worth of a conversation or an argument does not lie in its social palatability or political correctness. (Often, in fact, quite the opposite.) I would, in fact, recommend you approach to the author like a jester, a joker, a comedian - and not take the things he says too seriously. Calling some people ""sissies"" and ""a**holes"" is useful if politically incorrect Mediterranean advice, or life lessons, for non-Mediterranean people (the author is Lebanese, and he is recommending an Italian Mafia style solution to problems).And you wouldn't call Steve Jobs's inventions terrible just because he was a terrible human being.Nassim Taleb's insights and conversations can be quite good - well worth the trouble of forgiveness.Finally, to prove my point, here are five (5) great insights that can be gained from Taleb's account:1) The interconnection between all fields of life - from institutions and science to the economy. 2) We need external stressors, optionality, variability and evolutionary growth in order to strive.3) The vital importance of ""via negativa"" as a general life strategy: call BS BS and avoid comfort.4) The importance of the long view of things; a short-view perspective leads to too much fragility.5) The mutual importance of risk-averse conservatism and risk-loving radicalism as coeval paths.Most importantly, the book is fun, daring, obscene, ugly, egotistical, important, crazy, and good. The great lesson is that we don't all need to be Mother Theresa - even terrible people can be right."
131,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"It is not hard to see why Nassim Nicholas Taleb ticks a lot of people off. On top of being heterodox, he's also brash, confrontational, and--by the standards of academic decorum--a barbarian. I love the guy.I'm not sure that I believe everything that he says, but his theories and ideas are fascinating and definitely have merit. What's more--although I wouldn't take personal swipes at people the way he does--I really think he's utterly sincere in his quest for knowledge. That's something that's desperately rare in professional academia, where the incentives make sure we have plenty of provocation and novelty and complexity but tend to leave truth as a neglected concept. And that's the best case scenario.I listened to this book on Audible and took so many notes that my back-of-the-envelope calculation tells me I can reread the entire book in Kindle faster than I can transcribe the notes. (Cursed Google Books won't let me find most of the passages I want to transcribe. Which is obnoxious, since I already own the book in audio and digital format, but not at the right venues. How many times do I have to buy the same book just to be able to search the text? The 21st century still has some things to figure out.)Anyway, I'm going to reread the book and then automatically import the notes into Evernote and then update this review with more info on the actual, you know, content.But the short version? Taleb is an interesting adversary to the complex systems guys at the Santa Fe Institute. They're both tackling real problems (like institutional fragility, which matters a lot when the institutions in question are stock markets and governments) with a genuine 21st century paradigm while almost all of our contemporary policy and political debates are still basically mired in the 19th century. Maybe 20th, on a good day.This stuff matters. I'm just a little worried that we're going to have a lot more avoidable catastrophes (like the Great Recession) before public discourse catches up with the relevant research into complex systems."
132,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10708119-pieter,5,"This book is the third (and hence last) part of Mr Taleb's trilogy, of which the world famous The Black Swan is the second.His thesis is that all in the world is either fragile, robust or antifragile. Volatility harms fragile products/ people/.... (e.g. glass), while robustness is neutral to volatily. But antifragility thrives on risk. Although this may sound contra-intuitive, the author gives loads of examples in many domains. Typically, entrepreneurs are by definition fond of ""opportunities"" (a term preferred to ""problems""). Bureaucrats and managers on the other hand are not only risk adverse, they have no skin in the game. For the latter, there is no incentive to make the right decisions and their bonuses are only focused on the short term.Also in the field of biology, many examples of antifragility are alive. Why use medicins (sleeping pills, antibiotics,...) which are expensive and make the body weak and fragile? Or muscles that are trained in the gym are made stronger by challenging them a little. ""What does not kill you, makes you stronger"", indeed.Mr. Taleb is skeptical when it comes to human hubris. Urbanisation a la Le Corbusier has created alienation and unsafe cities, big states have made the political system unstable and fragile (EU, China, USA) while smaller countries are more robust, even antifragile (Switzerland, Hong Kong,...). A lot of theories in social sciences have been built from trial-and-error and do not come out of the blue.From a philosophical point of view, the author does not agree with Socrates that what one does not know is senseless. He rather believes in the Nietzschean Dionysus, the positive nihilism that favours creative destruction.Politically, I was pleasantly surprised to discover some conservative opinions: ""small is beautiful"", a dislike for the bureaucrats that are risk-adverse, importance of tradition (Lindy-effect).The best book I have read in the last years!"
133,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,5,"Nassim Taleb is cultural Heretic, and I say that with the most respect that I can. It is not easy being a skeptic when not just the masses of so-called 'experts' are against you, but the sheer force of an entire culture. Like the proverbial Emperor's New Clothes, the author calls into question many of the basic assumptions that our modern society today is based on. The ideas of bigger is better, or too-big to fail, or even the responsibility of Government to protect and bail out companies from hardship. He instead advocates that chaos, that stress are not only natural but great for making companies stronger, better and killing off the ones that don't deserve to survive. Capitalism isn't the problem, its when Government gets too involved with it that it becomes so warped and mutated that companies become shielded from natural consequences of bad practices. They are able to run a muck and then have the government come in and clean up behind them.This author hits his thesis so hard he believes Federal governments are unnatural and beyond the scope of human ability to safely utilize. He instead believes in City-States and small businesses, where the damage done from poor leadership are limited and small and not colossal in scale. For example if a city-state fails it would only affect a few thousand people, but if the Federal government fails the effects would be globally catastrophic. His ideas are very intriguing and forces the reader to really think and question almost all basic assumptions especially if they come from the ""Experts"". His tone might come across as arrogant to some, but I find that he needs to adopt such a tone merely because his thesis is so contentious that if he wasn't confident to the point of being cocky so many would simply dismiss him.

A book full of new and fresh perspectives. I also liked it especially since it explains so well and confirms and demonstrates certain facts about the world that coincide with my intuitions of how the world works and how common approaches do not usually work in complex systems. Of course, mine are just intuitions from experience, and the author does a great job of explaining very well in words this complexity of systems, hormesis, heuristics, non-linearity, and many other concepts (naive rationalism, the soviet-harvard complext - that was a good one - etc.)that's why I think this should be read by mostly everyone but specially those in the public sector or in decision-making positions. It's good to read things that challenge the placid status quo and ""authorized"" modes of thinking.I also found the challenge and criticism of naive rationalism and the interventionism it justify very entertaining; being a fan of classic liberalism, it's great to see a vindication of autonomy and freedom in system and somebody with a sane mind, claim the need to stop pretending we can control all variables in a complex system (the collapse of the Soviet Union apparently was not enough for many to be convinced that these manipulated systems did not work)"

Fortunately ""Antifragile"" doesn't repeat the same mistakes: it's much more ""readable"", examples are more much more diverse & author approaches the concept of fragility & anti-fragility from far more ""angles"".It's not perfect of course - sometimes it gets too egocentric, sometimes author dives too deeply in his personal beliefs that are not backed with any hard facts, sometimes he flows a bit too far (e.g. by reaching to examples from mythology ...), but it truly succeeds in MAKING READER THINK.

It's one thing to disagree with the established way of thinking in various fields, but it's quite another thing not only to be utterly contemptuous of many people (Taleb's list is long: economists, bankers, academics, MBAs, doctors, journalists, politicians, bureaucrats, etc.), but also continuously and proudly show off your contempt as a badge of honor. Taleb is cocky in a very unpleasant way. He feels the need to tell us a few times throughout the book about his bodybuilding and how he now looks like a bodyguard and can tell people to fuck off. He tells us that when he goes to a ski resort he feels good knowing that he's richer than those other ""rich farts"" who don't know that he's richer than them!

I heard about this before when someone explained the chaos monkey software that randomly interfered with a complex IT system to improve its fault tolerance. I hoped to learn more about such systems but was badly disappointed.This book is even worse than Fooled by Randomness. Taleb mixes his anecdotes with dropping the names of philosophers and mythical figures. He uses footnotes as if he would write a scientific paper while using every chance he has to explain how stupid academia is and that they haven’t the slightest clue.

153,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32834867-mitch-watson,1,"The idea is great, the book is almost unreadable. Recommend you read a synopsis. "
154,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"In this book the author presents the idea of antifragileness. The best way to understand this is with the tricotomy he gives: fragile-robust-antifragile. Fragile things or people are adversely affected by large random events that are not anticipated. Robust things or people are those that can weather the storm so to speak. Antifragile things or people actual gain significantly from the same events that break the fragile things and people. An example of antifragileness that the author gives early on is options. To illustrate these he gives the story of Thales, sometimes said to be the first philosopher, who bought up all the olive presses in his part of Asia Minor, then part of the Greek sphere in 600 BC. The cost was small, but he became rich when there was a bumper crop of olives, and people all around came to rent his olive presses, for which he made a handsome profit. The idea is that you can take small risks with big payoffs, hence making you antifragile. Some other aspects of antifragileness are: the use of via negativa, which contains the idea of substracting to things, instead of adding (e.g. in medicine, quit smoking); having variety and varying intensity; hormoses, exposure to a little of something to build up resistance to it (e.g. germs so the immune system can be primed); negative (fragile) and positive (antifragile) convexity; and relying on empiricism instead of theory. As far as his empiricism is concern I have some qualms. While one should always have evidence for ones actions without theory observation is lame. He also seems to require valid experiment for the benefit of things, while he does not think it is necessary for things dealing with the antifragile because it is deemed broadly applicable. This seems like a double standard and being reliant on theory or methodology instead of evidence. His basic ethical approach is admirable. This involves never gaining antifragileness at the expense of somone elses fragileness. He believes that compensation in employment should include negative compensation. Hence, if an executive is on the job when that company falters, that person should be docked compensation, so that he or she can be held responsible for the negative consequences he or she brought about. This makes the person have “skin in the game,” as he would say. Or, don't cause risk for others without causing risk to oneself.Another thing that the author claims is that education does not lead a nation to riches, but it goes the other way; riches leads to education. I can buy this up to a point. After all, the United States gained wealth before it became the center of world class university education. However, on a personal level education leads to better job prospects in the modern world. So, my agreement is mixed on this point.I felt that I connected with the author on a number of points. He counsels diversity, which my activities in life certainly are at the present time. We also seem similar in our reading habits; we both read what is interesting and refuse to finish a book that bores us. Another link is that our ideas spring from our active pursuit of knowledge, such as reading. This is in contrast to others, who propose an idea, and then go looking for confirmation.Overall, I give the book high marks. It was interesting throughout and the author's writing is fluid. As you can guess from some of my comments above, I do not agree with him on all points. But, that's okay. Agreement is not necessarily a criteria for what makes a good book for me. I suggest this book for someone who is interested in a different approach to economics and other social sciences. Although it might be useful as a challenge to a person's entrenched view point on these subjects. I would also recommend the book for those interested in relatively new ideas. He claims that parts of the book are on the technical side, and I do not agree. The only part that is definitely technical is appendix 2. If you find graphs and simple, in words, equations a challenge, you would consider these parts technical as well."
155,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92475250-shrikant-patil,5,"Mind-blowing book. Central idea of the book ""Everything gains or loses from volatility. Fragility is what loses from volatility and uncertainty""I have been reading it slowly over last 3 months as there are so many ideas compressed in the book which will make you ponder for a while.Taleb fan forever now!"
156,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,2,"Maaaan this book was frustrating to read.His main point is that some things are fragile - small random things happening to them make them break. Some things are robust - they're resilient to small random things happening to them. But the best things are antifragile - small random things happening to them make them stronger. Good examples are things like your immune system, since being exposed to weak viruses makes it stronger.So far so good. Unfortunately the rest of the book was painful to read, even as there were some good ideas sprinkled within. Here are some reasons why!- The author is, to put it delicately, an egocentric asshole. He calls things ""sissy"" and ""wussy"", because he's apparently a fifth grader. Some choice quotes:A friend who writes books remarked that painters like painting but authors like ""having written."" I suggested he stop writing, for his sake and the sake of his readers. Charming, no? He also goes on about people who just don't understand his ideas (which I'm a little skeptical of...it's possible that they do understand and disagree, which I'm sure the author would consider the same as not ""really"" understanding) and gives the example of a time when he was doing a radio interview and the journalist didn't understand something, so he walked out of the studio.- The book is extremely prone to overstating things for dramatic effect (I assume?), which made me not trust it in a lot of cases. The author says ""I realized school was a plot designed to deprive people of erudition by squeezing their knowledge into a narrow set of authors."" (and then has a long list of authors that he's read) He says depression is a made-up disease! Here, look:But when you medicate a child for an imagined or invented psychiatric disease, say, ADHD or depression, instead of letting him out of the cage, the long-term harm is largely unaccounted for.I mean, I don't disagree that ADHD is probably overdiagnosed and we need to be careful about prescribing medication, especially if it isn't proven to work better than counseling. But I think it's pretty unreasonable and insulting to say depression is ""imagined or invented"". To me, this shows a lack of empathy or a belief that since he doesn't feel depressed, other people are just ""sad"" or faking it or something. Sigh.- He has a giant chip on his shoulder. In retrospect this isn't terribly surprising, because in ""The Black Swan"" he talks about betting for the market to crash and being wrong every day for a long time, until he was right. (it also isn't surprising because he's an egocentric asshole - see above) But he attacks people mercilessly, some of whom seem like they don't deserve it. He keeps calling people ""Fragilista"" (which I never was entirely clear what that meant) and he talks about about ""Soviet-Harvard"" people. He is extremely condescending towards ""book learning"" and claims that most innovations came from tinkering without understanding what was going on, which I find a bit implausible.- The book is extremely hedgehog like (see The Hedgehog and the Fox) - he tries to apply this principle of antifragility across a wide range of topics, some of which he (proudly!) doesn't know much about.He also hates the metric system because the imperial measures are ""intuitive"". For example, a furlong is the distance one can sprint before running out of breath, which is really stretching the definition of intuitive...Anyway, with most books I try to ignore the parts I don't like and get what I can out of it. In this case the whole reading experience was pretty unpleasant, and 90% of the good parts were in ""The Black Swan"" anyway, so I'd recommend reading that instead."
157,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"== Second Read ==The second run-through was just as good as the first. Key keys reinforced: optionality, ""via negativa"" (subtractive > additive), iatrogenics (harm done by the healer, or more generally naive interventions), asymmetric risks (so topical). Understanding a bit more about risk asymmetries is so interesting - it changes the way you think about many questions and problems (be it finance, pollution, medicine, forecasting, estimating, planning, policy-making, etc). I want to re-emphasize what a cool ""idea book"" I think this is. If you haven't read NNT it's probably unlike anything you've read before. It's not an airport business book, and it doesn't fit into a neat genre. The narrative is nonlinear and challenging (in a good way) and to me, very refreshing. Since Taleb is an unapologetic asshole he writes unfiltered and that pisses off some readers (esp. those ""charlatans and wage slaves"" in academia and huge corporations), he takes a jab at virtually every audience likely to be reading the book. I highly recommend this book (above all other NNT works), just ignore the jabs and don't miss a chance to learn something and explore new ideas via a great modern thinker, storyteller and philosopher. == First Read ==My head is spinning - this is such an interesting book. The key concept is in the title, which is not necessarily intuitive without a whole book beating the idea into you. Here's the thought experiment: If someone asked you to name the opposite of fragile - not knowing this book - you'd say robust, strong, or another synonym. But fragile (think: a teacup) implies a terrific failure in the face of volatility (shocks), whereas robust (think: a travel mug) just implies durability, but little change in state. Antifragile is a different idea: something that gets stronger with volatility/shocks (cup metaphor fails here). A real-life example would be forest fire management: forests are fragile due to fire management and the enormous buildup of underbrush, but are antifragile to fires (they get stronger) in their natural, unmanaged state. The same idea applies to the human body; we get stronger with shocks to our system. We are missing this word, antifragile, from our vocabulary. Taleb carries the concept of antifragility through finance, business, medicine, personal ethics, the human body and more. Like The Black Swan, this book is filled with his trademark side stories, aphorisms, examples, and philosophical musings. However, Antifragile is more focused, the side stories are more off track, the aphorisms are better (much of academia = lecturing birds on how to fly), everything is just BETTER. After my first read, I think this is simply a better book than The Black Swan; equally challenging and entertaining, and well put-together. Still, Taleb's style and I'm-definitely-smarter-than-you tone is not for everyone. Whoever borrowed this from the library before me was triggered enough to add about a dozen put-downs and call-outs in the margins, for reasons I don't quite understand. This is definitely a book I want to re-read (and expand my review, and hone the ideas). 5 easy stars. Me: ""I loved it"" Robyn: ""Well you didn't stop talking about it""Lastly here is a much better review than my own: https://unherd.com/2018/12/why-antifr..."
158,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807377-jon,5,"Nassim Taleb has coined a useful word, antifragile—a word that will be permanently lodged in our lexicon. Here's how to explain it. When you send a box of glasses in the mail, you write fragile on the box. When you send something robust, you write nothing. So robust isn't the opposite of fragile, as some might suppose. The opposite of fragile is something that gets stronger when it's broken—something antifragile. It's a useful word for many reasons, but I'm primarily interested in how it applies to politics because it allows us to bypass many typical (boring) partisan arguments about whether regulation is inherently good or bad. Taleb starts with the premise that we will never eliminate volatility (i.e. Black Swan events, or random unforeseen changes). From that premise it follows that we should only pass regulations which will make the economy more antifragile (that is, stronger after the inevitable future volatility).That may sound simple-minded, but the implications are important. For instance, this rule of thumb would eliminate endlessly complicated regulation like the Dodd-Frank Act (which may eventually sprawl to 30,000 pages of rules—creating loopholes ripe for cronyism), but it would leave open the possibility for simple, market-wide regulations like breaking up the banks, or banning credit-default swaps. In other words, an antifragile economy is one that implements only regulations that aren't needlessly complex, don't pick winners and losers, and never add hosts of bureaucrats. By this token an antifragile economy also favors diverse, simple, small and medium-sized governments over the concentrated hive of bureaucrats that Washington has become. (Taleb's uses early America and Switzerland as models to follow, and I agree.)What's more, an antifragile economy is full of entrepreneurs and small/medium-sized businesses instead of megacorporations. We know that entrepreneurs fail frequently, over and over, but each failure makes the future economy stronger as it quickly learns from their/our mistakes (thus, it's antifragile). This is the opposite of ""too big to fail,"" a system where each recurring failure weakens the future economy for years to come, with losses spilling over to unrelated parties (i.e. taxpayers).So here's a word that breaks the pro-regulation/anti-regulation dichotomy: antifragile. It provides us with a useful rule of thumb, a new and better way to frame debates about the intersection of business and government. It's a word we should start using.And the book? The book is sprawling and aggravating(!) and wonderful. "
159,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7140517-sam-rhodes,5,"Having just finished Mr. Taleb's Antifragile, I find myself dazed to the point of saying something as trite and stupid as, ""Thank God. You're here. Where have you been?"" At 63, I would like to say that Antifragile has been, not the read of the day, not the read of the week or the month, nor, not even that more revered and honored award, book of the year. Antifragile, for me, has been the read of a lifetime. It has helped me, in ways that no other book has heretofore been able, understand the way, and the ways, in which I have always thought. Mr. Taleb's words serve as a flashlight (actually more like a beacon) to present, past, and future segments of my journey through this life. Just because a book somehow finds itself assigned to such meaning in one particular life, does not make it a great book, even though it may be that it has done so for many others as well. That would only mean there are many particular others connecting, just as I have, to Mr. Taleb's vast understanding of chaotic thoughts and principles.The true greatness in Mr. Taleb's writing is in its allowance for abstract thought to find life and become visualized on the page. His writing style cradles great truths and facetious little innuendos sprinkled within single sentences. His depiction of Fat Tony's bumbling and stumbling along into a massive collection of wealth through the common sense, Snooki-like, captured and fed only in New Jersey logic is incredible, especially when pulled, in full character, into conversations with Nero and debates with Socrates. His apt, and brutally honest, descriptions and characterizations of the people with whom we mingle everyday, whom we too see in such light but are afraid to talk about it, seem to come from a complete undressing of all things sacred, safe, and secret by Superman like eyes while we look on.It would be easy to drone on and on about Mr' Taleb's acute awareness and observational skills, or his psychologically and historically sound philosophical unpatterns of antifragile thought, but that would be an attempt to grease the skids of antifragility through the use of fragility, so I will stop here, and if nothing else, pretend that the simplicity of you alone with a book is something I want to see."
160,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"The Fragility of Braggadocio: Taleb's Bullied BrainIt takes a certain kind of mind to tolerate a man who thinks so highly of himself, and whose main hobby seems to be to badmouth other intellectuals, businesspeople and politicians. While we're on the subject of failings, let me make clear that the main insights, and theories, of the book are neither as original nor as immediately useful as the author wants you to believe.There. That's two pretty big failings - I can see the point of all those 2- and 1-star reviews.However, you've got to be kidding me if you place so much value on such trivial things. The worth of a conversation or an argument does not lie in its social palatability or political correctness. (Often, in fact, quite the opposite.) I would, in fact, recommend you approach to the author like a jester, a joker, a comedian - and not take the things he says too seriously. Calling some people ""sissies"" and ""a**holes"" is useful if politically incorrect Mediterranean advice, or life lessons, for non-Mediterranean people (the author is Lebanese, and he is recommending an Italian Mafia style solution to problems).And you wouldn't call Steve Jobs's inventions terrible just because he was a terrible human being.Nassim Taleb's insights and conversations can be quite good - well worth the trouble of forgiveness.Finally, to prove my point, here are five (5) great insights that can be gained from Taleb's account:1) The interconnection between all fields of life - from institutions and science to the economy. 2) We need external stressors, optionality, variability and evolutionary growth in order to strive.3) The vital importance of ""via negativa"" as a general life strategy: call BS BS and avoid comfort.4) The importance of the long view of things; a short-view perspective leads to too much fragility.5) The mutual importance of risk-averse conservatism and risk-loving radicalism as coeval paths.Most importantly, the book is fun, daring, obscene, ugly, egotistical, important, crazy, and good. The great lesson is that we don't all need to be Mother Theresa - even terrible people can be right."
161,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"It is not hard to see why Nassim Nicholas Taleb ticks a lot of people off. On top of being heterodox, he's also brash, confrontational, and--by the standards of academic decorum--a barbarian. I love the guy.I'm not sure that I believe everything that he says, but his theories and ideas are fascinating and definitely have merit. What's more--although I wouldn't take personal swipes at people the way he does--I really think he's utterly sincere in his quest for knowledge. That's something that's desperately rare in professional academia, where the incentives make sure we have plenty of provocation and novelty and complexity but tend to leave truth as a neglected concept. And that's the best case scenario.I listened to this book on Audible and took so many notes that my back-of-the-envelope calculation tells me I can reread the entire book in Kindle faster than I can transcribe the notes. (Cursed Google Books won't let me find most of the passages I want to transcribe. Which is obnoxious, since I already own the book in audio and digital format, but not at the right venues. How many times do I have to buy the same book just to be able to search the text? The 21st century still has some things to figure out.)Anyway, I'm going to reread the book and then automatically import the notes into Evernote and then update this review with more info on the actual, you know, content.But the short version? Taleb is an interesting adversary to the complex systems guys at the Santa Fe Institute. They're both tackling real problems (like institutional fragility, which matters a lot when the institutions in question are stock markets and governments) with a genuine 21st century paradigm while almost all of our contemporary policy and political debates are still basically mired in the 19th century. Maybe 20th, on a good day.This stuff matters. I'm just a little worried that we're going to have a lot more avoidable catastrophes (like the Great Recession) before public discourse catches up with the relevant research into complex systems."
162,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10708119-pieter,5,"This book is the third (and hence last) part of Mr Taleb's trilogy, of which the world famous The Black Swan is the second.His thesis is that all in the world is either fragile, robust or antifragile. Volatility harms fragile products/ people/.... (e.g. glass), while robustness is neutral to volatily. But antifragility thrives on risk. Although this may sound contra-intuitive, the author gives loads of examples in many domains. Typically, entrepreneurs are by definition fond of ""opportunities"" (a term preferred to ""problems""). Bureaucrats and managers on the other hand are not only risk adverse, they have no skin in the game. For the latter, there is no incentive to make the right decisions and their bonuses are only focused on the short term.Also in the field of biology, many examples of antifragility are alive. Why use medicins (sleeping pills, antibiotics,...) which are expensive and make the body weak and fragile? Or muscles that are trained in the gym are made stronger by challenging them a little. ""What does not kill you, makes you stronger"", indeed.Mr. Taleb is skeptical when it comes to human hubris. Urbanisation a la Le Corbusier has created alienation and unsafe cities, big states have made the political system unstable and fragile (EU, China, USA) while smaller countries are more robust, even antifragile (Switzerland, Hong Kong,...). A lot of theories in social sciences have been built from trial-and-error and do not come out of the blue.From a philosophical point of view, the author does not agree with Socrates that what one does not know is senseless. He rather believes in the Nietzschean Dionysus, the positive nihilism that favours creative destruction.Politically, I was pleasantly surprised to discover some conservative opinions: ""small is beautiful"", a dislike for the bureaucrats that are risk-adverse, importance of tradition (Lindy-effect).The best book I have read in the last years!"
163,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,5,"Nassim Taleb is cultural Heretic, and I say that with the most respect that I can. It is not easy being a skeptic when not just the masses of so-called 'experts' are against you, but the sheer force of an entire culture. Like the proverbial Emperor's New Clothes, the author calls into question many of the basic assumptions that our modern society today is based on. The ideas of bigger is better, or too-big to fail, or even the responsibility of Government to protect and bail out companies from hardship. He instead advocates that chaos, that stress are not only natural but great for making companies stronger, better and killing off the ones that don't deserve to survive. Capitalism isn't the problem, its when Government gets too involved with it that it becomes so warped and mutated that companies become shielded from natural consequences of bad practices. They are able to run a muck and then have the government come in and clean up behind them.This author hits his thesis so hard he believes Federal governments are unnatural and beyond the scope of human ability to safely utilize. He instead believes in City-States and small businesses, where the damage done from poor leadership are limited and small and not colossal in scale. For example if a city-state fails it would only affect a few thousand people, but if the Federal government fails the effects would be globally catastrophic. His ideas are very intriguing and forces the reader to really think and question almost all basic assumptions especially if they come from the ""Experts"". His tone might come across as arrogant to some, but I find that he needs to adopt such a tone merely because his thesis is so contentious that if he wasn't confident to the point of being cocky so many would simply dismiss him.

A book full of new and fresh perspectives. I also liked it especially since it explains so well and confirms and demonstrates certain facts about the world that coincide with my intuitions of how the world works and how common approaches do not usually work in complex systems. Of course, mine are just intuitions from experience, and the author does a great job of explaining very well in words this complexity of systems, hormesis, heuristics, non-linearity, and many other concepts (naive rationalism, the soviet-harvard complext - that was a good one - etc.)that's why I think this should be read by mostly everyone but specially those in the public sector or in decision-making positions. It's good to read things that challenge the placid status quo and ""authorized"" modes of thinking.I also found the challenge and criticism of naive rationalism and the interventionism it justify very entertaining; being a fan of classic liberalism, it's great to see a vindication of autonomy and freedom in system and somebody with a sane mind, claim the need to stop pretending we can control all variables in a complex system (the collapse of the Soviet Union apparently was not enough for many to be convinced that these manipulated systems did not work)"

Fortunately ""Antifragile"" doesn't repeat the same mistakes: it's much more ""readable"", examples are more much more diverse & author approaches the concept of fragility & anti-fragility from far more ""angles"".It's not perfect of course - sometimes it gets too egocentric, sometimes author dives too deeply in his personal beliefs that are not backed with any hard facts, sometimes he flows a bit too far (e.g. by reaching to examples from mythology ...), but it truly succeeds in MAKING READER THINK.

It's one thing to disagree with the established way of thinking in various fields, but it's quite another thing not only to be utterly contemptuous of many people (Taleb's list is long: economists, bankers, academics, MBAs, doctors, journalists, politicians, bureaucrats, etc.), but also continuously and proudly show off your contempt as a badge of honor. Taleb is cocky in a very unpleasant way. He feels the need to tell us a few times throughout the book about his bodybuilding and how he now looks like a bodyguard and can tell people to fuck off. He tells us that when he goes to a ski resort he feels good knowing that he's richer than those other ""rich farts"" who don't know that he's richer than them!

Taleb mixes his anecdotes with dropping the names of philosophers and mythical figures. He uses footnotes as if he would write a scientific paper while using every chance he has to explain how stupid academia is and that they haven’t the slightest clue. Except when there is a study that proves one of his many points.My time is to important therefore I dropped this book as Taleb started to analyse TV series after explaining thoroughly the single steps one of his bodyguards does in the gym."

Time and time again, he uses anecdotes, often personal in nature, to convey these ideas to the layman.Despite the occasional use of certain technical terms, this book is a pretty easy read for those who don't have a background in economics, finance, statistics or political science.

183,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32834867-mitch-watson,1,"The idea is great, the book is almost unreadable. Recommend you read a synopsis. "
184,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"In this book the author presents the idea of antifragileness. The best way to understand this is with the tricotomy he gives: fragile-robust-antifragile. Fragile things or people are adversely affected by large random events that are not anticipated. Robust things or people are those that can weather the storm so to speak. Antifragile things or people actual gain significantly from the same events that break the fragile things and people. An example of antifragileness that the author gives early on is options. To illustrate these he gives the story of Thales, sometimes said to be the first philosopher, who bought up all the olive presses in his part of Asia Minor, then part of the Greek sphere in 600 BC. The cost was small, but he became rich when there was a bumper crop of olives, and people all around came to rent his olive presses, for which he made a handsome profit. The idea is that you can take small risks with big payoffs, hence making you antifragile. Some other aspects of antifragileness are: the use of via negativa, which contains the idea of substracting to things, instead of adding (e.g. in medicine, quit smoking); having variety and varying intensity; hormoses, exposure to a little of something to build up resistance to it (e.g. germs so the immune system can be primed); negative (fragile) and positive (antifragile) convexity; and relying on empiricism instead of theory. As far as his empiricism is concern I have some qualms. While one should always have evidence for ones actions without theory observation is lame. He also seems to require valid experiment for the benefit of things, while he does not think it is necessary for things dealing with the antifragile because it is deemed broadly applicable. This seems like a double standard and being reliant on theory or methodology instead of evidence. His basic ethical approach is admirable. This involves never gaining antifragileness at the expense of somone elses fragileness. He believes that compensation in employment should include negative compensation. Hence, if an executive is on the job when that company falters, that person should be docked compensation, so that he or she can be held responsible for the negative consequences he or she brought about. This makes the person have “skin in the game,” as he would say. Or, don't cause risk for others without causing risk to oneself.Another thing that the author claims is that education does not lead a nation to riches, but it goes the other way; riches leads to education. I can buy this up to a point. After all, the United States gained wealth before it became the center of world class university education. However, on a personal level education leads to better job prospects in the modern world. So, my agreement is mixed on this point.I felt that I connected with the author on a number of points. He counsels diversity, which my activities in life certainly are at the present time. We also seem similar in our reading habits; we both read what is interesting and refuse to finish a book that bores us. Another link is that our ideas spring from our active pursuit of knowledge, such as reading. This is in contrast to others, who propose an idea, and then go looking for confirmation.Overall, I give the book high marks. It was interesting throughout and the author's writing is fluid. As you can guess from some of my comments above, I do not agree with him on all points. But, that's okay. Agreement is not necessarily a criteria for what makes a good book for me. I suggest this book for someone who is interested in a different approach to economics and other social sciences. Although it might be useful as a challenge to a person's entrenched view point on these subjects. I would also recommend the book for those interested in relatively new ideas. He claims that parts of the book are on the technical side, and I do not agree. The only part that is definitely technical is appendix 2. If you find graphs and simple, in words, equations a challenge, you would consider these parts technical as well."
185,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92475250-shrikant-patil,5,"Mind-blowing book. Central idea of the book ""Everything gains or loses from volatility. Fragility is what loses from volatility and uncertainty""I have been reading it slowly over last 3 months as there are so many ideas compressed in the book which will make you ponder for a while.Taleb fan forever now!"
186,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,2,"Maaaan this book was frustrating to read.His main point is that some things are fragile - small random things happening to them make them break. Some things are robust - they're resilient to small random things happening to them. But the best things are antifragile - small random things happening to them make them stronger. Good examples are things like your immune system, since being exposed to weak viruses makes it stronger.So far so good. Unfortunately the rest of the book was painful to read, even as there were some good ideas sprinkled within. Here are some reasons why!- The author is, to put it delicately, an egocentric asshole. He calls things ""sissy"" and ""wussy"", because he's apparently a fifth grader. Some choice quotes:A friend who writes books remarked that painters like painting but authors like ""having written."" I suggested he stop writing, for his sake and the sake of his readers. Charming, no? He also goes on about people who just don't understand his ideas (which I'm a little skeptical of...it's possible that they do understand and disagree, which I'm sure the author would consider the same as not ""really"" understanding) and gives the example of a time when he was doing a radio interview and the journalist didn't understand something, so he walked out of the studio.- The book is extremely prone to overstating things for dramatic effect (I assume?), which made me not trust it in a lot of cases. The author says ""I realized school was a plot designed to deprive people of erudition by squeezing their knowledge into a narrow set of authors."" (and then has a long list of authors that he's read) He says depression is a made-up disease! Here, look:But when you medicate a child for an imagined or invented psychiatric disease, say, ADHD or depression, instead of letting him out of the cage, the long-term harm is largely unaccounted for.I mean, I don't disagree that ADHD is probably overdiagnosed and we need to be careful about prescribing medication, especially if it isn't proven to work better than counseling. But I think it's pretty unreasonable and insulting to say depression is ""imagined or invented"". To me, this shows a lack of empathy or a belief that since he doesn't feel depressed, other people are just ""sad"" or faking it or something. Sigh.- He has a giant chip on his shoulder. In retrospect this isn't terribly surprising, because in ""The Black Swan"" he talks about betting for the market to crash and being wrong every day for a long time, until he was right. (it also isn't surprising because he's an egocentric asshole - see above) But he attacks people mercilessly, some of whom seem like they don't deserve it. He keeps calling people ""Fragilista"" (which I never was entirely clear what that meant) and he talks about about ""Soviet-Harvard"" people. He is extremely condescending towards ""book learning"" and claims that most innovations came from tinkering without understanding what was going on, which I find a bit implausible.- The book is extremely hedgehog like (see The Hedgehog and the Fox) - he tries to apply this principle of antifragility across a wide range of topics, some of which he (proudly!) doesn't know much about.He also hates the metric system because the imperial measures are ""intuitive"". For example, a furlong is the distance one can sprint before running out of breath, which is really stretching the definition of intuitive...Anyway, with most books I try to ignore the parts I don't like and get what I can out of it. In this case the whole reading experience was pretty unpleasant, and 90% of the good parts were in ""The Black Swan"" anyway, so I'd recommend reading that instead."
187,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"== Second Read ==The second run-through was just as good as the first. Key keys reinforced: optionality, ""via negativa"" (subtractive > additive), iatrogenics (harm done by the healer, or more generally naive interventions), asymmetric risks (so topical). Understanding a bit more about risk asymmetries is so interesting - it changes the way you think about many questions and problems (be it finance, pollution, medicine, forecasting, estimating, planning, policy-making, etc). I want to re-emphasize what a cool ""idea book"" I think this is. If you haven't read NNT it's probably unlike anything you've read before. It's not an airport business book, and it doesn't fit into a neat genre. The narrative is nonlinear and challenging (in a good way) and to me, very refreshing. Since Taleb is an unapologetic asshole he writes unfiltered and that pisses off some readers (esp. those ""charlatans and wage slaves"" in academia and huge corporations), he takes a jab at virtually every audience likely to be reading the book. I highly recommend this book (above all other NNT works), just ignore the jabs and don't miss a chance to learn something and explore new ideas via a great modern thinker, storyteller and philosopher. == First Read ==My head is spinning - this is such an interesting book. The key concept is in the title, which is not necessarily intuitive without a whole book beating the idea into you. Here's the thought experiment: If someone asked you to name the opposite of fragile - not knowing this book - you'd say robust, strong, or another synonym. But fragile (think: a teacup) implies a terrific failure in the face of volatility (shocks), whereas robust (think: a travel mug) just implies durability, but little change in state. Antifragile is a different idea: something that gets stronger with volatility/shocks (cup metaphor fails here). A real-life example would be forest fire management: forests are fragile due to fire management and the enormous buildup of underbrush, but are antifragile to fires (they get stronger) in their natural, unmanaged state. The same idea applies to the human body; we get stronger with shocks to our system. We are missing this word, antifragile, from our vocabulary. Taleb carries the concept of antifragility through finance, business, medicine, personal ethics, the human body and more. Like The Black Swan, this book is filled with his trademark side stories, aphorisms, examples, and philosophical musings. However, Antifragile is more focused, the side stories are more off track, the aphorisms are better (much of academia = lecturing birds on how to fly), everything is just BETTER. After my first read, I think this is simply a better book than The Black Swan; equally challenging and entertaining, and well put-together. Still, Taleb's style and I'm-definitely-smarter-than-you tone is not for everyone. Whoever borrowed this from the library before me was triggered enough to add about a dozen put-downs and call-outs in the margins, for reasons I don't quite understand. This is definitely a book I want to re-read (and expand my review, and hone the ideas). 5 easy stars. Me: ""I loved it"" Robyn: ""Well you didn't stop talking about it""Lastly here is a much better review than my own: https://unherd.com/2018/12/why-antifr..."
188,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807377-jon,5,"Nassim Taleb has coined a useful word, antifragile—a word that will be permanently lodged in our lexicon. Here's how to explain it. When you send a box of glasses in the mail, you write fragile on the box. When you send something robust, you write nothing. So robust isn't the opposite of fragile, as some might suppose. The opposite of fragile is something that gets stronger when it's broken—something antifragile. It's a useful word for many reasons, but I'm primarily interested in how it applies to politics because it allows us to bypass many typical (boring) partisan arguments about whether regulation is inherently good or bad. Taleb starts with the premise that we will never eliminate volatility (i.e. Black Swan events, or random unforeseen changes). From that premise it follows that we should only pass regulations which will make the economy more antifragile (that is, stronger after the inevitable future volatility).That may sound simple-minded, but the implications are important. For instance, this rule of thumb would eliminate endlessly complicated regulation like the Dodd-Frank Act (which may eventually sprawl to 30,000 pages of rules—creating loopholes ripe for cronyism), but it would leave open the possibility for simple, market-wide regulations like breaking up the banks, or banning credit-default swaps. In other words, an antifragile economy is one that implements only regulations that aren't needlessly complex, don't pick winners and losers, and never add hosts of bureaucrats. By this token an antifragile economy also favors diverse, simple, small and medium-sized governments over the concentrated hive of bureaucrats that Washington has become. (Taleb's uses early America and Switzerland as models to follow, and I agree.)What's more, an antifragile economy is full of entrepreneurs and small/medium-sized businesses instead of megacorporations. We know that entrepreneurs fail frequently, over and over, but each failure makes the future economy stronger as it quickly learns from their/our mistakes (thus, it's antifragile). This is the opposite of ""too big to fail,"" a system where each recurring failure weakens the future economy for years to come, with losses spilling over to unrelated parties (i.e. taxpayers).So here's a word that breaks the pro-regulation/anti-regulation dichotomy: antifragile. It provides us with a useful rule of thumb, a new and better way to frame debates about the intersection of business and government. It's a word we should start using.And the book? The book is sprawling and aggravating(!) and wonderful. "
189,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7140517-sam-rhodes,5,"Having just finished Mr. Taleb's Antifragile, I find myself dazed to the point of saying something as trite and stupid as, ""Thank God. You're here. Where have you been?"" At 63, I would like to say that Antifragile has been, not the read of the day, not the read of the week or the month, nor, not even that more revered and honored award, book of the year. Antifragile, for me, has been the read of a lifetime. It has helped me, in ways that no other book has heretofore been able, understand the way, and the ways, in which I have always thought. Mr. Taleb's words serve as a flashlight (actually more like a beacon) to present, past, and future segments of my journey through this life. Just because a book somehow finds itself assigned to such meaning in one particular life, does not make it a great book, even though it may be that it has done so for many others as well. That would only mean there are many particular others connecting, just as I have, to Mr. Taleb's vast understanding of chaotic thoughts and principles.The true greatness in Mr. Taleb's writing is in its allowance for abstract thought to find life and become visualized on the page. His writing style cradles great truths and facetious little innuendos sprinkled within single sentences. His depiction of Fat Tony's bumbling and stumbling along into a massive collection of wealth through the common sense, Snooki-like, captured and fed only in New Jersey logic is incredible, especially when pulled, in full character, into conversations with Nero and debates with Socrates. His apt, and brutally honest, descriptions and characterizations of the people with whom we mingle everyday, whom we too see in such light but are afraid to talk about it, seem to come from a complete undressing of all things sacred, safe, and secret by Superman like eyes while we look on.It would be easy to drone on and on about Mr' Taleb's acute awareness and observational skills, or his psychologically and historically sound philosophical unpatterns of antifragile thought, but that would be an attempt to grease the skids of antifragility through the use of fragility, so I will stop here, and if nothing else, pretend that the simplicity of you alone with a book is something I want to see."

While we're on the subject of failings, let me make clear that the main insights, and theories, of the book are neither as original nor as immediately useful as the author wants you to believe.There. That's two pretty big failings - I can see the point of all those 2- and 1-star reviews.However, you've got to be kidding me if you place so much value on such trivial things. The worth of a conversation or an argument does not lie in its social palatability or political correctness. (Often, in fact, quite the opposite.) I would, in fact, recommend you approach to the author like a jester, a joker, a comedian - and not take the things he says too seriously. Calling some people ""sissies"" and ""a**holes"" is useful if politically incorrect Mediterranean advice, or life lessons, for non-Mediterranean people (the author is Lebanese, and he is recommending an Italian Mafia style solution to problems).And you wouldn't call Steve Jobs's inventions terrible just because he was a terrible human being.Nassim Taleb's insights and conversations can be quite good - well worth the trouble of forgiveness.Finally, to prove my point, here are five (5) great insights that can be gained from Taleb's account:1) The interconnection between all fields of life - from institutions and science to the economy. 2) We need external stressors, optionality, variability and evolutionary growth in order to strive.3) The vital importance of ""via negativa"" as a general life strategy: call BS BS and avoid comfort.4) The importance of the long view of things; a short-view perspective leads to too much fragility.5) The mutual importance of risk-averse conservatism and risk-loving radicalism as coeval paths.Most importantly, the book is fun, daring, obscene, ugly, egotistical, important, crazy, and good. The great lesson is that we don't all need to be Mother Theresa - even terrible people can be right."
191,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"It is not hard to see why Nassim Nicholas Taleb ticks a lot of people off. On top of being heterodox, he's also brash, confrontational, and--by the standards of academic decorum--a barbarian. I love the guy.I'm not sure that I believe everything that he says, but his theories and ideas are fascinating and definitely have merit. What's more--although I wouldn't take personal swipes at people the way he does--I really think he's utterly sincere in his quest for knowledge. That's something that's desperately rare in professional academia, where the incentives make sure we have plenty of provocation and novelty and complexity but tend to leave truth as a neglected concept. And that's the best case scenario.I listened to this book on Audible and took so many notes that my back-of-the-envelope calculation tells me I can reread the entire book in Kindle faster than I can transcribe the notes. (Cursed Google Books won't let me find most of the passages I want to transcribe. Which is obnoxious, since I already own the book in audio and digital format, but not at the right venues. How many times do I have to buy the same book just to be able to search the text? The 21st century still has some things to figure out.)Anyway, I'm going to reread the book and then automatically import the notes into Evernote and then update this review with more info on the actual, you know, content.But the short version? Taleb is an interesting adversary to the complex systems guys at the Santa Fe Institute. They're both tackling real problems (like institutional fragility, which matters a lot when the institutions in question are stock markets and governments) with a genuine 21st century paradigm while almost all of our contemporary policy and political debates are still basically mired in the 19th century. Maybe 20th, on a good day.This stuff matters. I'm just a little worried that we're going to have a lot more avoidable catastrophes (like the Great Recession) before public discourse catches up with the relevant research into complex systems."
192,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10708119-pieter,5,"This book is the third (and hence last) part of Mr Taleb's trilogy, of which the world famous The Black Swan is the second.His thesis is that all in the world is either fragile, robust or antifragile. Volatility harms fragile products/ people/.... (e.g. glass), while robustness is neutral to volatily. But antifragility thrives on risk. Although this may sound contra-intuitive, the author gives loads of examples in many domains. Typically, entrepreneurs are by definition fond of ""opportunities"" (a term preferred to ""problems""). Bureaucrats and managers on the other hand are not only risk adverse, they have no skin in the game. For the latter, there is no incentive to make the right decisions and their bonuses are only focused on the short term.Also in the field of biology, many examples of antifragility are alive. Why use medicins (sleeping pills, antibiotics,...) which are expensive and make the body weak and fragile? Or muscles that are trained in the gym are made stronger by challenging them a little. ""What does not kill you, makes you stronger"", indeed.Mr. Taleb is skeptical when it comes to human hubris. Urbanisation a la Le Corbusier has created alienation and unsafe cities, big states have made the political system unstable and fragile (EU, China, USA) while smaller countries are more robust, even antifragile (Switzerland, Hong Kong,...). A lot of theories in social sciences have been built from trial-and-error and do not come out of the blue.From a philosophical point of view, the author does not agree with Socrates that what one does not know is senseless. He rather believes in the Nietzschean Dionysus, the positive nihilism that favours creative destruction.Politically, I was pleasantly surprised to discover some conservative opinions: ""small is beautiful"", a dislike for the bureaucrats that are risk-adverse, importance of tradition (Lindy-effect).The best book I have read in the last years!"
193,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,5,"Nassim Taleb is cultural Heretic, and I say that with the most respect that I can. It is not easy being a skeptic when not just the masses of so-called 'experts' are against you, but the sheer force of an entire culture. Like the proverbial Emperor's New Clothes, the author calls into question many of the basic assumptions that our modern society today is based on. The ideas of bigger is better, or too-big to fail, or even the responsibility of Government to protect and bail out companies from hardship. He instead advocates that chaos, that stress are not only natural but great for making companies stronger, better and killing off the ones that don't deserve to survive. Capitalism isn't the problem, its when Government gets too involved with it that it becomes so warped and mutated that companies become shielded from natural consequences of bad practices. They are able to run a muck and then have the government come in and clean up behind them.This author hits his thesis so hard he believes Federal governments are unnatural and beyond the scope of human ability to safely utilize. He instead believes in City-States and small businesses, where the damage done from poor leadership are limited and small and not colossal in scale. For example if a city-state fails it would only affect a few thousand people, but if the Federal government fails the effects would be globally catastrophic. His ideas are very intriguing and forces the reader to really think and question almost all basic assumptions especially if they come from the ""Experts"". His tone might come across as arrogant to some, but I find that he needs to adopt such a tone merely because his thesis is so contentious that if he wasn't confident to the point of being cocky so many would simply dismiss him.

His joy for life is evident on every page. How nice of him to share his secret formula with us."

A book full of new and fresh perspectives. I also liked it especially since it explains so well and confirms and demonstrates certain facts about the world that coincide with my intuitions of how the world works and how common approaches do not usually work in complex systems. Of course, mine are just intuitions from experience, and the author does a great job of explaining very well in words this complexity of systems, hormesis, heuristics, non-linearity, and many other concepts (naive rationalism, the soviet-harvard complext - that was a good one - etc.)that's why I think this should be read by mostly everyone but specially those in the public sector or in decision-making positions. It's good to read things that challenge the placid status quo and ""authorized"" modes of thinking.I also found the challenge and criticism of naive rationalism and the interventionism it justify very entertaining; being a fan of classic liberalism, it's great to see a vindication of autonomy and freedom in system and somebody with a sane mind, claim the need to stop pretending we can control all variables in a complex system (the collapse of the Soviet Union apparently was not enough for many to be convinced that these manipulated systems did not work)"

Fortunately ""Antifragile"" doesn't repeat the same mistakes: it's much more ""readable"", examples are more much more diverse & author approaches the concept of fragility & anti-fragility from far more ""angles"".It's not perfect of course - sometimes it gets too egocentric, sometimes author dives too deeply in his personal beliefs that are not backed with any hard facts, sometimes he flows a bit too far (e.g. by reaching to examples from mythology ...), but it truly succeeds in MAKING READER THINK. It's not that easy as the topic ain't really very tangible, but for me it really worked well.It may be one of the most important books of the decade (at least)."

It's one thing to disagree with the established way of thinking in various fields, but it's quite another thing not only to be utterly contemptuous of many people (Taleb's list is long: economists, bankers, academics, MBAs, doctors, journalists, politicians, bureaucrats, etc.), but also continuously and proudly show off your contempt as a badge of honor. Taleb is cocky in a very unpleasant way. He feels the need to tell us a few times throughout the book about his bodybuilding and how he now looks like a bodyguard and can tell people to fuck off. He tells us that when he goes to a ski resort he feels good knowing that he's richer than those other ""rich farts"" who don't know that he's richer than them! As for the book - Taleb has a few good ideas, but the book is disorganized and long-winded and can get repetitive. "

I heard about this before when someone explained the chaos monkey software that randomly interfered with a complex IT system to improve its fault tolerance. I hoped to learn more about such systems but was badly disappointed.This book is even worse than Fooled by Randomness. Taleb mixes his anecdotes with dropping the names of philosophers and mythical figures. He uses footnotes as if he would write a scientific paper while using every chance he has to explain how stupid academia is and that they haven’t the slightest clue. Except when there is a study that proves one of his many points.My time is to important therefore I dropped this book as Taleb started to analyse TV series after explaining thoroughly the single steps one of his bodyguards does in the gym."

Time and time again, he uses anecdotes, often personal in nature, to convey these ideas to the layman.Despite the occasional use of certain technical terms, this book is a pretty easy read for those who don't have a background in economics, finance, statistics or political science.

213,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32834867-mitch-watson,1,"The idea is great, the book is almost unreadable. Recommend you read a synopsis. "
214,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"In this book the author presents the idea of antifragileness. The best way to understand this is with the tricotomy he gives: fragile-robust-antifragile. Fragile things or people are adversely affected by large random events that are not anticipated. Robust things or people are those that can weather the storm so to speak. Antifragile things or people actual gain significantly from the same events that break the fragile things and people. An example of antifragileness that the author gives early on is options. To illustrate these he gives the story of Thales, sometimes said to be the first philosopher, who bought up all the olive presses in his part of Asia Minor, then part of the Greek sphere in 600 BC. The cost was small, but he became rich when there was a bumper crop of olives, and people all around came to rent his olive presses, for which he made a handsome profit. The idea is that you can take small risks with big payoffs, hence making you antifragile. Some other aspects of antifragileness are: the use of via negativa, which contains the idea of substracting to things, instead of adding (e.g. in medicine, quit smoking); having variety and varying intensity; hormoses, exposure to a little of something to build up resistance to it (e.g. germs so the immune system can be primed); negative (fragile) and positive (antifragile) convexity; and relying on empiricism instead of theory. As far as his empiricism is concern I have some qualms. While one should always have evidence for ones actions without theory observation is lame. He also seems to require valid experiment for the benefit of things, while he does not think it is necessary for things dealing with the antifragile because it is deemed broadly applicable. This seems like a double standard and being reliant on theory or methodology instead of evidence. His basic ethical approach is admirable. This involves never gaining antifragileness at the expense of somone elses fragileness. He believes that compensation in employment should include negative compensation. Hence, if an executive is on the job when that company falters, that person should be docked compensation, so that he or she can be held responsible for the negative consequences he or she brought about. This makes the person have “skin in the game,” as he would say. Or, don't cause risk for others without causing risk to oneself.Another thing that the author claims is that education does not lead a nation to riches, but it goes the other way; riches leads to education. I can buy this up to a point. After all, the United States gained wealth before it became the center of world class university education. However, on a personal level education leads to better job prospects in the modern world. So, my agreement is mixed on this point.I felt that I connected with the author on a number of points. He counsels diversity, which my activities in life certainly are at the present time. We also seem similar in our reading habits; we both read what is interesting and refuse to finish a book that bores us. Another link is that our ideas spring from our active pursuit of knowledge, such as reading. This is in contrast to others, who propose an idea, and then go looking for confirmation.Overall, I give the book high marks. It was interesting throughout and the author's writing is fluid. As you can guess from some of my comments above, I do not agree with him on all points. But, that's okay. Agreement is not necessarily a criteria for what makes a good book for me. I suggest this book for someone who is interested in a different approach to economics and other social sciences. Although it might be useful as a challenge to a person's entrenched view point on these subjects. I would also recommend the book for those interested in relatively new ideas. He claims that parts of the book are on the technical side, and I do not agree. The only part that is definitely technical is appendix 2. If you find graphs and simple, in words, equations a challenge, you would consider these parts technical as well."
215,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92475250-shrikant-patil,5,"Mind-blowing book. Central idea of the book ""Everything gains or loses from volatility. Fragility is what loses from volatility and uncertainty""I have been reading it slowly over last 3 months as there are so many ideas compressed in the book which will make you ponder for a while.Taleb fan forever now!"
216,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,2,"Maaaan this book was frustrating to read.His main point is that some things are fragile - small random things happening to them make them break. Some things are robust - they're resilient to small random things happening to them. But the best things are antifragile - small random things happening to them make them stronger. Good examples are things like your immune system, since being exposed to weak viruses makes it stronger.So far so good. Unfortunately the rest of the book was painful to read, even as there were some good ideas sprinkled within. Here are some reasons why!- The author is, to put it delicately, an egocentric asshole. He calls things ""sissy"" and ""wussy"", because he's apparently a fifth grader. Some choice quotes:A friend who writes books remarked that painters like painting but authors like ""having written."" I suggested he stop writing, for his sake and the sake of his readers. Charming, no? He also goes on about people who just don't understand his ideas (which I'm a little skeptical of...it's possible that they do understand and disagree, which I'm sure the author would consider the same as not ""really"" understanding) and gives the example of a time when he was doing a radio interview and the journalist didn't understand something, so he walked out of the studio.- The book is extremely prone to overstating things for dramatic effect (I assume?), which made me not trust it in a lot of cases. The author says ""I realized school was a plot designed to deprive people of erudition by squeezing their knowledge into a narrow set of authors."" (and then has a long list of authors that he's read) He says depression is a made-up disease! Here, look:But when you medicate a child for an imagined or invented psychiatric disease, say, ADHD or depression, instead of letting him out of the cage, the long-term harm is largely unaccounted for.I mean, I don't disagree that ADHD is probably overdiagnosed and we need to be careful about prescribing medication, especially if it isn't proven to work better than counseling. But I think it's pretty unreasonable and insulting to say depression is ""imagined or invented"". To me, this shows a lack of empathy or a belief that since he doesn't feel depressed, other people are just ""sad"" or faking it or something. Sigh.- He has a giant chip on his shoulder. In retrospect this isn't terribly surprising, because in ""The Black Swan"" he talks about betting for the market to crash and being wrong every day for a long time, until he was right. (it also isn't surprising because he's an egocentric asshole - see above) But he attacks people mercilessly, some of whom seem like they don't deserve it. He keeps calling people ""Fragilista"" (which I never was entirely clear what that meant) and he talks about about ""Soviet-Harvard"" people. He is extremely condescending towards ""book learning"" and claims that most innovations came from tinkering without understanding what was going on, which I find a bit implausible.- The book is extremely hedgehog like (see The Hedgehog and the Fox) - he tries to apply this principle of antifragility across a wide range of topics, some of which he (proudly!) doesn't know much about.He also hates the metric system because the imperial measures are ""intuitive"". For example, a furlong is the distance one can sprint before running out of breath, which is really stretching the definition of intuitive...Anyway, with most books I try to ignore the parts I don't like and get what I can out of it. In this case the whole reading experience was pretty unpleasant, and 90% of the good parts were in ""The Black Swan"" anyway, so I'd recommend reading that instead."
217,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"== Second Read ==The second run-through was just as good as the first. Key keys reinforced: optionality, ""via negativa"" (subtractive > additive), iatrogenics (harm done by the healer, or more generally naive interventions), asymmetric risks (so topical). Understanding a bit more about risk asymmetries is so interesting - it changes the way you think about many questions and problems (be it finance, pollution, medicine, forecasting, estimating, planning, policy-making, etc). I want to re-emphasize what a cool ""idea book"" I think this is. If you haven't read NNT it's probably unlike anything you've read before. It's not an airport business book, and it doesn't fit into a neat genre. The narrative is nonlinear and challenging (in a good way) and to me, very refreshing. Since Taleb is an unapologetic asshole he writes unfiltered and that pisses off some readers (esp. those ""charlatans and wage slaves"" in academia and huge corporations), he takes a jab at virtually every audience likely to be reading the book. I highly recommend this book (above all other NNT works), just ignore the jabs and don't miss a chance to learn something and explore new ideas via a great modern thinker, storyteller and philosopher. == First Read ==My head is spinning - this is such an interesting book. The key concept is in the title, which is not necessarily intuitive without a whole book beating the idea into you. Here's the thought experiment: If someone asked you to name the opposite of fragile - not knowing this book - you'd say robust, strong, or another synonym. But fragile (think: a teacup) implies a terrific failure in the face of volatility (shocks), whereas robust (think: a travel mug) just implies durability, but little change in state. Antifragile is a different idea: something that gets stronger with volatility/shocks (cup metaphor fails here). A real-life example would be forest fire management: forests are fragile due to fire management and the enormous buildup of underbrush, but are antifragile to fires (they get stronger) in their natural, unmanaged state. The same idea applies to the human body; we get stronger with shocks to our system. We are missing this word, antifragile, from our vocabulary. Taleb carries the concept of antifragility through finance, business, medicine, personal ethics, the human body and more. Like The Black Swan, this book is filled with his trademark side stories, aphorisms, examples, and philosophical musings. However, Antifragile is more focused, the side stories are more off track, the aphorisms are better (much of academia = lecturing birds on how to fly), everything is just BETTER. After my first read, I think this is simply a better book than The Black Swan; equally challenging and entertaining, and well put-together. Still, Taleb's style and I'm-definitely-smarter-than-you tone is not for everyone. Whoever borrowed this from the library before me was triggered enough to add about a dozen put-downs and call-outs in the margins, for reasons I don't quite understand. This is definitely a book I want to re-read (and expand my review, and hone the ideas). 5 easy stars. Me: ""I loved it"" Robyn: ""Well you didn't stop talking about it""Lastly here is a much better review than my own: https://unherd.com/2018/12/why-antifr..."
218,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807377-jon,5,"Nassim Taleb has coined a useful word, antifragile—a word that will be permanently lodged in our lexicon. Here's how to explain it. When you send a box of glasses in the mail, you write fragile on the box. When you send something robust, you write nothing. So robust isn't the opposite of fragile, as some might suppose. The opposite of fragile is something that gets stronger when it's broken—something antifragile. It's a useful word for many reasons, but I'm primarily interested in how it applies to politics because it allows us to bypass many typical (boring) partisan arguments about whether regulation is inherently good or bad. Taleb starts with the premise that we will never eliminate volatility (i.e. Black Swan events, or random unforeseen changes). From that premise it follows that we should only pass regulations which will make the economy more antifragile (that is, stronger after the inevitable future volatility).That may sound simple-minded, but the implications are important. For instance, this rule of thumb would eliminate endlessly complicated regulation like the Dodd-Frank Act (which may eventually sprawl to 30,000 pages of rules—creating loopholes ripe for cronyism), but it would leave open the possibility for simple, market-wide regulations like breaking up the banks, or banning credit-default swaps. In other words, an antifragile economy is one that implements only regulations that aren't needlessly complex, don't pick winners and losers, and never add hosts of bureaucrats. By this token an antifragile economy also favors diverse, simple, small and medium-sized governments over the concentrated hive of bureaucrats that Washington has become. (Taleb's uses early America and Switzerland as models to follow, and I agree.)What's more, an antifragile economy is full of entrepreneurs and small/medium-sized businesses instead of megacorporations. We know that entrepreneurs fail frequently, over and over, but each failure makes the future economy stronger as it quickly learns from their/our mistakes (thus, it's antifragile). This is the opposite of ""too big to fail,"" a system where each recurring failure weakens the future economy for years to come, with losses spilling over to unrelated parties (i.e. taxpayers).So here's a word that breaks the pro-regulation/anti-regulation dichotomy: antifragile. It provides us with a useful rule of thumb, a new and better way to frame debates about the intersection of business and government. It's a word we should start using.And the book? The book is sprawling and aggravating(!) and wonderful. "
219,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7140517-sam-rhodes,5,"Having just finished Mr. Taleb's Antifragile, I find myself dazed to the point of saying something as trite and stupid as, ""Thank God. You're here. Where have you been?"" At 63, I would like to say that Antifragile has been, not the read of the day, not the read of the week or the month, nor, not even that more revered and honored award, book of the year. Antifragile, for me, has been the read of a lifetime. It has helped me, in ways that no other book has heretofore been able, understand the way, and the ways, in which I have always thought. Mr. Taleb's words serve as a flashlight (actually more like a beacon) to present, past, and future segments of my journey through this life. Just because a book somehow finds itself assigned to such meaning in one particular life, does not make it a great book, even though it may be that it has done so for many others as well. That would only mean there are many particular others connecting, just as I have, to Mr. Taleb's vast understanding of chaotic thoughts and principles.The true greatness in Mr. Taleb's writing is in its allowance for abstract thought to find life and become visualized on the page. His writing style cradles great truths and facetious little innuendos sprinkled within single sentences. His depiction of Fat Tony's bumbling and stumbling along into a massive collection of wealth through the common sense, Snooki-like, captured and fed only in New Jersey logic is incredible, especially when pulled, in full character, into conversations with Nero and debates with Socrates. His apt, and brutally honest, descriptions and characterizations of the people with whom we mingle everyday, whom we too see in such light but are afraid to talk about it, seem to come from a complete undressing of all things sacred, safe, and secret by Superman like eyes while we look on.It would be easy to drone on and on about Mr' Taleb's acute awareness and observational skills, or his psychologically and historically sound philosophical unpatterns of antifragile thought, but that would be an attempt to grease the skids of antifragility through the use of fragility, so I will stop here, and if nothing else, pretend that the simplicity of you alone with a book is something I want to see."
220,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"The Fragility of Braggadocio: Taleb's Bullied BrainIt takes a certain kind of mind to tolerate a man who thinks so highly of himself, and whose main hobby seems to be to badmouth other intellectuals, businesspeople and politicians. While we're on the subject of failings, let me make clear that the main insights, and theories, of the book are neither as original nor as immediately useful as the author wants you to believe.There. That's two pretty big failings - I can see the point of all those 2- and 1-star reviews.However, you've got to be kidding me if you place so much value on such trivial things. The worth of a conversation or an argument does not lie in its social palatability or political correctness. (Often, in fact, quite the opposite.) I would, in fact, recommend you approach to the author like a jester, a joker, a comedian - and not take the things he says too seriously. Calling some people ""sissies"" and ""a**holes"" is useful if politically incorrect Mediterranean advice, or life lessons, for non-Mediterranean people (the author is Lebanese, and he is recommending an Italian Mafia style solution to problems).And you wouldn't call Steve Jobs's inventions terrible just because he was a terrible human being.Nassim Taleb's insights and conversations can be quite good - well worth the trouble of forgiveness.Finally, to prove my point, here are five (5) great insights that can be gained from Taleb's account:1) The interconnection between all fields of life - from institutions and science to the economy. 2) We need external stressors, optionality, variability and evolutionary growth in order to strive.3) The vital importance of ""via negativa"" as a general life strategy: call BS BS and avoid comfort.4) The importance of the long view of things; a short-view perspective leads to too much fragility.5) The mutual importance of risk-averse conservatism and risk-loving radicalism as coeval paths.Most importantly, the book is fun, daring, obscene, ugly, egotistical, important, crazy, and good. The great lesson is that we don't all need to be Mother Theresa - even terrible people can be right."
221,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"It is not hard to see why Nassim Nicholas Taleb ticks a lot of people off. On top of being heterodox, he's also brash, confrontational, and--by the standards of academic decorum--a barbarian. I love the guy.I'm not sure that I believe everything that he says, but his theories and ideas are fascinating and definitely have merit. What's more--although I wouldn't take personal swipes at people the way he does--I really think he's utterly sincere in his quest for knowledge. That's something that's desperately rare in professional academia, where the incentives make sure we have plenty of provocation and novelty and complexity but tend to leave truth as a neglected concept. And that's the best case scenario.I listened to this book on Audible and took so many notes that my back-of-the-envelope calculation tells me I can reread the entire book in Kindle faster than I can transcribe the notes. (Cursed Google Books won't let me find most of the passages I want to transcribe. Which is obnoxious, since I already own the book in audio and digital format, but not at the right venues. How many times do I have to buy the same book just to be able to search the text? The 21st century still has some things to figure out.)Anyway, I'm going to reread the book and then automatically import the notes into Evernote and then update this review with more info on the actual, you know, content.But the short version? Taleb is an interesting adversary to the complex systems guys at the Santa Fe Institute. They're both tackling real problems (like institutional fragility, which matters a lot when the institutions in question are stock markets and governments) with a genuine 21st century paradigm while almost all of our contemporary policy and political debates are still basically mired in the 19th century. Maybe 20th, on a good day.This stuff matters. I'm just a little worried that we're going to have a lot more avoidable catastrophes (like the Great Recession) before public discourse catches up with the relevant research into complex systems."

Volatility harms fragile products/ people/.... (e.g. glass), while robustness is neutral to volatily. But antifragility thrives on risk. Although this may sound contra-intuitive, the author gives loads of examples in many domains. Typically, entrepreneurs are by definition fond of ""opportunities"" (a term preferred to ""problems""). Bureaucrats and managers on the other hand are not only risk adverse, they have no skin in the game. For the latter, there is no incentive to make the right decisions and their bonuses are only focused on the short term.Also in the field of biology, many examples of antifragility are alive. Why use medicins (sleeping pills, antibiotics,...) which are expensive and make the body weak and fragile? Or muscles that are trained in the gym are made stronger by challenging them a little. ""What does not kill you, makes you stronger"", indeed.Mr. Taleb is skeptical when it comes to human hubris. Urbanisation a la Le Corbusier has created alienation and unsafe cities, big states have made the political system unstable and fragile (EU, China, USA) while smaller countries are more robust, even antifragile (Switzerland, Hong Kong,...). A lot of theories in social sciences have been built from trial-and-error and do not come out of the blue.From a philosophical point of view, the author does not agree with Socrates that what one does not know is senseless. He rather believes in the Nietzschean Dionysus, the positive nihilism that favours creative destruction.Politically, I was pleasantly surprised to discover some conservative opinions: ""small is beautiful"", a dislike for the bureaucrats that are risk-adverse, importance of tradition (Lindy-effect).The best book I have read in the last years!"
223,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,5,"Nassim Taleb is cultural Heretic, and I say that with the most respect that I can. It is not easy being a skeptic when not just the masses of so-called 'experts' are against you, but the sheer force of an entire culture. Like the proverbial Emperor's New Clothes, the author calls into question many of the basic assumptions that our modern society today is based on. The ideas of bigger is better, or too-big to fail, or even the responsibility of Government to protect and bail out companies from hardship. He instead advocates that chaos, that stress are not only natural but great for making companies stronger, better and killing off the ones that don't deserve to survive. Capitalism isn't the problem, its when Government gets too involved with it that it becomes so warped and mutated that companies become shielded from natural consequences of bad practices. They are able to run a muck and then have the government come in and clean up behind them.This author hits his thesis so hard he believes Federal governments are unnatural and beyond the scope of human ability to safely utilize. He instead believes in City-States and small businesses, where the damage done from poor leadership are limited and small and not colossal in scale. For example if a city-state fails it would only affect a few thousand people, but if the Federal government fails the effects would be globally catastrophic. His ideas are very intriguing and forces the reader to really think and question almost all basic assumptions especially if they come from the ""Experts"". His tone might come across as arrogant to some, but I find that he needs to adopt such a tone merely because his thesis is so contentious that if he wasn't confident to the point of being cocky so many would simply dismiss him.

A book full of new and fresh perspectives. I also liked it especially since it explains so well and confirms and demonstrates certain facts about the world that coincide with my intuitions of how the world works and how common approaches do not usually work in complex systems. Of course, mine are just intuitions from experience, and the author does a great job of explaining very well in words this complexity of systems, hormesis, heuristics, non-linearity, and many other concepts (naive rationalism, the soviet-harvard complext - that was a good one - etc.)that's why I think this should be read by mostly everyone but specially those in the public sector or in decision-making positions. It's good to read things that challenge the placid status quo and ""authorized"" modes of thinking.I also found the challenge and criticism of naive rationalism and the interventionism it justify very entertaining; being a fan of classic liberalism, it's great to see a vindication of autonomy and freedom in system and somebody with a sane mind, claim the need to stop pretending we can control all variables in a complex system (the collapse of the Soviet Union apparently was not enough for many to be convinced that these manipulated systems did not work)"

Fortunately ""Antifragile"" doesn't repeat the same mistakes: it's much more ""readable"", examples are more much more diverse & author approaches the concept of fragility & anti-fragility from far more ""angles"".It's not perfect of course - sometimes it gets too egocentric, sometimes author dives too deeply in his personal beliefs that are not backed with any hard facts, sometimes he flows a bit too far (e.g. by reaching to examples from mythology ...), but it truly succeeds in MAKING READER THINK.

It's one thing to disagree with the established way of thinking in various fields, but it's quite another thing not only to be utterly contemptuous of many people (Taleb's list is long: economists, bankers, academics, MBAs, doctors, journalists, politicians, bureaucrats, etc.), but also continuously and proudly show off your contempt as a badge of honor. Taleb is cocky in a very unpleasant way. He feels the need to tell us a few times throughout the book about his bodybuilding and how he now looks like a bodyguard and can tell people to fuck off. He tells us that when he goes to a ski resort he feels good knowing that he's richer than those other ""rich farts"" who don't know that he's richer than them!

I heard about this before when someone explained the chaos monkey software that randomly interfered with a complex IT system to improve its fault tolerance. I hoped to learn more about such systems but was badly disappointed.This book is even worse than Fooled by Randomness. Taleb mixes his anecdotes with dropping the names of philosophers and mythical figures. He uses footnotes as if he would write a scientific paper while using every chance he has to explain how stupid academia is and that they haven’t the slightest clue.

243,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32834867-mitch-watson,1,"The idea is great, the book is almost unreadable. Recommend you read a synopsis. "
244,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"In this book the author presents the idea of antifragileness. The best way to understand this is with the tricotomy he gives: fragile-robust-antifragile. Fragile things or people are adversely affected by large random events that are not anticipated. Robust things or people are those that can weather the storm so to speak. Antifragile things or people actual gain significantly from the same events that break the fragile things and people. An example of antifragileness that the author gives early on is options. To illustrate these he gives the story of Thales, sometimes said to be the first philosopher, who bought up all the olive presses in his part of Asia Minor, then part of the Greek sphere in 600 BC. The cost was small, but he became rich when there was a bumper crop of olives, and people all around came to rent his olive presses, for which he made a handsome profit. The idea is that you can take small risks with big payoffs, hence making you antifragile. Some other aspects of antifragileness are: the use of via negativa, which contains the idea of substracting to things, instead of adding (e.g. in medicine, quit smoking); having variety and varying intensity; hormoses, exposure to a little of something to build up resistance to it (e.g. germs so the immune system can be primed); negative (fragile) and positive (antifragile) convexity; and relying on empiricism instead of theory. As far as his empiricism is concern I have some qualms. While one should always have evidence for ones actions without theory observation is lame. He also seems to require valid experiment for the benefit of things, while he does not think it is necessary for things dealing with the antifragile because it is deemed broadly applicable. This seems like a double standard and being reliant on theory or methodology instead of evidence. His basic ethical approach is admirable. This involves never gaining antifragileness at the expense of somone elses fragileness. He believes that compensation in employment should include negative compensation. Hence, if an executive is on the job when that company falters, that person should be docked compensation, so that he or she can be held responsible for the negative consequences he or she brought about. This makes the person have “skin in the game,” as he would say. Or, don't cause risk for others without causing risk to oneself.Another thing that the author claims is that education does not lead a nation to riches, but it goes the other way; riches leads to education. I can buy this up to a point. After all, the United States gained wealth before it became the center of world class university education. However, on a personal level education leads to better job prospects in the modern world. So, my agreement is mixed on this point.I felt that I connected with the author on a number of points. He counsels diversity, which my activities in life certainly are at the present time. We also seem similar in our reading habits; we both read what is interesting and refuse to finish a book that bores us. Another link is that our ideas spring from our active pursuit of knowledge, such as reading. This is in contrast to others, who propose an idea, and then go looking for confirmation.Overall, I give the book high marks. It was interesting throughout and the author's writing is fluid. As you can guess from some of my comments above, I do not agree with him on all points. But, that's okay. Agreement is not necessarily a criteria for what makes a good book for me. I suggest this book for someone who is interested in a different approach to economics and other social sciences. Although it might be useful as a challenge to a person's entrenched view point on these subjects. I would also recommend the book for those interested in relatively new ideas. He claims that parts of the book are on the technical side, and I do not agree. The only part that is definitely technical is appendix 2. If you find graphs and simple, in words, equations a challenge, you would consider these parts technical as well."
245,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92475250-shrikant-patil,5,"Mind-blowing book. Central idea of the book ""Everything gains or loses from volatility. Fragility is what loses from volatility and uncertainty""I have been reading it slowly over last 3 months as there are so many ideas compressed in the book which will make you ponder for a while.Taleb fan forever now!"
246,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,2,"Maaaan this book was frustrating to read.His main point is that some things are fragile - small random things happening to them make them break. Some things are robust - they're resilient to small random things happening to them. But the best things are antifragile - small random things happening to them make them stronger. Good examples are things like your immune system, since being exposed to weak viruses makes it stronger.So far so good. Unfortunately the rest of the book was painful to read, even as there were some good ideas sprinkled within. Here are some reasons why!- The author is, to put it delicately, an egocentric asshole. He calls things ""sissy"" and ""wussy"", because he's apparently a fifth grader. Some choice quotes:A friend who writes books remarked that painters like painting but authors like ""having written."" I suggested he stop writing, for his sake and the sake of his readers. Charming, no? He also goes on about people who just don't understand his ideas (which I'm a little skeptical of...it's possible that they do understand and disagree, which I'm sure the author would consider the same as not ""really"" understanding) and gives the example of a time when he was doing a radio interview and the journalist didn't understand something, so he walked out of the studio.- The book is extremely prone to overstating things for dramatic effect (I assume?), which made me not trust it in a lot of cases. The author says ""I realized school was a plot designed to deprive people of erudition by squeezing their knowledge into a narrow set of authors."" (and then has a long list of authors that he's read) He says depression is a made-up disease! Here, look:But when you medicate a child for an imagined or invented psychiatric disease, say, ADHD or depression, instead of letting him out of the cage, the long-term harm is largely unaccounted for.I mean, I don't disagree that ADHD is probably overdiagnosed and we need to be careful about prescribing medication, especially if it isn't proven to work better than counseling. But I think it's pretty unreasonable and insulting to say depression is ""imagined or invented"". To me, this shows a lack of empathy or a belief that since he doesn't feel depressed, other people are just ""sad"" or faking it or something. Sigh.- He has a giant chip on his shoulder. In retrospect this isn't terribly surprising, because in ""The Black Swan"" he talks about betting for the market to crash and being wrong every day for a long time, until he was right. (it also isn't surprising because he's an egocentric asshole - see above) But he attacks people mercilessly, some of whom seem like they don't deserve it. He keeps calling people ""Fragilista"" (which I never was entirely clear what that meant) and he talks about about ""Soviet-Harvard"" people. He is extremely condescending towards ""book learning"" and claims that most innovations came from tinkering without understanding what was going on, which I find a bit implausible.- The book is extremely hedgehog like (see The Hedgehog and the Fox) - he tries to apply this principle of antifragility across a wide range of topics, some of which he (proudly!) doesn't know much about.He also hates the metric system because the imperial measures are ""intuitive"". For example, a furlong is the distance one can sprint before running out of breath, which is really stretching the definition of intuitive...Anyway, with most books I try to ignore the parts I don't like and get what I can out of it. In this case the whole reading experience was pretty unpleasant, and 90% of the good parts were in ""The Black Swan"" anyway, so I'd recommend reading that instead."
247,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"== Second Read ==The second run-through was just as good as the first. Key keys reinforced: optionality, ""via negativa"" (subtractive > additive), iatrogenics (harm done by the healer, or more generally naive interventions), asymmetric risks (so topical). Understanding a bit more about risk asymmetries is so interesting - it changes the way you think about many questions and problems (be it finance, pollution, medicine, forecasting, estimating, planning, policy-making, etc). I want to re-emphasize what a cool ""idea book"" I think this is. If you haven't read NNT it's probably unlike anything you've read before. It's not an airport business book, and it doesn't fit into a neat genre. The narrative is nonlinear and challenging (in a good way) and to me, very refreshing. Since Taleb is an unapologetic asshole he writes unfiltered and that pisses off some readers (esp. those ""charlatans and wage slaves"" in academia and huge corporations), he takes a jab at virtually every audience likely to be reading the book. I highly recommend this book (above all other NNT works), just ignore the jabs and don't miss a chance to learn something and explore new ideas via a great modern thinker, storyteller and philosopher. == First Read ==My head is spinning - this is such an interesting book. The key concept is in the title, which is not necessarily intuitive without a whole book beating the idea into you. Here's the thought experiment: If someone asked you to name the opposite of fragile - not knowing this book - you'd say robust, strong, or another synonym. But fragile (think: a teacup) implies a terrific failure in the face of volatility (shocks), whereas robust (think: a travel mug) just implies durability, but little change in state. Antifragile is a different idea: something that gets stronger with volatility/shocks (cup metaphor fails here). A real-life example would be forest fire management: forests are fragile due to fire management and the enormous buildup of underbrush, but are antifragile to fires (they get stronger) in their natural, unmanaged state. The same idea applies to the human body; we get stronger with shocks to our system. We are missing this word, antifragile, from our vocabulary. Taleb carries the concept of antifragility through finance, business, medicine, personal ethics, the human body and more. Like The Black Swan, this book is filled with his trademark side stories, aphorisms, examples, and philosophical musings. However, Antifragile is more focused, the side stories are more off track, the aphorisms are better (much of academia = lecturing birds on how to fly), everything is just BETTER. After my first read, I think this is simply a better book than The Black Swan; equally challenging and entertaining, and well put-together. Still, Taleb's style and I'm-definitely-smarter-than-you tone is not for everyone. Whoever borrowed this from the library before me was triggered enough to add about a dozen put-downs and call-outs in the margins, for reasons I don't quite understand. This is definitely a book I want to re-read (and expand my review, and hone the ideas). 5 easy stars. Me: ""I loved it"" Robyn: ""Well you didn't stop talking about it""Lastly here is a much better review than my own: https://unherd.com/2018/12/why-antifr..."
248,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807377-jon,5,"Nassim Taleb has coined a useful word, antifragile—a word that will be permanently lodged in our lexicon. Here's how to explain it. When you send a box of glasses in the mail, you write fragile on the box. When you send something robust, you write nothing. So robust isn't the opposite of fragile, as some might suppose. The opposite of fragile is something that gets stronger when it's broken—something antifragile. It's a useful word for many reasons, but I'm primarily interested in how it applies to politics because it allows us to bypass many typical (boring) partisan arguments about whether regulation is inherently good or bad. Taleb starts with the premise that we will never eliminate volatility (i.e. Black Swan events, or random unforeseen changes). From that premise it follows that we should only pass regulations which will make the economy more antifragile (that is, stronger after the inevitable future volatility).That may sound simple-minded, but the implications are important. For instance, this rule of thumb would eliminate endlessly complicated regulation like the Dodd-Frank Act (which may eventually sprawl to 30,000 pages of rules—creating loopholes ripe for cronyism), but it would leave open the possibility for simple, market-wide regulations like breaking up the banks, or banning credit-default swaps. In other words, an antifragile economy is one that implements only regulations that aren't needlessly complex, don't pick winners and losers, and never add hosts of bureaucrats. By this token an antifragile economy also favors diverse, simple, small and medium-sized governments over the concentrated hive of bureaucrats that Washington has become. (Taleb's uses early America and Switzerland as models to follow, and I agree.)What's more, an antifragile economy is full of entrepreneurs and small/medium-sized businesses instead of megacorporations. We know that entrepreneurs fail frequently, over and over, but each failure makes the future economy stronger as it quickly learns from their/our mistakes (thus, it's antifragile). This is the opposite of ""too big to fail,"" a system where each recurring failure weakens the future economy for years to come, with losses spilling over to unrelated parties (i.e. taxpayers).So here's a word that breaks the pro-regulation/anti-regulation dichotomy: antifragile. It provides us with a useful rule of thumb, a new and better way to frame debates about the intersection of business and government. It's a word we should start using.And the book? The book is sprawling and aggravating(!) and wonderful. "
249,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7140517-sam-rhodes,5,"Having just finished Mr. Taleb's Antifragile, I find myself dazed to the point of saying something as trite and stupid as, ""Thank God. You're here. Where have you been?"" At 63, I would like to say that Antifragile has been, not the read of the day, not the read of the week or the month, nor, not even that more revered and honored award, book of the year. Antifragile, for me, has been the read of a lifetime. It has helped me, in ways that no other book has heretofore been able, understand the way, and the ways, in which I have always thought. Mr. Taleb's words serve as a flashlight (actually more like a beacon) to present, past, and future segments of my journey through this life. Just because a book somehow finds itself assigned to such meaning in one particular life, does not make it a great book, even though it may be that it has done so for many others as well. That would only mean there are many particular others connecting, just as I have, to Mr. Taleb's vast understanding of chaotic thoughts and principles.The true greatness in Mr. Taleb's writing is in its allowance for abstract thought to find life and become visualized on the page. His writing style cradles great truths and facetious little innuendos sprinkled within single sentences. His depiction of Fat Tony's bumbling and stumbling along into a massive collection of wealth through the common sense, Snooki-like, captured and fed only in New Jersey logic is incredible, especially when pulled, in full character, into conversations with Nero and debates with Socrates. His apt, and brutally honest, descriptions and characterizations of the people with whom we mingle everyday, whom we too see in such light but are afraid to talk about it, seem to come from a complete undressing of all things sacred, safe, and secret by Superman like eyes while we look on.It would be easy to drone on and on about Mr' Taleb's acute awareness and observational skills, or his psychologically and historically sound philosophical unpatterns of antifragile thought, but that would be an attempt to grease the skids of antifragility through the use of fragility, so I will stop here, and if nothing else, pretend that the simplicity of you alone with a book is something I want to see."

While we're on the subject of failings, let me make clear that the main insights, and theories, of the book are neither as original nor as immediately useful as the author wants you to believe.There. That's two pretty big failings - I can see the point of all those 2- and 1-star reviews.However, you've got to be kidding me if you place so much value on such trivial things. The worth of a conversation or an argument does not lie in its social palatability or political correctness. (Often, in fact, quite the opposite.) I would, in fact, recommend you approach to the author like a jester, a joker, a comedian - and not take the things he says too seriously. Calling some people ""sissies"" and ""a**holes"" is useful if politically incorrect Mediterranean advice, or life lessons, for non-Mediterranean people (the author is Lebanese, and he is recommending an Italian Mafia style solution to problems).And you wouldn't call Steve Jobs's inventions terrible just because he was a terrible human being.Nassim Taleb's insights and conversations can be quite good - well worth the trouble of forgiveness.Finally, to prove my point, here are five (5) great insights that can be gained from Taleb's account:1) The interconnection between all fields of life - from institutions and science to the economy. 2) We need external stressors, optionality, variability and evolutionary growth in order to strive.3) The vital importance of ""via negativa"" as a general life strategy: call BS BS and avoid comfort.4) The importance of the long view of things; a short-view perspective leads to too much fragility.5) The mutual importance of risk-averse conservatism and risk-loving radicalism as coeval paths.Most importantly, the book is fun, daring, obscene, ugly, egotistical, important, crazy, and good. The great lesson is that we don't all need to be Mother Theresa - even terrible people can be right."
251,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"It is not hard to see why Nassim Nicholas Taleb ticks a lot of people off. On top of being heterodox, he's also brash, confrontational, and--by the standards of academic decorum--a barbarian. I love the guy.I'm not sure that I believe everything that he says, but his theories and ideas are fascinating and definitely have merit. What's more--although I wouldn't take personal swipes at people the way he does--I really think he's utterly sincere in his quest for knowledge. That's something that's desperately rare in professional academia, where the incentives make sure we have plenty of provocation and novelty and complexity but tend to leave truth as a neglected concept. And that's the best case scenario.I listened to this book on Audible and took so many notes that my back-of-the-envelope calculation tells me I can reread the entire book in Kindle faster than I can transcribe the notes. (Cursed Google Books won't let me find most of the passages I want to transcribe. Which is obnoxious, since I already own the book in audio and digital format, but not at the right venues. How many times do I have to buy the same book just to be able to search the text? The 21st century still has some things to figure out.)Anyway, I'm going to reread the book and then automatically import the notes into Evernote and then update this review with more info on the actual, you know, content.But the short version? Taleb is an interesting adversary to the complex systems guys at the Santa Fe Institute. They're both tackling real problems (like institutional fragility, which matters a lot when the institutions in question are stock markets and governments) with a genuine 21st century paradigm while almost all of our contemporary policy and political debates are still basically mired in the 19th century. Maybe 20th, on a good day.This stuff matters. I'm just a little worried that we're going to have a lot more avoidable catastrophes (like the Great Recession) before public discourse catches up with the relevant research into complex systems."
252,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10708119-pieter,5,"This book is the third (and hence last) part of Mr Taleb's trilogy, of which the world famous The Black Swan is the second.His thesis is that all in the world is either fragile, robust or antifragile. Volatility harms fragile products/ people/.... (e.g. glass), while robustness is neutral to volatily. But antifragility thrives on risk. Although this may sound contra-intuitive, the author gives loads of examples in many domains. Typically, entrepreneurs are by definition fond of ""opportunities"" (a term preferred to ""problems""). Bureaucrats and managers on the other hand are not only risk adverse, they have no skin in the game. For the latter, there is no incentive to make the right decisions and their bonuses are only focused on the short term.Also in the field of biology, many examples of antifragility are alive. Why use medicins (sleeping pills, antibiotics,...) which are expensive and make the body weak and fragile? Or muscles that are trained in the gym are made stronger by challenging them a little. ""What does not kill you, makes you stronger"", indeed.Mr. Taleb is skeptical when it comes to human hubris. Urbanisation a la Le Corbusier has created alienation and unsafe cities, big states have made the political system unstable and fragile (EU, China, USA) while smaller countries are more robust, even antifragile (Switzerland, Hong Kong,...). A lot of theories in social sciences have been built from trial-and-error and do not come out of the blue.From a philosophical point of view, the author does not agree with Socrates that what one does not know is senseless. He rather believes in the Nietzschean Dionysus, the positive nihilism that favours creative destruction.Politically, I was pleasantly surprised to discover some conservative opinions: ""small is beautiful"", a dislike for the bureaucrats that are risk-adverse, importance of tradition (Lindy-effect).The best book I have read in the last years!"
253,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,5,"Nassim Taleb is cultural Heretic, and I say that with the most respect that I can. It is not easy being a skeptic when not just the masses of so-called 'experts' are against you, but the sheer force of an entire culture. Like the proverbial Emperor's New Clothes, the author calls into question many of the basic assumptions that our modern society today is based on. The ideas of bigger is better, or too-big to fail, or even the responsibility of Government to protect and bail out companies from hardship. He instead advocates that chaos, that stress are not only natural but great for making companies stronger, better and killing off the ones that don't deserve to survive. Capitalism isn't the problem, its when Government gets too involved with it that it becomes so warped and mutated that companies become shielded from natural consequences of bad practices. They are able to run a muck and then have the government come in and clean up behind them.This author hits his thesis so hard he believes Federal governments are unnatural and beyond the scope of human ability to safely utilize. He instead believes in City-States and small businesses, where the damage done from poor leadership are limited and small and not colossal in scale. For example if a city-state fails it would only affect a few thousand people, but if the Federal government fails the effects would be globally catastrophic. His ideas are very intriguing and forces the reader to really think and question almost all basic assumptions especially if they come from the ""Experts"". His tone might come across as arrogant to some, but I find that he needs to adopt such a tone merely because his thesis is so contentious that if he wasn't confident to the point of being cocky so many would simply dismiss him.

Your enjoyment will be amplified by reading his other books beforehand.At this point Taleb has removed all shackling limitations - both financial and psychological - on his ability to live in accordance with his ingenious philosophy.

A book full of new and fresh perspectives. I also liked it especially since it explains so well and confirms and demonstrates certain facts about the world that coincide with my intuitions of how the world works and how common approaches do not usually work in complex systems. Of course, mine are just intuitions from experience, and the author does a great job of explaining very well in words this complexity of systems, hormesis, heuristics, non-linearity, and many other concepts (naive rationalism, the soviet-harvard complext - that was a good one - etc.)that's why I think this should be read by mostly everyone but specially those in the public sector or in decision-making positions. It's good to read things that challenge the placid status quo and ""authorized"" modes of thinking.I also found the challenge and criticism of naive rationalism and the interventionism it justify very entertaining; being a fan of classic liberalism, it's great to see a vindication of autonomy and freedom in system and somebody with a sane mind, claim the need to stop pretending we can control all variables in a complex system (the collapse of the Soviet Union apparently was not enough for many to be convinced that these manipulated systems did not work)"

Fortunately ""Antifragile"" doesn't repeat the same mistakes: it's much more ""readable"", examples are more much more diverse & author approaches the concept of fragility & anti-fragility from far more ""angles"".It's not perfect of course - sometimes it gets too egocentric, sometimes author dives too deeply in his personal beliefs that are not backed with any hard facts, sometimes he flows a bit too far (e.g. by reaching to examples from mythology ...), but it truly succeeds in MAKING READER THINK. It's not that easy as the topic ain't really very tangible, but for me it really worked well.It may be one of the most important books of the decade (at least)."

It's one thing to disagree with the established way of thinking in various fields, but it's quite another thing not only to be utterly contemptuous of many people (Taleb's list is long: economists, bankers, academics, MBAs, doctors, journalists, politicians, bureaucrats, etc.), but also continuously and proudly show off your contempt as a badge of honor. Taleb is cocky in a very unpleasant way. He feels the need to tell us a few times throughout the book about his bodybuilding and how he now looks like a bodyguard and can tell people to fuck off. He tells us that when he goes to a ski resort he feels good knowing that he's richer than those other ""rich farts"" who don't know that he's richer than them! As for the book - Taleb has a few good ideas, but the book is disorganized and long-winded and can get repetitive. "

I heard about this before when someone explained the chaos monkey software that randomly interfered with a complex IT system to improve its fault tolerance. I hoped to learn more about such systems but was badly disappointed.This book is even worse than Fooled by Randomness. Taleb mixes his anecdotes with dropping the names of philosophers and mythical figures. He uses footnotes as if he would write a scientific paper while using every chance he has to explain how stupid academia is and that they haven’t the slightest clue. Except when there is a study that proves one of his many points.My time is to important therefore I dropped this book as Taleb started to analyse TV series after explaining thoroughly the single steps one of his bodyguards does in the gym."

Time and time again, he uses anecdotes, often personal in nature, to convey these ideas to the layman.Despite the occasional use of certain technical terms, this book is a pretty easy read for those who don't have a background in economics, finance, statistics or political science.

273,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32834867-mitch-watson,1,"The idea is great, the book is almost unreadable. Recommend you read a synopsis. "
274,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28825839-stephie-williams,4,"In this book the author presents the idea of antifragileness. The best way to understand this is with the tricotomy he gives: fragile-robust-antifragile. Fragile things or people are adversely affected by large random events that are not anticipated. Robust things or people are those that can weather the storm so to speak. Antifragile things or people actual gain significantly from the same events that break the fragile things and people. An example of antifragileness that the author gives early on is options. To illustrate these he gives the story of Thales, sometimes said to be the first philosopher, who bought up all the olive presses in his part of Asia Minor, then part of the Greek sphere in 600 BC. The cost was small, but he became rich when there was a bumper crop of olives, and people all around came to rent his olive presses, for which he made a handsome profit. The idea is that you can take small risks with big payoffs, hence making you antifragile. Some other aspects of antifragileness are: the use of via negativa, which contains the idea of substracting to things, instead of adding (e.g. in medicine, quit smoking); having variety and varying intensity; hormoses, exposure to a little of something to build up resistance to it (e.g. germs so the immune system can be primed); negative (fragile) and positive (antifragile) convexity; and relying on empiricism instead of theory. As far as his empiricism is concern I have some qualms. While one should always have evidence for ones actions without theory observation is lame. He also seems to require valid experiment for the benefit of things, while he does not think it is necessary for things dealing with the antifragile because it is deemed broadly applicable. This seems like a double standard and being reliant on theory or methodology instead of evidence. His basic ethical approach is admirable. This involves never gaining antifragileness at the expense of somone elses fragileness. He believes that compensation in employment should include negative compensation. Hence, if an executive is on the job when that company falters, that person should be docked compensation, so that he or she can be held responsible for the negative consequences he or she brought about. This makes the person have “skin in the game,” as he would say. Or, don't cause risk for others without causing risk to oneself.Another thing that the author claims is that education does not lead a nation to riches, but it goes the other way; riches leads to education. I can buy this up to a point. After all, the United States gained wealth before it became the center of world class university education. However, on a personal level education leads to better job prospects in the modern world. So, my agreement is mixed on this point.I felt that I connected with the author on a number of points. He counsels diversity, which my activities in life certainly are at the present time. We also seem similar in our reading habits; we both read what is interesting and refuse to finish a book that bores us. Another link is that our ideas spring from our active pursuit of knowledge, such as reading. This is in contrast to others, who propose an idea, and then go looking for confirmation.Overall, I give the book high marks. It was interesting throughout and the author's writing is fluid. As you can guess from some of my comments above, I do not agree with him on all points. But, that's okay. Agreement is not necessarily a criteria for what makes a good book for me. I suggest this book for someone who is interested in a different approach to economics and other social sciences. Although it might be useful as a challenge to a person's entrenched view point on these subjects. I would also recommend the book for those interested in relatively new ideas. He claims that parts of the book are on the technical side, and I do not agree. The only part that is definitely technical is appendix 2. If you find graphs and simple, in words, equations a challenge, you would consider these parts technical as well."
275,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92475250-shrikant-patil,5,"Mind-blowing book. Central idea of the book ""Everything gains or loses from volatility. Fragility is what loses from volatility and uncertainty""I have been reading it slowly over last 3 months as there are so many ideas compressed in the book which will make you ponder for a while.Taleb fan forever now!"
276,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5756337-greg-stoll,2,"Maaaan this book was frustrating to read.His main point is that some things are fragile - small random things happening to them make them break. Some things are robust - they're resilient to small random things happening to them. But the best things are antifragile - small random things happening to them make them stronger. Good examples are things like your immune system, since being exposed to weak viruses makes it stronger.So far so good. Unfortunately the rest of the book was painful to read, even as there were some good ideas sprinkled within. Here are some reasons why!- The author is, to put it delicately, an egocentric asshole. He calls things ""sissy"" and ""wussy"", because he's apparently a fifth grader. Some choice quotes:A friend who writes books remarked that painters like painting but authors like ""having written."" I suggested he stop writing, for his sake and the sake of his readers. Charming, no? He also goes on about people who just don't understand his ideas (which I'm a little skeptical of...it's possible that they do understand and disagree, which I'm sure the author would consider the same as not ""really"" understanding) and gives the example of a time when he was doing a radio interview and the journalist didn't understand something, so he walked out of the studio.- The book is extremely prone to overstating things for dramatic effect (I assume?), which made me not trust it in a lot of cases. The author says ""I realized school was a plot designed to deprive people of erudition by squeezing their knowledge into a narrow set of authors."" (and then has a long list of authors that he's read) He says depression is a made-up disease! Here, look:But when you medicate a child for an imagined or invented psychiatric disease, say, ADHD or depression, instead of letting him out of the cage, the long-term harm is largely unaccounted for.I mean, I don't disagree that ADHD is probably overdiagnosed and we need to be careful about prescribing medication, especially if it isn't proven to work better than counseling. But I think it's pretty unreasonable and insulting to say depression is ""imagined or invented"". To me, this shows a lack of empathy or a belief that since he doesn't feel depressed, other people are just ""sad"" or faking it or something. Sigh.- He has a giant chip on his shoulder. In retrospect this isn't terribly surprising, because in ""The Black Swan"" he talks about betting for the market to crash and being wrong every day for a long time, until he was right. (it also isn't surprising because he's an egocentric asshole - see above) But he attacks people mercilessly, some of whom seem like they don't deserve it. He keeps calling people ""Fragilista"" (which I never was entirely clear what that meant) and he talks about about ""Soviet-Harvard"" people. He is extremely condescending towards ""book learning"" and claims that most innovations came from tinkering without understanding what was going on, which I find a bit implausible.- The book is extremely hedgehog like (see The Hedgehog and the Fox) - he tries to apply this principle of antifragility across a wide range of topics, some of which he (proudly!) doesn't know much about.He also hates the metric system because the imperial measures are ""intuitive"". For example, a furlong is the distance one can sprint before running out of breath, which is really stretching the definition of intuitive...Anyway, with most books I try to ignore the parts I don't like and get what I can out of it. In this case the whole reading experience was pretty unpleasant, and 90% of the good parts were in ""The Black Swan"" anyway, so I'd recommend reading that instead."
277,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"== Second Read ==The second run-through was just as good as the first. Key keys reinforced: optionality, ""via negativa"" (subtractive > additive), iatrogenics (harm done by the healer, or more generally naive interventions), asymmetric risks (so topical). Understanding a bit more about risk asymmetries is so interesting - it changes the way you think about many questions and problems (be it finance, pollution, medicine, forecasting, estimating, planning, policy-making, etc). I want to re-emphasize what a cool ""idea book"" I think this is. If you haven't read NNT it's probably unlike anything you've read before. It's not an airport business book, and it doesn't fit into a neat genre. The narrative is nonlinear and challenging (in a good way) and to me, very refreshing. Since Taleb is an unapologetic asshole he writes unfiltered and that pisses off some readers (esp. those ""charlatans and wage slaves"" in academia and huge corporations), he takes a jab at virtually every audience likely to be reading the book. I highly recommend this book (above all other NNT works), just ignore the jabs and don't miss a chance to learn something and explore new ideas via a great modern thinker, storyteller and philosopher. == First Read ==My head is spinning - this is such an interesting book. The key concept is in the title, which is not necessarily intuitive without a whole book beating the idea into you. Here's the thought experiment: If someone asked you to name the opposite of fragile - not knowing this book - you'd say robust, strong, or another synonym. But fragile (think: a teacup) implies a terrific failure in the face of volatility (shocks), whereas robust (think: a travel mug) just implies durability, but little change in state. Antifragile is a different idea: something that gets stronger with volatility/shocks (cup metaphor fails here). A real-life example would be forest fire management: forests are fragile due to fire management and the enormous buildup of underbrush, but are antifragile to fires (they get stronger) in their natural, unmanaged state. The same idea applies to the human body; we get stronger with shocks to our system. We are missing this word, antifragile, from our vocabulary. Taleb carries the concept of antifragility through finance, business, medicine, personal ethics, the human body and more. Like The Black Swan, this book is filled with his trademark side stories, aphorisms, examples, and philosophical musings. However, Antifragile is more focused, the side stories are more off track, the aphorisms are better (much of academia = lecturing birds on how to fly), everything is just BETTER. After my first read, I think this is simply a better book than The Black Swan; equally challenging and entertaining, and well put-together. Still, Taleb's style and I'm-definitely-smarter-than-you tone is not for everyone. Whoever borrowed this from the library before me was triggered enough to add about a dozen put-downs and call-outs in the margins, for reasons I don't quite understand. This is definitely a book I want to re-read (and expand my review, and hone the ideas). 5 easy stars. Me: ""I loved it"" Robyn: ""Well you didn't stop talking about it""Lastly here is a much better review than my own: https://unherd.com/2018/12/why-antifr..."
278,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/807377-jon,5,"Nassim Taleb has coined a useful word, antifragile—a word that will be permanently lodged in our lexicon. Here's how to explain it. When you send a box of glasses in the mail, you write fragile on the box. When you send something robust, you write nothing. So robust isn't the opposite of fragile, as some might suppose. The opposite of fragile is something that gets stronger when it's broken—something antifragile. It's a useful word for many reasons, but I'm primarily interested in how it applies to politics because it allows us to bypass many typical (boring) partisan arguments about whether regulation is inherently good or bad. Taleb starts with the premise that we will never eliminate volatility (i.e. Black Swan events, or random unforeseen changes). From that premise it follows that we should only pass regulations which will make the economy more antifragile (that is, stronger after the inevitable future volatility).That may sound simple-minded, but the implications are important. For instance, this rule of thumb would eliminate endlessly complicated regulation like the Dodd-Frank Act (which may eventually sprawl to 30,000 pages of rules—creating loopholes ripe for cronyism), but it would leave open the possibility for simple, market-wide regulations like breaking up the banks, or banning credit-default swaps. In other words, an antifragile economy is one that implements only regulations that aren't needlessly complex, don't pick winners and losers, and never add hosts of bureaucrats. By this token an antifragile economy also favors diverse, simple, small and medium-sized governments over the concentrated hive of bureaucrats that Washington has become. (Taleb's uses early America and Switzerland as models to follow, and I agree.)What's more, an antifragile economy is full of entrepreneurs and small/medium-sized businesses instead of megacorporations. We know that entrepreneurs fail frequently, over and over, but each failure makes the future economy stronger as it quickly learns from their/our mistakes (thus, it's antifragile). This is the opposite of ""too big to fail,"" a system where each recurring failure weakens the future economy for years to come, with losses spilling over to unrelated parties (i.e. taxpayers).So here's a word that breaks the pro-regulation/anti-regulation dichotomy: antifragile. It provides us with a useful rule of thumb, a new and better way to frame debates about the intersection of business and government. It's a word we should start using.And the book? The book is sprawling and aggravating(!) and wonderful. "
279,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7140517-sam-rhodes,5,"Having just finished Mr. Taleb's Antifragile, I find myself dazed to the point of saying something as trite and stupid as, ""Thank God. You're here. Where have you been?"" At 63, I would like to say that Antifragile has been, not the read of the day, not the read of the week or the month, nor, not even that more revered and honored award, book of the year. Antifragile, for me, has been the read of a lifetime. It has helped me, in ways that no other book has heretofore been able, understand the way, and the ways, in which I have always thought. Mr. Taleb's words serve as a flashlight (actually more like a beacon) to present, past, and future segments of my journey through this life. Just because a book somehow finds itself assigned to such meaning in one particular life, does not make it a great book, even though it may be that it has done so for many others as well. That would only mean there are many particular others connecting, just as I have, to Mr. Taleb's vast understanding of chaotic thoughts and principles.The true greatness in Mr. Taleb's writing is in its allowance for abstract thought to find life and become visualized on the page. His writing style cradles great truths and facetious little innuendos sprinkled within single sentences. His depiction of Fat Tony's bumbling and stumbling along into a massive collection of wealth through the common sense, Snooki-like, captured and fed only in New Jersey logic is incredible, especially when pulled, in full character, into conversations with Nero and debates with Socrates. His apt, and brutally honest, descriptions and characterizations of the people with whom we mingle everyday, whom we too see in such light but are afraid to talk about it, seem to come from a complete undressing of all things sacred, safe, and secret by Superman like eyes while we look on.It would be easy to drone on and on about Mr' Taleb's acute awareness and observational skills, or his psychologically and historically sound philosophical unpatterns of antifragile thought, but that would be an attempt to grease the skids of antifragility through the use of fragility, so I will stop here, and if nothing else, pretend that the simplicity of you alone with a book is something I want to see."
280,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"The Fragility of Braggadocio: Taleb's Bullied BrainIt takes a certain kind of mind to tolerate a man who thinks so highly of himself, and whose main hobby seems to be to badmouth other intellectuals, businesspeople and politicians. While we're on the subject of failings, let me make clear that the main insights, and theories, of the book are neither as original nor as immediately useful as the author wants you to believe.There. That's two pretty big failings - I can see the point of all those 2- and 1-star reviews.However, you've got to be kidding me if you place so much value on such trivial things. The worth of a conversation or an argument does not lie in its social palatability or political correctness. (Often, in fact, quite the opposite.) I would, in fact, recommend you approach to the author like a jester, a joker, a comedian - and not take the things he says too seriously. Calling some people ""sissies"" and ""a**holes"" is useful if politically incorrect Mediterranean advice, or life lessons, for non-Mediterranean people (the author is Lebanese, and he is recommending an Italian Mafia style solution to problems).And you wouldn't call Steve Jobs's inventions terrible just because he was a terrible human being.Nassim Taleb's insights and conversations can be quite good - well worth the trouble of forgiveness.Finally, to prove my point, here are five (5) great insights that can be gained from Taleb's account:1) The interconnection between all fields of life - from institutions and science to the economy. 2) We need external stressors, optionality, variability and evolutionary growth in order to strive.3) The vital importance of ""via negativa"" as a general life strategy: call BS BS and avoid comfort.4) The importance of the long view of things; a short-view perspective leads to too much fragility.5) The mutual importance of risk-averse conservatism and risk-loving radicalism as coeval paths.Most importantly, the book is fun, daring, obscene, ugly, egotistical, important, crazy, and good. The great lesson is that we don't all need to be Mother Theresa - even terrible people can be right."
281,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"It is not hard to see why Nassim Nicholas Taleb ticks a lot of people off. On top of being heterodox, he's also brash, confrontational, and--by the standards of academic decorum--a barbarian. I love the guy.I'm not sure that I believe everything that he says, but his theories and ideas are fascinating and definitely have merit. What's more--although I wouldn't take personal swipes at people the way he does--I really think he's utterly sincere in his quest for knowledge. That's something that's desperately rare in professional academia, where the incentives make sure we have plenty of provocation and novelty and complexity but tend to leave truth as a neglected concept. And that's the best case scenario.I listened to this book on Audible and took so many notes that my back-of-the-envelope calculation tells me I can reread the entire book in Kindle faster than I can transcribe the notes. (Cursed Google Books won't let me find most of the passages I want to transcribe. Which is obnoxious, since I already own the book in audio and digital format, but not at the right venues. How many times do I have to buy the same book just to be able to search the text? The 21st century still has some things to figure out.)Anyway, I'm going to reread the book and then automatically import the notes into Evernote and then update this review with more info on the actual, you know, content.But the short version? Taleb is an interesting adversary to the complex systems guys at the Santa Fe Institute. They're both tackling real problems (like institutional fragility, which matters a lot when the institutions in question are stock markets and governments) with a genuine 21st century paradigm while almost all of our contemporary policy and political debates are still basically mired in the 19th century. Maybe 20th, on a good day.This stuff matters. I'm just a little worried that we're going to have a lot more avoidable catastrophes (like the Great Recession) before public discourse catches up with the relevant research into complex systems."
282,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10708119-pieter,5,"This book is the third (and hence last) part of Mr Taleb's trilogy, of which the world famous The Black Swan is the second.His thesis is that all in the world is either fragile, robust or antifragile. Volatility harms fragile products/ people/.... (e.g. glass), while robustness is neutral to volatily. But antifragility thrives on risk. Although this may sound contra-intuitive, the author gives loads of examples in many domains. Typically, entrepreneurs are by definition fond of ""opportunities"" (a term preferred to ""problems""). Bureaucrats and managers on the other hand are not only risk adverse, they have no skin in the game. For the latter, there is no incentive to make the right decisions and their bonuses are only focused on the short term.Also in the field of biology, many examples of antifragility are alive. Why use medicins (sleeping pills, antibiotics,...) which are expensive and make the body weak and fragile? Or muscles that are trained in the gym are made stronger by challenging them a little. ""What does not kill you, makes you stronger"", indeed.Mr. Taleb is skeptical when it comes to human hubris. Urbanisation a la Le Corbusier has created alienation and unsafe cities, big states have made the political system unstable and fragile (EU, China, USA) while smaller countries are more robust, even antifragile (Switzerland, Hong Kong,...). A lot of theories in social sciences have been built from trial-and-error and do not come out of the blue.From a philosophical point of view, the author does not agree with Socrates that what one does not know is senseless. He rather believes in the Nietzschean Dionysus, the positive nihilism that favours creative destruction.Politically, I was pleasantly surprised to discover some conservative opinions: ""small is beautiful"", a dislike for the bureaucrats that are risk-adverse, importance of tradition (Lindy-effect).The best book I have read in the last years!"
283,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,5,"Nassim Taleb is cultural Heretic, and I say that with the most respect that I can. It is not easy being a skeptic when not just the masses of so-called 'experts' are against you, but the sheer force of an entire culture. Like the proverbial Emperor's New Clothes, the author calls into question many of the basic assumptions that our modern society today is based on. The ideas of bigger is better, or too-big to fail, or even the responsibility of Government to protect and bail out companies from hardship. He instead advocates that chaos, that stress are not only natural but great for making companies stronger, better and killing off the ones that don't deserve to survive. Capitalism isn't the problem, its when Government gets too involved with it that it becomes so warped and mutated that companies become shielded from natural consequences of bad practices. They are able to run a muck and then have the government come in and clean up behind them.This author hits his thesis so hard he believes Federal governments are unnatural and beyond the scope of human ability to safely utilize. He instead believes in City-States and small businesses, where the damage done from poor leadership are limited and small and not colossal in scale. For example if a city-state fails it would only affect a few thousand people, but if the Federal government fails the effects would be globally catastrophic. His ideas are very intriguing and forces the reader to really think and question almost all basic assumptions especially if they come from the ""Experts"". His tone might come across as arrogant to some, but I find that he needs to adopt such a tone merely because his thesis is so contentious that if he wasn't confident to the point of being cocky so many would simply dismiss him.

Or, on how not to fail at life. Individuals, businesses and entire societies thrive from adaptability cultivated by exposure to survivable stresses and deprivations. Our unprecedented affluence is instead used by most to fortify comfort and predictability, which fosters maladaptive stagnation and decay, as well as vulnerability to large unexpected shocks.I can see myself re-reading this book every year for the rest of my life: finding insights I missed on the last go-round, or uncovering new dimensions of fragility/antifragility in my most recent observations and experiences.This is the best of Taleb's books (so far). Your enjoyment will be amplified by reading his other books beforehand.At this point Taleb has removed all shackling limitations - both financial and psychological - on his ability to live in accordance with his ingenious philosophy. His joy for life is evident on every page. How nice of him to share his secret formula with us."
285,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7109863-aelena,5,"much has already been said and written about this book so I have little to add. I found it a very very interesting read. A book full of new and fresh perspectives. I also liked it especially since it explains so well and confirms and demonstrates certain facts about the world that coincide with my intuitions of how the world works and how common approaches do not usually work in complex systems. Of course, mine are just intuitions from experience, and the author does a great job of explaining very well in words this complexity of systems, hormesis, heuristics, non-linearity, and many other concepts (naive rationalism, the soviet-harvard complext - that was a good one - etc.)that's why I think this should be read by mostly everyone but specially those in the public sector or in decision-making positions. It's good to read things that challenge the placid status quo and ""authorized"" modes of thinking.I also found the challenge and criticism of naive rationalism and the interventionism it justify very entertaining; being a fan of classic liberalism, it's great to see a vindication of autonomy and freedom in system and somebody with a sane mind, claim the need to stop pretending we can control all variables in a complex system (the collapse of the Soviet Union apparently was not enough for many to be convinced that these manipulated systems did not work)"
286,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116469-sebastian-gebski,5,"One of the best (& most influential) books I've read in past few years.I'd put it on the same shelf as ""Thinking fast & slow"", ""Flow"", ""Grit"" or ""The Goal"".Maybe it's just because it so well resonates with my own thoughts & personal epiphanies :)Anyway, this book is sort of natural extension of the most famous Taleb's book: ""The Black Swan"", which was all about very interesting concept, but it failed as a book - it was boring, very repetitive, hardly engaging. Fortunately ""Antifragile"" doesn't repeat the same mistakes: it's much more ""readable"", examples are more much more diverse & author approaches the concept of fragility & anti-fragility from far more ""angles"".It's not perfect of course - sometimes it gets too egocentric, sometimes author dives too deeply in his personal beliefs that are not backed with any hard facts, sometimes he flows a bit too far (e.g. by reaching to examples from mythology ...), but it truly succeeds in MAKING READER THINK. It's not that easy as the topic ain't really very tangible, but for me it really worked well.It may be one of the most important books of the decade (at least)."
287,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"Taleb managed to put me off with his personality - as Rushdie did with his memoir. It's one thing to disagree with the established way of thinking in various fields, but it's quite another thing not only to be utterly contemptuous of many people (Taleb's list is long: economists, bankers, academics, MBAs, doctors, journalists, politicians, bureaucrats, etc.), but also continuously and proudly show off your contempt as a badge of honor. Taleb is cocky in a very unpleasant way. He feels the need to tell us a few times throughout the book about his bodybuilding and how he now looks like a bodyguard and can tell people to fuck off. He tells us that when he goes to a ski resort he feels good knowing that he's richer than those other ""rich farts"" who don't know that he's richer than them! As for the book - Taleb has a few good ideas, but the book is disorganized and long-winded and can get repetitive. "
288,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26287713-johnny,1,"Antifragile had a good start with an interesting idea: Some systems not only can handle random events and still keep going, but they even can improve when badly handled. I heard about this before when someone explained the chaos monkey software that randomly interfered with a complex IT system to improve its fault tolerance. I hoped to learn more about such systems but was badly disappointed.This book is even worse than Fooled by Randomness. Taleb mixes his anecdotes with dropping the names of philosophers and mythical figures. He uses footnotes as if he would write a scientific paper while using every chance he has to explain how stupid academia is and that they haven’t the slightest clue. Except when there is a study that proves one of his many points.My time is to important therefore I dropped this book as Taleb started to analyse TV series after explaining thoroughly the single steps one of his bodyguards does in the gym."
289,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35136404-alexander-ray,5,"This book coalesced vague ideas I'd been exploring since college: rapid iteration as a means of exploring possibilities, increasing the magnitude of variance in order to maximize its benefits, plans where you ""don't have to get it right the first time"".I think there is a lot of good philosophy in here to learn from, especially anyone that can benefit from faster and more feedback.In my work I've found it very applicable both to spacecraft design and software engineering, and I think it applies very generally as well.If you're convinced and are willing to read two books, start with Black Swan, and go immediately to Anti-Fragile -- you'll have a better and firmer grasp of the underlying concepts."

So I dipped in and was not disappointed. And gradually I developed a taste for Taleb's style too. It's fun :)"
291,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11163158-shoaib-nagi,5,"Apart from the highly pompous and self-aggrandizing tone that Taleb maintains throughout the book, he has successfully managed to put forth a lot of revolutionary and intuitive ideas that often run obverse to the orthodox socioeconomic thinking. Time and time again, he uses anecdotes, often personal in nature, to convey these ideas to the layman.Despite the occasional use of certain technical terms, this book is a pretty easy read for those who don't have a background in economics, finance, statistics or political science. As far those who have an interest in aforementioned fields, this book is a must read."

Nassim Taleb challenges the norms of conventional science, psychology, sociology, economics, history and ethics. More than that, he offers very sound alternatives instead.I took the ideas in the book with a grain of salt and definitely will need to re-read the book after a while to digest more.Would've given 5 stars, if the author's tone wouldn't be so annoyingly angry against his opponents."

And it did!Talking about the book itself, looks like that guy consider them the smartest ass in the world and love to talk about him. The idea of antifragility could be explained on 5 pages, I believe, not 424 pages."

Still, 4 stars for having a lot of interesting ideas and opinions, and for being largely consistent in what is said. However, parts of the book were extremely annoying because Taleb has a penchant for generalisation, which I find extremely annoying. "

Taleb helps us look at life in new ways and realize that the best is often encoded in the past, in tried and tested ways.This is not an economics book, though the ideas are derived from probability and risk, but a philosophy book!"
298,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68462976-regis-hattori,5,Sometimes the author spends so much time criticizing others instead of focus on his ideas. Sometimes he is verbose.

299,1400067820,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27893878-neenz-faleafine,5,This book opened my mind and articulated the conflict I've long had with the imbalance of positivity and argument for 'fairness'. Antifragility is a rare leadership value.
