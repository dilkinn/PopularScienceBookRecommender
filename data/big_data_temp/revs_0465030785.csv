My only justification for saying such an outrageous thing is that it doesn’t matter. Folk will go on taking Hofstadter seriously in any case. Nevertheless I have a valid objection which needs to be recorded. Enough, then, of self-referentiality.Hofstadter’s teenage intuition got him started on the idea that there are degrees of souledness in the material world. Atoms (and presumably their constituent parts) have no souls; bacteria have very primitive, that is to say, very small souls; dogs have somewhat bigger souls; and human beings have much larger souls but even among those there is enormous variation and no logical upper limit to size. This of course is not an entirely novel intuition. It was shared by Ancient Greek philosophers, pre-industrial tribal groups, perhaps some Shinto sects, and St. Thomas Aquinas among others.This idea of souledness is of course essentially a moral one. Hofstadter’s explicit intention is to provide a criterion by which he and his fellow human beings can decide how to act - in general the more soul, the more respect should be afforded to its bearer. Incidentally he is also developing a theory of consciousness, which is a correlate of soul. But this is simply wrong. Hofstadter, from the very beginning of his exceptionally discursive argument, presumes that what he is doing is constructing a metric of souledness through which he can estimate the size of soul or degree of consciousness possessed by an entity. This is, of course what scientists, and engineers, and husbands who are putting up curtains usually think they are doing when they measure something, namely determining what length, breadth, volume, color, texture, or other magnitude constitutes some entity of interest. The metric employed depends on the interest one has of course.It is this interest one has, however, and not the molecule, or bridge, or curtain material, which ‘contains’ the result of any measurement. The choice of which metric to employ determines not how much of something is contained in an object but where that object sits in relation to other objects on the metric. The object is a property of the metric; the metric is definitely not a property of the object.This distinction is crucial in light of Hofstadter’s fundamental motivation to provide a criteria for correct behaviour. The choice of metric is THE moral choice. The thing measured has no moral content at all - not people, not events, not inanimate objects. They are considered as moral (or tall, or wide, or disgusting) when we put them on the scale we have chosen. The consequence is that Hofstader’s Strange Loop, the ‘I’ of consciousness, is not some objective entity, a logical ego which can be studied scientifically for its salient characteristics. This Strange Loop is literally a moral construction, a consequence of the very metric of souledness that Hofstader chooses. We, not just human beings but all that exists, have no soul whatsoever until someone like Hofstader, or Plato, or Thomas Aquinas comes along and sets up a criterion for assessing it. Then, hey voila, it’s there. But it’s really not there as well. The mirage that Hofstadter writes about is that the things we measure have the characteristics that we measure. An innocuous self-delusion, except when it’s not. The metric he started with is the Strange Loop, hiding in plain sight, a ninja ego smirking behind his index finger with a Cheshire Cat grin. It was created when Hofstadter said it and someone else heard it. The Strange Loop is not ‘I’, it is ‘We’. And so the Strange Loop exists in that very strange state we call language, being nowhere specific but lurking invisibly everywhere. This gives the Strange Loop the character of quantum uncertainty: it can be experienced and reflected upon, but never at the same time. Just like the metric of souledness, one of its many masks."
1,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444651-david-katzman,3,"I have an interesting perspective on this title because the book I read just before it was The New Earth by Eckhart Tolle, a book grounded in Zen Buddhist philosophy. Tolle declares that the Ego (or thinking mind) is the cause of all the poisons of our civilization and the only hope for us as a species is to embrace awareness and presence and escape the thinking mind that feeds our needs for material possessions, success, achievement, domination, and so on. This book is in fact an entire logician’s analysis of what the “Ego” is, which Hofstadter believes is equivalent to the “I,” the Self, the soul, and consciousness itself. In fact Hofstadter believes the Ego is all there is in us. Tolle would probably say…you may be right that the Ego is a strange loop…but so what? It’s poison; cure it! While Tolle occasionally does fall into new-age batshit, overall his analysis was fairly compelling to me. I would also claim that Hofstadter’s equating consciousness, the “I,” and the “Ego” as all one equivalent thing is nothing more than an assertion.Hofstadter’s essential claim is that the Ego is a strange loop in the mind, and by strange loop he means a feedback loop (or “pattern”) that reflects on itself. Everything in our brain is a symbol, including the symbol of itself. I believe he would say that the Self-symbol is a loop, and the loop is a symbol that is continually reevaluating itself and making slight adjustments to itself. A loop that can observe itself and provide feedback on itself (it’s “self”). We invent this Self-symbol in our minds over our lifetime as it constantly accretes bits of other symbols to it—it provides feedback on itself constantly. I actually agree that this is (possibly) an accurate way to describe much of the Ego. Hofstadter agrees with Buddhism that the Self is an illusion, but he off-handedly says striving to get past the illusion as Buddhism suggests is a pointless, dead-end pursuit.I did not find that Hofstadter compellingly demonstrates that this strange loop is the entirety of consciousness. Awareness and energy or pure presence seem to be aspects of consciousness which are outside the symbol of the Ego. He tries—but doesn’t succeed in my mind—to dispel that there is something else present. In addition, he seems to confuse our mind's symbol of the “I” with what the “I” might really be. The mind is easily fooled after all so, this strange loop might certainly be an illusion. But also there might be something else we can’t sense because we are so easy to fool. I think one of the key flaws in his argument is that he doesn’t delve deeply enough into the “self-reflexivity” he talks about. Since this “self-reflexivity” is the very point when a self-symbol examines itself then that very point may well be the point of the conscious mind. He essentially claims the self is a formula, and life is in fact mechanistic. There is no free-will because all your brain is doing is weighing pros and cons of various choices and whichever internal symbol gets the most checkmarks wins. The brain is an infinitely extensible, malleable computer processor and there is no “free” in will, only the choosing based on our brains weighing various symbols. He starts out sounding non-deterministic but in the end came out pro-deterministic. Thought=computation. In fact, he hasn’t really thought it all through. For example: can’t our brain re-evaluate a symbol’s value by thinking about it? By examining it internally, we can uncheck old boxes and check new ones. So in fact there is a consideration that occurs, a self-reflective change, an awareness that could be called “free.” It’s only action without analysis which is not free (at least within the framework he has set up.) This “will” to change is perhaps our moment of freedom.There is something else to this self-reflective loop that Hofstadter doesn’t consider very thoroughly. Godel’s self-reflective mathematical statements are his model for what the Self is, such as “I am unprovable.” The self-reflective quality of Godel’s theories are certainly clever and very brilliant, but where they part ways with the analogy to human consciousness is our ability to change our formula and take a different direction through awareness. Someone actually wrote Godel’s formula, it didn’t burst into existence on its own. The claim that it represents the model for the self is nothing but a claim unbacked by scientific evidence.One key outcome of Hofstadter’s analysis is that the “pattern” of the Self, or consciousness, can be distributed between people…so that a piece of his deceased wife’s consciousness exists in him because they were so intimate and her pattern lives on in him. But the flaw in this argument is so blatant, I can’t believe he doesn’t acknowledge it. If we grant him the premise that the Self is a symbol in the mind that the mind is constantly reinterpreting—then the symbol of “my dead wife” exists in his mind as a symbol of her but that symbol does not provide feedback to itself or reinterpret itself. So her consciousness is not distributed, merely a symbol of her is in his mind. The key difference being that (by his own definition) the Self is a self-reflexive symbol but my symbol of someone else—no matter how detailed it is, no matter how intimate we were—does not provide feedback to itself.He gives us another hypothetical case to reinforce this theory. The story of a man who jumps into what is basically a Star Trek teleporter and is then reintegrated on another planet with every memory, thought, inclination, etc. Is it the same person or a new Self? What if the first person accidentally wasn’t disintegrated but survived? Which of the two would be the “real” man? He concludes that they really both are the real man and thus consciousness can be distributed. What this story lacks is an understanding of how a unique point-of-view makes the self what it is. To me the simple answer is: To other people, these two men will appear in every way the same. But to the individual who is teleported, the experience is not continuous. He simply dies in the first place and is not “reborn”. His consciousness will end and some other person identical to him in every way will be reborn, but his point-of-view of the world will be snuffed out. In the second case, the man who wasn’t disintegrated is the real consciousness while the new one is essentially an insta-clone. It’s not the complicated “grey area” puzzle Hofstadter claims. The clone may think it’s the same person as the previous one because it has the same thoughts and memories, but the man who stepped into the teleporter never had another thought. He died and was replaced by a doppelganger that was convinced it was him in every way. Hofstadter’s vision of distributed consciousness is not compelling.Finally, in his conclusion, Hofstadter tries to bucket all people into two categories (an annoying habit he has): those who believe all things must follow physical laws (which would include those who agree with his theory), and those who believe in Dualism that would declare that there’s magic in that-there brain, a magic soul that gets squirted in at some point. The obvious flaw here is to assume that we have anywhere near a full grasp on what “physical laws” are. Does Quantum Physics “really” reflect what’s going on down there? Or is it just a metaphor for something we don’t understand at all? What about other universes or dimensions in space/time? So, perhaps there is another point to be made that maybe our “self” does follow a physical law that allows it to exist…but we just haven’t found that law yet. Or maybe physical laws are just abstractions and not so “determined” or concrete anyway. And what about the ambiguity and indeterminacy of quantum action itself? Or maybe something completely other is true that we have never even imagined. Oh, and his weighing of “souls” by their level of consciousness is creepy. As well as his odd philosophy of how love of Bach makes you a bigger soul.I Am a Strange Loop is overly-wordy and jammed with a few too many analogies and painful puns, but I enjoyed the intellectual challenge. He truly provides no concrete “reasons to believe” only assertions, which are worth pondering if not agreeing with."
2,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/961119-clay-kallam,2,"I read Douglas Hofstadter”s “Godel, Escher, Bach” long ago – sometime in the early ‘80s, and I remember thinking “I really need to read this again. I liked this book, but there was a lot I think I missed.”When I saw a copy of “I Am a Strange Loop” in a used-book store, and Hofstadter said in the intro it was his update of “Godel, Escher, Bach,” I figured this was my chance to rediscover the concepts in “Godel, Escher, Bach.”Well, I did, but I can’t say I was happy with the result. Hofstadter’s topic in “I Am a Strange Loop” is consciousness, and the concept of the “I” that we all carry around in our heads. And somewhat like Gilbert Ryle and the other black-box philosophers who believe that mental states are unimportant phenomena, and all that matters is physical behavior, Hofstadter concludes that there is no I there at all. Instead, there are just a bunch of competing desires that he says, using one of his many analogies, compete in the brain for votes, and the one with the most votes gets to see that desire translated into action.Hofstadter’s primary point is the problem that’s haunted the mind-body dualists since Descartes: How does a thought or idea get transmitted from the non-corporeal plane of mental activity to the decidedly down-and-dirty mass of blood and bone that is human flesh? Hofstadter claims that the I we believe we have is just a convenient fiction our brains have constructed, and that there’s no way our mental beliefs could be translated into physical action.Of course, Hofstadter’s own theory suffers from the same fundamental problem: How does the winner in the competition between various wishes and desires translate that specific wish and desire into physical action? What is the mechanism that bridges the gap between the world of spirit and the world of flesh?Absent that key connection, Hofstadter’s alternative to our ingrained belief in our own consciousness, and our own ability to make decisions that we then execute, lacks any real advantage. It’s just another theory about mental states, but one that ignores the reality of our belief in our own identity.Which leads to a second argument against Hofstadter’s position that there’s no I there: the evolutionary one. If the I really doesn’t exist, why do we think it does? If we don’t have free will, why did we develop this elaborate mental apparatus that makes us think we do? If free will is an illusion, wouldn’t we as a species be better off applying the resources we spend believing in our ability to choose to something more practical, like running faster, or producing more sperm and eggs, or having a better sense of smell? Why would evolution have allowed this strong sense of our own consciousness to use up so much of our mental energy if it was just a figment of our imagination?Another argument: In the 19th century, there was a great deal of philosophical debate, again going back to Descartes, about the validity of our perceptions about reality. Bishop Berkeley contended that all that existed were ideas, as whatever we perceive is mediated by our brains – and thus even if there were an objective reality, we could have no idea what it was because of the barrier set up by our brain’s interpretation of what our senses transmitted.Logically, there is no real answer to this contention, but pragmatist G.E. Moore finally simply said “This is my hand” – and the idealists, as they were called, cannot deny that the world operates as though our hands are real, and exist.Finally, though I could go on, there’s this question: Does Hofstadter himself believe that he doesn’t make choices? Does he really live his life as though his own identity doesn’t matter, and doesn’t make decisions? Does he go to lunch with the other philosophers who believe our mental states cannot translate into action, and wind up just walking aimlessly until they find a Taco Bell? Or do they act as if they could decide that the local taqueria is a better choice?All that said, I did find parts of “I Am a Strange Loop” well worth reading. Hofstadter’s long explanation of precisely how Kurt Godel demolished the formalist mathematical theories of Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead is fascinating (if sometimes difficult), and there are other segments early in the book that are very engaging.But as the book goes on, Hofstadter’s penchant for unusual analogies and his reductionist philosophy take over, and frankly, left me cold. I read the first 200 pages with interest, but it was a struggle to finish “I Am a Strange Loop.”Oh, and I am now cured of my desire to go back and re-read “Godel, Escher, Bach” – especially since, according to Hofstadter, I don’t really exist at all."
3,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"I’d like to preface the review (which is very long, but if you are vacillating on whether or not to read this book, I hope my review will help you decide to your best interests, whichever those will be. Particularly if you, like me, are decidedly not math-inclined) by saying that I’m a philosophy student. I love philosophy so much it’s disgusting. We’re dating. We moved in together after our third date. We have a wedding registry at Macy’s. So it is with nothing but complete affection that I say many, many, many philosophers- particularly modern, male philosophers- are total fucking assholes who I will happily argue do not possess souls and as such have no business talking about them. But I love their soulless little hearts anyway.Naturally, I head into “I Am A Strange Loop” expecting more of the same. So you can imagine my surprise when, by page 11, I’m aw’ing at Douglas Hofstadter’s warm little animal-loving soul, and later, when he talks about losing his wife- it’s unbelievably touching. So basically consider me fully indoctrinated to the Hofstadter cult of personality. I am fully ready to drink the Kool-Aid. I am THERE. Show me your world, Douglas.And what an interesting world. I read this book as a teaser to convince me I need to read Godel, Escher, Bach. I wanted the motivation to read that, because it’s twice as long as “Loop” is and you need to really commit. Successful! This book is fully readable for anyone who likes thinking about thinking. Contrary to what the other reviewers say, there’s not really that much math. From Page 113 to around 170, there’s some conceptual math he walks you through, but he’s gentle and at least half of that material is anecdotes and analogies, so really you’re look at mayyyybe 20 or 30 pages of actual math and metamathematics. That’s practically a pamphlet, and doable for anyone if you just grit your teeth. But it’s important you read it or the rest of the book will be a waste. That said, I don’t think it’s important for the *idea* the book outlines. Godel’s discovery that Russell & Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica is self-referential (self-reference in math being the very thing Russell & Whitehead were trying to explain away by writing PM) is an analogy for the main idea of the book, and as such, it’s supposed to elucidate the primary idea. It doesn’t, much. There are many other, much shorter analogies (a good number of which Hofstadter also uses) to introduce the idea that consciousness and perception of the “I” are Mobius strip-esque. An analogy to support an idea shouldn’t take up half the book. While the analogy is sound, it’s superfluous, and I think Hofstadter just loves Godel too much to leave him out of anything (Bach, too. And Escher. We’re treated to all three of his heroes in varying doses). Therefore I agree with other reviews which say this book could have been half this size and gotten the same point across, but I disagree that it *should* have been shorter. I’m glad the Godel analogy (and all the rest of the digressions, which are many but pleasant) was included, because I enjoyed learning about it, and I liked reading the book the way it was written.Other notes: Douglas, you are a freak. I would have loved to be your mom because you were obviously the kind of kid you could leave in a house alone for days, like a cat, and come back to find you sitting in the exact same spot you left them staring fixedly at his own hands. I say this because he explains that for Video Voyage II (when he pointed a camera at the TV screen which displayed its feed, creating an infinite feedback loop) he spent twelve hours with his friend just playing with that. Dangling shit in front of the camera to see what would happen. Now, look. That sounds like a fantastic thing to do and I’m going to try it myself when I have the chance. But for an hour. Mayyyyybe two if I’ve had some Adderall or something. But twelve hours? He also names a box of envelopes Epi and carries “her” around for thirty years and counting. He is- perhaps appropriately- loopy. While he clearly recognizes his zaniness, he so obviously doesn’t know the half of it. He’s like what would result if Pee Wee Herman and Hilary Putnam somehow had a baby and dipped it in radioactive ice cream. And I truly mean that as a compliment. What might be my favourite moment of the book is his explanation of Euclid’s proof on the infinitude of prime numbers. WHAT? you gasp, remembering that I said I am so unmathy there are not words to describe it (amusingly, Hofstadter points out somewhere that in saying that, I have described it- “indescribable” is a descriptive word. Ah, loops and paradoxes). But it’s true. In less than a page, he describes this proof, and if you aren’t familiar with it, it’s a “Eureka!” moment like no other. He leads into the proof by saying it’s a crucial life experience like tasting chocolate or hearing music for the first time. At this, I’m scoffing. Sure, Douggie. For a mathfreak like you, sure. But for me, it is just a page to get through before we go back to the fun philosophy. By the end of it, there are stars in my eyes because I’ve just had the most enjoyable math-related experience of my life because, for the first time, it clicked and it was amazing and it was chocolate. It was music. HE WAS RIGHT. Nota bene: it's true this book doesn’t have a lot of brand-new ideas- new to me or new to the world. But it does articulate them in more compelling ways than I’ve personally encountered, and in doing so, convinced me more of their possibility. So in that way it was personally transformative.He gets a lot of criticism for the amount of himself that he puts in the book. There are many personal anecdotes and a lot about the death of his wife. I think that’s important. I think that to write a book on the nature of the “I” for the author to abstract entirely is delusional and as foolhardy as a scientist claiming that science is pure hard fact and doesn’t come with its own set of warping factors and biases. It also, of course, makes for a more readable book, and makes the ideas he defends with those personal stories more convincing. The philosophical world he describes about midway through the book, Twinwirld, was extremely fun to play with. He loves to play with words and he loves corny puns. From “simmballs” to “post partyum decompression” there are many winks to make you smile. I would respectfully but staunchly disagree with interpretations that claim Hofstadter’s take is reductionist. It is not. In no way is he claiming that mental states are irrelevant. Quite the opposite- he is claiming that the body is the least important part of the mind, that the mind can exist outside one body, that in being able to think like someone else, and experience states of mind from or of them, we are them, in a strange way- we don’t carry the most faithful part of them, of course, but we do in some sense have their “soul” (he often uses this word in a non-religious and unromantic way, of course, and really means something more like “essence” or “consciousness”) in part. Because, like a finger waggling in front of a video camera pointed at a screen showing its own feed, souls are strange loops- one small alteration will be played back eternally, and human interaction creates many such alterations, and so just as the finger will exist on those video screens in an infinite loop (infinite so long as the camera and screen hold out without breaking or being moved, obviously) long after the finger is gone (even, in fact, if the owner of the finger is dead and rotted away), and in that way the finger is preserved, sort of, just so a person’s consciousness, when it becomes intertwined with the loops of others’ consciousness, may well be said to endure in some sense after they are dead. "
4,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532590-zach,2,"I didn’t like this book, although I agree with almost all of its assertions. Conceptually, I guess you could say, I enjoyed it, but the presentation - the language of the author, the over-long format, and the strange mixture of hard math and elementary philosophy - diminished and diluted the content to the point that it was barely worth reading. The first problem is Hofstadter’s “aww shucks” Uncle Fluffy writing style. His language is so steeped in a fireside chat mentality that the meat of his ideas is completely devoured by his good-natured cleverness. He is kind of a dork (I mean that as uninsultingly as possible) and it shows. Despite his obvious grasp of a difficult subject, I can’t imagine conversing with him about it. His anecdotal asides alone are enough to trigger the gag reflex. The book is written as if he is more worried about getting the reader to like him than he is about clarity in the presentation and defense of his thesis (which, I must assert again, is a marvelous thesis, indeed).What was already to me a shaky book collapses completely in the final few chapters, when Hofstadter devotes a significant portion of his efforts to refuting only tangentially related philosophical claims. In particular, his analysis of the “inverted spectrum” is not only extraneous but outright wrong. His grasp of the philosophical arguments is lacking, and he spends most of a chapter refuting thought experiments with the laws of physics. It is frustrating for an author who has been delving into abstraction for 400 pages to suddenly attack others for their abstractions. While I’m not versed in the particular philosophers he is addressing (and I don’t think he addresses anything with thoroughness), I know enough of the concept to realize immediately the fallacy of his argument. His conclusions are irrelevant because they operate within a field of study separate from the one in question. Not only that, he is mistaken on a number of his assumptions, including the foundation of his argument – that physical external stimuli cause the same internal neural reaction. The quickest way to refute this claim is with dyslexia, where a concrete word, number or shape is viewed completely differently by a dyslexic brain as compared to a normal brain. He assumes a universal nature for thought, which proven wrong quite simply, and on the abstract level the actual nature of thought is irrelevant for philosophical musings. His mixing of physics and metaphysics, especially in an important part of his book, so near the end, shattered for me much of his credibility, mainly because it is presented in the context of a petty attack against ideas he doesn’t “like.”My long refutation of this single point of Hofstadter’s should not imply that I liked the book up to this point. I was disappointed from the beginning it. It seemed like his arguments could have been made much more clearly in a shorter work and if he toned down his personality. The density of “revelations” in this book is too low for it to be worth reading."
5,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1014389-craig,1,"The purpose of this book is to explain the mystery of consciousness. He admits off the top that the concept of the mind and conscious thought is quite difficult to nail down, and probably impossible to draw a distinct line upon. Is a mosquito conscious? After all, it, like us, seems to have a will to live, and responds to environmental stimuli in ways that benefit itself. If not a mosquito, is a bee conscious? A fish? A snake? A dog?He does so by describing the mind's process of something like ""infinite reflexivity"". Whereas a mosquito probably only responds in very predictable and determined ways to stimulus, higher order life ""reflects"" on stimuli in increasing complicated and diverse ways. His epiphany came back in the 70's when he took a video camera and began shooting it directly at the TV monitor which itself was displaying the video feed, thus showing an infinite number of reflections which gradually fade to a single point. The point, I suppose, is that because of the depth and arbitrary complexity of human thought, it is difficult to define in discrete terms, although this fact does not make it any less grounded in purely scientific and reasonable terms. Perhaps the thing I learned most from this book is that consciousness can perhaps only be understood by analogy, not by a direct understanding of the physiology or via mechanical terms.The fact that he spent nearly 200 page trying to develop this metaphor, and providing multiple anecdotes illustrating the concept of the infinite and circular suggests to me that he really has no idea what consciousness is. He tries to keep his discussion purely on mathematical and scientific terms. It's clear he falls into the camp of those who believe the mind and soul are no more than complicated atomic and molecular interactions, and is doing his part to further the quest for the Holy Grail of atheists: explaining humanity in purely godless terms.The problem is that if consciousness and brain function (if that is really the essence of humanity) were truly understood, scientists should be able to program it into a computer. So far, the only noticeable advances in the field of AI have only been virtual magic tricks -- in part researchers can get computers to seem to ""think"" like humans (as in Deep Blue's chess victories over Garry Kasparov) for specific tasks, but such simulations only work for the specific applications for which they were programmed. This isn't really AI -- they're just essentially complicated math solutions. There has been no AI which has successfully modeled the brain and human intelligence, which can respond to abstract and arbitrary input and truly ""learn"". Aside from the author's utter failure to explain the essence of consciousness (I mean, really, how could you in < 400 pages?), he shows himself to be quite the arrogant scholarly type, with contempt towards those living outside his bubble. Himself a strict vegetarian for many years, he suggests meat eaters are less human than he is, because they seem not to be bothered by eating that which once represented a conscious and semi-sentient being. He even uses such eating habits to establish his own numerical scale of human consciousness -- essentially the less meat you eat, the more human you are. Um, okkk..."
6,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7619789-leo-robertson,4,"The parts I liked were great, were what literature is for, really. Intellectual musings based on personal experience. Fascinating to hear about Hofstadter going through the loss of his wife. Easier to understand than Godel, Escher, Bach, especially if you read that one first.It is so awesome that Hofstadter is celebrated for/is allowed to/has made a career out of following the conclusions of his passions, making previously unforeseen connections. Ultimately I think it's an empty meditation, but a beautiful one all the same. Every now and then, we humans, despite knowing we won't come to any definite conclusion, need to sit back and wonder what it all means, in a new way each time. Hofstadter provides one of these ways. It was so cool to hear him unashamedly demonstrate his passions for the rigorous and logical study of mathematics and then discuss the definition of a soul and how we live in many people, live on in others to some extent, that this offers some consolation when people pass.It reminded me of something I was thinking hard about last year. It's no secret that I love DFW's book Oblivion—many of my reviews attest to that. Anyways, there's a story in it called The Soul is Not a Smithy, referencing the quote in Joyce's Portrait of an Artist...:""Welcome, O life! I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.”DFW is saying, no, you can't do this, that the tragedy of human existence is that we are trapped in our own heads.Since his background was philosophy, he's been trained, I think, to argue for a particular side of a debate even although there isn't enough evidence available in the universe to ever prove it one way or another. So in one respect what DFW is saying is true, but in another, Hofstadter says 'True, but you can't deny the way we live in other people's thoughts, influence their decisions.'I'm very proud to think of myself as a test for my loved ones. It seems despite all my own follies, most people I know respect me way more highly than I think I deserve (this is just a fact, not a boast. Whatever. Why am I defending myself to you? I don't know you, I'm basically writing this for my own understanding and I offer you all these words for free!) Anyways to get the full picture of my own family and friends I often have to ask around and hear things secondhand because whatever someone disapproves of that they're doing, they don't tell me! That's at least the clearest evidence I've ever found that when I'm not around, I have a certain influence in people's heads, that they ask what I would do or think. My boss said that whatever people say about you when you're not around is your reputation. I've done nothing overt to make myself so scary. But if I make people want to be better, I love it.So in conclusion: I believe the soul is a smithy, albeit an imperfect one, because I've seen evidence of it. Sure, I can't prove it, but I'm glad for that, because maybe we were never meant to. Maybe, in the face of existence, we were mercifully left to choose the happier philosophical position. So why wouldn't you?! And should I get hit by a bus today, with these words I am with you now. The only immortality we get is pseudo, but we do get it. And that's pretty damn cool :)"
7,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83769-shawn,1,"i am sorry to give this book one measly star. i am a huge admirer of hofstadter's work. i would fanatically recommend any of his books, which are all fantastic and required reading by this point for all intellectually-minded people interested in ""putting it all together"". i was therefore ecstatic that he should finally publish another book, but crushed upon reading it.the principle point is that though he purports to have some new big answer, this book merely retraces terrain he covered decades ago. it gives us all the same paradigm shifts that he presented throughout his other books, simply collected into one volume and severely abbreviated in scope. it does not put them together. we get no new thinking, no astounding new products of his analytical genius.this book might be great for a first-timer who wants to know what hofstadter's about. but for those of us who've read his prior books and spent years thinking about them and the implications of their concepts, this is a regrettable waste of time.if you haven't read him and you're thinking about reading this, skip it and go straight for ""godel, escher, bach"". you will be profoundly rewarded."
8,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156877-jane,5,"This book, on consciousness and what makes a human an ""I,"" is methodical and exuberant, technical and personal. Reading it was a long, thoughtful journey. It's not an easy book. The workings of the human brain are described metaphorically (and not physiologically), and often those metaphors are mathematical. Sometimes, too, Hofstadter employs playful analogies to show how consciousness works, and how it doesn't work. (He is not a dualist; consciousness arises from physical laws and not from a kind of essence.)You can read summaries of this book elsewhere; I won't write one. What I loved about it was how challenging and yet accessible it is (if you put in the time), and how willing Hofstadter is to make it personal in ways that are really relevant. (That our ability to be friends, to have empathy and affection for others, are aspects of our higher-level consciousness, according to H., is very affirming to me.) He's a scientist, and a brilliant one, but a human, too, and he's frank about his fascination and struggles with the same knowledge.From the epilogue:""The key problem is, it seems to me, that when we try to understand what we are, we humans are doomed, as spiritual creatures in a universe of mere stuff, to eternal puzzlement about our nature. I vividly remember how, as a teen-ager reading about brains, I was forced for the first time in my life to face up to the idea that a human brain, especially my own, must be a physical structure obeying physical law... In a nutshell, our quandary is this. Either we believe that our consciousness is something other than an outcome of physical law, or we believe it is an outcome of physical law--but making either choice leads us to disturbing, perhaps even unacceptable, consequences"" (357).This book unfolds in layers of concepts and insight. H. builds his argument gracefully. His attention to a reader like me, studying consciousness for first time, is thoughtful and steady. Not easy stuff, he makes learning (one model of) it possible.p.s. Buddhists, beware. He admires the ""noble goal"" (295), yet dismisses the possibility that the self can be dismantled."
9,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/584321-kristopher,1,"After about 200 pages of reading I still was unsure what the point was supposed to be. Hoffstadter purportedly explores the nature of self-reference and consciousness, but instead, I think, spends more time pointing out through his writing how clever he is, how feeble he considers Bertrand Russell, and how much of a fan boy he (Hoffstadter) is of Godel. It's not at all clear to me that this book has any genuine insights to offer, but that may be that it is lost on me as I find his writing style clear, but amateurish... It is difficult to get into the book for the following reasons: (a) he subdivides each chapter into 10-20 sections, each with it's own header--this serves to state what he is about to tell you, but in far fewer words, and in a way that illustrates his wit (we get it, you're very clever); it also makes reading it difficult to maintain because it breaks up the flow of the read... (b) he spends far too much time explaining extravagant thought experiments that are meant to clarify concepts that are already pretty clear... (c) he spends much of the book making one of the most impressive feats of 20th century logic (Principia Mathematica) sound like the musings of a feeble old lunatic... and (d) he does not really ever say anything. These things together make the book uninteresting and no fun to read. "
10,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert,3,"This is merely a re-hash of Hofstadter's justly famous Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, with some ideas from Le Ton Beau de Marot thrown in but most of the fun stuff taken out; if you've read those, you don't need to read this. If you've only read GEB, then read this instead of Le Ton Beau de Marot unless you have a particular interest in the art/skill of translation.This isn't a bad book, apart from the constant use of reference to the ""dear reader"", it's just redundant because of the above and not nearly as much fun as GEB.Here's what it's about: minds - specifically what they are/where they come from. Hofstadter's thesis is very plausible to me, despite my disagreeing with some specific things he says. It seems like it might be scientifically testable, too. My beef with Hofstadter is that his research does not seem focused on testing what seems to be the crux axiom of his theory. I'm not sure off the top of my head to do it but Hofstadter has had since some time in the 1970s to think of a way...maybe it isn't testable after all, but if it isn't then it's just a waste of time and money.Also Hofstadter HATES mosquitos because they bite him and I think that he subconsciously believes they have no minds simply because of this!"
11,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/668409-claus,2,"I read Hofstadter's ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"" many years ago and was completely taken aback by the author's brilliant style and insight.I read Hofstadter's ""Metamagical Themas"" many years ago and was fascinated by the author's vast area of expertise.I read Hofstadter's ""Le Ton Beau de Marot"" a few years ago and was amazed by the author's enormous knowledge.I just finished Hofstadter's ""I Am a Strange Loop"" and was thoroughly disappointed.The author uses 300+ pages to say something that could just as easily have been said in 100. This means that he repeats himself over and over again. And he doesn't really get to the point until about 50 pages before the end. Finally, I find his point (""consciousness is a hallucination hallucinated by a hallucination"") useless and downright wrong.Waste your time on something else."

13,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,3,"There really is no valid reason I could recommend this book. It would be the rare reader who is interested in this topic who hasn’t read about all the classical Philosophy of Mind thought experiments presented throughout this book, and I really would have to ask any such reader: ‘what did you learn about consciousness that you didn’t already know and is meaning about meaning really that elusive to you?”. After Godel the firm foundation of mathematics as an absolute truth about knowledge outside ourselves has been seen as a chimera. Logic will only preserve truth and never creates truth outside of itself and within its own logical system needs set theory to get from the rules of thought to mathematics and by doing that you will have incompleteness and won’t be able to prove consistency. Anytime you have a system with rules a statement about the rules, a meta-statement can be made about those rules and that will lead to a recursive, self-referential, existence of a ‘strange loop’, or as in the case for being human, the ‘I’.The author invokes Bertrand Russell and Principia Mathematica frequently. The single most tone deaf introduction I have ever read was Russell’s for Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Russell didn’t quite comprehend that Wittgenstein eviscerates his (and Whitehead’s) ‘firm foundations’ for mathematics through grammar and tone deafly condescendingly patronizes Wittgenstein’s understanding of the absolute foundation of mathematical certainty. There is a reason why the trivium for the seven liberal arts consists of grammar, logic and rhetoric. Wittgenstein uses grammar to demonstrate the strange loop we live in, Godel comes along a few years later and uses logic to show the strange loop and Hofstadter uses Godel’s Incompleteness with rhetorical finesse. I don’t think Hofstadter mentions Wittgenstein (if he does, it was only in passing) at all in this book and that to me seems an oversight given the similar story both rhetorically tell, one through grammar the other through logic. The author does move around a lot in the story telling and will tend to conflate ‘I’ with ‘self aware’ with ‘consciousnesses or ‘conscience’ or ‘thinking’ or other such labels. He definitely has an ‘intentionality’ way ingrained in his methodology such that thought is always ‘about something’ such as about our hope, fears, desires or wants and gives predominance to the ‘why’ of our thought over the ‘what’ was done. He’ll make ‘Being’ as thinking as in ‘I think, therefore I am’, the cogito is really saying thinking=being (that is being is not becoming, nor knowledge, nor truth, nor striving (conatus), nor will, nor will to power, but thinking), the author will make it an implied ‘we’ for the ‘I’ and therefore his cogito would be ‘we think, therefore we are’ because ‘I’ is a label for the ‘we’ that comes about through our strange loop within us. (The author says he’s not a dualist, but he does lapse into that pattern from time to time). What he is trying to get at overall requires various discussions on free will, identity, qualia, zombies, and Star Trek transporters and he makes multiple forays into those overly familiar Philosophy of Mind topics. Gadamer in ‘Truth and Method’ said, ""All understanding is interpretation. Being that can be understood is language"". Gadamer is the last of the phenomenologist and hence he too would have an intentionalist stance and would think that thought (consciousness) is always about something such as our hope, fears, desires, or wants. Gadamer’s quote is another way of saying we are a strange loop. Hofstadter and Gadamer accept free will as a given, but I tend to agree with Hume and Schopenhauer who both would say that we understand our desire but we don’t control the desires of our desires it just happens through our experiences and through a long series of cause and effects; understanding that we are a strange loop doesn’t change that we are captive creatures of all of our previous environments, our present presence and our expectations for the future which are filtered and weighted by our past experiences and previous environments (see, we are a strange loop!) . Our ‘I’ that we have is a label that we put onto ourselves in order get a handle on how to deal with the outside world. It’s an illusion. (I tend to agree with that, and that is the author’s thrust too). He’ll conflate the consciousness with the ‘I’. The one thing with certainty one knows about ‘consciousness’ is that it can’t be an illusion since the definition of illusion needs a consciousness in order to exist, see ‘The Darker the Night, the Brighter the Stars: A Neuropsychologist's Odyssey through Consciousness’ by Broks. That book is better than this book in almost every way. Both books authors are dealing with a loss of a loved one and are searching for meaning and the meta-meaning that automatically generates from any system that has meaning (we are always in a strange loop referencing recursively leading to a paradox of existence or in other words what Kierkegaard said, ‘Irony is jealous of authenticity’. It’s well worth reading Kierkegaard just for being able to unpack what he meant by that statement). I think Hegel in ‘Phenomenology of Mind’ understands the strange loop that is within our own minds, between me and another, and between us and them, then the author was able to explain in this book. Hegel has a beautiful philosophical dialectic giving existence to the self through the acceptance of the other and the negation of that acceptance and so on with us and between us and within our nation as a whole. This author through his methodology reaches similar conclusions (except for the national part) by leveraging off of his mostly one dimensional strange loop formulation. It seems to me Hegel explains our strange loop with more pizzazz, but obviously by not appealing to Godel. Wittgenstein doesn’t have the mathematical logic but he does have the grammar and his core belief is we live in a strange loop such that the ‘finite will never understand the infinite’ and our labels we assign are at most part of our language games and ‘the world is made up of facts’ through our experiences of the world (the second line in the Tractatus is ‘The world is the totality of facts, not of things.’). I don’t think one lives on within us when one dies as the author says. I think when one dies one is dead. Symbols of another that float in our minds as representations of an idea are just that, ‘symbols in our own mind’, calling them symbols or part of a strange loop don’t make them real outside of our own mind. Also, I think there is always a gap between humans such that no matter how close we try to get to another we can never be thought of as one (no matter how many twin thought experiments are told such as by this author) because that is part of the human experience and our meaning comes from closing that gap, and our meaning comes from remembering loved ones who have passed on and the gap between anything that is not me is a chasm that only by pretending to know what is true but is not could allow it to be falsely broached; even within myself I never know myself, and the dumbest advice of all is ‘just be yourself’ because the self is just as elusive to ourselves as others would be to ourselves. The author gives existence to the dead and closes the gap within ourselves and between others more than I think is warranted. The author takes a long time to explain what he is getting at and the story is better told elsewhere. The meaning about meaning that Hofstadter tells the reader is universal and is already part of the human experience and is told more succinctly in other books. I don’t dislike this book, Hegel, Wittgenstein, Gadamer, et al. had already demonstrated that ‘I am a strange loop’ using different methodologies, and the Philosophy of Mind standard tropes provided in this book just seem too overly familiar for my taste without adding anything new."
14,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,5,"As reading experiences go, I'd rate this a 4-star book. It's highly repetitive and speculative; its digressions can annoy; it's cutesy (typical DH) in a way that can grate after a while; and it takes repeated pot shots at a towering intellect -- Bertrand Russell -- on whose shoulders the author un(sufficiently)self-acknowledgedly stands. (Goedel, DH's guiding muse, is rightly lionized in this and other DH books; Russell -- standing in for Whitehead as well -- is all but judged a moron for failing to have seen, in the logical edifice he built, what Goedel later saw. There's a whiff of ad hominem in this book that I found distasteful.)All that said, the idea DH develops in this book is so compelling, and so beautifully constructed, that I can only in good conscience award the book and its author 5 stars. In all my reading of the popular literature on theory of mind and consciousness, only a very few books have made me feel as though, reading them, I were seeing a bit of the veil pulled back. DH makes as persuasive a case for a non-dualistic theory of mind, and provides as convincing an account (albeit, a substantially metaphorical one) of what minds do, how selves form, and what it means to perceive as any I have come across. The jury may be out on the validity of the hypotheses and models he sets forth. I for one, however, can't help but think DH (and like-minded theorists) are onto something big. "
15,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1071206-joe,2,"A bit redundant in prose, and just GEB lite when all is said and done. Not really recommended."
16,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122610-jef-sneider,4,"I agree. He is a strange loop. The first third of this book is the Hofstadter that I expected to read - dragging me through a layperson's guide to prime numbers, squares, the Fibonacci series, Principia Mathematica and Bertrand Russell's attempt to banish paradox from mathematics, and finally, Godel's discovery of the ultimate self reflective mathematical string which shattered Russell's dreams. This was tough going, but ultimately worth it for this non-mathematician. Along the way we learned that a young Hofstadter played around with video cameras - daring to point the camera back at the TV screen to create swirling loops, endless corridors and infinite regressions. The Fibonacci series begins somewhat arbitrarily with the numbers 1 and 2. Such a series could start with any 2 numbers, but once it has started, it can go on to infinity. The swirling loops made by the self reflective video camera will only start after a movement is inserted, any movement, and once started maintains the loopy image forever - or until another movement changes it.The connection to consciousness comes through a theory of development and evolution. As brains get bigger and more complex, able to hold more and more images and symbols, a critical mass is reached and consciousness appears. Like the swirling feedback or the Fibonacci series, we don't know how it starts, but once started it is self sustaining and permanent - as long as the physical brain continues to work normally. I can see it, and believe it.Then, like the self reflective numbers and riddles that Hofsatder likes to observe and understand, he tells us about his own life, his wife and family, and the loop widens. I didn't expect this, and as Hofstadter himself worries, it is hard not to think that the sections about his family and the idea that two consciousnesses can share the same brain or many consciousnesses can share many brains, came from his own need to share his suffering, not from a need to teach us anything about consciousness. Yet, he points out that his musings on the subject predated his own personal tragedies.Hofstadter shows his imagination in Godel, Escher, Bach, and he continues to teach with creativity and imagination in this book. He is a wonderful teacher - he got me to understand - oh, how briefly - Godel's ideas and how they translate into the real world, I think! As we learn about his life, his teenage fascination with self reflective images and the meaning of life, his family, his friends, we get a more complete picture of this wonderful teacher.I don't agree with all of his conclusions about the looseness of the connection between brain and consciousness and some of his ideas about symbols and the physical structure of the brain - I don't think that the loop can escape the system in which it is created, but I applaud Hofsatder for his imagination in creating his theories and explaining them, and especially for his courage in bringing himself fully into the loop. I do have a few questions: why doesn't our consciousness reboot when we sleep or wake from a coma? How can we always wake up as the same person? How do we come back to the same loop, not a different one? And what is sleep about anyway? Why do we need to sleep? And why dream?I am a strange loop and so is Douglas Hofstadter, and so, most likely, are you. "
17,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5590114-greg,2,"I'm writing this review as I go along because the book is long. I read GEB in college and liked it, though I suspected that his idea that consciousness is a kind of self-referential loop might not bear close scrutiny. That's why I picked up this book when I saw it.However, my hopes have been lowered within the first few pages when Hofstadter tells the reader that some living things have bigger souls/more valuable souls than others. In particular mosquitoes don't have much of a soul that you could speak of. And for people who haven't read the book, 'soul' doesn't mean the Christian or religious soul, only a kind of cognition and introspection that seems to be uniquely developed in humans (so if you think of humans as having the biggest souls, and define a soul as that human quality of thinking and introspection, then you really are talking about a self-referential loop!) (I'm kidding.)Hofstadter takes it for granted that readers must have some line on the spectrum from humans to rocks where they demarcate those living things with souls we care about from those things that don't have enough of a soul to concern ourselves with. Though the line is kind of arbitrary, it must exist for each person. Even moral vegetarians are killers. After all, plants are living things.But I actually don't agree with the position which I think is setting up the rest of this book, though I'm sure there will be more details coming. I don't actually see much of difference between inanimate and animate things. I don't see human thought as fundamentally different in nature than other physical phenomena such as the orbit of planets or weather, though it's expressed in a different way. I'm not sure that we're necessarily in safe territory if we say that something like a plant doesn't have consciousness. That's a very biased way of looking at things. Isn't it at least possible that things like plants or worms have a kind of consciousness that is very important to them, but which, being so physically different from them, we can't understand? Might we not lead ourselves into error by assuming that human consciousness is the highest attainment yet along a one-dimensional scale running from 'no soul' to 'maximum soul?'-----Starting again because I put it down. I've only gotten as far as I was before, but I had an additional thought, which is that Hofstadter is basically trying in his vegetarianism discussion to evade the moral culpability that one incurs in killing. The vegetarian/vegan solution to this dilemma is to draw a demarcation line between ""conscious things"" and ""unconscious things,"" and rest on the side of eating unconscious things.Not only is this a potentially flawed way of thinking, as I said above, it's also an abdication of responsibility for killing. Although there are myriad good reasons to be vegetarian or vegan, such as environmental and health concerns, the more enlightened position is to recognize that in order for one being to live, others must be constantly dying. Except that plants don't usually kill other beings in order to live. I found it strange that Hofstadter is trying to so hard not to admit this point. One must recognize and come to accept one's responsibility in killing to see life correctly. Those who won't kill a deer would kill dozens of chickens or thousands of plants to get the same nutrition that a single deer supplies. Who eats farmed produce kills beasties large and small by the dozen, chemically, mechanically, and by displacement. One can say ""I'm resting on the right side of my demarcation line"" when one goes vegetarian, but one can only believe it through willful ignorance. Better to draw some other kind of line than a soul-based line, and base it on environmental concerns or cruelty concerns, I think.---End of Chapter 6I don't see why the author is so insistent that we admit that animals don't think like we do. When he's talking about how ideas might be represented by patterns in the brain, I'm on board, But then he keeps mixing in some pretty unconvincing bits about why humans are in a completely different class in symbolic understanding (according to his definition of ""symbol"" as, basically, an idea in the brain).You can take it as a general rule that when someone puts a stake in the ground and says ""this is where humans are different from animals,"" that in short order a bunch animals will be found that infringe upon that boundary. But Hofstadter, probably aware of this phenomenon, wants us not to decide whether a mosquito has ""interiority,"" which is debatable, but to admit that some living things don't and therefore justify his ""soul"" scale.But I can't. This is an oversimplification. He puts the words of someone who objects into the book, saying ""I can't say for sure that a mosquito doesn't have as rich an internal life as I do!"" and concludes that such objections are not sincere. Maybe not, but my objection is that this idea of ""interiority"" is not shown to be the only meaningful expression of consciousness or ""souledness."" Even beings that act almost as simply as computer programs nevertheless try desperately to feed and mate, often to protect their young, and to survive. Is this not a refutation of the idea that small-souled animals are edible? Even if they only have one single goal, to reproduce as much as possible before dying, be it pursued by reflex, cognition, or even (as in plants) by genetic design, it's that very idea that one violates in swatting the mosquito or eating the chicken or pulling out the weed.I tried to find a textual justification for this position wherein he states that, in his estimation, ""interiority"" is the same or largely corollated to soul size. This idea seems to be implicit at this point, but I couldn't find it stated directly. But whether he believes this or not, it's problematic for me, because conflating ""interiority"" with ""soul-size"" is basically begging the question of what things have big souls by defining ""souls"" as essentially the thing that we think humans have the most of, and if he's not making that point, then why all of the animal comparisons and asking the readers to admit that animals don't have souls as big as those of humans? If we took an ant's point of view and tried to define ""souls"" according to the capacities that make ants unique, humans would come out looking poorly, unable to serve their allotted function in the hive or sacrifice themselves unthinkingly when necessary. So what's the significance?And my complaint specifically is why we're being asked to concede the point. It doesn't seem to be necessary for his argument, which I think is going to be that the idea of rich ""interiority"" is essentially a matter of being able to build ideas out of ideas in a self-referential fashion. Does this argument require that we also say that animals without much ""interiority"" are ""small-souled?""---Page 210GEB made such a big impression on me in college, but I think I better not reread it if I want to keep the memories intact. One could make the argument that I'm not qualified to complain about the reasoning going in this book. Fair enough. Hofstadter is a respected academic, and I'm a dingus with a Goodreads account. We both struggled with the ""abstraction wall"" in higher mathematics, but I won't concede to Hofstadter here, because ultimately it was my slapdash proofwriting style that was my downfall, not the ideas themselves. And I challenge anyone to take as many good ideas as I had and make such bad grades out of them. I must have set some kind of record. How do 5 people working together on a proof all agree on the correct approach, and then 4 get 100% and one gets 50%? The one who came up with the idea in the first place? I'm bitter.And I'm bringing all that frustration to this book, because if I made half. as many confusing or unsupported claims as Hofstadter does, they would have told me I had a future in the Business school.But I can't explain it. Obviously Hofstadter is a logically-inclined man of good standing...do his analogies seem so irrelevant to the argument due to a surfeit of simplification? The book is heavily annotated, yet it feels like on most of the claims where I seek citations or explanations, those are the lines where no annotations exist.But stepping back from the level of simms (the murky argumentation and missing citations and overreliance on a handful of rather limited analogies) to the simmbllic level (heh), I'm finding it hard to understand the significance of the argument, which seems to go something like this: the brain is made up of neurons that act at such a low-level that one can't interpret symbolic meaning from them. However, because they have the ability to persistently represent external events, and to manipulate those ""symbols"" in such a way that ideas can accrete to other ideas, where a high-level concept like ""sitcom"" might include ""television"" which includes ""screen"" which includes ""image"", etc, it reaches a threshold where the system is able to conceive of itself in symbolic terms, even though at the symbolic level of thought, there one doesn't observe the individual neurons that physically cause that phnomenon. This self-reference at a more complex level of representation is the eponymous ""strange loop."" As in GEB, he does an 80-page summary of Gödel's proof, which is the inspration for strange loops. But I wonder if Hofstadter, enthusiastic as he is over the idea of self-referencing systems, isn't overstating his point. Gödel's genius was, basically to create a mapping from formal symbol logic to whole numbers so that each statement in B. Russell's logical system corresponded to exactly one whole number. In this way, one could embed statements about statements into the system, not just statements about numbers, because statements about numbers could also be statements about numbers that were standing in for other statements. So you could, in effect, say ""This statement is unprovable"" by making a logical statement about the whole number that uniquely identifies the very statement in question. The details of how to accomplish this are difficult, but the idea is easy. ""This statement is unprovable"" is true because of how it refers to itself. If you can prove it, then it's false. so obviously you can't prove it and it's true.Foundation-shattering as that is for mathematics, I don't really see the significance of the analogy to consciousness, except in that Gödel's proof also applies to all systems sufficiently powerful to define exponents within them. The brain is such a system, but it has so many properties so utterly divergent from formal systems that the analogy is not very instructive. For example, human brains can deduce false ideas starting with true premises because of errors of construction. I wonder if Hofstadter will address this. For example ""Fat is the word for the flubby stuff around the stomach, and fat is also listed as a macronutrient on nutrition labels, so eating fat adds fat to your stomach."" One could earnestly belive this based on the foregoing true statements, but the conclusion is wrong.And for this reason, it strikes me as less significant that a brain can think of itself, because brains clearly have flexibilities that formal systems don't have. Computers don't have opinions or preferences, for example. The surprise of Gödel's proof, for me, is not so much that it can be interpreted as being self-referential, but what it said about logical systems themselves--that they are incomplete. There are truths that can not be proved.What came next is also relevant, and I hope I relate this right. For some time, Gödel's proof was considered a kind of tricky corner case, a ""gotcha"" that could create statements that were unprovable due to their twisty logic, but that non-trivial assertions would have proofs. But Greenblatt? (check on the name) was able to prove that a certain non-trivial theorem was unprovable as well, putting a final bullet in the shiny dome of mathematical completeness. The truth is, nobody knows how many statements are true but unprovable. We just know that such assertions exist. How many famous open questions can never be proved? The response so far has basically been to ignore this inconvenient fact and hope that it's not so inconvenient that people begin to notice.Which is to say that Gödel could conceivably have found an unprovable statement without trickery that would have been even more shattering. The self-reference was a tool, not really the end in itself. It was just a clever mapping.So Hofstadter is here to say...that certain patterns of neurons can be mapped to so-called symbols in the brain, and that there is a mapping of neurons that becomes the concept of the brain itself? It makes sense, assuming that this is really how the brain works, but...was this unexpected? And why does he keep bringing animals into it? He also keeps saying things like there is a scale from small soul, with not much of a strange loop, to a big soul, where the self-concept is rich. But again I fail to see the significance. Is it true that beings that don't reflect on themselves are somehow less important than ones that do? After all, when we kill, it's not really the 'I' of the victim that we're hurting-it's those who survive who valued that thing that we should care about, if the injunction is to not cause pain.I jus really hope at this point that the author doesn't attempt a proof of free will.---End of Chapter 16I realize now what's wrong with this book. Hofstadter doesn't believe his own argument. That's why the arguments are so murky--because they don't quite connect. And he knows they don't quite connect. But he really wishes they did, not only because they're his ideas.It's clear that he was deeply moved not only by the death of his wife, for which reason he would naturally be inclined to believe, like R. Pirsig, that a person is a ""pattern"" that in some way survives their death, but by his love even before her death, which was probably sweeping all logic before it.If it were true that his interest in nested selves predated any emotional perturbation, positive or negative, wouldn't there be more consideration of more germane cases of people who literally switch selves, like multiple personality cases, method actors, or more discussion of authors, as opposed to the couples-first approach? And beyond this, the postscript to chapter 16 should be unnecessary if he knew that his argumentation were solid. Instead of telling us that he had many of the foregoing thoughts prior to his wife's death, he should have said ""Go on, try to poke a hole in this argument if you think I'm crazy.""For completeness, I'll do so now: he's trying to have it two ways by refusing to define ""soul."" He refers to it at times as a kind of metaphor for a real brain pattern, and other times quite plainly in metaphysical sense. He's muddying the issue by on the one hand making an equivalence between a ""soul"" and ""interiority,"" which is the self-concept, the strange loop, and on the other hand invoking ""soul"" as the vital essence of an individual, indefinable but definitely present, what gives a being worth, in Hofstadter's eyes. But these senses of the word ""soul"" are not equivalent. The latter sense is not demonstrated to definitely exist in the first place, nor is it conclusively argued that interiority itself is a meaningful measure from which to judge the ""size"" of a soul. Ultimately, my first complaint keeps wringing true--the whole premise is flawed. If you don't believe in a metaphysical soul like I don't, then the argument collapses to merely an observation that brains can think about themselves, which is not terribly exciting. And if you do believe in a metaphysical soul, you're being asked to tie it directly to how much a being thinks about itself. But this is not an obvious equivalence, I dare say.---Sorry to those people who ""liked"" this review recently, as it was incomplete. An update that I had tried to submit when I finished the book appears not to have saved.I wanted to say that in the end, Hofstadter makes his position on several existential questions clear. He does not believe in free will, which makes sense, and he doesn't believe either in mystical, incorporeal souls. So that means that he and I agree on the basics after all, but it makes much of what went before in the book all the more confusing. I am able to grant him that the overgrown ganglion which is the brain can, at a certain point, conceive of an idea or a ""symbol"" of itself, but since I incorporeal souls don't exist, this is a trivial proposition. The human body, being the only unit associated to each self-aware person, is clearly capable of conceiving of itself, because we all conceive of ourselves.More intriguing is the idea that the capacity for this kind of abstraction is associated with brain complexity, where certain beings with small brains just don't have the neural power to conceive of such an idea. This, I think, is what he meant to illustrate with his insistence that some animals don't have ""souls"" or ""interiority.""But my original complaint still seems relevant to me. If Hofstadter and I both grant that consciousness is a totally physical phenomenon, like lightning striking or sand dunes, then we have to grant that other beings undergoing complex physical processes might be experiencing other kinds of consciousness no less valid than our own. The question, then, becomes why is the ""I"" concept uniquely significant? In what way does it imply a being's worth or dispensability? If there were a creature with no ""I"" concept, whose entire neural network was nothing but pain receptors, and it writhed and screamed at even the slightest touch, would you touch it? Is it a biological machine, only pretending to feel pain? I wouldn't touch it, whether it thinks about itself or not. The ""I"" concept is just something that seems to be uniquely developed in ""higher"" animals, so it's a convenient standard to take up as a measure of worth, because we as humans are sure to come out on top. How things would be different if the standard of worth favored a being like the mosquito. It would be our moral duty to let ourselves be sucked dry then, and swatting would be an unforgivable crime."
18,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/618361-chuck-mccabe,3,"Twenty-eight years ago, Douglas Hofstadter published a book titled ""Goedel, Escher, Bach"" that earned him instant academic renown and a cultlike following. A mathematician friend recommended the book to me, and I tried mightily to read it, keeping at it more because of my admiration for my friend that for the experience of reading the book. It was either too indirect, too intricately argued, or too Germanic for me to follow, and after months of off and on attempts I finally put it aside.So why did I start out to read another Hofstadter book? I have long been interested in the nature and origin or human consciousness and sense of self, and as an irreligious materialist, the traditional explanations offered by our dominant social institutions were unsatisfactory. I bought and read ""I am a strange loop"" because the jacket liner began with the following: ""Can a self, a soul, a consciousness, an 'I' arise out of mere matter? If it cannot, then how can you or I be here? If it can, then how can we understand this baffling emergence?"" I was hooked.My favorite materialist explanation of consciousness comes from Sartre, who says that consciousness arises out of material existence and serves as a presence to the world. The essence of human consciousness is the ability to negate, to say no, to conceive alternatives (l'etre et le neant). But Sartre does not explain in any detail how this consciousness can emerge from material existence. Rather, he develops a psychology that illustrates and supports his fundamental view of human reality.The core of Hofstadter's consciousness (or self, soul, I) is the enormous capacity of the human brain for complex operations, among which are feedback loops that grow in number and sophistication until they enable the human consciousness of self, the emergence of an 'I', and our ability to conceive of or mirror others in our minds. This seems to me to be a satisfying, although not necessarily complete, analysis of the problem of human consciousness in a material universe. Hofstadter's intellectual touchstones lie in mathematics, and particularly number theory; mine are in language, grammar, linguistics.The book's method and organization lead the reader to understand and perhaps accept this huge concept in a way that I again found very frustrating -- often indirect, full of special vocabulary and game-playing, highly personal, idiosyncratic, shifting and evasive, and (I would say) self-indulgent. More difficult, I thought, than it needed to be. The book demands great patience from the reader. I found myself cursing the author for the way he circled and circled around the subject, bringing in every thought he has ever had about consciousness, and relying to a disturbing extent on his personal experience. But I'm going to forgive Hofstadter again because the book has in the end provided me with an enhanced perspective on something that interests me very much. I can also give him credit for having made a case that is certainly unpopular outside of academic circles in these days of established religion and political evangelicalism, and having made it in a way that rises above ad hominem criticism. (Indeed, given the way the book is written, it may be destined to forever fly under the Christian Right's polemical radar.) A critic could of course say that Hofstadter is mistaken in his conclusions, but there can be no doubt about the authenticity and good will of the effort he has made and the undeniability of the ""factual"" evidence he marshalls to support his claims."
19,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970421-fred,2," I've been reading ""I Am A Strange Loop"" by Douglas Hofstadter. The development of his theme is slow, so I read the epilogue to find out if he was coming to anything other than where he seemed to be going. The epilogue seems to be about the same as the first few chapters.  I skipped around the book a little and found this intriguing discussion on page 322 called 'Two Daves.' He presents a mental experiment of two universes, identical in every detail except that universe Q has the stuff of consciousness, and universe Z (zed, zombie) is missing the stuff of consciousness. In both universes Dave talks about his possession of consciousness but in universe Z he is lying without knowing it, (sound familiar?). His next section is titled 'The Nagging Worry that One May Be a Zombie."" This is a promising title but he detours into fluff on this issue and dismisses it.  I would suggest that with careful work, he could learn to observe both universes in his own life and experience. I know I do. I have occasional moments of consciousness that make me aware of the long intervals of unconsciousness that I suffer.  I suspect that Mr. Hofstasdter has not done the experiment, followed the procedures, practiced the practices, that allows one to approach an awareness of the Self. Yet as a scientist he must have the habit of experimental verification of results. Results have no meaning without the formula, procedure, recipe, for generating them. In the index to his book the word 'meditation' is not listed, neither is 'yoga.' On page 297 his characterization of Zen 'They resent words,...' sounds more like someone who read the lab report but didn't bother to do the experiment. I would have been surprised to find Gurdjieff listed in his index. See: www.gurdjieff-legacy.org. I look forward to reading the remainder of the book and perhaps finding a few nuggets of value. But I'm afraid it is too soon to go beyond Ayn Rand's statements of the fundamental axioms of philosophy: Existence exits, and I am conscious. See: www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagen...OK, I finished Hofstatder's book months ago and I have been pondering his ideas. My final conclusion is that his book is more autobiographical than a scholarly or scientific work. I did a cursory review of the field in terms of modern western scientific writing and found several writers who published significantly better works than his on this problem of the ""I."" One key example is :The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness by Antonio Damasio. I haven't finished this book yet, or really I haven't started it, but the result of skimming it is that this book, written 14 years before ""I Am A Strange Loop"" is at a much higher level than H's maudlin rendering of his senile? meanderings about Strange Loops. H should know better than to publish ideas that are half a century out of date. Or if you read Aristotle, perhaps a millennia out of date. But then again, he is a parochial computer scientist. "
20,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/123081-david-gross,2,"I got about three-quarters of the way through and by then it seemed like Hofstadter had completely lost the plot.He makes some bold claims about the nature of consciousness, but he doesn't use his terms and concepts rigorously enough to keep his arguments straight, and he doesn't do much work to back them up anyway.It amounts to listening to some friend who got stoned and had an amazing idea. If that friend happens to be Douglas Hofstadter, it's probably worth your while to stick around for a while, have another hit, and relax in the comfy chair. It ought to be a good ride. But don't expect much more than that.Still there's plenty of thought-provoking stuff in the earlier sections, even if much of it is a retread of material he's covered before (it's been long enough that I was ripe for reruns). While reading, you'll probably pursue some of your own lines of thought, tangent to the ideas he lays down, that are as interesting and fun as the ones he pursues."
21,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,1,"On the face of it, this is an interesting book. The author draws analogies between Godel's incompleteness theorem of mathematical logic and the question of the meaning of identity and consciousness. And on the plus side, at least Hofstadter's discussion of Godel was refreshingly correct technically -- it helps having had some formal mathematical training.But I found his numerous and lengthy discursions to be, for starters, only tangentially and vaguely associated with Godel incompleteness. In my view as a mathematician, the goal of a mathematical author is the pare down all the fluff surrounding a mathematical result to its bare essential -- a simple, compelling and concise demonstration is much more likely to convince. In contrast, one is more likely to come away more confused by the long series. For instance, I am afraid that many social scientists and humanities persons who, after reading this book, will think that they truly know what Godel's theorem is all about. Most likely they will not.And while perhaps some will find the long and length discursions into Hofstadter's personal life (such as the early death of his wife due to cancer) to be enlightening, I don't see that they really add anything to the objective of the book.So overall, I didn't particularly enjoy this one. Better luck next time."
22,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1804559-randolph,4,"Not as dense or rich as Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid and more focused on the ""scientific"" side of things without all the wonderful digressions (you have to read GEB to understand). Still Hofstadter plays enough mind games to make the going entertaining and challenging.Basically an argument for the nature of consciousness that all but proves Descartes' proposition. But Hofstadter presents a pretty convincing argument for his theories on why I think I am I.The one place where he goes out on thin ice is the persistence of ""selves"" after death via the symbols in other peoples' minds. It seems a bit of wishful thinking on Hofstadter's part as he ruminates on his wife's sudden death. Since he doesn't believe in a persistent ""soul"" he yearns for some sort of lifelike afterimage of the departed. It doesn't hold water.My sorry little review gives no idea of the depth or richness of this book. Suffice it to say that I think Hofstadter is on to the nature of consciousness and he presents it in a lively yet challenging way. Anyway, I am a self-referent loop that talks about itself. You gotta read it."
23,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134026-malini-sridharan,1,"The meat of this book, which uses an analogy with Godel's critique of the Principia Mathematica to explain how the concept of an ""I"" might be an emergent phenomenon of self referential loops in the brain, is interesting. I had a lot of issues with the structure of the argument, which was too dependent on the analogy. I think there are much better ways to make this point than by talking about math. Like, I don't know, maybe talking about BIOLOGY. The last hundred pages or so of the book annoyed me so much that I did a lot of skimming. It is basically an argument against dualism through a celebration of how we can still have souls or greatness or whatever even though we are only made of particles. Hofstadter accepts materialism but isn't comfortable in its embrace, so he ends up sounding ridiculous."
24,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2415452-pj,1,This book is the painful rantings of a man suffering a great loss. Not the brilliance I was looking forward to.
25,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1222597-ron,1,"I read Godel, Escher and Bach and Metamagical Themas when I was in college, and was looking forward to a new book from Douglas Hofstadter, but this book was very disappointing. I tried to finish it, and kept reading hoping to finally come up with something redeeming about this book, but in the end I put it down around page 200. Too many thought experiments that I thought sounded just a little to simple, and nothing new if you have already read his two prior books. I also didn't think much of the reasoning that he starts to give about me living on in other people after you are gone. This may make relatives of dead people happy, but I don't believe that it will make people dying feel better. Overall, a very disappointing book."
26,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"The first half of this book goes into some depth concerning Bertrand Russell's and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica, and then the work of Kurt Godel. Hofstadter has an interesting description and point of view about this area. But the later portions of the book become steeped in philosophy, and quite frankly, became a bit boring. On the other hand, I had read his book Godel, Escher, Bach long ago, and found it to be excellent."
27,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33034-brodie,3,"I enjoyed much of Hostetter's account of the ways in which a strictly biological account of cognition fails to grasp the complexities of consciousness and identities. I did find, however, his account of how identity is dispersed and externalized the be somewhat unconvincing, thought not because I disagree with the concept but with his interpretation of the concept. He tries to argue through several chapters that the decentered--""strange loopiness""--of consciousness comes about because cognition is really a series of complex and shifting patterns in the brain, super-imposed on top of micro-level physical processes. Because consciousness forms the substance of identity and consciousness is basically a process of accumulating and recalling patterns, these patterns have no essential connection to the ""wet-ware"" of the brain. Thus the patterns that represent my love for 19th century novels can easily to replicated in another's brain--my wife's for instance--which results in a part of identity having a kind of weak, second order existence in my wife's brain. If I were to die and she were to recall my thoughts and feelings about 19th century novels she would, in a sense, be re-processing my consciousness, as if uploading it like a program (though Hostetter's metaphors are at times less mechanical or technological than this, he seems very comfortable moving between physical and metaphysical tropes for cognition). This rings false to me because who is to say that my wife has truly internalized my actually thought process or even emotive reaction to such an external stimulus. She may think that she has, but how would she really know. Hostetter counters such an objection by bringing up Cartesian dualism, that thinking that we are minds locked inside of bodies conjures up that, to use Zizek's words, spectre that haunts western metaphysics. So, I have no real logical response to this counter-claim, other than his original description of such weak, second-order existences seems intuitively wrong to me. Nonetheless, an interesting read, though sometimes a bit too ""cutesy"" for my taste."
28,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15515752-to-c,3,"Dr. Hofstadter always has an intriguing and playful way to present his thinking. Even the title reflects this. ""I Am a Strange Loop"" should not be taken to mean ""Douglas Hofstadter is a strange loop"". The ""I"" in the title refers to the concept of the ""I"" in all of us. And the book does an excellent job of presenting his views on just how the ""I"" forms in a brain, what kind of hardware may be necessary for an ""I"", what kinds of ""I"" am out there, and on how many brains a single ""I"" may live.He's thought about this for a long, long time and has come up with some rather surprising opinions on the matter. Not of all of which I can bring myself to agree with so YMMV. But it's a delightful tromp on minds thru a fascinating mind. But be warned: the man does enjoy a good pun.Ignore how long it took me to read the book. Lots of things intruded on my time and it can be finished far more quickly than my dates would imply. And it's probably best to do so."
29,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden,5,"This is the best science-related book I've ever read. I'm not being hyperbolic. Right from the start, Hofstadter talks about how it's far better to convey scientific and philosophical truths through analogies than through hard-and-fast data. As soon as he said that, I was so excited. It gets rid of the main problem I've always had with books like these: too much information. Instead, you get a host of parables and stories to convey his ideas (along with Gödel, Parfit, Dennett, and a host of other people's thoughts too) about what identity and consciousness is made of. Does he solve the riddle? No. But he sure knows his way around the territory. Not to mention, the prose in this book is pretty much Nabokovian—eloquent, stacked with puns and wordplay, playful. There are also moments of pathos—when he talks about his late wife—that rival a lot of what I've seen in my favorite memoirs on grief. What's not to like? Really recommend this one highly."
30,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1802502-kevan,5,"In one of Feynman's books he discusses the difference between deep ideas and profound ideas, Character of Physical Law perhaps.Hofstadter is a profound thinker. Some of his explorations such as designing fonts seem just silly at first until you understand that he's exploring micro-puzzles that include deep challenges. His Fluid Analogy stuff contain good examples.If I understand The Strange Loop properly, he's exploring the idea that consciousness if simply an illusion looking at an illusion. Wow!His thinking about the continued existence of his dead wife within his own mind is very thought provoking and I suspect has some merit. A sort of ""Extended Phenotype"" of the mind if that makes any sense.As always with Hofstadter, it's quite easy to miss the point of his thesis as it's tackling one of those questions we simply don't think to ask."
31,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14215559-satya,4,"The molecules constituting the book had managed to get the molecules in my head to get the molecules in my hands to get the molecules in the book, 'I am a strange loop by Douglas Hofstadter'. This reading consumed a good amount of time to get the gist of the self-reference, the 'I'-ness discussed in the book. Half of the book discusses the Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which posits the limitations of the Principia Mathematica, and self-referential loops. In the other half of the book, author argues that there is no such thing as ""I""; and the concept of 'I' is a myth! It's just an hallucination hallucinated by hallucination. And he further adds that, a man can inhabit multiple brains in their careenium/skulls. A very profound and different book to what I have read so far!"
32,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2097050-matthew-sturges,2,"Gave up about 250 pages in. Hofstadter lost me with his meanderings about entwined souls. I kept waiting for him to provide some concrete evidence for what he was talking about, but he just keeps making the same few analogies over and over. I enjoyed the refresher course on Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, and found the idea of Godel's reflexive use of Principia Mathematica as an analogue for self-perception interesting, but in the end I'm afraid I'll never be sold on the notion of self as nothing more than an illusion, however trenchant. Nobody will ever convince me that I don't possess actual free will. Sorry. "

34,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/526331-richard,1,"Hofstadter, I fear, has jumped the shark. More than fifty pages into this book, he had yet to offer an intriguing idea worth pursuing this book fully through. A lot of this feels like pale egocentricism."
35,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh,2,"“Dreary, oh so dreary”, remarks an imaginary sceptical reader at the start of chapter 20 of I Am A Strange Loop, highly unimpressed with the implications of Hofstadter’s stance on the nature of consciousness. I don’t share this imaginary reader’s dismay at Hofstadter’s point of view, but their words do fairly accurately sum up my opinion of Strange Loop as a whole, and hence their appearance at the opening of this review too.When flicking through this book in the shop, I thought it was going to be a dense, perhaps difficult to grasp, but richly rewarding and thought-provoking read that might well change the way I thought not just about myself but also about the world around me. Unfortunately, the first two thirds of it – honestly, that’s no exaggeration – have almost nothing at all to say about consciousness, beyond one or two very meat-and-potatoes little scene-setters; instead, Hofstadter blathers on and on about what he thinks are enlightening analogies to consciousness, such as various forms of feedback and self-referential mathematical formulas, every once in a while teasing you by seeming to be about to finally tackle things head-on, before once again maddeningly invoking yet another analogy or – worse still – going back over something that he already tortured you with for several chapters earlier on. Now, I realise that it’s these analogies and Hofstadter’s approach that make this book unique, and it’s obvious that Hofstadter himself considers these chapters to indeed be talking about consciousness, albeit in a roundabout way, but even leaving aside the subjective question of whether these analogies are at all helpful for understanding the actually pretty straightforward topics the book eeeeevvvvveeeeentually goes on to discuss, I really don’t see how you can justify spending 200+ pages setting the scene. Sure, use your analogies to present things in various different ways in order to cater for the various different means of understanding that the varied brains of your varied readers might have, but please please do so succinctly, and please punctuate your meanderings with sections of real meaty content here and there, so as to also satisfy the cravings of those of us that like things direct and to the point! Lists of twenty or so examples when three or four would suffice are particularly wearisome...Anyway, eventually the book does lift up its skirts and give you a brief flash of the flesh for which you paid your entrance fee, and things do perk up a fair bit then, although only for a little while. The most interesting question pondered is whether people’s brains are able to contain within them not just one consciousness (your “I”), but two, three or however many, if only in part. In a remarkably honest, touching and personal section, Hofstadter talks about his late wife and her death, and how through the closeness of their relationship he gradually incorporated many of her traits and memories into himself, and he posits that this incorporation may have resulted in the partial duplication of her consciousness within his own brain (and that this also happens to you too). This was an idea at which I initially balked, but Hofstadter does argue it pretty convincingly, and he’s fully aware of (and discusses) the points at which it is most difficult to accept as well as what’s required at an anatomical level for it to be true. He doesn’t claim to reach any strong conclusions, he just lays out his thoughts on the matter and hopes that you’ll keep an open mind and perhaps come around to his views to at least some extent. I did come around a little, but he failed to convince me on certain key points. However, I think this is a matter on which ones thoughts might change as one forges stronger relationships throughout one’s life, so I’ll try to remember to consider it again a little further down the line.As I said, that’s the most interesting question pondered in this on-topic final third. I’m afraid a fair amount of the rest of it I found boring and frustrating or else downright aggravating. For example, the twentieth chapter is a fictional conversation between two people, one of whom thinks that there must be something above and beyond simple neuronal activation required for consciousness, and one of whom does not. It’s aimed at people with at least one foot in the first camp, so for readers already standing with both feet squarely in the second it quickly becomes very tedious indeed, as you’re forced to suffer through query after query and response after response in which you’ve absolutely no interest – this is one of the longest chapters in the book, and it certainly feels like it.In another chapter Hofstadter claims to put to bed a couple of objections (“sacred cows”) that philosophers commonly raise to notions of the similarity of different consciousnesses, the first of which is the “problem of the inverted spectrum” – the idea that one person’s sensory input may be inverted in some respect to another person’s, and that this would make them so different that they could never truly know what it’s like to be each other (for example, one person seeing red where the other sees blue). And yes, Hofstadter does go on to address this, but I don’t understand why the inputs must be completely inverted, and not simply significantly different, which is an altogether different kettle of fish. For example, the proportion of cone cells that I have that perceive light of a certain wavelength may differ significantly from the proportion that you have, and this may cause us to perceive colours slightly differently. Perhaps not differently enough to have a substantial effect on our respective consciousnesses, but who knows? Or take taste as another example – my girlfriend absolutely loves sushi, and feels energised and invigorated after eating it, whereas I find it bland and completely unsatisfying. So there are unquestionably degrees of variation between people that, cumulatively, make the way we perceive our worlds as a whole substantially different. For me Hofstadter’s slaying of this “sacred cow” is more a putdown of a straw man, and even if the problem is frequently raised in this form of a total sensory inversion, I would expect a man of Hofstadter’s reasoning ability to do a better job of extrapolating the argument to its more worthwhile alternative.Hofstadter’s style is engaging, but that only compensates for the almost unbelievable lack of directness to a small extent. In the introduction Hofstadter tells us how this book started life as a request for a chapter’s worth of content from the compilers of an anthology, and ended up becoming two chapters of that book and then, eventually, I Am A Strange Loop. Well, I haven’t read that anthology, but I think there probably is about enough real content here for around two very decent chapters of a book much wider in scope, so my advice to you if you’re considering reading Strange Loop is to do a little digging and perhaps give that anthology your attention instead."
36,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"I read Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach in my college days. While I loved the book, looking back I realize that the appreciation was not deep enough. I was impressed by the novelty and surface gloss of his thinking, but I was not yet ready to understand the depth of the book. Then I purchased The Mind's I in the eighties, but never read the whole thing. I browsed through it, and read bits and pieces, but never did a close reading. I think I was finally ready to understand his work when I started reading this book a few weeks ago.Some of the best experience in life is when you nurture some thoughts for a long time, and gradually they take shape in your mind, and then one day you read a book that articulates those same thoughts, but in a more organized way. That was my experience with this book. I have been reading a lot about consciousness for the last few years. They covered a wide spectrum from strong dualist views who are convinced that there is something non-physical about our mind, to people who believe that consciousness is a quantum phenomenon, to people who believe it is an universal field-like thing giving every object a degree of consciousness, and then people who believe that it is a very powerful illusion that is almost impossible to shake off. This book makes a very strong case for the last viewpoint.If you are interested in this topic then I think this book should be in your reading list, irrespective of which point-of-view you currently support, as long as you have kept an open mind about it. The arguments here are very strong. Though, I have to say, at times he takes his analogical methods a little too far, and someone can find holes in the parallel he is drawing between the real problem and the analog. Even in those cases his intelligence and insightfulness come through, and the text remains enjoyable. What he presents here is not a scholarly argument. It is intended for curious readers interested in this deep question, and nudges them towards accepting his view. You may not be convinced, but I'll be surprised if he cannot introduce some serious doubts in your current perspective."
37,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6805662-bhashit-parikh,5,"The arguments for consciousness out of purely physical processes are brilliant, and Hofstadter is so much fun to read. The arguments about consciousness arising out of the strange loops is very fascinating to say the least."

39,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,3,"Douglas Hofstadter is a quirky and entertaining writer, though not as systematic as I would like. He starts off with the interesting insight that the I (or the self, or consciousness) is a strange feedback loop similar to an audio feedback loop or a video feedback loop. Audio feedback takes place when a microphone picks up its own background noise, and then endlessly rebroadcasts it as a screech. Video feedback occurs if a video camera is pointed at the video screen showing what the camera is picking up, thus yielding a similar endless loop.What these phenomena have in common is self-reference, the ability of a machine (or an algorithm or a language or a person) to represent itself. Thus a video screen showing itself showing itself showing itself… is similar to consciousness being aware of itself being aware of itself being aware of itself….Hofstadter goes on to connect these feedback loops with the paradoxes of self-reference important in mathematical history, such as the liar’s paradox. The town liar says that he is lying. If he is lying, he is telling the truth. If he is telling the truth, he is lying. Bertrand Russell developed the Theory of Types so as to prevent self-reference (and paradox) in the foundations of mathematics. But Kurt Godel proved that within Russell’s system there are true statements that cannot be proven, showing that self-referential paradoxes can sneak back in, even when they have been systematically ruled out.Hofstadter’s treatment of Godel’s Proof is one of the best discussions I have seen (and I have read the classic Nagel-Newman introductory text). In a nutshell, Hofstadter points out that a mathematical system as rich as the Russell-Whitehead system can say things about it’s own structure (i.e., be self-referential), even though that has been supposedly ruled out by its own construction rules.What I miss in Hofstadter’s discussion is how the paradoxes of self-reference cast light on consciousness. Hofstadter points out that not all self-reference is paradoxical (there is no truth-teller’s paradox). Self-referential paradoxes in consciousness might be something like Groucho Marx’s joke that he would not belong to a club that would have him as a member. In a more serious vein, self-referential paradox does mirror the human experience of judging (and therefore being different from) oneself.Hofstadter spends a lot of time mourning the premature loss of his wife, and analyzing his sense that she is not completely gone, but lives on in the thought-patterns and self-referential loops that he shared with her. That discussion is touching and personally appealing. Along the way, he wants to argue that consciousness is an illusion, that it is a changing collection of thought-patterns that can be spread over different brains and machines. He argues that he is not the same person that he was the day before, or that he will be the next day, because he is constantly having new experiences and forgetting things.Here I think he goes too far. A person, a self, a consciousness, has a continuity of experience that extends from birth to the present moment, and also envisages the future. This is what it means to be human, to make a single project out of one’s life (thank you, Heidegger), however self-referential that may be. If I am not the same person as my childhood self, then how did I ever grow up?I said I wished Hofstadter were more systematic. Akeel Bilgrami (in Self-Knowledge and Resentment) has gone into much more detail in analyzing how self-reference (or a metalinguistic level of comment) is core to such philosophical concepts as agency, value, intentionality and self-knowledge. Very briefly, to be a moral agent, to value something, to intend something, and to know oneself, all of these core philosophical activities involve not only doing something (which a robot can do), but recognizing that I am doing it. This kind of analysis, to my mind, is extraordinarily fruitful, and what I wish I had seen more of in Hofstadter."
40,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"Hofstadter, who became famous with his 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, now tackles the task of defining the self, “I,” consciousness, and the soul, all of which he sees as the same thing. He approaches the question with both science and philosophy, although the book is more philosophical than scientific.So, what’s the “loop”? He means a feedback loop, like the squeal of a PA system, although he’s more interested in what happens when you point a video camera at its own monitor. What you often get is an image of something that doesn’t really exist—except how can you say it doesn’t exist when you’re looking right at it? The human mind can look at itself, and that, too, can create images of things that “don’t really exist.” Unlike the video setup, though, the human mind can to some degree alter itself based on that image—which in turn can alter what it sees when it next looks at itself.Hofstadter builds on this self-referential feedback loop with forays into mathematics, biology, computer science, brain science, art, music, religion, the work of other philosophers, his own life, and his own and others’ thought experiments. Escher, Bach, and especially Gödel all put in appearances. This isn’t a book that zooms in on one definite answer that renders all others irrelevant. Rather, it gently leads you to think in new ways about “yourself,” which you might never look at again in quite the same way.Hofstadter writes clearly, with creativity, humor, and a unique way of looking at the world. He also makes numerous digressions, which are usually interesting even if not always strictly on point and sometimes too lengthy.He sees no need to invoke nonphysical entities, spirits, or gods to explain self and consciousness, but he also says we’ll never be able to open a human skull and pinpoint the exact brain structure or clump of neurons that house “I.” So, this book isn’t going to please either strict materialists or dogmatic dualists, which is probably a good thing."
41,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Hofstadter presents what strikes me as a convincing philosophical model of a non-dualistic world in which it is unnecessary to divide our experiences into material and spiritual components, or to hold on to the familiar and comforting concept of an immaterial ""soul."" Along the way, the reader is required to jump some pretty formidable hurdles, including a chapter that summarizes Kurt Godel's famous incompleteness theorem. I banged myself up pretty good trying to jump that one (but thanks to some help from a friend, I did attain a certain level of insight).If you are wondering how the ""self"" and ""consciousness"" can be accounted for in relatively materialistic terms, then this book is an excellent starting point. Hofstadter succeeds in presenting his ideas with humor, compassion, and much creativity.Many of the ideas Hofstadter presents in this book are familiar to me because they have materialized out of my own experience. For example: the notion that one personality can overlap with another's (so, in a sense, the dead can temporarily live on in the minds of their friends and loved ones); or the notion that I am not really the same person I was ten years ago (the Ship of Theseus paradox); or the notion of an ""inverted spectrum"" (the question of whether two people see the same ""red,"" or instead actually see different colors but merely call them by the same name?). Hofstadter demolishes the ""inverted spectrum"" thesis with little difficulty. I'll never wonder about that one again! H's conclusions regarding the phenomenon of human consciousness are somewhat tentative, because he's a humble person who is willing to explore opposing points of view and willing to admit that so much remains unknown. Nevertheless, I felt that he succeeded in showing that a materialistic viewpoint is more consistent and plausible than a dualistic viewpoint. Overall, an impressive performance!"
42,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3008879-dominikus,4,"A very personal and insightful book. As a long-time fan of Hofstadter's 'Gödel Escher Bach' I was glad to read this official 'sequel'. Hofstadter professes that he wants to use this book to clarify the points that he tried to make 30 years earlier, especially when it comes to the nature of consciousness. This naturally leads to some repetition: for example, since Gödel's destruction of Principia Mathematica builds his central argument about minds being strange loops, Hofstadter spends some time on that. But fortunately, the whole book is written in a very engaging and entertaining way, so even the more complex parts never feel like a chore.The core idea - spoilers ahead - about consciousness being a phenomenon naturally emerging from the complexity of any symbol processing apparatus is convincingly introduced and explained. Hofstadter's ousting of dualism forces him to arrive at the conclusion that consciousness is an illusion that consciousness plays on itself (in true strange loop fashion) and that ideas like an eternal 'I' or soul could not exist since they would lead to an infinite regress. While he's at killing sacred cows, he also denies the idea of a free will.These somewhat bleak results are loosened by Hofstadter's meditations on the spreading of personalities across minds (so death is more of a fading away than an abrupt ending of a person), ways to measure the size of a soul (hint: empathy is important), and others. Yet, these somewhat meandering chapters also led me to give only four out of five stars. The author takes about half of the book to arrive at the nature of strange loops and dwells long on things that obviously fascinate him but might not be as engaging for the reader. Some editing would have been in order there.Overall, however, this is an important book and Hofstadter was able to convince me of his conclusion when it comes to the nature of consciousness. Every being that feels like having an 'I' should read this."
43,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"A good introduction to Hofstadter's ideas about consciousness, in a considerably shorter package than Godel, Escher, Bach. Hofstadter is at his best in the first half of the book, when he's outlining his idea of the ""strange loop"" and discussing how it connects to his other ideas about the mind. His discussion of Godel and incompleteness is also excellent-- I'd read another book on the same subject, but Hofstadter did a much better job of getting the ideas across. After that, the book goes off on a little bit of a tangent about the degree to which one person's consciousness can spread (at lower levels of resolution and fidelity) to another person's mind. He really believes in the strong form of this idea, which implies that another person's consciousness can run in some degree on a different brain, with all that implies (a sense of interiority, etc.) It's a hard thing to swallow without scientific evidence, and you get the sense that the author might have been unduly influenced in his views by the tragic early death of his wife-- and is engaging in a little bit of wishful philosophizing about her soul's survival. The book returns to form in a rousing deconstruction and refutation of dualism, and concludes nicely with the author applying his ideas to the phenomenons of empathy and friendship. All in all, definitely a nice place to start in your investigation of Philosophy of Mind. "
44,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,3,"I enjoyed reading this foray by Hofstadter into coming to terms with that slippery concept we call 'I'; the style is cheeky, cheerful, very witty (perhaps too witty for some tastes). The subject of this book is elusive and slippery as ever; but it is of interest to anyone trying to grapple with this mercurial subject. Linked with 'I' is the concept of 'self', and by association, 'mind', 'soul', and 'conscience'. Hofstadter masterfully guides us through all the labyrinthian pathways, sometimes playing with us, endlessly punning (perhaps too much so for my taste), yet treats us kindly through the journey. He had many insights to provide, and does not shy away from the paradoxes involved. Nor does he fear to go into some very dense and some quite difficult terrain; but his hand is firm and steady, and he does get you through, even though you might not fully understand every step.Whether he is totally convincing in his conclusions is problematic: and Hofstadter readily acknowledges this. But he feels that what he and we as readers gain from the journey well outweighs any 'negatives' we might feel (they are 'negatives' but only in the sense that it makes us question, perhaps, some of our most cherished sacred cows about ourselves).Whether this is good or bad for you is neither here nor there. Anyone who is intrigued by the idea of who or what ""I"" is [sic] will find this book stimulating and thought-provoking."
45,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537281-ronny,1,"I didn't finish the book.This book is supposedly about consciousness. However, what I read were random ruminations that (at best) briefly connected with the promised subject matter.For instance, near the beginning, the author wrote at length about vegetarianism. Near the end of this section, he briefly segued into the concept of degrees of consciousness, but did not develop it. This was a shame because that would have been interesting and on-topic -- more interesting and on-topic than the vegetarian ruminations that dominated that section.I then started skimming. When I dipped in to read, I encountered more off-topic ruminations.Then I stopped entirely.In and of itself, the book may have been interesting, but the description was deceptive.Maybe the book got on track later on, but that doesn't matter. Going off on a tangent near the beginning is poor writing, and if it alienates the reader early on so s/he doesn't give the book a chance later, that's solely the author's fault.If the book consisted mainly of off-topic ruminations with a quick segue into consciousness, then it's deceptive since the bulk of the book should be about consciousness, not the other way around.Since I got this book for its description (consciousness), I am judging it by that. On that count, it fails."
46,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18930784-me,3,"I've been interested in reading Hofstadter since his name came up as author of Godel, Escher, Bach, as discussed in The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, and I realized that this was same person who edited Godel's Proof which I had earlier read. His name came up again in Gleick's 'The Information: A history, a theory, a flood', so then I set off to read his work.Half-way through, I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars. Really enjoyed the commentary on Godel's proof and the idea of consciousness as a similar ""strange loop"" based on abstract symbol system that can be turned upon itself. However, I think the book become rather repetitive, and a bit ""preachy"" over the second half--less backed by analogy to mathematical and physical structures and perhaps a bit too much about Hofstadter's opinions regarding morality and aesthetics (which I concurred with throughout, but felt somewhat detracted rather than enhanced his thesis). Overall, still a very interesting read and recommended. Other readers may find the book much more powerful or rewarding for the same reasons I found it diluted. I am a strange loop."
47,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11041240-zarathustra-goertzel,4,"87.5% good book.I Am a Strange Loop reads like a comfy fireplace chat with a profoundly warmhearted (""large souled"") man. A Strange Loop is in essence a causal-loop among k abstraction levels (with k > 1).E.g., macro-properties influencing micro-happenings, hich in turn make up the macro-properties.The discussion and build-up of strange loops feels like a glorious Safari journey, including his beloved Gödelian loop. There are fun ideas about how we live in each other, etc. (Which, of course, would become even more fun if something akin to Morphic Resonance were to be the case :'D).To be disappointment, however, Douglas does not consider how people can, in a sense, develop past the ""I"" -- in a sense adding yet more abstraction-level distance to the loopiness ;-)He devotes a mere sentence to the topic. Finally, the discussions of Cartesian Egos, Zombies, and Sacred Cows are fairly lackluster and shallow, with some boiling down to ""I don't understand it, so it's wrong"". Seems he's very good at expositing ideas he understands, but not so much at rebutting others (or even mentally modeling others' weird ideas xD).All in all a fairly enjoyable, easy, insightful read :)"
48,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666609-dusty-rhodes,3,"Hofstadter is a victim of his own influence. The ideas in this book are extensions of the ideas he presented in Godel, Escher, Bach and are still interesting thoughts clearly presented. I am a Strange loop is, however, a far inferior book. Or at least, a book of a different style. Hofstadter has traded in his incredibly complex and beautiful structural sense of humor for cringe-worthy puns.That being said, he's not a novelist. The concepts wrestled with here provide an intriguing lens through which to view what exactly consciousness is. The issue is that the quality of the writing varies just as wildly as the focus. His repetition of concepts without the enlightening playfulness of GEB wears on my strange loop.However, if you enjoyed the *ideas* of Hofstadter, read this. Just be prepared for the decline in concern for the craft of creating the book as a whole. Which is, what elevated GEB in the first place."
49,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5632471-carl,3,"Definitely not as good as the author’s masterpiece “Gödel, Escher, Bach”. The book is a valiant but hopeless attempt to understand human consciousness. Hofstadter loves feedback loops, and thinks that feedback loops in our brains give us the “I” feeling. I wasn’t at all convinced.But the book has a couple of interesting ideas. One is that souls have different sizes. Mature adults have fairly large souls (Albert Schweitzer’s was huge), babies have little souls, dogs smaller yet, and mosquitoes and bacteria have teeny tiny souls.Hofstadter seems a pretty mellow guy, so I was surprised at the edge in his comments about his fellow philosopher John Searle."

53,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2010962-alec-julien,2,"Oh my god, Hofstadter has lost it. I read the first half of this book, forgiving him his blind faith in 1980s computational philosophy of mind, and mildly intrigued by where he seemed to be going. But then... well, I won't give any spoilers here, but I will say that he has apparently been driven mad by grief and is using bad philosophy in order to shore up a ridiculous position that comforts him."

Some of his explorations such as designing fonts seem just silly at first until you understand that he's exploring micro-puzzles that include deep challenges. His Fluid Analogy stuff contain good examples.If I understand The Strange Loop properly, he's exploring the idea that consciousness if simply an illusion looking at an illusion. Wow!His thinking about the continued existence of his dead wife within his own mind is very thought provoking and I suspect has some merit. A sort of ""Extended Phenotype"" of the mind if that makes any sense.As always with Hofstadter, it's quite easy to miss the point of his thesis as it's tackling one of those questions we simply don't think to ask."

This reading consumed a good amount of time to get the gist of the self-reference, the 'I'-ness discussed in the book. Half of the book discusses the Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which posits the limitations of the Principia Mathematica, and self-referential loops. In the other half of the book, author argues that there is no such thing as ""I""; and the concept of 'I' is a myth! It's just an hallucination hallucinated by hallucination.

I don’t share this imaginary reader’s dismay at Hofstadter’s point of view, but their words do fairly accurately sum up my opinion of Strange Loop as a whole, and hence their appearance at the opening of this review too.When flicking through this book in the shop, I thought it was going to be a dense, perhaps difficult to grasp, but richly rewarding and thought-provoking read that might well change the way I thought not just about myself but also about the world around me. Unfortunately, the first two thirds of it – honestly, that’s no exaggeration – have almost nothing at all to say about consciousness, beyond one or two very meat-and-potatoes little scene-setters; instead, Hofstadter blathers on and on about what he thinks are enlightening analogies to consciousness, such as various forms of feedback and self-referential mathematical formulas, every once in a while teasing you by seeming to be about to finally tackle things head-on, before once again maddeningly invoking yet another analogy or – worse still – going back over something that he already tortured you with for several chapters earlier on. Now, I realise that it’s these analogies and Hofstadter’s approach that make this book unique, and it’s obvious that Hofstadter himself considers these chapters to indeed be talking about consciousness, albeit in a roundabout way, but even leaving aside the subjective question of whether these analogies are at all helpful for understanding the actually pretty straightforward topics the book eeeeevvvvveeeeentually goes on to discuss, I really don’t see how you can justify spending 200+ pages setting the scene. Sure, use your analogies to present things in various different ways in order to cater for the various different means of understanding that the varied brains of your varied readers might have, but please please do so succinctly, and please punctuate your meanderings with sections of real meaty content here and there, so as to also satisfy the cravings of those of us that like things direct and to the point! Lists of twenty or so examples when three or four would suffice are particularly wearisome...Anyway, eventually the book does lift up its skirts and give you a brief flash of the flesh for which you paid your entrance fee, and things do perk up a fair bit then, although only for a little while. The most interesting question pondered is whether people’s brains are able to contain within them not just one consciousness (your “I”), but two, three or however many, if only in part. In a remarkably honest, touching and personal section, Hofstadter talks about his late wife and her death, and how through the closeness of their relationship he gradually incorporated many of her traits and memories into himself, and he posits that this incorporation may have resulted in the partial duplication of her consciousness within his own brain (and that this also happens to you too). This was an idea at which I initially balked, but Hofstadter does argue it pretty convincingly, and he’s fully aware of (and discusses) the points at which it is most difficult to accept as well as what’s required at an anatomical level for it to be true. He doesn’t claim to reach any strong conclusions, he just lays out his thoughts on the matter and hopes that you’ll keep an open mind and perhaps come around to his views to at least some extent. I did come around a little, but he failed to convince me on certain key points. However, I think this is a matter on which ones thoughts might change as one forges stronger relationships throughout one’s life, so I’ll try to remember to consider it again a little further down the line.As I said, that’s the most interesting question pondered in this on-topic final third. I’m afraid a fair amount of the rest of it I found boring and frustrating or else downright aggravating. For example, the twentieth chapter is a fictional conversation between two people, one of whom thinks that there must be something above and beyond simple neuronal activation required for consciousness, and one of whom does not. It’s aimed at people with at least one foot in the first camp, so for readers already standing with both feet squarely in the second it quickly becomes very tedious indeed, as you’re forced to suffer through query after query and response after response in which you’ve absolutely no interest – this is one of the longest chapters in the book, and it certainly feels like it.In another chapter Hofstadter claims to put to bed a couple of objections (“sacred cows”) that philosophers commonly raise to notions of the similarity of different consciousnesses, the first of which is the “problem of the inverted spectrum” – the idea that one person’s sensory input may be inverted in some respect to another person’s, and that this would make them so different that they could never truly know what it’s like to be each other (for example, one person seeing red where the other sees blue). And yes, Hofstadter does go on to address this, but I don’t understand why the inputs must be completely inverted, and not simply significantly different, which is an altogether different kettle of fish. For example, the proportion of cone cells that I have that perceive light of a certain wavelength may differ significantly from the proportion that you have, and this may cause us to perceive colours slightly differently. Perhaps not differently enough to have a substantial effect on our respective consciousnesses, but who knows? Or take taste as another example – my girlfriend absolutely loves sushi, and feels energised and invigorated after eating it, whereas I find it bland and completely unsatisfying. So there are unquestionably degrees of variation between people that, cumulatively, make the way we perceive our worlds as a whole substantially different. For me Hofstadter’s slaying of this “sacred cow” is more a putdown of a straw man, and even if the problem is frequently raised in this form of a total sensory inversion, I would expect a man of Hofstadter’s reasoning ability to do a better job of extrapolating the argument to its more worthwhile alternative.Hofstadter’s style is engaging, but that only compensates for the almost unbelievable lack of directness to a small extent. In the introduction Hofstadter tells us how this book started life as a request for a chapter’s worth of content from the compilers of an anthology, and ended up becoming two chapters of that book and then, eventually, I Am A Strange Loop. Well, I haven’t read that anthology, but I think there probably is about enough real content here for around two very decent chapters of a book much wider in scope, so my advice to you if you’re considering reading Strange Loop is to do a little digging and perhaps give that anthology your attention instead."
66,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"I read Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach in my college days. While I loved the book, looking back I realize that the appreciation was not deep enough. I was impressed by the novelty and surface gloss of his thinking, but I was not yet ready to understand the depth of the book. Then I purchased The Mind's I in the eighties, but never read the whole thing. I browsed through it, and read bits and pieces, but never did a close reading. I think I was finally ready to understand his work when I started reading this book a few weeks ago.Some of the best experience in life is when you nurture some thoughts for a long time, and gradually they take shape in your mind, and then one day you read a book that articulates those same thoughts, but in a more organized way. That was my experience with this book. I have been reading a lot about consciousness for the last few years. They covered a wide spectrum from strong dualist views who are convinced that there is something non-physical about our mind, to people who believe that consciousness is a quantum phenomenon, to people who believe it is an universal field-like thing giving every object a degree of consciousness, and then people who believe that it is a very powerful illusion that is almost impossible to shake off. This book makes a very strong case for the last viewpoint.If you are interested in this topic then I think this book should be in your reading list, irrespective of which point-of-view you currently support, as long as you have kept an open mind about it. The arguments here are very strong. Though, I have to say, at times he takes his analogical methods a little too far, and someone can find holes in the parallel he is drawing between the real problem and the analog. Even in those cases his intelligence and insightfulness come through, and the text remains enjoyable. What he presents here is not a scholarly argument. It is intended for curious readers interested in this deep question, and nudges them towards accepting his view. You may not be convinced, but I'll be surprised if he cannot introduce some serious doubts in your current perspective."
67,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6805662-bhashit-parikh,5,"The arguments for consciousness out of purely physical processes are brilliant, and Hofstadter is so much fun to read. The arguments about consciousness arising out of the strange loops is very fascinating to say the least."
68,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24849811-andreea-reads,4,*my brain needs to cool down a bit after this read.
69,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,3,"Douglas Hofstadter is a quirky and entertaining writer, though not as systematic as I would like. He starts off with the interesting insight that the I (or the self, or consciousness) is a strange feedback loop similar to an audio feedback loop or a video feedback loop. Audio feedback takes place when a microphone picks up its own background noise, and then endlessly rebroadcasts it as a screech. Video feedback occurs if a video camera is pointed at the video screen showing what the camera is picking up, thus yielding a similar endless loop.What these phenomena have in common is self-reference, the ability of a machine (or an algorithm or a language or a person) to represent itself. Thus a video screen showing itself showing itself showing itself… is similar to consciousness being aware of itself being aware of itself being aware of itself….Hofstadter goes on to connect these feedback loops with the paradoxes of self-reference important in mathematical history, such as the liar’s paradox. The town liar says that he is lying. If he is lying, he is telling the truth. If he is telling the truth, he is lying. Bertrand Russell developed the Theory of Types so as to prevent self-reference (and paradox) in the foundations of mathematics. But Kurt Godel proved that within Russell’s system there are true statements that cannot be proven, showing that self-referential paradoxes can sneak back in, even when they have been systematically ruled out.Hofstadter’s treatment of Godel’s Proof is one of the best discussions I have seen (and I have read the classic Nagel-Newman introductory text). In a nutshell, Hofstadter points out that a mathematical system as rich as the Russell-Whitehead system can say things about it’s own structure (i.e., be self-referential), even though that has been supposedly ruled out by its own construction rules.What I miss in Hofstadter’s discussion is how the paradoxes of self-reference cast light on consciousness. Hofstadter points out that not all self-reference is paradoxical (there is no truth-teller’s paradox). Self-referential paradoxes in consciousness might be something like Groucho Marx’s joke that he would not belong to a club that would have him as a member. In a more serious vein, self-referential paradox does mirror the human experience of judging (and therefore being different from) oneself.Hofstadter spends a lot of time mourning the premature loss of his wife, and analyzing his sense that she is not completely gone, but lives on in the thought-patterns and self-referential loops that he shared with her. That discussion is touching and personally appealing. Along the way, he wants to argue that consciousness is an illusion, that it is a changing collection of thought-patterns that can be spread over different brains and machines. He argues that he is not the same person that he was the day before, or that he will be the next day, because he is constantly having new experiences and forgetting things.Here I think he goes too far. A person, a self, a consciousness, has a continuity of experience that extends from birth to the present moment, and also envisages the future. This is what it means to be human, to make a single project out of one’s life (thank you, Heidegger), however self-referential that may be. If I am not the same person as my childhood self, then how did I ever grow up?I said I wished Hofstadter were more systematic. Akeel Bilgrami (in Self-Knowledge and Resentment) has gone into much more detail in analyzing how self-reference (or a metalinguistic level of comment) is core to such philosophical concepts as agency, value, intentionality and self-knowledge. Very briefly, to be a moral agent, to value something, to intend something, and to know oneself, all of these core philosophical activities involve not only doing something (which a robot can do), but recognizing that I am doing it. This kind of analysis, to my mind, is extraordinarily fruitful, and what I wish I had seen more of in Hofstadter."
70,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"Hofstadter, who became famous with his 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, now tackles the task of defining the self, “I,” consciousness, and the soul, all of which he sees as the same thing. He approaches the question with both science and philosophy, although the book is more philosophical than scientific.So, what’s the “loop”? He means a feedback loop, like the squeal of a PA system, although he’s more interested in what happens when you point a video camera at its own monitor. What you often get is an image of something that doesn’t really exist—except how can you say it doesn’t exist when you’re looking right at it? The human mind can look at itself, and that, too, can create images of things that “don’t really exist.” Unlike the video setup, though, the human mind can to some degree alter itself based on that image—which in turn can alter what it sees when it next looks at itself.Hofstadter builds on this self-referential feedback loop with forays into mathematics, biology, computer science, brain science, art, music, religion, the work of other philosophers, his own life, and his own and others’ thought experiments. Escher, Bach, and especially Gödel all put in appearances. This isn’t a book that zooms in on one definite answer that renders all others irrelevant. Rather, it gently leads you to think in new ways about “yourself,” which you might never look at again in quite the same way.Hofstadter writes clearly, with creativity, humor, and a unique way of looking at the world. He also makes numerous digressions, which are usually interesting even if not always strictly on point and sometimes too lengthy.He sees no need to invoke nonphysical entities, spirits, or gods to explain self and consciousness, but he also says we’ll never be able to open a human skull and pinpoint the exact brain structure or clump of neurons that house “I.” So, this book isn’t going to please either strict materialists or dogmatic dualists, which is probably a good thing."
71,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Hofstadter presents what strikes me as a convincing philosophical model of a non-dualistic world in which it is unnecessary to divide our experiences into material and spiritual components, or to hold on to the familiar and comforting concept of an immaterial ""soul."" Along the way, the reader is required to jump some pretty formidable hurdles, including a chapter that summarizes Kurt Godel's famous incompleteness theorem. I banged myself up pretty good trying to jump that one (but thanks to some help from a friend, I did attain a certain level of insight).If you are wondering how the ""self"" and ""consciousness"" can be accounted for in relatively materialistic terms, then this book is an excellent starting point. Hofstadter succeeds in presenting his ideas with humor, compassion, and much creativity.Many of the ideas Hofstadter presents in this book are familiar to me because they have materialized out of my own experience. For example: the notion that one personality can overlap with another's (so, in a sense, the dead can temporarily live on in the minds of their friends and loved ones); or the notion that I am not really the same person I was ten years ago (the Ship of Theseus paradox); or the notion of an ""inverted spectrum"" (the question of whether two people see the same ""red,"" or instead actually see different colors but merely call them by the same name?). Hofstadter demolishes the ""inverted spectrum"" thesis with little difficulty. I'll never wonder about that one again! H's conclusions regarding the phenomenon of human consciousness are somewhat tentative, because he's a humble person who is willing to explore opposing points of view and willing to admit that so much remains unknown. Nevertheless, I felt that he succeeded in showing that a materialistic viewpoint is more consistent and plausible than a dualistic viewpoint. Overall, an impressive performance!"
72,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3008879-dominikus,4,"A very personal and insightful book. As a long-time fan of Hofstadter's 'Gödel Escher Bach' I was glad to read this official 'sequel'. Hofstadter professes that he wants to use this book to clarify the points that he tried to make 30 years earlier, especially when it comes to the nature of consciousness. This naturally leads to some repetition: for example, since Gödel's destruction of Principia Mathematica builds his central argument about minds being strange loops, Hofstadter spends some time on that. But fortunately, the whole book is written in a very engaging and entertaining way, so even the more complex parts never feel like a chore.The core idea - spoilers ahead - about consciousness being a phenomenon naturally emerging from the complexity of any symbol processing apparatus is convincingly introduced and explained. Hofstadter's ousting of dualism forces him to arrive at the conclusion that consciousness is an illusion that consciousness plays on itself (in true strange loop fashion) and that ideas like an eternal 'I' or soul could not exist since they would lead to an infinite regress. While he's at killing sacred cows, he also denies the idea of a free will.These somewhat bleak results are loosened by Hofstadter's meditations on the spreading of personalities across minds (so death is more of a fading away than an abrupt ending of a person), ways to measure the size of a soul (hint: empathy is important), and others. Yet, these somewhat meandering chapters also led me to give only four out of five stars. The author takes about half of the book to arrive at the nature of strange loops and dwells long on things that obviously fascinate him but might not be as engaging for the reader. Some editing would have been in order there.Overall, however, this is an important book and Hofstadter was able to convince me of his conclusion when it comes to the nature of consciousness. Every being that feels like having an 'I' should read this."
73,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"A good introduction to Hofstadter's ideas about consciousness, in a considerably shorter package than Godel, Escher, Bach. Hofstadter is at his best in the first half of the book, when he's outlining his idea of the ""strange loop"" and discussing how it connects to his other ideas about the mind. His discussion of Godel and incompleteness is also excellent-- I'd read another book on the same subject, but Hofstadter did a much better job of getting the ideas across. After that, the book goes off on a little bit of a tangent about the degree to which one person's consciousness can spread (at lower levels of resolution and fidelity) to another person's mind. He really believes in the strong form of this idea, which implies that another person's consciousness can run in some degree on a different brain, with all that implies (a sense of interiority, etc.) It's a hard thing to swallow without scientific evidence, and you get the sense that the author might have been unduly influenced in his views by the tragic early death of his wife-- and is engaging in a little bit of wishful philosophizing about her soul's survival. The book returns to form in a rousing deconstruction and refutation of dualism, and concludes nicely with the author applying his ideas to the phenomenons of empathy and friendship. All in all, definitely a nice place to start in your investigation of Philosophy of Mind. "
74,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,3,"I enjoyed reading this foray by Hofstadter into coming to terms with that slippery concept we call 'I'; the style is cheeky, cheerful, very witty (perhaps too witty for some tastes). The subject of this book is elusive and slippery as ever; but it is of interest to anyone trying to grapple with this mercurial subject. Linked with 'I' is the concept of 'self', and by association, 'mind', 'soul', and 'conscience'. Hofstadter masterfully guides us through all the labyrinthian pathways, sometimes playing with us, endlessly punning (perhaps too much so for my taste), yet treats us kindly through the journey. He had many insights to provide, and does not shy away from the paradoxes involved. Nor does he fear to go into some very dense and some quite difficult terrain; but his hand is firm and steady, and he does get you through, even though you might not fully understand every step.Whether he is totally convincing in his conclusions is problematic: and Hofstadter readily acknowledges this. But he feels that what he and we as readers gain from the journey well outweighs any 'negatives' we might feel (they are 'negatives' but only in the sense that it makes us question, perhaps, some of our most cherished sacred cows about ourselves).Whether this is good or bad for you is neither here nor there. Anyone who is intrigued by the idea of who or what ""I"" is [sic] will find this book stimulating and thought-provoking."
75,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537281-ronny,1,"I didn't finish the book.This book is supposedly about consciousness. However, what I read were random ruminations that (at best) briefly connected with the promised subject matter.For instance, near the beginning, the author wrote at length about vegetarianism. Near the end of this section, he briefly segued into the concept of degrees of consciousness, but did not develop it. This was a shame because that would have been interesting and on-topic -- more interesting and on-topic than the vegetarian ruminations that dominated that section.I then started skimming. When I dipped in to read, I encountered more off-topic ruminations.Then I stopped entirely.In and of itself, the book may have been interesting, but the description was deceptive.Maybe the book got on track later on, but that doesn't matter. Going off on a tangent near the beginning is poor writing, and if it alienates the reader early on so s/he doesn't give the book a chance later, that's solely the author's fault.If the book consisted mainly of off-topic ruminations with a quick segue into consciousness, then it's deceptive since the bulk of the book should be about consciousness, not the other way around.Since I got this book for its description (consciousness), I am judging it by that. On that count, it fails."
76,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18930784-me,3,"I've been interested in reading Hofstadter since his name came up as author of Godel, Escher, Bach, as discussed in The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, and I realized that this was same person who edited Godel's Proof which I had earlier read. His name came up again in Gleick's 'The Information: A history, a theory, a flood', so then I set off to read his work.Half-way through, I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars. Really enjoyed the commentary on Godel's proof and the idea of consciousness as a similar ""strange loop"" based on abstract symbol system that can be turned upon itself. However, I think the book become rather repetitive, and a bit ""preachy"" over the second half--less backed by analogy to mathematical and physical structures and perhaps a bit too much about Hofstadter's opinions regarding morality and aesthetics (which I concurred with throughout, but felt somewhat detracted rather than enhanced his thesis). Overall, still a very interesting read and recommended. Other readers may find the book much more powerful or rewarding for the same reasons I found it diluted. I am a strange loop."
77,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11041240-zarathustra-goertzel,4,"87.5% good book.I Am a Strange Loop reads like a comfy fireplace chat with a profoundly warmhearted (""large souled"") man. A Strange Loop is in essence a causal-loop among k abstraction levels (with k > 1).E.g., macro-properties influencing micro-happenings, hich in turn make up the macro-properties.The discussion and build-up of strange loops feels like a glorious Safari journey, including his beloved Gödelian loop. There are fun ideas about how we live in each other, etc. (Which, of course, would become even more fun if something akin to Morphic Resonance were to be the case :'D).To be disappointment, however, Douglas does not consider how people can, in a sense, develop past the ""I"" -- in a sense adding yet more abstraction-level distance to the loopiness ;-)He devotes a mere sentence to the topic. Finally, the discussions of Cartesian Egos, Zombies, and Sacred Cows are fairly lackluster and shallow, with some boiling down to ""I don't understand it, so it's wrong"". Seems he's very good at expositing ideas he understands, but not so much at rebutting others (or even mentally modeling others' weird ideas xD).All in all a fairly enjoyable, easy, insightful read :)"
78,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666609-dusty-rhodes,3,"Hofstadter is a victim of his own influence. The ideas in this book are extensions of the ideas he presented in Godel, Escher, Bach and are still interesting thoughts clearly presented. I am a Strange loop is, however, a far inferior book. Or at least, a book of a different style. Hofstadter has traded in his incredibly complex and beautiful structural sense of humor for cringe-worthy puns.That being said, he's not a novelist. The concepts wrestled with here provide an intriguing lens through which to view what exactly consciousness is. The issue is that the quality of the writing varies just as wildly as the focus. His repetition of concepts without the enlightening playfulness of GEB wears on my strange loop.However, if you enjoyed the *ideas* of Hofstadter, read this. Just be prepared for the decline in concern for the craft of creating the book as a whole. Which is, what elevated GEB in the first place."
79,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5632471-carl,3,"Definitely not as good as the author’s masterpiece “Gödel, Escher, Bach”. The book is a valiant but hopeless attempt to understand human consciousness. Hofstadter loves feedback loops, and thinks that feedback loops in our brains give us the “I” feeling. I wasn’t at all convinced.But the book has a couple of interesting ideas. One is that souls have different sizes. Mature adults have fairly large souls (Albert Schweitzer’s was huge), babies have little souls, dogs smaller yet, and mosquitoes and bacteria have teeny tiny souls.Hofstadter seems a pretty mellow guy, so I was surprised at the edge in his comments about his fellow philosopher John Searle."

I read the first half of this book, forgiving him his blind faith in 1980s computational philosophy of mind, and mildly intrigued by where he seemed to be going. But then... well, I won't give any spoilers here, but I will say that he has apparently been driven mad by grief and is using bad philosophy in order to shore up a ridiculous position that comforts him."

Some of his explorations such as designing fonts seem just silly at first until you understand that he's exploring micro-puzzles that include deep challenges. His Fluid Analogy stuff contain good examples.If I understand The Strange Loop properly, he's exploring the idea that consciousness if simply an illusion looking at an illusion. Wow!His thinking about the continued existence of his dead wife within his own mind is very thought provoking and I suspect has some merit. A sort of ""Extended Phenotype"" of the mind if that makes any sense.As always with Hofstadter, it's quite easy to miss the point of his thesis as it's tackling one of those questions we simply don't think to ask."

Half of the book discusses the Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which posits the limitations of the Principia Mathematica, and self-referential loops. In the other half of the book, author argues that there is no such thing as ""I""; and the concept of 'I' is a myth! It's just an hallucination hallucinated by hallucination.

I don’t share this imaginary reader’s dismay at Hofstadter’s point of view, but their words do fairly accurately sum up my opinion of Strange Loop as a whole, and hence their appearance at the opening of this review too.When flicking through this book in the shop, I thought it was going to be a dense, perhaps difficult to grasp, but richly rewarding and thought-provoking read that might well change the way I thought not just about myself but also about the world around me. Unfortunately, the first two thirds of it – honestly, that’s no exaggeration – have almost nothing at all to say about consciousness, beyond one or two very meat-and-potatoes little scene-setters; instead, Hofstadter blathers on and on about what he thinks are enlightening analogies to consciousness, such as various forms of feedback and self-referential mathematical formulas, every once in a while teasing you by seeming to be about to finally tackle things head-on, before once again maddeningly invoking yet another analogy or – worse still – going back over something that he already tortured you with for several chapters earlier on. Now, I realise that it’s these analogies and Hofstadter’s approach that make this book unique, and it’s obvious that Hofstadter himself considers these chapters to indeed be talking about consciousness, albeit in a roundabout way, but even leaving aside the subjective question of whether these analogies are at all helpful for understanding the actually pretty straightforward topics the book eeeeevvvvveeeeentually goes on to discuss, I really don’t see how you can justify spending 200+ pages setting the scene. Sure, use your analogies to present things in various different ways in order to cater for the various different means of understanding that the varied brains of your varied readers might have, but please please do so succinctly, and please punctuate your meanderings with sections of real meaty content here and there, so as to also satisfy the cravings of those of us that like things direct and to the point! Lists of twenty or so examples when three or four would suffice are particularly wearisome...Anyway, eventually the book does lift up its skirts and give you a brief flash of the flesh for which you paid your entrance fee, and things do perk up a fair bit then, although only for a little while. The most interesting question pondered is whether people’s brains are able to contain within them not just one consciousness (your “I”), but two, three or however many, if only in part. In a remarkably honest, touching and personal section, Hofstadter talks about his late wife and her death, and how through the closeness of their relationship he gradually incorporated many of her traits and memories into himself, and he posits that this incorporation may have resulted in the partial duplication of her consciousness within his own brain (and that this also happens to you too). This was an idea at which I initially balked, but Hofstadter does argue it pretty convincingly, and he’s fully aware of (and discusses) the points at which it is most difficult to accept as well as what’s required at an anatomical level for it to be true. He doesn’t claim to reach any strong conclusions, he just lays out his thoughts on the matter and hopes that you’ll keep an open mind and perhaps come around to his views to at least some extent. I did come around a little, but he failed to convince me on certain key points. However, I think this is a matter on which ones thoughts might change as one forges stronger relationships throughout one’s life, so I’ll try to remember to consider it again a little further down the line.As I said, that’s the most interesting question pondered in this on-topic final third. I’m afraid a fair amount of the rest of it I found boring and frustrating or else downright aggravating. For example, the twentieth chapter is a fictional conversation between two people, one of whom thinks that there must be something above and beyond simple neuronal activation required for consciousness, and one of whom does not. It’s aimed at people with at least one foot in the first camp, so for readers already standing with both feet squarely in the second it quickly becomes very tedious indeed, as you’re forced to suffer through query after query and response after response in which you’ve absolutely no interest – this is one of the longest chapters in the book, and it certainly feels like it.In another chapter Hofstadter claims to put to bed a couple of objections (“sacred cows”) that philosophers commonly raise to notions of the similarity of different consciousnesses, the first of which is the “problem of the inverted spectrum” – the idea that one person’s sensory input may be inverted in some respect to another person’s, and that this would make them so different that they could never truly know what it’s like to be each other (for example, one person seeing red where the other sees blue). And yes, Hofstadter does go on to address this, but I don’t understand why the inputs must be completely inverted, and not simply significantly different, which is an altogether different kettle of fish. For example, the proportion of cone cells that I have that perceive light of a certain wavelength may differ significantly from the proportion that you have, and this may cause us to perceive colours slightly differently. Perhaps not differently enough to have a substantial effect on our respective consciousnesses, but who knows? Or take taste as another example – my girlfriend absolutely loves sushi, and feels energised and invigorated after eating it, whereas I find it bland and completely unsatisfying. So there are unquestionably degrees of variation between people that, cumulatively, make the way we perceive our worlds as a whole substantially different. For me Hofstadter’s slaying of this “sacred cow” is more a putdown of a straw man, and even if the problem is frequently raised in this form of a total sensory inversion, I would expect a man of Hofstadter’s reasoning ability to do a better job of extrapolating the argument to its more worthwhile alternative.Hofstadter’s style is engaging, but that only compensates for the almost unbelievable lack of directness to a small extent. In the introduction Hofstadter tells us how this book started life as a request for a chapter’s worth of content from the compilers of an anthology, and ended up becoming two chapters of that book and then, eventually, I Am A Strange Loop. Well, I haven’t read that anthology, but I think there probably is about enough real content here for around two very decent chapters of a book much wider in scope, so my advice to you if you’re considering reading Strange Loop is to do a little digging and perhaps give that anthology your attention instead."
96,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"I read Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach in my college days. While I loved the book, looking back I realize that the appreciation was not deep enough. I was impressed by the novelty and surface gloss of his thinking, but I was not yet ready to understand the depth of the book. Then I purchased The Mind's I in the eighties, but never read the whole thing. I browsed through it, and read bits and pieces, but never did a close reading. I think I was finally ready to understand his work when I started reading this book a few weeks ago.Some of the best experience in life is when you nurture some thoughts for a long time, and gradually they take shape in your mind, and then one day you read a book that articulates those same thoughts, but in a more organized way. That was my experience with this book. I have been reading a lot about consciousness for the last few years. They covered a wide spectrum from strong dualist views who are convinced that there is something non-physical about our mind, to people who believe that consciousness is a quantum phenomenon, to people who believe it is an universal field-like thing giving every object a degree of consciousness, and then people who believe that it is a very powerful illusion that is almost impossible to shake off. This book makes a very strong case for the last viewpoint.If you are interested in this topic then I think this book should be in your reading list, irrespective of which point-of-view you currently support, as long as you have kept an open mind about it. The arguments here are very strong. Though, I have to say, at times he takes his analogical methods a little too far, and someone can find holes in the parallel he is drawing between the real problem and the analog. Even in those cases his intelligence and insightfulness come through, and the text remains enjoyable. What he presents here is not a scholarly argument. It is intended for curious readers interested in this deep question, and nudges them towards accepting his view. You may not be convinced, but I'll be surprised if he cannot introduce some serious doubts in your current perspective."
97,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6805662-bhashit-parikh,5,"The arguments for consciousness out of purely physical processes are brilliant, and Hofstadter is so much fun to read. The arguments about consciousness arising out of the strange loops is very fascinating to say the least."
98,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24849811-andreea-reads,4,*my brain needs to cool down a bit after this read.
99,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,3,"Douglas Hofstadter is a quirky and entertaining writer, though not as systematic as I would like. He starts off with the interesting insight that the I (or the self, or consciousness) is a strange feedback loop similar to an audio feedback loop or a video feedback loop. Audio feedback takes place when a microphone picks up its own background noise, and then endlessly rebroadcasts it as a screech. Video feedback occurs if a video camera is pointed at the video screen showing what the camera is picking up, thus yielding a similar endless loop.What these phenomena have in common is self-reference, the ability of a machine (or an algorithm or a language or a person) to represent itself. Thus a video screen showing itself showing itself showing itself… is similar to consciousness being aware of itself being aware of itself being aware of itself….Hofstadter goes on to connect these feedback loops with the paradoxes of self-reference important in mathematical history, such as the liar’s paradox. The town liar says that he is lying. If he is lying, he is telling the truth. If he is telling the truth, he is lying. Bertrand Russell developed the Theory of Types so as to prevent self-reference (and paradox) in the foundations of mathematics. But Kurt Godel proved that within Russell’s system there are true statements that cannot be proven, showing that self-referential paradoxes can sneak back in, even when they have been systematically ruled out.Hofstadter’s treatment of Godel’s Proof is one of the best discussions I have seen (and I have read the classic Nagel-Newman introductory text). In a nutshell, Hofstadter points out that a mathematical system as rich as the Russell-Whitehead system can say things about it’s own structure (i.e., be self-referential), even though that has been supposedly ruled out by its own construction rules.What I miss in Hofstadter’s discussion is how the paradoxes of self-reference cast light on consciousness. Hofstadter points out that not all self-reference is paradoxical (there is no truth-teller’s paradox). Self-referential paradoxes in consciousness might be something like Groucho Marx’s joke that he would not belong to a club that would have him as a member. In a more serious vein, self-referential paradox does mirror the human experience of judging (and therefore being different from) oneself.Hofstadter spends a lot of time mourning the premature loss of his wife, and analyzing his sense that she is not completely gone, but lives on in the thought-patterns and self-referential loops that he shared with her. That discussion is touching and personally appealing. Along the way, he wants to argue that consciousness is an illusion, that it is a changing collection of thought-patterns that can be spread over different brains and machines. He argues that he is not the same person that he was the day before, or that he will be the next day, because he is constantly having new experiences and forgetting things.Here I think he goes too far. A person, a self, a consciousness, has a continuity of experience that extends from birth to the present moment, and also envisages the future. This is what it means to be human, to make a single project out of one’s life (thank you, Heidegger), however self-referential that may be. If I am not the same person as my childhood self, then how did I ever grow up?I said I wished Hofstadter were more systematic. Akeel Bilgrami (in Self-Knowledge and Resentment) has gone into much more detail in analyzing how self-reference (or a metalinguistic level of comment) is core to such philosophical concepts as agency, value, intentionality and self-knowledge. Very briefly, to be a moral agent, to value something, to intend something, and to know oneself, all of these core philosophical activities involve not only doing something (which a robot can do), but recognizing that I am doing it. This kind of analysis, to my mind, is extraordinarily fruitful, and what I wish I had seen more of in Hofstadter."
100,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"Hofstadter, who became famous with his 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, now tackles the task of defining the self, “I,” consciousness, and the soul, all of which he sees as the same thing. He approaches the question with both science and philosophy, although the book is more philosophical than scientific.So, what’s the “loop”? He means a feedback loop, like the squeal of a PA system, although he’s more interested in what happens when you point a video camera at its own monitor. What you often get is an image of something that doesn’t really exist—except how can you say it doesn’t exist when you’re looking right at it? The human mind can look at itself, and that, too, can create images of things that “don’t really exist.” Unlike the video setup, though, the human mind can to some degree alter itself based on that image—which in turn can alter what it sees when it next looks at itself.Hofstadter builds on this self-referential feedback loop with forays into mathematics, biology, computer science, brain science, art, music, religion, the work of other philosophers, his own life, and his own and others’ thought experiments. Escher, Bach, and especially Gödel all put in appearances. This isn’t a book that zooms in on one definite answer that renders all others irrelevant. Rather, it gently leads you to think in new ways about “yourself,” which you might never look at again in quite the same way.Hofstadter writes clearly, with creativity, humor, and a unique way of looking at the world. He also makes numerous digressions, which are usually interesting even if not always strictly on point and sometimes too lengthy.He sees no need to invoke nonphysical entities, spirits, or gods to explain self and consciousness, but he also says we’ll never be able to open a human skull and pinpoint the exact brain structure or clump of neurons that house “I.” So, this book isn’t going to please either strict materialists or dogmatic dualists, which is probably a good thing."
101,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Hofstadter presents what strikes me as a convincing philosophical model of a non-dualistic world in which it is unnecessary to divide our experiences into material and spiritual components, or to hold on to the familiar and comforting concept of an immaterial ""soul."" Along the way, the reader is required to jump some pretty formidable hurdles, including a chapter that summarizes Kurt Godel's famous incompleteness theorem. I banged myself up pretty good trying to jump that one (but thanks to some help from a friend, I did attain a certain level of insight).If you are wondering how the ""self"" and ""consciousness"" can be accounted for in relatively materialistic terms, then this book is an excellent starting point. Hofstadter succeeds in presenting his ideas with humor, compassion, and much creativity.Many of the ideas Hofstadter presents in this book are familiar to me because they have materialized out of my own experience. For example: the notion that one personality can overlap with another's (so, in a sense, the dead can temporarily live on in the minds of their friends and loved ones); or the notion that I am not really the same person I was ten years ago (the Ship of Theseus paradox); or the notion of an ""inverted spectrum"" (the question of whether two people see the same ""red,"" or instead actually see different colors but merely call them by the same name?). Hofstadter demolishes the ""inverted spectrum"" thesis with little difficulty. I'll never wonder about that one again! H's conclusions regarding the phenomenon of human consciousness are somewhat tentative, because he's a humble person who is willing to explore opposing points of view and willing to admit that so much remains unknown. Nevertheless, I felt that he succeeded in showing that a materialistic viewpoint is more consistent and plausible than a dualistic viewpoint. Overall, an impressive performance!"
102,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3008879-dominikus,4,"A very personal and insightful book. As a long-time fan of Hofstadter's 'Gödel Escher Bach' I was glad to read this official 'sequel'. Hofstadter professes that he wants to use this book to clarify the points that he tried to make 30 years earlier, especially when it comes to the nature of consciousness. This naturally leads to some repetition: for example, since Gödel's destruction of Principia Mathematica builds his central argument about minds being strange loops, Hofstadter spends some time on that. But fortunately, the whole book is written in a very engaging and entertaining way, so even the more complex parts never feel like a chore.The core idea - spoilers ahead - about consciousness being a phenomenon naturally emerging from the complexity of any symbol processing apparatus is convincingly introduced and explained. Hofstadter's ousting of dualism forces him to arrive at the conclusion that consciousness is an illusion that consciousness plays on itself (in true strange loop fashion) and that ideas like an eternal 'I' or soul could not exist since they would lead to an infinite regress. While he's at killing sacred cows, he also denies the idea of a free will.These somewhat bleak results are loosened by Hofstadter's meditations on the spreading of personalities across minds (so death is more of a fading away than an abrupt ending of a person), ways to measure the size of a soul (hint: empathy is important), and others. Yet, these somewhat meandering chapters also led me to give only four out of five stars. The author takes about half of the book to arrive at the nature of strange loops and dwells long on things that obviously fascinate him but might not be as engaging for the reader. Some editing would have been in order there.Overall, however, this is an important book and Hofstadter was able to convince me of his conclusion when it comes to the nature of consciousness. Every being that feels like having an 'I' should read this."
103,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"A good introduction to Hofstadter's ideas about consciousness, in a considerably shorter package than Godel, Escher, Bach. Hofstadter is at his best in the first half of the book, when he's outlining his idea of the ""strange loop"" and discussing how it connects to his other ideas about the mind. His discussion of Godel and incompleteness is also excellent-- I'd read another book on the same subject, but Hofstadter did a much better job of getting the ideas across. After that, the book goes off on a little bit of a tangent about the degree to which one person's consciousness can spread (at lower levels of resolution and fidelity) to another person's mind. He really believes in the strong form of this idea, which implies that another person's consciousness can run in some degree on a different brain, with all that implies (a sense of interiority, etc.) It's a hard thing to swallow without scientific evidence, and you get the sense that the author might have been unduly influenced in his views by the tragic early death of his wife-- and is engaging in a little bit of wishful philosophizing about her soul's survival. The book returns to form in a rousing deconstruction and refutation of dualism, and concludes nicely with the author applying his ideas to the phenomenons of empathy and friendship. All in all, definitely a nice place to start in your investigation of Philosophy of Mind. "
104,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,3,"I enjoyed reading this foray by Hofstadter into coming to terms with that slippery concept we call 'I'; the style is cheeky, cheerful, very witty (perhaps too witty for some tastes). The subject of this book is elusive and slippery as ever; but it is of interest to anyone trying to grapple with this mercurial subject. Linked with 'I' is the concept of 'self', and by association, 'mind', 'soul', and 'conscience'. Hofstadter masterfully guides us through all the labyrinthian pathways, sometimes playing with us, endlessly punning (perhaps too much so for my taste), yet treats us kindly through the journey. He had many insights to provide, and does not shy away from the paradoxes involved. Nor does he fear to go into some very dense and some quite difficult terrain; but his hand is firm and steady, and he does get you through, even though you might not fully understand every step.Whether he is totally convincing in his conclusions is problematic: and Hofstadter readily acknowledges this. But he feels that what he and we as readers gain from the journey well outweighs any 'negatives' we might feel (they are 'negatives' but only in the sense that it makes us question, perhaps, some of our most cherished sacred cows about ourselves).Whether this is good or bad for you is neither here nor there. Anyone who is intrigued by the idea of who or what ""I"" is [sic] will find this book stimulating and thought-provoking."
105,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537281-ronny,1,"I didn't finish the book.This book is supposedly about consciousness. However, what I read were random ruminations that (at best) briefly connected with the promised subject matter.For instance, near the beginning, the author wrote at length about vegetarianism. Near the end of this section, he briefly segued into the concept of degrees of consciousness, but did not develop it. This was a shame because that would have been interesting and on-topic -- more interesting and on-topic than the vegetarian ruminations that dominated that section.I then started skimming. When I dipped in to read, I encountered more off-topic ruminations.Then I stopped entirely.In and of itself, the book may have been interesting, but the description was deceptive.Maybe the book got on track later on, but that doesn't matter. Going off on a tangent near the beginning is poor writing, and if it alienates the reader early on so s/he doesn't give the book a chance later, that's solely the author's fault.If the book consisted mainly of off-topic ruminations with a quick segue into consciousness, then it's deceptive since the bulk of the book should be about consciousness, not the other way around.Since I got this book for its description (consciousness), I am judging it by that. On that count, it fails."
106,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18930784-me,3,"I've been interested in reading Hofstadter since his name came up as author of Godel, Escher, Bach, as discussed in The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, and I realized that this was same person who edited Godel's Proof which I had earlier read. His name came up again in Gleick's 'The Information: A history, a theory, a flood', so then I set off to read his work.Half-way through, I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars. Really enjoyed the commentary on Godel's proof and the idea of consciousness as a similar ""strange loop"" based on abstract symbol system that can be turned upon itself. However, I think the book become rather repetitive, and a bit ""preachy"" over the second half--less backed by analogy to mathematical and physical structures and perhaps a bit too much about Hofstadter's opinions regarding morality and aesthetics (which I concurred with throughout, but felt somewhat detracted rather than enhanced his thesis). Overall, still a very interesting read and recommended. Other readers may find the book much more powerful or rewarding for the same reasons I found it diluted. I am a strange loop."
107,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11041240-zarathustra-goertzel,4,"87.5% good book.I Am a Strange Loop reads like a comfy fireplace chat with a profoundly warmhearted (""large souled"") man. A Strange Loop is in essence a causal-loop among k abstraction levels (with k > 1).E.g., macro-properties influencing micro-happenings, hich in turn make up the macro-properties.The discussion and build-up of strange loops feels like a glorious Safari journey, including his beloved Gödelian loop. There are fun ideas about how we live in each other, etc. (Which, of course, would become even more fun if something akin to Morphic Resonance were to be the case :'D).To be disappointment, however, Douglas does not consider how people can, in a sense, develop past the ""I"" -- in a sense adding yet more abstraction-level distance to the loopiness ;-)He devotes a mere sentence to the topic. Finally, the discussions of Cartesian Egos, Zombies, and Sacred Cows are fairly lackluster and shallow, with some boiling down to ""I don't understand it, so it's wrong"". Seems he's very good at expositing ideas he understands, but not so much at rebutting others (or even mentally modeling others' weird ideas xD).All in all a fairly enjoyable, easy, insightful read :)"
108,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666609-dusty-rhodes,3,"Hofstadter is a victim of his own influence. The ideas in this book are extensions of the ideas he presented in Godel, Escher, Bach and are still interesting thoughts clearly presented. I am a Strange loop is, however, a far inferior book. Or at least, a book of a different style. Hofstadter has traded in his incredibly complex and beautiful structural sense of humor for cringe-worthy puns.That being said, he's not a novelist. The concepts wrestled with here provide an intriguing lens through which to view what exactly consciousness is. The issue is that the quality of the writing varies just as wildly as the focus. His repetition of concepts without the enlightening playfulness of GEB wears on my strange loop.However, if you enjoyed the *ideas* of Hofstadter, read this. Just be prepared for the decline in concern for the craft of creating the book as a whole. Which is, what elevated GEB in the first place."

The book is a valiant but hopeless attempt to understand human consciousness. Hofstadter loves feedback loops, and thinks that feedback loops in our brains give us the “I” feeling. I wasn’t at all convinced.But the book has a couple of interesting ideas. One is that souls have different sizes. Mature adults have fairly large souls (Albert Schweitzer’s was huge), babies have little souls, dogs smaller yet, and mosquitoes and bacteria have teeny tiny souls.Hofstadter seems a pretty mellow guy, so I was surprised at the edge in his comments about his fellow philosopher John Searle."

His Fluid Analogy stuff contain good examples.If I understand The Strange Loop properly, he's exploring the idea that consciousness if simply an illusion looking at an illusion. Wow!His thinking about the continued existence of his dead wife within his own mind is very thought provoking and I suspect has some merit. A sort of ""Extended Phenotype"" of the mind if that makes any sense.As always with Hofstadter, it's quite easy to miss the point of his thesis as it's tackling one of those questions we simply don't think to ask."

Half of the book discusses the Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which posits the limitations of the Principia Mathematica, and self-referential loops. In the other half of the book, author argues that there is no such thing as ""I""; and the concept of 'I' is a myth! It's just an hallucination hallucinated by hallucination.

124,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/526331-richard,1,"Hofstadter, I fear, has jumped the shark. More than fifty pages into this book, he had yet to offer an intriguing idea worth pursuing this book fully through. A lot of this feels like pale egocentricism."
125,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh,2,"“Dreary, oh so dreary”, remarks an imaginary sceptical reader at the start of chapter 20 of I Am A Strange Loop, highly unimpressed with the implications of Hofstadter’s stance on the nature of consciousness. I don’t share this imaginary reader’s dismay at Hofstadter’s point of view, but their words do fairly accurately sum up my opinion of Strange Loop as a whole, and hence their appearance at the opening of this review too.When flicking through this book in the shop, I thought it was going to be a dense, perhaps difficult to grasp, but richly rewarding and thought-provoking read that might well change the way I thought not just about myself but also about the world around me. Unfortunately, the first two thirds of it – honestly, that’s no exaggeration – have almost nothing at all to say about consciousness, beyond one or two very meat-and-potatoes little scene-setters; instead, Hofstadter blathers on and on about what he thinks are enlightening analogies to consciousness, such as various forms of feedback and self-referential mathematical formulas, every once in a while teasing you by seeming to be about to finally tackle things head-on, before once again maddeningly invoking yet another analogy or – worse still – going back over something that he already tortured you with for several chapters earlier on. Now, I realise that it’s these analogies and Hofstadter’s approach that make this book unique, and it’s obvious that Hofstadter himself considers these chapters to indeed be talking about consciousness, albeit in a roundabout way, but even leaving aside the subjective question of whether these analogies are at all helpful for understanding the actually pretty straightforward topics the book eeeeevvvvveeeeentually goes on to discuss, I really don’t see how you can justify spending 200+ pages setting the scene. Sure, use your analogies to present things in various different ways in order to cater for the various different means of understanding that the varied brains of your varied readers might have, but please please do so succinctly, and please punctuate your meanderings with sections of real meaty content here and there, so as to also satisfy the cravings of those of us that like things direct and to the point! Lists of twenty or so examples when three or four would suffice are particularly wearisome...Anyway, eventually the book does lift up its skirts and give you a brief flash of the flesh for which you paid your entrance fee, and things do perk up a fair bit then, although only for a little while. The most interesting question pondered is whether people’s brains are able to contain within them not just one consciousness (your “I”), but two, three or however many, if only in part. In a remarkably honest, touching and personal section, Hofstadter talks about his late wife and her death, and how through the closeness of their relationship he gradually incorporated many of her traits and memories into himself, and he posits that this incorporation may have resulted in the partial duplication of her consciousness within his own brain (and that this also happens to you too). This was an idea at which I initially balked, but Hofstadter does argue it pretty convincingly, and he’s fully aware of (and discusses) the points at which it is most difficult to accept as well as what’s required at an anatomical level for it to be true. He doesn’t claim to reach any strong conclusions, he just lays out his thoughts on the matter and hopes that you’ll keep an open mind and perhaps come around to his views to at least some extent. I did come around a little, but he failed to convince me on certain key points. However, I think this is a matter on which ones thoughts might change as one forges stronger relationships throughout one’s life, so I’ll try to remember to consider it again a little further down the line.As I said, that’s the most interesting question pondered in this on-topic final third. I’m afraid a fair amount of the rest of it I found boring and frustrating or else downright aggravating. For example, the twentieth chapter is a fictional conversation between two people, one of whom thinks that there must be something above and beyond simple neuronal activation required for consciousness, and one of whom does not. It’s aimed at people with at least one foot in the first camp, so for readers already standing with both feet squarely in the second it quickly becomes very tedious indeed, as you’re forced to suffer through query after query and response after response in which you’ve absolutely no interest – this is one of the longest chapters in the book, and it certainly feels like it.In another chapter Hofstadter claims to put to bed a couple of objections (“sacred cows”) that philosophers commonly raise to notions of the similarity of different consciousnesses, the first of which is the “problem of the inverted spectrum” – the idea that one person’s sensory input may be inverted in some respect to another person’s, and that this would make them so different that they could never truly know what it’s like to be each other (for example, one person seeing red where the other sees blue). And yes, Hofstadter does go on to address this, but I don’t understand why the inputs must be completely inverted, and not simply significantly different, which is an altogether different kettle of fish. For example, the proportion of cone cells that I have that perceive light of a certain wavelength may differ significantly from the proportion that you have, and this may cause us to perceive colours slightly differently. Perhaps not differently enough to have a substantial effect on our respective consciousnesses, but who knows? Or take taste as another example – my girlfriend absolutely loves sushi, and feels energised and invigorated after eating it, whereas I find it bland and completely unsatisfying. So there are unquestionably degrees of variation between people that, cumulatively, make the way we perceive our worlds as a whole substantially different. For me Hofstadter’s slaying of this “sacred cow” is more a putdown of a straw man, and even if the problem is frequently raised in this form of a total sensory inversion, I would expect a man of Hofstadter’s reasoning ability to do a better job of extrapolating the argument to its more worthwhile alternative.Hofstadter’s style is engaging, but that only compensates for the almost unbelievable lack of directness to a small extent. In the introduction Hofstadter tells us how this book started life as a request for a chapter’s worth of content from the compilers of an anthology, and ended up becoming two chapters of that book and then, eventually, I Am A Strange Loop. Well, I haven’t read that anthology, but I think there probably is about enough real content here for around two very decent chapters of a book much wider in scope, so my advice to you if you’re considering reading Strange Loop is to do a little digging and perhaps give that anthology your attention instead."
126,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"I read Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach in my college days. While I loved the book, looking back I realize that the appreciation was not deep enough. I was impressed by the novelty and surface gloss of his thinking, but I was not yet ready to understand the depth of the book. Then I purchased The Mind's I in the eighties, but never read the whole thing. I browsed through it, and read bits and pieces, but never did a close reading. I think I was finally ready to understand his work when I started reading this book a few weeks ago.Some of the best experience in life is when you nurture some thoughts for a long time, and gradually they take shape in your mind, and then one day you read a book that articulates those same thoughts, but in a more organized way. That was my experience with this book. I have been reading a lot about consciousness for the last few years. They covered a wide spectrum from strong dualist views who are convinced that there is something non-physical about our mind, to people who believe that consciousness is a quantum phenomenon, to people who believe it is an universal field-like thing giving every object a degree of consciousness, and then people who believe that it is a very powerful illusion that is almost impossible to shake off. This book makes a very strong case for the last viewpoint.If you are interested in this topic then I think this book should be in your reading list, irrespective of which point-of-view you currently support, as long as you have kept an open mind about it. The arguments here are very strong. Though, I have to say, at times he takes his analogical methods a little too far, and someone can find holes in the parallel he is drawing between the real problem and the analog. Even in those cases his intelligence and insightfulness come through, and the text remains enjoyable. What he presents here is not a scholarly argument. It is intended for curious readers interested in this deep question, and nudges them towards accepting his view. You may not be convinced, but I'll be surprised if he cannot introduce some serious doubts in your current perspective."
127,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6805662-bhashit-parikh,5,"The arguments for consciousness out of purely physical processes are brilliant, and Hofstadter is so much fun to read. The arguments about consciousness arising out of the strange loops is very fascinating to say the least."
128,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24849811-andreea-reads,4,*my brain needs to cool down a bit after this read.
129,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,3,"Douglas Hofstadter is a quirky and entertaining writer, though not as systematic as I would like. He starts off with the interesting insight that the I (or the self, or consciousness) is a strange feedback loop similar to an audio feedback loop or a video feedback loop. Audio feedback takes place when a microphone picks up its own background noise, and then endlessly rebroadcasts it as a screech. Video feedback occurs if a video camera is pointed at the video screen showing what the camera is picking up, thus yielding a similar endless loop.What these phenomena have in common is self-reference, the ability of a machine (or an algorithm or a language or a person) to represent itself. Thus a video screen showing itself showing itself showing itself… is similar to consciousness being aware of itself being aware of itself being aware of itself….Hofstadter goes on to connect these feedback loops with the paradoxes of self-reference important in mathematical history, such as the liar’s paradox. The town liar says that he is lying. If he is lying, he is telling the truth. If he is telling the truth, he is lying. Bertrand Russell developed the Theory of Types so as to prevent self-reference (and paradox) in the foundations of mathematics. But Kurt Godel proved that within Russell’s system there are true statements that cannot be proven, showing that self-referential paradoxes can sneak back in, even when they have been systematically ruled out.Hofstadter’s treatment of Godel’s Proof is one of the best discussions I have seen (and I have read the classic Nagel-Newman introductory text). In a nutshell, Hofstadter points out that a mathematical system as rich as the Russell-Whitehead system can say things about it’s own structure (i.e., be self-referential), even though that has been supposedly ruled out by its own construction rules.What I miss in Hofstadter’s discussion is how the paradoxes of self-reference cast light on consciousness. Hofstadter points out that not all self-reference is paradoxical (there is no truth-teller’s paradox). Self-referential paradoxes in consciousness might be something like Groucho Marx’s joke that he would not belong to a club that would have him as a member. In a more serious vein, self-referential paradox does mirror the human experience of judging (and therefore being different from) oneself.Hofstadter spends a lot of time mourning the premature loss of his wife, and analyzing his sense that she is not completely gone, but lives on in the thought-patterns and self-referential loops that he shared with her. That discussion is touching and personally appealing. Along the way, he wants to argue that consciousness is an illusion, that it is a changing collection of thought-patterns that can be spread over different brains and machines. He argues that he is not the same person that he was the day before, or that he will be the next day, because he is constantly having new experiences and forgetting things.Here I think he goes too far. A person, a self, a consciousness, has a continuity of experience that extends from birth to the present moment, and also envisages the future. This is what it means to be human, to make a single project out of one’s life (thank you, Heidegger), however self-referential that may be. If I am not the same person as my childhood self, then how did I ever grow up?I said I wished Hofstadter were more systematic. Akeel Bilgrami (in Self-Knowledge and Resentment) has gone into much more detail in analyzing how self-reference (or a metalinguistic level of comment) is core to such philosophical concepts as agency, value, intentionality and self-knowledge. Very briefly, to be a moral agent, to value something, to intend something, and to know oneself, all of these core philosophical activities involve not only doing something (which a robot can do), but recognizing that I am doing it. This kind of analysis, to my mind, is extraordinarily fruitful, and what I wish I had seen more of in Hofstadter."
130,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"Hofstadter, who became famous with his 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, now tackles the task of defining the self, “I,” consciousness, and the soul, all of which he sees as the same thing. He approaches the question with both science and philosophy, although the book is more philosophical than scientific.So, what’s the “loop”? He means a feedback loop, like the squeal of a PA system, although he’s more interested in what happens when you point a video camera at its own monitor. What you often get is an image of something that doesn’t really exist—except how can you say it doesn’t exist when you’re looking right at it? The human mind can look at itself, and that, too, can create images of things that “don’t really exist.” Unlike the video setup, though, the human mind can to some degree alter itself based on that image—which in turn can alter what it sees when it next looks at itself.Hofstadter builds on this self-referential feedback loop with forays into mathematics, biology, computer science, brain science, art, music, religion, the work of other philosophers, his own life, and his own and others’ thought experiments. Escher, Bach, and especially Gödel all put in appearances. This isn’t a book that zooms in on one definite answer that renders all others irrelevant. Rather, it gently leads you to think in new ways about “yourself,” which you might never look at again in quite the same way.Hofstadter writes clearly, with creativity, humor, and a unique way of looking at the world. He also makes numerous digressions, which are usually interesting even if not always strictly on point and sometimes too lengthy.He sees no need to invoke nonphysical entities, spirits, or gods to explain self and consciousness, but he also says we’ll never be able to open a human skull and pinpoint the exact brain structure or clump of neurons that house “I.” So, this book isn’t going to please either strict materialists or dogmatic dualists, which is probably a good thing."
131,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Hofstadter presents what strikes me as a convincing philosophical model of a non-dualistic world in which it is unnecessary to divide our experiences into material and spiritual components, or to hold on to the familiar and comforting concept of an immaterial ""soul."" Along the way, the reader is required to jump some pretty formidable hurdles, including a chapter that summarizes Kurt Godel's famous incompleteness theorem. I banged myself up pretty good trying to jump that one (but thanks to some help from a friend, I did attain a certain level of insight).If you are wondering how the ""self"" and ""consciousness"" can be accounted for in relatively materialistic terms, then this book is an excellent starting point. Hofstadter succeeds in presenting his ideas with humor, compassion, and much creativity.Many of the ideas Hofstadter presents in this book are familiar to me because they have materialized out of my own experience. For example: the notion that one personality can overlap with another's (so, in a sense, the dead can temporarily live on in the minds of their friends and loved ones); or the notion that I am not really the same person I was ten years ago (the Ship of Theseus paradox); or the notion of an ""inverted spectrum"" (the question of whether two people see the same ""red,"" or instead actually see different colors but merely call them by the same name?). Hofstadter demolishes the ""inverted spectrum"" thesis with little difficulty. I'll never wonder about that one again! H's conclusions regarding the phenomenon of human consciousness are somewhat tentative, because he's a humble person who is willing to explore opposing points of view and willing to admit that so much remains unknown. Nevertheless, I felt that he succeeded in showing that a materialistic viewpoint is more consistent and plausible than a dualistic viewpoint. Overall, an impressive performance!"
132,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3008879-dominikus,4,"A very personal and insightful book. As a long-time fan of Hofstadter's 'Gödel Escher Bach' I was glad to read this official 'sequel'. Hofstadter professes that he wants to use this book to clarify the points that he tried to make 30 years earlier, especially when it comes to the nature of consciousness. This naturally leads to some repetition: for example, since Gödel's destruction of Principia Mathematica builds his central argument about minds being strange loops, Hofstadter spends some time on that. But fortunately, the whole book is written in a very engaging and entertaining way, so even the more complex parts never feel like a chore.The core idea - spoilers ahead - about consciousness being a phenomenon naturally emerging from the complexity of any symbol processing apparatus is convincingly introduced and explained. Hofstadter's ousting of dualism forces him to arrive at the conclusion that consciousness is an illusion that consciousness plays on itself (in true strange loop fashion) and that ideas like an eternal 'I' or soul could not exist since they would lead to an infinite regress. While he's at killing sacred cows, he also denies the idea of a free will.These somewhat bleak results are loosened by Hofstadter's meditations on the spreading of personalities across minds (so death is more of a fading away than an abrupt ending of a person), ways to measure the size of a soul (hint: empathy is important), and others. Yet, these somewhat meandering chapters also led me to give only four out of five stars. The author takes about half of the book to arrive at the nature of strange loops and dwells long on things that obviously fascinate him but might not be as engaging for the reader. Some editing would have been in order there.Overall, however, this is an important book and Hofstadter was able to convince me of his conclusion when it comes to the nature of consciousness. Every being that feels like having an 'I' should read this."
133,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"A good introduction to Hofstadter's ideas about consciousness, in a considerably shorter package than Godel, Escher, Bach. Hofstadter is at his best in the first half of the book, when he's outlining his idea of the ""strange loop"" and discussing how it connects to his other ideas about the mind. His discussion of Godel and incompleteness is also excellent-- I'd read another book on the same subject, but Hofstadter did a much better job of getting the ideas across. After that, the book goes off on a little bit of a tangent about the degree to which one person's consciousness can spread (at lower levels of resolution and fidelity) to another person's mind. He really believes in the strong form of this idea, which implies that another person's consciousness can run in some degree on a different brain, with all that implies (a sense of interiority, etc.) It's a hard thing to swallow without scientific evidence, and you get the sense that the author might have been unduly influenced in his views by the tragic early death of his wife-- and is engaging in a little bit of wishful philosophizing about her soul's survival. The book returns to form in a rousing deconstruction and refutation of dualism, and concludes nicely with the author applying his ideas to the phenomenons of empathy and friendship. All in all, definitely a nice place to start in your investigation of Philosophy of Mind. "
134,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,3,"I enjoyed reading this foray by Hofstadter into coming to terms with that slippery concept we call 'I'; the style is cheeky, cheerful, very witty (perhaps too witty for some tastes). The subject of this book is elusive and slippery as ever; but it is of interest to anyone trying to grapple with this mercurial subject. Linked with 'I' is the concept of 'self', and by association, 'mind', 'soul', and 'conscience'. Hofstadter masterfully guides us through all the labyrinthian pathways, sometimes playing with us, endlessly punning (perhaps too much so for my taste), yet treats us kindly through the journey. He had many insights to provide, and does not shy away from the paradoxes involved. Nor does he fear to go into some very dense and some quite difficult terrain; but his hand is firm and steady, and he does get you through, even though you might not fully understand every step.Whether he is totally convincing in his conclusions is problematic: and Hofstadter readily acknowledges this. But he feels that what he and we as readers gain from the journey well outweighs any 'negatives' we might feel (they are 'negatives' but only in the sense that it makes us question, perhaps, some of our most cherished sacred cows about ourselves).Whether this is good or bad for you is neither here nor there. Anyone who is intrigued by the idea of who or what ""I"" is [sic] will find this book stimulating and thought-provoking."
135,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537281-ronny,1,"I didn't finish the book.This book is supposedly about consciousness. However, what I read were random ruminations that (at best) briefly connected with the promised subject matter.For instance, near the beginning, the author wrote at length about vegetarianism. Near the end of this section, he briefly segued into the concept of degrees of consciousness, but did not develop it. This was a shame because that would have been interesting and on-topic -- more interesting and on-topic than the vegetarian ruminations that dominated that section.I then started skimming. When I dipped in to read, I encountered more off-topic ruminations.Then I stopped entirely.In and of itself, the book may have been interesting, but the description was deceptive.Maybe the book got on track later on, but that doesn't matter. Going off on a tangent near the beginning is poor writing, and if it alienates the reader early on so s/he doesn't give the book a chance later, that's solely the author's fault.If the book consisted mainly of off-topic ruminations with a quick segue into consciousness, then it's deceptive since the bulk of the book should be about consciousness, not the other way around.Since I got this book for its description (consciousness), I am judging it by that. On that count, it fails."
136,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18930784-me,3,"I've been interested in reading Hofstadter since his name came up as author of Godel, Escher, Bach, as discussed in The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, and I realized that this was same person who edited Godel's Proof which I had earlier read. His name came up again in Gleick's 'The Information: A history, a theory, a flood', so then I set off to read his work.Half-way through, I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars. Really enjoyed the commentary on Godel's proof and the idea of consciousness as a similar ""strange loop"" based on abstract symbol system that can be turned upon itself. However, I think the book become rather repetitive, and a bit ""preachy"" over the second half--less backed by analogy to mathematical and physical structures and perhaps a bit too much about Hofstadter's opinions regarding morality and aesthetics (which I concurred with throughout, but felt somewhat detracted rather than enhanced his thesis). Overall, still a very interesting read and recommended. Other readers may find the book much more powerful or rewarding for the same reasons I found it diluted. I am a strange loop."
137,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11041240-zarathustra-goertzel,4,"87.5% good book.I Am a Strange Loop reads like a comfy fireplace chat with a profoundly warmhearted (""large souled"") man. A Strange Loop is in essence a causal-loop among k abstraction levels (with k > 1).E.g., macro-properties influencing micro-happenings, hich in turn make up the macro-properties.The discussion and build-up of strange loops feels like a glorious Safari journey, including his beloved Gödelian loop. There are fun ideas about how we live in each other, etc. (Which, of course, would become even more fun if something akin to Morphic Resonance were to be the case :'D).To be disappointment, however, Douglas does not consider how people can, in a sense, develop past the ""I"" -- in a sense adding yet more abstraction-level distance to the loopiness ;-)He devotes a mere sentence to the topic. Finally, the discussions of Cartesian Egos, Zombies, and Sacred Cows are fairly lackluster and shallow, with some boiling down to ""I don't understand it, so it's wrong"". Seems he's very good at expositing ideas he understands, but not so much at rebutting others (or even mentally modeling others' weird ideas xD).All in all a fairly enjoyable, easy, insightful read :)"

The ideas in this book are extensions of the ideas he presented in Godel, Escher, Bach and are still interesting thoughts clearly presented. I am a Strange loop is, however, a far inferior book. Or at least, a book of a different style. Hofstadter has traded in his incredibly complex and beautiful structural sense of humor for cringe-worthy puns.That being said, he's not a novelist. The concepts wrestled with here provide an intriguing lens through which to view what exactly consciousness is. The issue is that the quality of the writing varies just as wildly as the focus. His repetition of concepts without the enlightening playfulness of GEB wears on my strange loop.However, if you enjoyed the *ideas* of Hofstadter, read this. Just be prepared for the decline in concern for the craft of creating the book as a whole. Which is, what elevated GEB in the first place."

The book is a valiant but hopeless attempt to understand human consciousness. Hofstadter loves feedback loops, and thinks that feedback loops in our brains give us the “I” feeling. I wasn’t at all convinced.But the book has a couple of interesting ideas. One is that souls have different sizes. Mature adults have fairly large souls (Albert Schweitzer’s was huge), babies have little souls, dogs smaller yet, and mosquitoes and bacteria have teeny tiny souls.Hofstadter seems a pretty mellow guy, so I was surprised at the edge in his comments about his fellow philosopher John Searle."

Some of his explorations such as designing fonts seem just silly at first until you understand that he's exploring micro-puzzles that include deep challenges. His Fluid Analogy stuff contain good examples.If I understand The Strange Loop properly, he's exploring the idea that consciousness if simply an illusion looking at an illusion. Wow!His thinking about the continued existence of his dead wife within his own mind is very thought provoking and I suspect has some merit. A sort of ""Extended Phenotype"" of the mind if that makes any sense.As always with Hofstadter, it's quite easy to miss the point of his thesis as it's tackling one of those questions we simply don't think to ask."

This reading consumed a good amount of time to get the gist of the self-reference, the 'I'-ness discussed in the book. Half of the book discusses the Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which posits the limitations of the Principia Mathematica, and self-referential loops. In the other half of the book, author argues that there is no such thing as ""I""; and the concept of 'I' is a myth! It's just an hallucination hallucinated by hallucination. And he further adds that, a man can inhabit multiple brains in their careenium/skulls. A very profound and different book to what I have read so far!"

I kept waiting for him to provide some concrete evidence for what he was talking about, but he just keeps making the same few analogies over and over. I enjoyed the refresher course on Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, and found the idea of Godel's reflexive use of Principia Mathematica as an analogue for self-perception interesting, but in the end I'm afraid I'll never be sold on the notion of self as nothing more than an illusion, however trenchant. Nobody will ever convince me that I don't possess actual free will. Sorry. "

155,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh,2,"“Dreary, oh so dreary”, remarks an imaginary sceptical reader at the start of chapter 20 of I Am A Strange Loop, highly unimpressed with the implications of Hofstadter’s stance on the nature of consciousness. I don’t share this imaginary reader’s dismay at Hofstadter’s point of view, but their words do fairly accurately sum up my opinion of Strange Loop as a whole, and hence their appearance at the opening of this review too.When flicking through this book in the shop, I thought it was going to be a dense, perhaps difficult to grasp, but richly rewarding and thought-provoking read that might well change the way I thought not just about myself but also about the world around me. Unfortunately, the first two thirds of it – honestly, that’s no exaggeration – have almost nothing at all to say about consciousness, beyond one or two very meat-and-potatoes little scene-setters; instead, Hofstadter blathers on and on about what he thinks are enlightening analogies to consciousness, such as various forms of feedback and self-referential mathematical formulas, every once in a while teasing you by seeming to be about to finally tackle things head-on, before once again maddeningly invoking yet another analogy or – worse still – going back over something that he already tortured you with for several chapters earlier on. Now, I realise that it’s these analogies and Hofstadter’s approach that make this book unique, and it’s obvious that Hofstadter himself considers these chapters to indeed be talking about consciousness, albeit in a roundabout way, but even leaving aside the subjective question of whether these analogies are at all helpful for understanding the actually pretty straightforward topics the book eeeeevvvvveeeeentually goes on to discuss, I really don’t see how you can justify spending 200+ pages setting the scene. Sure, use your analogies to present things in various different ways in order to cater for the various different means of understanding that the varied brains of your varied readers might have, but please please do so succinctly, and please punctuate your meanderings with sections of real meaty content here and there, so as to also satisfy the cravings of those of us that like things direct and to the point! Lists of twenty or so examples when three or four would suffice are particularly wearisome...Anyway, eventually the book does lift up its skirts and give you a brief flash of the flesh for which you paid your entrance fee, and things do perk up a fair bit then, although only for a little while. The most interesting question pondered is whether people’s brains are able to contain within them not just one consciousness (your “I”), but two, three or however many, if only in part. In a remarkably honest, touching and personal section, Hofstadter talks about his late wife and her death, and how through the closeness of their relationship he gradually incorporated many of her traits and memories into himself, and he posits that this incorporation may have resulted in the partial duplication of her consciousness within his own brain (and that this also happens to you too). This was an idea at which I initially balked, but Hofstadter does argue it pretty convincingly, and he’s fully aware of (and discusses) the points at which it is most difficult to accept as well as what’s required at an anatomical level for it to be true. He doesn’t claim to reach any strong conclusions, he just lays out his thoughts on the matter and hopes that you’ll keep an open mind and perhaps come around to his views to at least some extent. I did come around a little, but he failed to convince me on certain key points. However, I think this is a matter on which ones thoughts might change as one forges stronger relationships throughout one’s life, so I’ll try to remember to consider it again a little further down the line.As I said, that’s the most interesting question pondered in this on-topic final third. I’m afraid a fair amount of the rest of it I found boring and frustrating or else downright aggravating. For example, the twentieth chapter is a fictional conversation between two people, one of whom thinks that there must be something above and beyond simple neuronal activation required for consciousness, and one of whom does not. It’s aimed at people with at least one foot in the first camp, so for readers already standing with both feet squarely in the second it quickly becomes very tedious indeed, as you’re forced to suffer through query after query and response after response in which you’ve absolutely no interest – this is one of the longest chapters in the book, and it certainly feels like it.In another chapter Hofstadter claims to put to bed a couple of objections (“sacred cows”) that philosophers commonly raise to notions of the similarity of different consciousnesses, the first of which is the “problem of the inverted spectrum” – the idea that one person’s sensory input may be inverted in some respect to another person’s, and that this would make them so different that they could never truly know what it’s like to be each other (for example, one person seeing red where the other sees blue). And yes, Hofstadter does go on to address this, but I don’t understand why the inputs must be completely inverted, and not simply significantly different, which is an altogether different kettle of fish. For example, the proportion of cone cells that I have that perceive light of a certain wavelength may differ significantly from the proportion that you have, and this may cause us to perceive colours slightly differently. Perhaps not differently enough to have a substantial effect on our respective consciousnesses, but who knows? Or take taste as another example – my girlfriend absolutely loves sushi, and feels energised and invigorated after eating it, whereas I find it bland and completely unsatisfying. So there are unquestionably degrees of variation between people that, cumulatively, make the way we perceive our worlds as a whole substantially different. For me Hofstadter’s slaying of this “sacred cow” is more a putdown of a straw man, and even if the problem is frequently raised in this form of a total sensory inversion, I would expect a man of Hofstadter’s reasoning ability to do a better job of extrapolating the argument to its more worthwhile alternative.Hofstadter’s style is engaging, but that only compensates for the almost unbelievable lack of directness to a small extent. In the introduction Hofstadter tells us how this book started life as a request for a chapter’s worth of content from the compilers of an anthology, and ended up becoming two chapters of that book and then, eventually, I Am A Strange Loop. Well, I haven’t read that anthology, but I think there probably is about enough real content here for around two very decent chapters of a book much wider in scope, so my advice to you if you’re considering reading Strange Loop is to do a little digging and perhaps give that anthology your attention instead."
156,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"I read Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach in my college days. While I loved the book, looking back I realize that the appreciation was not deep enough. I was impressed by the novelty and surface gloss of his thinking, but I was not yet ready to understand the depth of the book. Then I purchased The Mind's I in the eighties, but never read the whole thing. I browsed through it, and read bits and pieces, but never did a close reading. I think I was finally ready to understand his work when I started reading this book a few weeks ago.Some of the best experience in life is when you nurture some thoughts for a long time, and gradually they take shape in your mind, and then one day you read a book that articulates those same thoughts, but in a more organized way. That was my experience with this book. I have been reading a lot about consciousness for the last few years. They covered a wide spectrum from strong dualist views who are convinced that there is something non-physical about our mind, to people who believe that consciousness is a quantum phenomenon, to people who believe it is an universal field-like thing giving every object a degree of consciousness, and then people who believe that it is a very powerful illusion that is almost impossible to shake off. This book makes a very strong case for the last viewpoint.If you are interested in this topic then I think this book should be in your reading list, irrespective of which point-of-view you currently support, as long as you have kept an open mind about it. The arguments here are very strong. Though, I have to say, at times he takes his analogical methods a little too far, and someone can find holes in the parallel he is drawing between the real problem and the analog. Even in those cases his intelligence and insightfulness come through, and the text remains enjoyable. What he presents here is not a scholarly argument. It is intended for curious readers interested in this deep question, and nudges them towards accepting his view. You may not be convinced, but I'll be surprised if he cannot introduce some serious doubts in your current perspective."
157,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6805662-bhashit-parikh,5,"The arguments for consciousness out of purely physical processes are brilliant, and Hofstadter is so much fun to read. The arguments about consciousness arising out of the strange loops is very fascinating to say the least."
158,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24849811-andreea-reads,4,*my brain needs to cool down a bit after this read.
159,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,3,"Douglas Hofstadter is a quirky and entertaining writer, though not as systematic as I would like. He starts off with the interesting insight that the I (or the self, or consciousness) is a strange feedback loop similar to an audio feedback loop or a video feedback loop. Audio feedback takes place when a microphone picks up its own background noise, and then endlessly rebroadcasts it as a screech. Video feedback occurs if a video camera is pointed at the video screen showing what the camera is picking up, thus yielding a similar endless loop.What these phenomena have in common is self-reference, the ability of a machine (or an algorithm or a language or a person) to represent itself. Thus a video screen showing itself showing itself showing itself… is similar to consciousness being aware of itself being aware of itself being aware of itself….Hofstadter goes on to connect these feedback loops with the paradoxes of self-reference important in mathematical history, such as the liar’s paradox. The town liar says that he is lying. If he is lying, he is telling the truth. If he is telling the truth, he is lying. Bertrand Russell developed the Theory of Types so as to prevent self-reference (and paradox) in the foundations of mathematics. But Kurt Godel proved that within Russell’s system there are true statements that cannot be proven, showing that self-referential paradoxes can sneak back in, even when they have been systematically ruled out.Hofstadter’s treatment of Godel’s Proof is one of the best discussions I have seen (and I have read the classic Nagel-Newman introductory text). In a nutshell, Hofstadter points out that a mathematical system as rich as the Russell-Whitehead system can say things about it’s own structure (i.e., be self-referential), even though that has been supposedly ruled out by its own construction rules.What I miss in Hofstadter’s discussion is how the paradoxes of self-reference cast light on consciousness. Hofstadter points out that not all self-reference is paradoxical (there is no truth-teller’s paradox). Self-referential paradoxes in consciousness might be something like Groucho Marx’s joke that he would not belong to a club that would have him as a member. In a more serious vein, self-referential paradox does mirror the human experience of judging (and therefore being different from) oneself.Hofstadter spends a lot of time mourning the premature loss of his wife, and analyzing his sense that she is not completely gone, but lives on in the thought-patterns and self-referential loops that he shared with her. That discussion is touching and personally appealing. Along the way, he wants to argue that consciousness is an illusion, that it is a changing collection of thought-patterns that can be spread over different brains and machines. He argues that he is not the same person that he was the day before, or that he will be the next day, because he is constantly having new experiences and forgetting things.Here I think he goes too far. A person, a self, a consciousness, has a continuity of experience that extends from birth to the present moment, and also envisages the future. This is what it means to be human, to make a single project out of one’s life (thank you, Heidegger), however self-referential that may be. If I am not the same person as my childhood self, then how did I ever grow up?I said I wished Hofstadter were more systematic. Akeel Bilgrami (in Self-Knowledge and Resentment) has gone into much more detail in analyzing how self-reference (or a metalinguistic level of comment) is core to such philosophical concepts as agency, value, intentionality and self-knowledge. Very briefly, to be a moral agent, to value something, to intend something, and to know oneself, all of these core philosophical activities involve not only doing something (which a robot can do), but recognizing that I am doing it. This kind of analysis, to my mind, is extraordinarily fruitful, and what I wish I had seen more of in Hofstadter."
160,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"Hofstadter, who became famous with his 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, now tackles the task of defining the self, “I,” consciousness, and the soul, all of which he sees as the same thing. He approaches the question with both science and philosophy, although the book is more philosophical than scientific.So, what’s the “loop”? He means a feedback loop, like the squeal of a PA system, although he’s more interested in what happens when you point a video camera at its own monitor. What you often get is an image of something that doesn’t really exist—except how can you say it doesn’t exist when you’re looking right at it? The human mind can look at itself, and that, too, can create images of things that “don’t really exist.” Unlike the video setup, though, the human mind can to some degree alter itself based on that image—which in turn can alter what it sees when it next looks at itself.Hofstadter builds on this self-referential feedback loop with forays into mathematics, biology, computer science, brain science, art, music, religion, the work of other philosophers, his own life, and his own and others’ thought experiments. Escher, Bach, and especially Gödel all put in appearances. This isn’t a book that zooms in on one definite answer that renders all others irrelevant. Rather, it gently leads you to think in new ways about “yourself,” which you might never look at again in quite the same way.Hofstadter writes clearly, with creativity, humor, and a unique way of looking at the world. He also makes numerous digressions, which are usually interesting even if not always strictly on point and sometimes too lengthy.He sees no need to invoke nonphysical entities, spirits, or gods to explain self and consciousness, but he also says we’ll never be able to open a human skull and pinpoint the exact brain structure or clump of neurons that house “I.” So, this book isn’t going to please either strict materialists or dogmatic dualists, which is probably a good thing."
161,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Hofstadter presents what strikes me as a convincing philosophical model of a non-dualistic world in which it is unnecessary to divide our experiences into material and spiritual components, or to hold on to the familiar and comforting concept of an immaterial ""soul."" Along the way, the reader is required to jump some pretty formidable hurdles, including a chapter that summarizes Kurt Godel's famous incompleteness theorem. I banged myself up pretty good trying to jump that one (but thanks to some help from a friend, I did attain a certain level of insight).If you are wondering how the ""self"" and ""consciousness"" can be accounted for in relatively materialistic terms, then this book is an excellent starting point. Hofstadter succeeds in presenting his ideas with humor, compassion, and much creativity.Many of the ideas Hofstadter presents in this book are familiar to me because they have materialized out of my own experience. For example: the notion that one personality can overlap with another's (so, in a sense, the dead can temporarily live on in the minds of their friends and loved ones); or the notion that I am not really the same person I was ten years ago (the Ship of Theseus paradox); or the notion of an ""inverted spectrum"" (the question of whether two people see the same ""red,"" or instead actually see different colors but merely call them by the same name?). Hofstadter demolishes the ""inverted spectrum"" thesis with little difficulty. I'll never wonder about that one again! H's conclusions regarding the phenomenon of human consciousness are somewhat tentative, because he's a humble person who is willing to explore opposing points of view and willing to admit that so much remains unknown. Nevertheless, I felt that he succeeded in showing that a materialistic viewpoint is more consistent and plausible than a dualistic viewpoint. Overall, an impressive performance!"
162,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3008879-dominikus,4,"A very personal and insightful book. As a long-time fan of Hofstadter's 'Gödel Escher Bach' I was glad to read this official 'sequel'. Hofstadter professes that he wants to use this book to clarify the points that he tried to make 30 years earlier, especially when it comes to the nature of consciousness. This naturally leads to some repetition: for example, since Gödel's destruction of Principia Mathematica builds his central argument about minds being strange loops, Hofstadter spends some time on that. But fortunately, the whole book is written in a very engaging and entertaining way, so even the more complex parts never feel like a chore.The core idea - spoilers ahead - about consciousness being a phenomenon naturally emerging from the complexity of any symbol processing apparatus is convincingly introduced and explained. Hofstadter's ousting of dualism forces him to arrive at the conclusion that consciousness is an illusion that consciousness plays on itself (in true strange loop fashion) and that ideas like an eternal 'I' or soul could not exist since they would lead to an infinite regress. While he's at killing sacred cows, he also denies the idea of a free will.These somewhat bleak results are loosened by Hofstadter's meditations on the spreading of personalities across minds (so death is more of a fading away than an abrupt ending of a person), ways to measure the size of a soul (hint: empathy is important), and others. Yet, these somewhat meandering chapters also led me to give only four out of five stars. The author takes about half of the book to arrive at the nature of strange loops and dwells long on things that obviously fascinate him but might not be as engaging for the reader. Some editing would have been in order there.Overall, however, this is an important book and Hofstadter was able to convince me of his conclusion when it comes to the nature of consciousness. Every being that feels like having an 'I' should read this."
163,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"A good introduction to Hofstadter's ideas about consciousness, in a considerably shorter package than Godel, Escher, Bach. Hofstadter is at his best in the first half of the book, when he's outlining his idea of the ""strange loop"" and discussing how it connects to his other ideas about the mind. His discussion of Godel and incompleteness is also excellent-- I'd read another book on the same subject, but Hofstadter did a much better job of getting the ideas across. After that, the book goes off on a little bit of a tangent about the degree to which one person's consciousness can spread (at lower levels of resolution and fidelity) to another person's mind. He really believes in the strong form of this idea, which implies that another person's consciousness can run in some degree on a different brain, with all that implies (a sense of interiority, etc.) It's a hard thing to swallow without scientific evidence, and you get the sense that the author might have been unduly influenced in his views by the tragic early death of his wife-- and is engaging in a little bit of wishful philosophizing about her soul's survival. The book returns to form in a rousing deconstruction and refutation of dualism, and concludes nicely with the author applying his ideas to the phenomenons of empathy and friendship. All in all, definitely a nice place to start in your investigation of Philosophy of Mind. "
164,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,3,"I enjoyed reading this foray by Hofstadter into coming to terms with that slippery concept we call 'I'; the style is cheeky, cheerful, very witty (perhaps too witty for some tastes). The subject of this book is elusive and slippery as ever; but it is of interest to anyone trying to grapple with this mercurial subject. Linked with 'I' is the concept of 'self', and by association, 'mind', 'soul', and 'conscience'. Hofstadter masterfully guides us through all the labyrinthian pathways, sometimes playing with us, endlessly punning (perhaps too much so for my taste), yet treats us kindly through the journey. He had many insights to provide, and does not shy away from the paradoxes involved. Nor does he fear to go into some very dense and some quite difficult terrain; but his hand is firm and steady, and he does get you through, even though you might not fully understand every step.Whether he is totally convincing in his conclusions is problematic: and Hofstadter readily acknowledges this. But he feels that what he and we as readers gain from the journey well outweighs any 'negatives' we might feel (they are 'negatives' but only in the sense that it makes us question, perhaps, some of our most cherished sacred cows about ourselves).Whether this is good or bad for you is neither here nor there. Anyone who is intrigued by the idea of who or what ""I"" is [sic] will find this book stimulating and thought-provoking."
165,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537281-ronny,1,"I didn't finish the book.This book is supposedly about consciousness. However, what I read were random ruminations that (at best) briefly connected with the promised subject matter.For instance, near the beginning, the author wrote at length about vegetarianism. Near the end of this section, he briefly segued into the concept of degrees of consciousness, but did not develop it. This was a shame because that would have been interesting and on-topic -- more interesting and on-topic than the vegetarian ruminations that dominated that section.I then started skimming. When I dipped in to read, I encountered more off-topic ruminations.Then I stopped entirely.In and of itself, the book may have been interesting, but the description was deceptive.Maybe the book got on track later on, but that doesn't matter. Going off on a tangent near the beginning is poor writing, and if it alienates the reader early on so s/he doesn't give the book a chance later, that's solely the author's fault.If the book consisted mainly of off-topic ruminations with a quick segue into consciousness, then it's deceptive since the bulk of the book should be about consciousness, not the other way around.Since I got this book for its description (consciousness), I am judging it by that. On that count, it fails."
166,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18930784-me,3,"I've been interested in reading Hofstadter since his name came up as author of Godel, Escher, Bach, as discussed in The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, and I realized that this was same person who edited Godel's Proof which I had earlier read. His name came up again in Gleick's 'The Information: A history, a theory, a flood', so then I set off to read his work.Half-way through, I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars. Really enjoyed the commentary on Godel's proof and the idea of consciousness as a similar ""strange loop"" based on abstract symbol system that can be turned upon itself. However, I think the book become rather repetitive, and a bit ""preachy"" over the second half--less backed by analogy to mathematical and physical structures and perhaps a bit too much about Hofstadter's opinions regarding morality and aesthetics (which I concurred with throughout, but felt somewhat detracted rather than enhanced his thesis). Overall, still a very interesting read and recommended. Other readers may find the book much more powerful or rewarding for the same reasons I found it diluted. I am a strange loop."

A Strange Loop is in essence a causal-loop among k abstraction levels (with k > 1).E.g., macro-properties influencing micro-happenings, hich in turn make up the macro-properties.The discussion and build-up of strange loops feels like a glorious Safari journey, including his beloved Gödelian loop. There are fun ideas about how we live in each other, etc. (Which, of course, would become even more fun if something akin to Morphic Resonance were to be the case :'D).To be disappointment, however, Douglas does not consider how people can, in a sense, develop past the ""I"" -- in a sense adding yet more abstraction-level distance to the loopiness ;-)He devotes a mere sentence to the topic. Finally, the discussions of Cartesian Egos, Zombies, and Sacred Cows are fairly lackluster and shallow, with some boiling down to ""I don't understand it, so it's wrong"". Seems he's very good at expositing ideas he understands, but not so much at rebutting others (or even mentally modeling others' weird ideas xD).All in all a fairly enjoyable, easy, insightful read :)"

The ideas in this book are extensions of the ideas he presented in Godel, Escher, Bach and are still interesting thoughts clearly presented. I am a Strange loop is, however, a far inferior book. Or at least, a book of a different style. Hofstadter has traded in his incredibly complex and beautiful structural sense of humor for cringe-worthy puns.That being said, he's not a novelist. The concepts wrestled with here provide an intriguing lens through which to view what exactly consciousness is. The issue is that the quality of the writing varies just as wildly as the focus. His repetition of concepts without the enlightening playfulness of GEB wears on my strange loop.However, if you enjoyed the *ideas* of Hofstadter, read this. Just be prepared for the decline in concern for the craft of creating the book as a whole. Which is, what elevated GEB in the first place."

The book is a valiant but hopeless attempt to understand human consciousness. Hofstadter loves feedback loops, and thinks that feedback loops in our brains give us the “I” feeling. I wasn’t at all convinced.But the book has a couple of interesting ideas. One is that souls have different sizes. Mature adults have fairly large souls (Albert Schweitzer’s was huge), babies have little souls, dogs smaller yet, and mosquitoes and bacteria have teeny tiny souls.Hofstadter seems a pretty mellow guy, so I was surprised at the edge in his comments about his fellow philosopher John Searle."

His Fluid Analogy stuff contain good examples.If I understand The Strange Loop properly, he's exploring the idea that consciousness if simply an illusion looking at an illusion. Wow!His thinking about the continued existence of his dead wife within his own mind is very thought provoking and I suspect has some merit.

Half of the book discusses the Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which posits the limitations of the Principia Mathematica, and self-referential loops. In the other half of the book, author argues that there is no such thing as ""I""; and the concept of 'I' is a myth! It's just an hallucination hallucinated by hallucination.

185,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh,2,"“Dreary, oh so dreary”, remarks an imaginary sceptical reader at the start of chapter 20 of I Am A Strange Loop, highly unimpressed with the implications of Hofstadter’s stance on the nature of consciousness. I don’t share this imaginary reader’s dismay at Hofstadter’s point of view, but their words do fairly accurately sum up my opinion of Strange Loop as a whole, and hence their appearance at the opening of this review too.When flicking through this book in the shop, I thought it was going to be a dense, perhaps difficult to grasp, but richly rewarding and thought-provoking read that might well change the way I thought not just about myself but also about the world around me. Unfortunately, the first two thirds of it – honestly, that’s no exaggeration – have almost nothing at all to say about consciousness, beyond one or two very meat-and-potatoes little scene-setters; instead, Hofstadter blathers on and on about what he thinks are enlightening analogies to consciousness, such as various forms of feedback and self-referential mathematical formulas, every once in a while teasing you by seeming to be about to finally tackle things head-on, before once again maddeningly invoking yet another analogy or – worse still – going back over something that he already tortured you with for several chapters earlier on. Now, I realise that it’s these analogies and Hofstadter’s approach that make this book unique, and it’s obvious that Hofstadter himself considers these chapters to indeed be talking about consciousness, albeit in a roundabout way, but even leaving aside the subjective question of whether these analogies are at all helpful for understanding the actually pretty straightforward topics the book eeeeevvvvveeeeentually goes on to discuss, I really don’t see how you can justify spending 200+ pages setting the scene. Sure, use your analogies to present things in various different ways in order to cater for the various different means of understanding that the varied brains of your varied readers might have, but please please do so succinctly, and please punctuate your meanderings with sections of real meaty content here and there, so as to also satisfy the cravings of those of us that like things direct and to the point! Lists of twenty or so examples when three or four would suffice are particularly wearisome...Anyway, eventually the book does lift up its skirts and give you a brief flash of the flesh for which you paid your entrance fee, and things do perk up a fair bit then, although only for a little while. The most interesting question pondered is whether people’s brains are able to contain within them not just one consciousness (your “I”), but two, three or however many, if only in part. In a remarkably honest, touching and personal section, Hofstadter talks about his late wife and her death, and how through the closeness of their relationship he gradually incorporated many of her traits and memories into himself, and he posits that this incorporation may have resulted in the partial duplication of her consciousness within his own brain (and that this also happens to you too). This was an idea at which I initially balked, but Hofstadter does argue it pretty convincingly, and he’s fully aware of (and discusses) the points at which it is most difficult to accept as well as what’s required at an anatomical level for it to be true. He doesn’t claim to reach any strong conclusions, he just lays out his thoughts on the matter and hopes that you’ll keep an open mind and perhaps come around to his views to at least some extent. I did come around a little, but he failed to convince me on certain key points. However, I think this is a matter on which ones thoughts might change as one forges stronger relationships throughout one’s life, so I’ll try to remember to consider it again a little further down the line.As I said, that’s the most interesting question pondered in this on-topic final third. I’m afraid a fair amount of the rest of it I found boring and frustrating or else downright aggravating. For example, the twentieth chapter is a fictional conversation between two people, one of whom thinks that there must be something above and beyond simple neuronal activation required for consciousness, and one of whom does not. It’s aimed at people with at least one foot in the first camp, so for readers already standing with both feet squarely in the second it quickly becomes very tedious indeed, as you’re forced to suffer through query after query and response after response in which you’ve absolutely no interest – this is one of the longest chapters in the book, and it certainly feels like it.In another chapter Hofstadter claims to put to bed a couple of objections (“sacred cows”) that philosophers commonly raise to notions of the similarity of different consciousnesses, the first of which is the “problem of the inverted spectrum” – the idea that one person’s sensory input may be inverted in some respect to another person’s, and that this would make them so different that they could never truly know what it’s like to be each other (for example, one person seeing red where the other sees blue). And yes, Hofstadter does go on to address this, but I don’t understand why the inputs must be completely inverted, and not simply significantly different, which is an altogether different kettle of fish. For example, the proportion of cone cells that I have that perceive light of a certain wavelength may differ significantly from the proportion that you have, and this may cause us to perceive colours slightly differently. Perhaps not differently enough to have a substantial effect on our respective consciousnesses, but who knows? Or take taste as another example – my girlfriend absolutely loves sushi, and feels energised and invigorated after eating it, whereas I find it bland and completely unsatisfying. So there are unquestionably degrees of variation between people that, cumulatively, make the way we perceive our worlds as a whole substantially different. For me Hofstadter’s slaying of this “sacred cow” is more a putdown of a straw man, and even if the problem is frequently raised in this form of a total sensory inversion, I would expect a man of Hofstadter’s reasoning ability to do a better job of extrapolating the argument to its more worthwhile alternative.Hofstadter’s style is engaging, but that only compensates for the almost unbelievable lack of directness to a small extent. In the introduction Hofstadter tells us how this book started life as a request for a chapter’s worth of content from the compilers of an anthology, and ended up becoming two chapters of that book and then, eventually, I Am A Strange Loop. Well, I haven’t read that anthology, but I think there probably is about enough real content here for around two very decent chapters of a book much wider in scope, so my advice to you if you’re considering reading Strange Loop is to do a little digging and perhaps give that anthology your attention instead."
186,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"I read Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach in my college days. While I loved the book, looking back I realize that the appreciation was not deep enough. I was impressed by the novelty and surface gloss of his thinking, but I was not yet ready to understand the depth of the book. Then I purchased The Mind's I in the eighties, but never read the whole thing. I browsed through it, and read bits and pieces, but never did a close reading. I think I was finally ready to understand his work when I started reading this book a few weeks ago.Some of the best experience in life is when you nurture some thoughts for a long time, and gradually they take shape in your mind, and then one day you read a book that articulates those same thoughts, but in a more organized way. That was my experience with this book. I have been reading a lot about consciousness for the last few years. They covered a wide spectrum from strong dualist views who are convinced that there is something non-physical about our mind, to people who believe that consciousness is a quantum phenomenon, to people who believe it is an universal field-like thing giving every object a degree of consciousness, and then people who believe that it is a very powerful illusion that is almost impossible to shake off. This book makes a very strong case for the last viewpoint.If you are interested in this topic then I think this book should be in your reading list, irrespective of which point-of-view you currently support, as long as you have kept an open mind about it. The arguments here are very strong. Though, I have to say, at times he takes his analogical methods a little too far, and someone can find holes in the parallel he is drawing between the real problem and the analog. Even in those cases his intelligence and insightfulness come through, and the text remains enjoyable. What he presents here is not a scholarly argument. It is intended for curious readers interested in this deep question, and nudges them towards accepting his view. You may not be convinced, but I'll be surprised if he cannot introduce some serious doubts in your current perspective."
187,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6805662-bhashit-parikh,5,"The arguments for consciousness out of purely physical processes are brilliant, and Hofstadter is so much fun to read. The arguments about consciousness arising out of the strange loops is very fascinating to say the least."
188,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24849811-andreea-reads,4,*my brain needs to cool down a bit after this read.
189,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,3,"Douglas Hofstadter is a quirky and entertaining writer, though not as systematic as I would like. He starts off with the interesting insight that the I (or the self, or consciousness) is a strange feedback loop similar to an audio feedback loop or a video feedback loop. Audio feedback takes place when a microphone picks up its own background noise, and then endlessly rebroadcasts it as a screech. Video feedback occurs if a video camera is pointed at the video screen showing what the camera is picking up, thus yielding a similar endless loop.What these phenomena have in common is self-reference, the ability of a machine (or an algorithm or a language or a person) to represent itself. Thus a video screen showing itself showing itself showing itself… is similar to consciousness being aware of itself being aware of itself being aware of itself….Hofstadter goes on to connect these feedback loops with the paradoxes of self-reference important in mathematical history, such as the liar’s paradox. The town liar says that he is lying. If he is lying, he is telling the truth. If he is telling the truth, he is lying. Bertrand Russell developed the Theory of Types so as to prevent self-reference (and paradox) in the foundations of mathematics. But Kurt Godel proved that within Russell’s system there are true statements that cannot be proven, showing that self-referential paradoxes can sneak back in, even when they have been systematically ruled out.Hofstadter’s treatment of Godel’s Proof is one of the best discussions I have seen (and I have read the classic Nagel-Newman introductory text). In a nutshell, Hofstadter points out that a mathematical system as rich as the Russell-Whitehead system can say things about it’s own structure (i.e., be self-referential), even though that has been supposedly ruled out by its own construction rules.What I miss in Hofstadter’s discussion is how the paradoxes of self-reference cast light on consciousness. Hofstadter points out that not all self-reference is paradoxical (there is no truth-teller’s paradox). Self-referential paradoxes in consciousness might be something like Groucho Marx’s joke that he would not belong to a club that would have him as a member. In a more serious vein, self-referential paradox does mirror the human experience of judging (and therefore being different from) oneself.Hofstadter spends a lot of time mourning the premature loss of his wife, and analyzing his sense that she is not completely gone, but lives on in the thought-patterns and self-referential loops that he shared with her. That discussion is touching and personally appealing. Along the way, he wants to argue that consciousness is an illusion, that it is a changing collection of thought-patterns that can be spread over different brains and machines. He argues that he is not the same person that he was the day before, or that he will be the next day, because he is constantly having new experiences and forgetting things.Here I think he goes too far. A person, a self, a consciousness, has a continuity of experience that extends from birth to the present moment, and also envisages the future. This is what it means to be human, to make a single project out of one’s life (thank you, Heidegger), however self-referential that may be. If I am not the same person as my childhood self, then how did I ever grow up?I said I wished Hofstadter were more systematic. Akeel Bilgrami (in Self-Knowledge and Resentment) has gone into much more detail in analyzing how self-reference (or a metalinguistic level of comment) is core to such philosophical concepts as agency, value, intentionality and self-knowledge. Very briefly, to be a moral agent, to value something, to intend something, and to know oneself, all of these core philosophical activities involve not only doing something (which a robot can do), but recognizing that I am doing it. This kind of analysis, to my mind, is extraordinarily fruitful, and what I wish I had seen more of in Hofstadter."
190,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"Hofstadter, who became famous with his 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, now tackles the task of defining the self, “I,” consciousness, and the soul, all of which he sees as the same thing. He approaches the question with both science and philosophy, although the book is more philosophical than scientific.So, what’s the “loop”? He means a feedback loop, like the squeal of a PA system, although he’s more interested in what happens when you point a video camera at its own monitor. What you often get is an image of something that doesn’t really exist—except how can you say it doesn’t exist when you’re looking right at it? The human mind can look at itself, and that, too, can create images of things that “don’t really exist.” Unlike the video setup, though, the human mind can to some degree alter itself based on that image—which in turn can alter what it sees when it next looks at itself.Hofstadter builds on this self-referential feedback loop with forays into mathematics, biology, computer science, brain science, art, music, religion, the work of other philosophers, his own life, and his own and others’ thought experiments. Escher, Bach, and especially Gödel all put in appearances. This isn’t a book that zooms in on one definite answer that renders all others irrelevant. Rather, it gently leads you to think in new ways about “yourself,” which you might never look at again in quite the same way.Hofstadter writes clearly, with creativity, humor, and a unique way of looking at the world. He also makes numerous digressions, which are usually interesting even if not always strictly on point and sometimes too lengthy.He sees no need to invoke nonphysical entities, spirits, or gods to explain self and consciousness, but he also says we’ll never be able to open a human skull and pinpoint the exact brain structure or clump of neurons that house “I.” So, this book isn’t going to please either strict materialists or dogmatic dualists, which is probably a good thing."
191,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Hofstadter presents what strikes me as a convincing philosophical model of a non-dualistic world in which it is unnecessary to divide our experiences into material and spiritual components, or to hold on to the familiar and comforting concept of an immaterial ""soul."" Along the way, the reader is required to jump some pretty formidable hurdles, including a chapter that summarizes Kurt Godel's famous incompleteness theorem. I banged myself up pretty good trying to jump that one (but thanks to some help from a friend, I did attain a certain level of insight).If you are wondering how the ""self"" and ""consciousness"" can be accounted for in relatively materialistic terms, then this book is an excellent starting point. Hofstadter succeeds in presenting his ideas with humor, compassion, and much creativity.Many of the ideas Hofstadter presents in this book are familiar to me because they have materialized out of my own experience. For example: the notion that one personality can overlap with another's (so, in a sense, the dead can temporarily live on in the minds of their friends and loved ones); or the notion that I am not really the same person I was ten years ago (the Ship of Theseus paradox); or the notion of an ""inverted spectrum"" (the question of whether two people see the same ""red,"" or instead actually see different colors but merely call them by the same name?). Hofstadter demolishes the ""inverted spectrum"" thesis with little difficulty. I'll never wonder about that one again! H's conclusions regarding the phenomenon of human consciousness are somewhat tentative, because he's a humble person who is willing to explore opposing points of view and willing to admit that so much remains unknown. Nevertheless, I felt that he succeeded in showing that a materialistic viewpoint is more consistent and plausible than a dualistic viewpoint. Overall, an impressive performance!"
192,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3008879-dominikus,4,"A very personal and insightful book. As a long-time fan of Hofstadter's 'Gödel Escher Bach' I was glad to read this official 'sequel'. Hofstadter professes that he wants to use this book to clarify the points that he tried to make 30 years earlier, especially when it comes to the nature of consciousness. This naturally leads to some repetition: for example, since Gödel's destruction of Principia Mathematica builds his central argument about minds being strange loops, Hofstadter spends some time on that. But fortunately, the whole book is written in a very engaging and entertaining way, so even the more complex parts never feel like a chore.The core idea - spoilers ahead - about consciousness being a phenomenon naturally emerging from the complexity of any symbol processing apparatus is convincingly introduced and explained. Hofstadter's ousting of dualism forces him to arrive at the conclusion that consciousness is an illusion that consciousness plays on itself (in true strange loop fashion) and that ideas like an eternal 'I' or soul could not exist since they would lead to an infinite regress. While he's at killing sacred cows, he also denies the idea of a free will.These somewhat bleak results are loosened by Hofstadter's meditations on the spreading of personalities across minds (so death is more of a fading away than an abrupt ending of a person), ways to measure the size of a soul (hint: empathy is important), and others. Yet, these somewhat meandering chapters also led me to give only four out of five stars. The author takes about half of the book to arrive at the nature of strange loops and dwells long on things that obviously fascinate him but might not be as engaging for the reader. Some editing would have been in order there.Overall, however, this is an important book and Hofstadter was able to convince me of his conclusion when it comes to the nature of consciousness. Every being that feels like having an 'I' should read this."
193,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"A good introduction to Hofstadter's ideas about consciousness, in a considerably shorter package than Godel, Escher, Bach. Hofstadter is at his best in the first half of the book, when he's outlining his idea of the ""strange loop"" and discussing how it connects to his other ideas about the mind. His discussion of Godel and incompleteness is also excellent-- I'd read another book on the same subject, but Hofstadter did a much better job of getting the ideas across. After that, the book goes off on a little bit of a tangent about the degree to which one person's consciousness can spread (at lower levels of resolution and fidelity) to another person's mind. He really believes in the strong form of this idea, which implies that another person's consciousness can run in some degree on a different brain, with all that implies (a sense of interiority, etc.) It's a hard thing to swallow without scientific evidence, and you get the sense that the author might have been unduly influenced in his views by the tragic early death of his wife-- and is engaging in a little bit of wishful philosophizing about her soul's survival. The book returns to form in a rousing deconstruction and refutation of dualism, and concludes nicely with the author applying his ideas to the phenomenons of empathy and friendship. All in all, definitely a nice place to start in your investigation of Philosophy of Mind. "
194,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,3,"I enjoyed reading this foray by Hofstadter into coming to terms with that slippery concept we call 'I'; the style is cheeky, cheerful, very witty (perhaps too witty for some tastes). The subject of this book is elusive and slippery as ever; but it is of interest to anyone trying to grapple with this mercurial subject. Linked with 'I' is the concept of 'self', and by association, 'mind', 'soul', and 'conscience'. Hofstadter masterfully guides us through all the labyrinthian pathways, sometimes playing with us, endlessly punning (perhaps too much so for my taste), yet treats us kindly through the journey. He had many insights to provide, and does not shy away from the paradoxes involved. Nor does he fear to go into some very dense and some quite difficult terrain; but his hand is firm and steady, and he does get you through, even though you might not fully understand every step.Whether he is totally convincing in his conclusions is problematic: and Hofstadter readily acknowledges this. But he feels that what he and we as readers gain from the journey well outweighs any 'negatives' we might feel (they are 'negatives' but only in the sense that it makes us question, perhaps, some of our most cherished sacred cows about ourselves).Whether this is good or bad for you is neither here nor there. Anyone who is intrigued by the idea of who or what ""I"" is [sic] will find this book stimulating and thought-provoking."
195,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537281-ronny,1,"I didn't finish the book.This book is supposedly about consciousness. However, what I read were random ruminations that (at best) briefly connected with the promised subject matter.For instance, near the beginning, the author wrote at length about vegetarianism. Near the end of this section, he briefly segued into the concept of degrees of consciousness, but did not develop it. This was a shame because that would have been interesting and on-topic -- more interesting and on-topic than the vegetarian ruminations that dominated that section.I then started skimming. When I dipped in to read, I encountered more off-topic ruminations.Then I stopped entirely.In and of itself, the book may have been interesting, but the description was deceptive.Maybe the book got on track later on, but that doesn't matter. Going off on a tangent near the beginning is poor writing, and if it alienates the reader early on so s/he doesn't give the book a chance later, that's solely the author's fault.If the book consisted mainly of off-topic ruminations with a quick segue into consciousness, then it's deceptive since the bulk of the book should be about consciousness, not the other way around.Since I got this book for its description (consciousness), I am judging it by that. On that count, it fails."
196,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18930784-me,3,"I've been interested in reading Hofstadter since his name came up as author of Godel, Escher, Bach, as discussed in The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, and I realized that this was same person who edited Godel's Proof which I had earlier read. His name came up again in Gleick's 'The Information: A history, a theory, a flood', so then I set off to read his work.Half-way through, I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars. Really enjoyed the commentary on Godel's proof and the idea of consciousness as a similar ""strange loop"" based on abstract symbol system that can be turned upon itself. However, I think the book become rather repetitive, and a bit ""preachy"" over the second half--less backed by analogy to mathematical and physical structures and perhaps a bit too much about Hofstadter's opinions regarding morality and aesthetics (which I concurred with throughout, but felt somewhat detracted rather than enhanced his thesis). Overall, still a very interesting read and recommended. Other readers may find the book much more powerful or rewarding for the same reasons I found it diluted. I am a strange loop."
197,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11041240-zarathustra-goertzel,4,"87.5% good book.I Am a Strange Loop reads like a comfy fireplace chat with a profoundly warmhearted (""large souled"") man. A Strange Loop is in essence a causal-loop among k abstraction levels (with k > 1).E.g., macro-properties influencing micro-happenings, hich in turn make up the macro-properties.The discussion and build-up of strange loops feels like a glorious Safari journey, including his beloved Gödelian loop. There are fun ideas about how we live in each other, etc. (Which, of course, would become even more fun if something akin to Morphic Resonance were to be the case :'D).To be disappointment, however, Douglas does not consider how people can, in a sense, develop past the ""I"" -- in a sense adding yet more abstraction-level distance to the loopiness ;-)He devotes a mere sentence to the topic. Finally, the discussions of Cartesian Egos, Zombies, and Sacred Cows are fairly lackluster and shallow, with some boiling down to ""I don't understand it, so it's wrong"". Seems he's very good at expositing ideas he understands, but not so much at rebutting others (or even mentally modeling others' weird ideas xD).All in all a fairly enjoyable, easy, insightful read :)"
198,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666609-dusty-rhodes,3,"Hofstadter is a victim of his own influence. The ideas in this book are extensions of the ideas he presented in Godel, Escher, Bach and are still interesting thoughts clearly presented. I am a Strange loop is, however, a far inferior book. Or at least, a book of a different style. Hofstadter has traded in his incredibly complex and beautiful structural sense of humor for cringe-worthy puns.That being said, he's not a novelist. The concepts wrestled with here provide an intriguing lens through which to view what exactly consciousness is. The issue is that the quality of the writing varies just as wildly as the focus. His repetition of concepts without the enlightening playfulness of GEB wears on my strange loop.However, if you enjoyed the *ideas* of Hofstadter, read this.

The book is a valiant but hopeless attempt to understand human consciousness. Hofstadter loves feedback loops, and thinks that feedback loops in our brains give us the “I” feeling. I wasn’t at all convinced.But the book has a couple of interesting ideas. One is that souls have different sizes. Mature adults have fairly large souls (Albert Schweitzer’s was huge), babies have little souls, dogs smaller yet, and mosquitoes and bacteria have teeny tiny souls.Hofstadter seems a pretty mellow guy, so I was surprised at the edge in his comments about his fellow philosopher John Searle."

His Fluid Analogy stuff contain good examples.If I understand The Strange Loop properly, he's exploring the idea that consciousness if simply an illusion looking at an illusion.

215,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh,2,"“Dreary, oh so dreary”, remarks an imaginary sceptical reader at the start of chapter 20 of I Am A Strange Loop, highly unimpressed with the implications of Hofstadter’s stance on the nature of consciousness. I don’t share this imaginary reader’s dismay at Hofstadter’s point of view, but their words do fairly accurately sum up my opinion of Strange Loop as a whole, and hence their appearance at the opening of this review too.When flicking through this book in the shop, I thought it was going to be a dense, perhaps difficult to grasp, but richly rewarding and thought-provoking read that might well change the way I thought not just about myself but also about the world around me. Unfortunately, the first two thirds of it – honestly, that’s no exaggeration – have almost nothing at all to say about consciousness, beyond one or two very meat-and-potatoes little scene-setters; instead, Hofstadter blathers on and on about what he thinks are enlightening analogies to consciousness, such as various forms of feedback and self-referential mathematical formulas, every once in a while teasing you by seeming to be about to finally tackle things head-on, before once again maddeningly invoking yet another analogy or – worse still – going back over something that he already tortured you with for several chapters earlier on. Now, I realise that it’s these analogies and Hofstadter’s approach that make this book unique, and it’s obvious that Hofstadter himself considers these chapters to indeed be talking about consciousness, albeit in a roundabout way, but even leaving aside the subjective question of whether these analogies are at all helpful for understanding the actually pretty straightforward topics the book eeeeevvvvveeeeentually goes on to discuss, I really don’t see how you can justify spending 200+ pages setting the scene. Sure, use your analogies to present things in various different ways in order to cater for the various different means of understanding that the varied brains of your varied readers might have, but please please do so succinctly, and please punctuate your meanderings with sections of real meaty content here and there, so as to also satisfy the cravings of those of us that like things direct and to the point! Lists of twenty or so examples when three or four would suffice are particularly wearisome...Anyway, eventually the book does lift up its skirts and give you a brief flash of the flesh for which you paid your entrance fee, and things do perk up a fair bit then, although only for a little while. The most interesting question pondered is whether people’s brains are able to contain within them not just one consciousness (your “I”), but two, three or however many, if only in part. In a remarkably honest, touching and personal section, Hofstadter talks about his late wife and her death, and how through the closeness of their relationship he gradually incorporated many of her traits and memories into himself, and he posits that this incorporation may have resulted in the partial duplication of her consciousness within his own brain (and that this also happens to you too). This was an idea at which I initially balked, but Hofstadter does argue it pretty convincingly, and he’s fully aware of (and discusses) the points at which it is most difficult to accept as well as what’s required at an anatomical level for it to be true. He doesn’t claim to reach any strong conclusions, he just lays out his thoughts on the matter and hopes that you’ll keep an open mind and perhaps come around to his views to at least some extent. I did come around a little, but he failed to convince me on certain key points. However, I think this is a matter on which ones thoughts might change as one forges stronger relationships throughout one’s life, so I’ll try to remember to consider it again a little further down the line.As I said, that’s the most interesting question pondered in this on-topic final third. I’m afraid a fair amount of the rest of it I found boring and frustrating or else downright aggravating. For example, the twentieth chapter is a fictional conversation between two people, one of whom thinks that there must be something above and beyond simple neuronal activation required for consciousness, and one of whom does not. It’s aimed at people with at least one foot in the first camp, so for readers already standing with both feet squarely in the second it quickly becomes very tedious indeed, as you’re forced to suffer through query after query and response after response in which you’ve absolutely no interest – this is one of the longest chapters in the book, and it certainly feels like it.In another chapter Hofstadter claims to put to bed a couple of objections (“sacred cows”) that philosophers commonly raise to notions of the similarity of different consciousnesses, the first of which is the “problem of the inverted spectrum” – the idea that one person’s sensory input may be inverted in some respect to another person’s, and that this would make them so different that they could never truly know what it’s like to be each other (for example, one person seeing red where the other sees blue). And yes, Hofstadter does go on to address this, but I don’t understand why the inputs must be completely inverted, and not simply significantly different, which is an altogether different kettle of fish. For example, the proportion of cone cells that I have that perceive light of a certain wavelength may differ significantly from the proportion that you have, and this may cause us to perceive colours slightly differently. Perhaps not differently enough to have a substantial effect on our respective consciousnesses, but who knows? Or take taste as another example – my girlfriend absolutely loves sushi, and feels energised and invigorated after eating it, whereas I find it bland and completely unsatisfying. So there are unquestionably degrees of variation between people that, cumulatively, make the way we perceive our worlds as a whole substantially different. For me Hofstadter’s slaying of this “sacred cow” is more a putdown of a straw man, and even if the problem is frequently raised in this form of a total sensory inversion, I would expect a man of Hofstadter’s reasoning ability to do a better job of extrapolating the argument to its more worthwhile alternative.Hofstadter’s style is engaging, but that only compensates for the almost unbelievable lack of directness to a small extent. In the introduction Hofstadter tells us how this book started life as a request for a chapter’s worth of content from the compilers of an anthology, and ended up becoming two chapters of that book and then, eventually, I Am A Strange Loop. Well, I haven’t read that anthology, but I think there probably is about enough real content here for around two very decent chapters of a book much wider in scope, so my advice to you if you’re considering reading Strange Loop is to do a little digging and perhaps give that anthology your attention instead."
216,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"I read Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach in my college days. While I loved the book, looking back I realize that the appreciation was not deep enough. I was impressed by the novelty and surface gloss of his thinking, but I was not yet ready to understand the depth of the book. Then I purchased The Mind's I in the eighties, but never read the whole thing. I browsed through it, and read bits and pieces, but never did a close reading. I think I was finally ready to understand his work when I started reading this book a few weeks ago.Some of the best experience in life is when you nurture some thoughts for a long time, and gradually they take shape in your mind, and then one day you read a book that articulates those same thoughts, but in a more organized way. That was my experience with this book. I have been reading a lot about consciousness for the last few years. They covered a wide spectrum from strong dualist views who are convinced that there is something non-physical about our mind, to people who believe that consciousness is a quantum phenomenon, to people who believe it is an universal field-like thing giving every object a degree of consciousness, and then people who believe that it is a very powerful illusion that is almost impossible to shake off. This book makes a very strong case for the last viewpoint.If you are interested in this topic then I think this book should be in your reading list, irrespective of which point-of-view you currently support, as long as you have kept an open mind about it. The arguments here are very strong. Though, I have to say, at times he takes his analogical methods a little too far, and someone can find holes in the parallel he is drawing between the real problem and the analog. Even in those cases his intelligence and insightfulness come through, and the text remains enjoyable. What he presents here is not a scholarly argument. It is intended for curious readers interested in this deep question, and nudges them towards accepting his view. You may not be convinced, but I'll be surprised if he cannot introduce some serious doubts in your current perspective."
217,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6805662-bhashit-parikh,5,"The arguments for consciousness out of purely physical processes are brilliant, and Hofstadter is so much fun to read. The arguments about consciousness arising out of the strange loops is very fascinating to say the least."
218,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24849811-andreea-reads,4,*my brain needs to cool down a bit after this read.
219,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,3,"Douglas Hofstadter is a quirky and entertaining writer, though not as systematic as I would like. He starts off with the interesting insight that the I (or the self, or consciousness) is a strange feedback loop similar to an audio feedback loop or a video feedback loop. Audio feedback takes place when a microphone picks up its own background noise, and then endlessly rebroadcasts it as a screech. Video feedback occurs if a video camera is pointed at the video screen showing what the camera is picking up, thus yielding a similar endless loop.What these phenomena have in common is self-reference, the ability of a machine (or an algorithm or a language or a person) to represent itself. Thus a video screen showing itself showing itself showing itself… is similar to consciousness being aware of itself being aware of itself being aware of itself….Hofstadter goes on to connect these feedback loops with the paradoxes of self-reference important in mathematical history, such as the liar’s paradox. The town liar says that he is lying. If he is lying, he is telling the truth. If he is telling the truth, he is lying. Bertrand Russell developed the Theory of Types so as to prevent self-reference (and paradox) in the foundations of mathematics. But Kurt Godel proved that within Russell’s system there are true statements that cannot be proven, showing that self-referential paradoxes can sneak back in, even when they have been systematically ruled out.Hofstadter’s treatment of Godel’s Proof is one of the best discussions I have seen (and I have read the classic Nagel-Newman introductory text). In a nutshell, Hofstadter points out that a mathematical system as rich as the Russell-Whitehead system can say things about it’s own structure (i.e., be self-referential), even though that has been supposedly ruled out by its own construction rules.What I miss in Hofstadter’s discussion is how the paradoxes of self-reference cast light on consciousness. Hofstadter points out that not all self-reference is paradoxical (there is no truth-teller’s paradox). Self-referential paradoxes in consciousness might be something like Groucho Marx’s joke that he would not belong to a club that would have him as a member. In a more serious vein, self-referential paradox does mirror the human experience of judging (and therefore being different from) oneself.Hofstadter spends a lot of time mourning the premature loss of his wife, and analyzing his sense that she is not completely gone, but lives on in the thought-patterns and self-referential loops that he shared with her. That discussion is touching and personally appealing. Along the way, he wants to argue that consciousness is an illusion, that it is a changing collection of thought-patterns that can be spread over different brains and machines. He argues that he is not the same person that he was the day before, or that he will be the next day, because he is constantly having new experiences and forgetting things.Here I think he goes too far. A person, a self, a consciousness, has a continuity of experience that extends from birth to the present moment, and also envisages the future. This is what it means to be human, to make a single project out of one’s life (thank you, Heidegger), however self-referential that may be. If I am not the same person as my childhood self, then how did I ever grow up?I said I wished Hofstadter were more systematic. Akeel Bilgrami (in Self-Knowledge and Resentment) has gone into much more detail in analyzing how self-reference (or a metalinguistic level of comment) is core to such philosophical concepts as agency, value, intentionality and self-knowledge. Very briefly, to be a moral agent, to value something, to intend something, and to know oneself, all of these core philosophical activities involve not only doing something (which a robot can do), but recognizing that I am doing it. This kind of analysis, to my mind, is extraordinarily fruitful, and what I wish I had seen more of in Hofstadter."
220,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"Hofstadter, who became famous with his 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, now tackles the task of defining the self, “I,” consciousness, and the soul, all of which he sees as the same thing. He approaches the question with both science and philosophy, although the book is more philosophical than scientific.So, what’s the “loop”? He means a feedback loop, like the squeal of a PA system, although he’s more interested in what happens when you point a video camera at its own monitor. What you often get is an image of something that doesn’t really exist—except how can you say it doesn’t exist when you’re looking right at it? The human mind can look at itself, and that, too, can create images of things that “don’t really exist.” Unlike the video setup, though, the human mind can to some degree alter itself based on that image—which in turn can alter what it sees when it next looks at itself.Hofstadter builds on this self-referential feedback loop with forays into mathematics, biology, computer science, brain science, art, music, religion, the work of other philosophers, his own life, and his own and others’ thought experiments. Escher, Bach, and especially Gödel all put in appearances. This isn’t a book that zooms in on one definite answer that renders all others irrelevant. Rather, it gently leads you to think in new ways about “yourself,” which you might never look at again in quite the same way.Hofstadter writes clearly, with creativity, humor, and a unique way of looking at the world. He also makes numerous digressions, which are usually interesting even if not always strictly on point and sometimes too lengthy.He sees no need to invoke nonphysical entities, spirits, or gods to explain self and consciousness, but he also says we’ll never be able to open a human skull and pinpoint the exact brain structure or clump of neurons that house “I.” So, this book isn’t going to please either strict materialists or dogmatic dualists, which is probably a good thing."
221,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Hofstadter presents what strikes me as a convincing philosophical model of a non-dualistic world in which it is unnecessary to divide our experiences into material and spiritual components, or to hold on to the familiar and comforting concept of an immaterial ""soul."" Along the way, the reader is required to jump some pretty formidable hurdles, including a chapter that summarizes Kurt Godel's famous incompleteness theorem. I banged myself up pretty good trying to jump that one (but thanks to some help from a friend, I did attain a certain level of insight).If you are wondering how the ""self"" and ""consciousness"" can be accounted for in relatively materialistic terms, then this book is an excellent starting point. Hofstadter succeeds in presenting his ideas with humor, compassion, and much creativity.Many of the ideas Hofstadter presents in this book are familiar to me because they have materialized out of my own experience. For example: the notion that one personality can overlap with another's (so, in a sense, the dead can temporarily live on in the minds of their friends and loved ones); or the notion that I am not really the same person I was ten years ago (the Ship of Theseus paradox); or the notion of an ""inverted spectrum"" (the question of whether two people see the same ""red,"" or instead actually see different colors but merely call them by the same name?). Hofstadter demolishes the ""inverted spectrum"" thesis with little difficulty. I'll never wonder about that one again! H's conclusions regarding the phenomenon of human consciousness are somewhat tentative, because he's a humble person who is willing to explore opposing points of view and willing to admit that so much remains unknown. Nevertheless, I felt that he succeeded in showing that a materialistic viewpoint is more consistent and plausible than a dualistic viewpoint. Overall, an impressive performance!"
222,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3008879-dominikus,4,"A very personal and insightful book. As a long-time fan of Hofstadter's 'Gödel Escher Bach' I was glad to read this official 'sequel'. Hofstadter professes that he wants to use this book to clarify the points that he tried to make 30 years earlier, especially when it comes to the nature of consciousness. This naturally leads to some repetition: for example, since Gödel's destruction of Principia Mathematica builds his central argument about minds being strange loops, Hofstadter spends some time on that. But fortunately, the whole book is written in a very engaging and entertaining way, so even the more complex parts never feel like a chore.The core idea - spoilers ahead - about consciousness being a phenomenon naturally emerging from the complexity of any symbol processing apparatus is convincingly introduced and explained. Hofstadter's ousting of dualism forces him to arrive at the conclusion that consciousness is an illusion that consciousness plays on itself (in true strange loop fashion) and that ideas like an eternal 'I' or soul could not exist since they would lead to an infinite regress. While he's at killing sacred cows, he also denies the idea of a free will.These somewhat bleak results are loosened by Hofstadter's meditations on the spreading of personalities across minds (so death is more of a fading away than an abrupt ending of a person), ways to measure the size of a soul (hint: empathy is important), and others. Yet, these somewhat meandering chapters also led me to give only four out of five stars. The author takes about half of the book to arrive at the nature of strange loops and dwells long on things that obviously fascinate him but might not be as engaging for the reader. Some editing would have been in order there.Overall, however, this is an important book and Hofstadter was able to convince me of his conclusion when it comes to the nature of consciousness. Every being that feels like having an 'I' should read this."
223,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"A good introduction to Hofstadter's ideas about consciousness, in a considerably shorter package than Godel, Escher, Bach. Hofstadter is at his best in the first half of the book, when he's outlining his idea of the ""strange loop"" and discussing how it connects to his other ideas about the mind. His discussion of Godel and incompleteness is also excellent-- I'd read another book on the same subject, but Hofstadter did a much better job of getting the ideas across. After that, the book goes off on a little bit of a tangent about the degree to which one person's consciousness can spread (at lower levels of resolution and fidelity) to another person's mind. He really believes in the strong form of this idea, which implies that another person's consciousness can run in some degree on a different brain, with all that implies (a sense of interiority, etc.) It's a hard thing to swallow without scientific evidence, and you get the sense that the author might have been unduly influenced in his views by the tragic early death of his wife-- and is engaging in a little bit of wishful philosophizing about her soul's survival. The book returns to form in a rousing deconstruction and refutation of dualism, and concludes nicely with the author applying his ideas to the phenomenons of empathy and friendship. All in all, definitely a nice place to start in your investigation of Philosophy of Mind. "
224,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,3,"I enjoyed reading this foray by Hofstadter into coming to terms with that slippery concept we call 'I'; the style is cheeky, cheerful, very witty (perhaps too witty for some tastes). The subject of this book is elusive and slippery as ever; but it is of interest to anyone trying to grapple with this mercurial subject. Linked with 'I' is the concept of 'self', and by association, 'mind', 'soul', and 'conscience'. Hofstadter masterfully guides us through all the labyrinthian pathways, sometimes playing with us, endlessly punning (perhaps too much so for my taste), yet treats us kindly through the journey. He had many insights to provide, and does not shy away from the paradoxes involved. Nor does he fear to go into some very dense and some quite difficult terrain; but his hand is firm and steady, and he does get you through, even though you might not fully understand every step.Whether he is totally convincing in his conclusions is problematic: and Hofstadter readily acknowledges this. But he feels that what he and we as readers gain from the journey well outweighs any 'negatives' we might feel (they are 'negatives' but only in the sense that it makes us question, perhaps, some of our most cherished sacred cows about ourselves).Whether this is good or bad for you is neither here nor there. Anyone who is intrigued by the idea of who or what ""I"" is [sic] will find this book stimulating and thought-provoking."
225,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537281-ronny,1,"I didn't finish the book.This book is supposedly about consciousness. However, what I read were random ruminations that (at best) briefly connected with the promised subject matter.For instance, near the beginning, the author wrote at length about vegetarianism. Near the end of this section, he briefly segued into the concept of degrees of consciousness, but did not develop it. This was a shame because that would have been interesting and on-topic -- more interesting and on-topic than the vegetarian ruminations that dominated that section.I then started skimming. When I dipped in to read, I encountered more off-topic ruminations.Then I stopped entirely.In and of itself, the book may have been interesting, but the description was deceptive.Maybe the book got on track later on, but that doesn't matter. Going off on a tangent near the beginning is poor writing, and if it alienates the reader early on so s/he doesn't give the book a chance later, that's solely the author's fault.If the book consisted mainly of off-topic ruminations with a quick segue into consciousness, then it's deceptive since the bulk of the book should be about consciousness, not the other way around.Since I got this book for its description (consciousness), I am judging it by that. On that count, it fails."
226,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18930784-me,3,"I've been interested in reading Hofstadter since his name came up as author of Godel, Escher, Bach, as discussed in The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, and I realized that this was same person who edited Godel's Proof which I had earlier read. His name came up again in Gleick's 'The Information: A history, a theory, a flood', so then I set off to read his work.Half-way through, I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars. Really enjoyed the commentary on Godel's proof and the idea of consciousness as a similar ""strange loop"" based on abstract symbol system that can be turned upon itself. However, I think the book become rather repetitive, and a bit ""preachy"" over the second half--less backed by analogy to mathematical and physical structures and perhaps a bit too much about Hofstadter's opinions regarding morality and aesthetics (which I concurred with throughout, but felt somewhat detracted rather than enhanced his thesis). Overall, still a very interesting read and recommended. Other readers may find the book much more powerful or rewarding for the same reasons I found it diluted. I am a strange loop."
227,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11041240-zarathustra-goertzel,4,"87.5% good book.I Am a Strange Loop reads like a comfy fireplace chat with a profoundly warmhearted (""large souled"") man. A Strange Loop is in essence a causal-loop among k abstraction levels (with k > 1).E.g., macro-properties influencing micro-happenings, hich in turn make up the macro-properties.The discussion and build-up of strange loops feels like a glorious Safari journey, including his beloved Gödelian loop. There are fun ideas about how we live in each other, etc. (Which, of course, would become even more fun if something akin to Morphic Resonance were to be the case :'D).To be disappointment, however, Douglas does not consider how people can, in a sense, develop past the ""I"" -- in a sense adding yet more abstraction-level distance to the loopiness ;-)He devotes a mere sentence to the topic. Finally, the discussions of Cartesian Egos, Zombies, and Sacred Cows are fairly lackluster and shallow, with some boiling down to ""I don't understand it, so it's wrong"". Seems he's very good at expositing ideas he understands, but not so much at rebutting others (or even mentally modeling others' weird ideas xD).All in all a fairly enjoyable, easy, insightful read :)"
228,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666609-dusty-rhodes,3,"Hofstadter is a victim of his own influence. The ideas in this book are extensions of the ideas he presented in Godel, Escher, Bach and are still interesting thoughts clearly presented. I am a Strange loop is, however, a far inferior book. Or at least, a book of a different style. Hofstadter has traded in his incredibly complex and beautiful structural sense of humor for cringe-worthy puns.That being said, he's not a novelist. The concepts wrestled with here provide an intriguing lens through which to view what exactly consciousness is. The issue is that the quality of the writing varies just as wildly as the focus. His repetition of concepts without the enlightening playfulness of GEB wears on my strange loop.However, if you enjoyed the *ideas* of Hofstadter, read this. Just be prepared for the decline in concern for the craft of creating the book as a whole. Which is, what elevated GEB in the first place."

The book is a valiant but hopeless attempt to understand human consciousness. Hofstadter loves feedback loops, and thinks that feedback loops in our brains give us the “I” feeling. I wasn’t at all convinced.But the book has a couple of interesting ideas. One is that souls have different sizes. Mature adults have fairly large souls (Albert Schweitzer’s was huge), babies have little souls, dogs smaller yet, and mosquitoes and bacteria have teeny tiny souls.Hofstadter seems a pretty mellow guy, so I was surprised at the edge in his comments about his fellow philosopher John Searle."

His Fluid Analogy stuff contain good examples.If I understand The Strange Loop properly, he's exploring the idea that consciousness if simply an illusion looking at an illusion. Wow!His thinking about the continued existence of his dead wife within his own mind is very thought provoking and I suspect has some merit.

Half of the book discusses the Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which posits the limitations of the Principia Mathematica, and self-referential loops. In the other half of the book, author argues that there is no such thing as ""I""; and the concept of 'I' is a myth! It's just an hallucination hallucinated by hallucination. And he further adds that, a man can inhabit multiple brains in their careenium/skulls. A very profound and different book to what I have read so far!"

I enjoyed the refresher course on Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, and found the idea of Godel's reflexive use of Principia Mathematica as an analogue for self-perception interesting, but in the end I'm afraid I'll never be sold on the notion of self as nothing more than an illusion, however trenchant.

245,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh,2,"“Dreary, oh so dreary”, remarks an imaginary sceptical reader at the start of chapter 20 of I Am A Strange Loop, highly unimpressed with the implications of Hofstadter’s stance on the nature of consciousness. I don’t share this imaginary reader’s dismay at Hofstadter’s point of view, but their words do fairly accurately sum up my opinion of Strange Loop as a whole, and hence their appearance at the opening of this review too.When flicking through this book in the shop, I thought it was going to be a dense, perhaps difficult to grasp, but richly rewarding and thought-provoking read that might well change the way I thought not just about myself but also about the world around me. Unfortunately, the first two thirds of it – honestly, that’s no exaggeration – have almost nothing at all to say about consciousness, beyond one or two very meat-and-potatoes little scene-setters; instead, Hofstadter blathers on and on about what he thinks are enlightening analogies to consciousness, such as various forms of feedback and self-referential mathematical formulas, every once in a while teasing you by seeming to be about to finally tackle things head-on, before once again maddeningly invoking yet another analogy or – worse still – going back over something that he already tortured you with for several chapters earlier on. Now, I realise that it’s these analogies and Hofstadter’s approach that make this book unique, and it’s obvious that Hofstadter himself considers these chapters to indeed be talking about consciousness, albeit in a roundabout way, but even leaving aside the subjective question of whether these analogies are at all helpful for understanding the actually pretty straightforward topics the book eeeeevvvvveeeeentually goes on to discuss, I really don’t see how you can justify spending 200+ pages setting the scene. Sure, use your analogies to present things in various different ways in order to cater for the various different means of understanding that the varied brains of your varied readers might have, but please please do so succinctly, and please punctuate your meanderings with sections of real meaty content here and there, so as to also satisfy the cravings of those of us that like things direct and to the point! Lists of twenty or so examples when three or four would suffice are particularly wearisome...Anyway, eventually the book does lift up its skirts and give you a brief flash of the flesh for which you paid your entrance fee, and things do perk up a fair bit then, although only for a little while. The most interesting question pondered is whether people’s brains are able to contain within them not just one consciousness (your “I”), but two, three or however many, if only in part. In a remarkably honest, touching and personal section, Hofstadter talks about his late wife and her death, and how through the closeness of their relationship he gradually incorporated many of her traits and memories into himself, and he posits that this incorporation may have resulted in the partial duplication of her consciousness within his own brain (and that this also happens to you too). This was an idea at which I initially balked, but Hofstadter does argue it pretty convincingly, and he’s fully aware of (and discusses) the points at which it is most difficult to accept as well as what’s required at an anatomical level for it to be true. He doesn’t claim to reach any strong conclusions, he just lays out his thoughts on the matter and hopes that you’ll keep an open mind and perhaps come around to his views to at least some extent. I did come around a little, but he failed to convince me on certain key points. However, I think this is a matter on which ones thoughts might change as one forges stronger relationships throughout one’s life, so I’ll try to remember to consider it again a little further down the line.As I said, that’s the most interesting question pondered in this on-topic final third. I’m afraid a fair amount of the rest of it I found boring and frustrating or else downright aggravating. For example, the twentieth chapter is a fictional conversation between two people, one of whom thinks that there must be something above and beyond simple neuronal activation required for consciousness, and one of whom does not. It’s aimed at people with at least one foot in the first camp, so for readers already standing with both feet squarely in the second it quickly becomes very tedious indeed, as you’re forced to suffer through query after query and response after response in which you’ve absolutely no interest – this is one of the longest chapters in the book, and it certainly feels like it.In another chapter Hofstadter claims to put to bed a couple of objections (“sacred cows”) that philosophers commonly raise to notions of the similarity of different consciousnesses, the first of which is the “problem of the inverted spectrum” – the idea that one person’s sensory input may be inverted in some respect to another person’s, and that this would make them so different that they could never truly know what it’s like to be each other (for example, one person seeing red where the other sees blue). And yes, Hofstadter does go on to address this, but I don’t understand why the inputs must be completely inverted, and not simply significantly different, which is an altogether different kettle of fish. For example, the proportion of cone cells that I have that perceive light of a certain wavelength may differ significantly from the proportion that you have, and this may cause us to perceive colours slightly differently. Perhaps not differently enough to have a substantial effect on our respective consciousnesses, but who knows? Or take taste as another example – my girlfriend absolutely loves sushi, and feels energised and invigorated after eating it, whereas I find it bland and completely unsatisfying. So there are unquestionably degrees of variation between people that, cumulatively, make the way we perceive our worlds as a whole substantially different. For me Hofstadter’s slaying of this “sacred cow” is more a putdown of a straw man, and even if the problem is frequently raised in this form of a total sensory inversion, I would expect a man of Hofstadter’s reasoning ability to do a better job of extrapolating the argument to its more worthwhile alternative.Hofstadter’s style is engaging, but that only compensates for the almost unbelievable lack of directness to a small extent. In the introduction Hofstadter tells us how this book started life as a request for a chapter’s worth of content from the compilers of an anthology, and ended up becoming two chapters of that book and then, eventually, I Am A Strange Loop. Well, I haven’t read that anthology, but I think there probably is about enough real content here for around two very decent chapters of a book much wider in scope, so my advice to you if you’re considering reading Strange Loop is to do a little digging and perhaps give that anthology your attention instead."
246,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"I read Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach in my college days. While I loved the book, looking back I realize that the appreciation was not deep enough. I was impressed by the novelty and surface gloss of his thinking, but I was not yet ready to understand the depth of the book. Then I purchased The Mind's I in the eighties, but never read the whole thing. I browsed through it, and read bits and pieces, but never did a close reading. I think I was finally ready to understand his work when I started reading this book a few weeks ago.Some of the best experience in life is when you nurture some thoughts for a long time, and gradually they take shape in your mind, and then one day you read a book that articulates those same thoughts, but in a more organized way. That was my experience with this book. I have been reading a lot about consciousness for the last few years. They covered a wide spectrum from strong dualist views who are convinced that there is something non-physical about our mind, to people who believe that consciousness is a quantum phenomenon, to people who believe it is an universal field-like thing giving every object a degree of consciousness, and then people who believe that it is a very powerful illusion that is almost impossible to shake off. This book makes a very strong case for the last viewpoint.If you are interested in this topic then I think this book should be in your reading list, irrespective of which point-of-view you currently support, as long as you have kept an open mind about it. The arguments here are very strong. Though, I have to say, at times he takes his analogical methods a little too far, and someone can find holes in the parallel he is drawing between the real problem and the analog. Even in those cases his intelligence and insightfulness come through, and the text remains enjoyable. What he presents here is not a scholarly argument. It is intended for curious readers interested in this deep question, and nudges them towards accepting his view. You may not be convinced, but I'll be surprised if he cannot introduce some serious doubts in your current perspective."
247,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6805662-bhashit-parikh,5,"The arguments for consciousness out of purely physical processes are brilliant, and Hofstadter is so much fun to read. The arguments about consciousness arising out of the strange loops is very fascinating to say the least."
248,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24849811-andreea-reads,4,*my brain needs to cool down a bit after this read.
249,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,3,"Douglas Hofstadter is a quirky and entertaining writer, though not as systematic as I would like. He starts off with the interesting insight that the I (or the self, or consciousness) is a strange feedback loop similar to an audio feedback loop or a video feedback loop. Audio feedback takes place when a microphone picks up its own background noise, and then endlessly rebroadcasts it as a screech. Video feedback occurs if a video camera is pointed at the video screen showing what the camera is picking up, thus yielding a similar endless loop.What these phenomena have in common is self-reference, the ability of a machine (or an algorithm or a language or a person) to represent itself. Thus a video screen showing itself showing itself showing itself… is similar to consciousness being aware of itself being aware of itself being aware of itself….Hofstadter goes on to connect these feedback loops with the paradoxes of self-reference important in mathematical history, such as the liar’s paradox. The town liar says that he is lying. If he is lying, he is telling the truth. If he is telling the truth, he is lying. Bertrand Russell developed the Theory of Types so as to prevent self-reference (and paradox) in the foundations of mathematics. But Kurt Godel proved that within Russell’s system there are true statements that cannot be proven, showing that self-referential paradoxes can sneak back in, even when they have been systematically ruled out.Hofstadter’s treatment of Godel’s Proof is one of the best discussions I have seen (and I have read the classic Nagel-Newman introductory text). In a nutshell, Hofstadter points out that a mathematical system as rich as the Russell-Whitehead system can say things about it’s own structure (i.e., be self-referential), even though that has been supposedly ruled out by its own construction rules.What I miss in Hofstadter’s discussion is how the paradoxes of self-reference cast light on consciousness. Hofstadter points out that not all self-reference is paradoxical (there is no truth-teller’s paradox). Self-referential paradoxes in consciousness might be something like Groucho Marx’s joke that he would not belong to a club that would have him as a member. In a more serious vein, self-referential paradox does mirror the human experience of judging (and therefore being different from) oneself.Hofstadter spends a lot of time mourning the premature loss of his wife, and analyzing his sense that she is not completely gone, but lives on in the thought-patterns and self-referential loops that he shared with her. That discussion is touching and personally appealing. Along the way, he wants to argue that consciousness is an illusion, that it is a changing collection of thought-patterns that can be spread over different brains and machines. He argues that he is not the same person that he was the day before, or that he will be the next day, because he is constantly having new experiences and forgetting things.Here I think he goes too far. A person, a self, a consciousness, has a continuity of experience that extends from birth to the present moment, and also envisages the future. This is what it means to be human, to make a single project out of one’s life (thank you, Heidegger), however self-referential that may be. If I am not the same person as my childhood self, then how did I ever grow up?I said I wished Hofstadter were more systematic. Akeel Bilgrami (in Self-Knowledge and Resentment) has gone into much more detail in analyzing how self-reference (or a metalinguistic level of comment) is core to such philosophical concepts as agency, value, intentionality and self-knowledge. Very briefly, to be a moral agent, to value something, to intend something, and to know oneself, all of these core philosophical activities involve not only doing something (which a robot can do), but recognizing that I am doing it. This kind of analysis, to my mind, is extraordinarily fruitful, and what I wish I had seen more of in Hofstadter."
250,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"Hofstadter, who became famous with his 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, now tackles the task of defining the self, “I,” consciousness, and the soul, all of which he sees as the same thing. He approaches the question with both science and philosophy, although the book is more philosophical than scientific.So, what’s the “loop”? He means a feedback loop, like the squeal of a PA system, although he’s more interested in what happens when you point a video camera at its own monitor. What you often get is an image of something that doesn’t really exist—except how can you say it doesn’t exist when you’re looking right at it? The human mind can look at itself, and that, too, can create images of things that “don’t really exist.” Unlike the video setup, though, the human mind can to some degree alter itself based on that image—which in turn can alter what it sees when it next looks at itself.Hofstadter builds on this self-referential feedback loop with forays into mathematics, biology, computer science, brain science, art, music, religion, the work of other philosophers, his own life, and his own and others’ thought experiments. Escher, Bach, and especially Gödel all put in appearances. This isn’t a book that zooms in on one definite answer that renders all others irrelevant. Rather, it gently leads you to think in new ways about “yourself,” which you might never look at again in quite the same way.Hofstadter writes clearly, with creativity, humor, and a unique way of looking at the world. He also makes numerous digressions, which are usually interesting even if not always strictly on point and sometimes too lengthy.He sees no need to invoke nonphysical entities, spirits, or gods to explain self and consciousness, but he also says we’ll never be able to open a human skull and pinpoint the exact brain structure or clump of neurons that house “I.” So, this book isn’t going to please either strict materialists or dogmatic dualists, which is probably a good thing."
251,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Hofstadter presents what strikes me as a convincing philosophical model of a non-dualistic world in which it is unnecessary to divide our experiences into material and spiritual components, or to hold on to the familiar and comforting concept of an immaterial ""soul."" Along the way, the reader is required to jump some pretty formidable hurdles, including a chapter that summarizes Kurt Godel's famous incompleteness theorem. I banged myself up pretty good trying to jump that one (but thanks to some help from a friend, I did attain a certain level of insight).If you are wondering how the ""self"" and ""consciousness"" can be accounted for in relatively materialistic terms, then this book is an excellent starting point. Hofstadter succeeds in presenting his ideas with humor, compassion, and much creativity.Many of the ideas Hofstadter presents in this book are familiar to me because they have materialized out of my own experience. For example: the notion that one personality can overlap with another's (so, in a sense, the dead can temporarily live on in the minds of their friends and loved ones); or the notion that I am not really the same person I was ten years ago (the Ship of Theseus paradox); or the notion of an ""inverted spectrum"" (the question of whether two people see the same ""red,"" or instead actually see different colors but merely call them by the same name?). Hofstadter demolishes the ""inverted spectrum"" thesis with little difficulty. I'll never wonder about that one again! H's conclusions regarding the phenomenon of human consciousness are somewhat tentative, because he's a humble person who is willing to explore opposing points of view and willing to admit that so much remains unknown. Nevertheless, I felt that he succeeded in showing that a materialistic viewpoint is more consistent and plausible than a dualistic viewpoint. Overall, an impressive performance!"
252,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3008879-dominikus,4,"A very personal and insightful book. As a long-time fan of Hofstadter's 'Gödel Escher Bach' I was glad to read this official 'sequel'. Hofstadter professes that he wants to use this book to clarify the points that he tried to make 30 years earlier, especially when it comes to the nature of consciousness. This naturally leads to some repetition: for example, since Gödel's destruction of Principia Mathematica builds his central argument about minds being strange loops, Hofstadter spends some time on that. But fortunately, the whole book is written in a very engaging and entertaining way, so even the more complex parts never feel like a chore.The core idea - spoilers ahead - about consciousness being a phenomenon naturally emerging from the complexity of any symbol processing apparatus is convincingly introduced and explained. Hofstadter's ousting of dualism forces him to arrive at the conclusion that consciousness is an illusion that consciousness plays on itself (in true strange loop fashion) and that ideas like an eternal 'I' or soul could not exist since they would lead to an infinite regress. While he's at killing sacred cows, he also denies the idea of a free will.These somewhat bleak results are loosened by Hofstadter's meditations on the spreading of personalities across minds (so death is more of a fading away than an abrupt ending of a person), ways to measure the size of a soul (hint: empathy is important), and others. Yet, these somewhat meandering chapters also led me to give only four out of five stars. The author takes about half of the book to arrive at the nature of strange loops and dwells long on things that obviously fascinate him but might not be as engaging for the reader. Some editing would have been in order there.Overall, however, this is an important book and Hofstadter was able to convince me of his conclusion when it comes to the nature of consciousness. Every being that feels like having an 'I' should read this."
253,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"A good introduction to Hofstadter's ideas about consciousness, in a considerably shorter package than Godel, Escher, Bach. Hofstadter is at his best in the first half of the book, when he's outlining his idea of the ""strange loop"" and discussing how it connects to his other ideas about the mind. His discussion of Godel and incompleteness is also excellent-- I'd read another book on the same subject, but Hofstadter did a much better job of getting the ideas across. After that, the book goes off on a little bit of a tangent about the degree to which one person's consciousness can spread (at lower levels of resolution and fidelity) to another person's mind. He really believes in the strong form of this idea, which implies that another person's consciousness can run in some degree on a different brain, with all that implies (a sense of interiority, etc.) It's a hard thing to swallow without scientific evidence, and you get the sense that the author might have been unduly influenced in his views by the tragic early death of his wife-- and is engaging in a little bit of wishful philosophizing about her soul's survival. The book returns to form in a rousing deconstruction and refutation of dualism, and concludes nicely with the author applying his ideas to the phenomenons of empathy and friendship. All in all, definitely a nice place to start in your investigation of Philosophy of Mind. "
254,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,3,"I enjoyed reading this foray by Hofstadter into coming to terms with that slippery concept we call 'I'; the style is cheeky, cheerful, very witty (perhaps too witty for some tastes). The subject of this book is elusive and slippery as ever; but it is of interest to anyone trying to grapple with this mercurial subject. Linked with 'I' is the concept of 'self', and by association, 'mind', 'soul', and 'conscience'. Hofstadter masterfully guides us through all the labyrinthian pathways, sometimes playing with us, endlessly punning (perhaps too much so for my taste), yet treats us kindly through the journey. He had many insights to provide, and does not shy away from the paradoxes involved. Nor does he fear to go into some very dense and some quite difficult terrain; but his hand is firm and steady, and he does get you through, even though you might not fully understand every step.Whether he is totally convincing in his conclusions is problematic: and Hofstadter readily acknowledges this. But he feels that what he and we as readers gain from the journey well outweighs any 'negatives' we might feel (they are 'negatives' but only in the sense that it makes us question, perhaps, some of our most cherished sacred cows about ourselves).Whether this is good or bad for you is neither here nor there. Anyone who is intrigued by the idea of who or what ""I"" is [sic] will find this book stimulating and thought-provoking."
255,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537281-ronny,1,"I didn't finish the book.This book is supposedly about consciousness. However, what I read were random ruminations that (at best) briefly connected with the promised subject matter.For instance, near the beginning, the author wrote at length about vegetarianism. Near the end of this section, he briefly segued into the concept of degrees of consciousness, but did not develop it. This was a shame because that would have been interesting and on-topic -- more interesting and on-topic than the vegetarian ruminations that dominated that section.I then started skimming. When I dipped in to read, I encountered more off-topic ruminations.Then I stopped entirely.In and of itself, the book may have been interesting, but the description was deceptive.Maybe the book got on track later on, but that doesn't matter. Going off on a tangent near the beginning is poor writing, and if it alienates the reader early on so s/he doesn't give the book a chance later, that's solely the author's fault.If the book consisted mainly of off-topic ruminations with a quick segue into consciousness, then it's deceptive since the bulk of the book should be about consciousness, not the other way around.Since I got this book for its description (consciousness), I am judging it by that. On that count, it fails."
256,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18930784-me,3,"I've been interested in reading Hofstadter since his name came up as author of Godel, Escher, Bach, as discussed in The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, and I realized that this was same person who edited Godel's Proof which I had earlier read. His name came up again in Gleick's 'The Information: A history, a theory, a flood', so then I set off to read his work.Half-way through, I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars. Really enjoyed the commentary on Godel's proof and the idea of consciousness as a similar ""strange loop"" based on abstract symbol system that can be turned upon itself. However, I think the book become rather repetitive, and a bit ""preachy"" over the second half--less backed by analogy to mathematical and physical structures and perhaps a bit too much about Hofstadter's opinions regarding morality and aesthetics (which I concurred with throughout, but felt somewhat detracted rather than enhanced his thesis). Overall, still a very interesting read and recommended. Other readers may find the book much more powerful or rewarding for the same reasons I found it diluted. I am a strange loop."

A Strange Loop is in essence a causal-loop among k abstraction levels (with k > 1).E.g., macro-properties influencing micro-happenings, hich in turn make up the macro-properties.The discussion and build-up of strange loops feels like a glorious Safari journey, including his beloved Gödelian loop. There are fun ideas about how we live in each other, etc. (Which, of course, would become even more fun if something akin to Morphic Resonance were to be the case :'D).To be disappointment, however, Douglas does not consider how people can, in a sense, develop past the ""I"" -- in a sense adding yet more abstraction-level distance to the loopiness ;-)He devotes a mere sentence to the topic. Finally, the discussions of Cartesian Egos, Zombies, and Sacred Cows are fairly lackluster and shallow, with some boiling down to ""I don't understand it, so it's wrong"". Seems he's very good at expositing ideas he understands, but not so much at rebutting others (or even mentally modeling others' weird ideas xD).All in all a fairly enjoyable, easy, insightful read :)"

The ideas in this book are extensions of the ideas he presented in Godel, Escher, Bach and are still interesting thoughts clearly presented. I am a Strange loop is, however, a far inferior book. Or at least, a book of a different style. Hofstadter has traded in his incredibly complex and beautiful structural sense of humor for cringe-worthy puns.That being said, he's not a novelist. The concepts wrestled with here provide an intriguing lens through which to view what exactly consciousness is. The issue is that the quality of the writing varies just as wildly as the focus. His repetition of concepts without the enlightening playfulness of GEB wears on my strange loop.However, if you enjoyed the *ideas* of Hofstadter, read this. Just be prepared for the decline in concern for the craft of creating the book as a whole. Which is, what elevated GEB in the first place."

The book is a valiant but hopeless attempt to understand human consciousness. Hofstadter loves feedback loops, and thinks that feedback loops in our brains give us the “I” feeling. I wasn’t at all convinced.But the book has a couple of interesting ideas. One is that souls have different sizes. Mature adults have fairly large souls (Albert Schweitzer’s was huge), babies have little souls, dogs smaller yet, and mosquitoes and bacteria have teeny tiny souls.Hofstadter seems a pretty mellow guy, so I was surprised at the edge in his comments about his fellow philosopher John Searle."

His Fluid Analogy stuff contain good examples.If I understand The Strange Loop properly, he's exploring the idea that consciousness if simply an illusion looking at an illusion. Wow!His thinking about the continued existence of his dead wife within his own mind is very thought provoking and I suspect has some merit.

Half of the book discusses the Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which posits the limitations of the Principia Mathematica, and self-referential loops. In the other half of the book, author argues that there is no such thing as ""I""; and the concept of 'I' is a myth! It's just an hallucination hallucinated by hallucination.

275,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2031057-ugh,2,"“Dreary, oh so dreary”, remarks an imaginary sceptical reader at the start of chapter 20 of I Am A Strange Loop, highly unimpressed with the implications of Hofstadter’s stance on the nature of consciousness. I don’t share this imaginary reader’s dismay at Hofstadter’s point of view, but their words do fairly accurately sum up my opinion of Strange Loop as a whole, and hence their appearance at the opening of this review too.When flicking through this book in the shop, I thought it was going to be a dense, perhaps difficult to grasp, but richly rewarding and thought-provoking read that might well change the way I thought not just about myself but also about the world around me. Unfortunately, the first two thirds of it – honestly, that’s no exaggeration – have almost nothing at all to say about consciousness, beyond one or two very meat-and-potatoes little scene-setters; instead, Hofstadter blathers on and on about what he thinks are enlightening analogies to consciousness, such as various forms of feedback and self-referential mathematical formulas, every once in a while teasing you by seeming to be about to finally tackle things head-on, before once again maddeningly invoking yet another analogy or – worse still – going back over something that he already tortured you with for several chapters earlier on. Now, I realise that it’s these analogies and Hofstadter’s approach that make this book unique, and it’s obvious that Hofstadter himself considers these chapters to indeed be talking about consciousness, albeit in a roundabout way, but even leaving aside the subjective question of whether these analogies are at all helpful for understanding the actually pretty straightforward topics the book eeeeevvvvveeeeentually goes on to discuss, I really don’t see how you can justify spending 200+ pages setting the scene. Sure, use your analogies to present things in various different ways in order to cater for the various different means of understanding that the varied brains of your varied readers might have, but please please do so succinctly, and please punctuate your meanderings with sections of real meaty content here and there, so as to also satisfy the cravings of those of us that like things direct and to the point! Lists of twenty or so examples when three or four would suffice are particularly wearisome...Anyway, eventually the book does lift up its skirts and give you a brief flash of the flesh for which you paid your entrance fee, and things do perk up a fair bit then, although only for a little while. The most interesting question pondered is whether people’s brains are able to contain within them not just one consciousness (your “I”), but two, three or however many, if only in part. In a remarkably honest, touching and personal section, Hofstadter talks about his late wife and her death, and how through the closeness of their relationship he gradually incorporated many of her traits and memories into himself, and he posits that this incorporation may have resulted in the partial duplication of her consciousness within his own brain (and that this also happens to you too). This was an idea at which I initially balked, but Hofstadter does argue it pretty convincingly, and he’s fully aware of (and discusses) the points at which it is most difficult to accept as well as what’s required at an anatomical level for it to be true. He doesn’t claim to reach any strong conclusions, he just lays out his thoughts on the matter and hopes that you’ll keep an open mind and perhaps come around to his views to at least some extent. I did come around a little, but he failed to convince me on certain key points. However, I think this is a matter on which ones thoughts might change as one forges stronger relationships throughout one’s life, so I’ll try to remember to consider it again a little further down the line.As I said, that’s the most interesting question pondered in this on-topic final third. I’m afraid a fair amount of the rest of it I found boring and frustrating or else downright aggravating. For example, the twentieth chapter is a fictional conversation between two people, one of whom thinks that there must be something above and beyond simple neuronal activation required for consciousness, and one of whom does not. It’s aimed at people with at least one foot in the first camp, so for readers already standing with both feet squarely in the second it quickly becomes very tedious indeed, as you’re forced to suffer through query after query and response after response in which you’ve absolutely no interest – this is one of the longest chapters in the book, and it certainly feels like it.In another chapter Hofstadter claims to put to bed a couple of objections (“sacred cows”) that philosophers commonly raise to notions of the similarity of different consciousnesses, the first of which is the “problem of the inverted spectrum” – the idea that one person’s sensory input may be inverted in some respect to another person’s, and that this would make them so different that they could never truly know what it’s like to be each other (for example, one person seeing red where the other sees blue). And yes, Hofstadter does go on to address this, but I don’t understand why the inputs must be completely inverted, and not simply significantly different, which is an altogether different kettle of fish. For example, the proportion of cone cells that I have that perceive light of a certain wavelength may differ significantly from the proportion that you have, and this may cause us to perceive colours slightly differently. Perhaps not differently enough to have a substantial effect on our respective consciousnesses, but who knows? Or take taste as another example – my girlfriend absolutely loves sushi, and feels energised and invigorated after eating it, whereas I find it bland and completely unsatisfying. So there are unquestionably degrees of variation between people that, cumulatively, make the way we perceive our worlds as a whole substantially different. For me Hofstadter’s slaying of this “sacred cow” is more a putdown of a straw man, and even if the problem is frequently raised in this form of a total sensory inversion, I would expect a man of Hofstadter’s reasoning ability to do a better job of extrapolating the argument to its more worthwhile alternative.Hofstadter’s style is engaging, but that only compensates for the almost unbelievable lack of directness to a small extent. In the introduction Hofstadter tells us how this book started life as a request for a chapter’s worth of content from the compilers of an anthology, and ended up becoming two chapters of that book and then, eventually, I Am A Strange Loop. Well, I haven’t read that anthology, but I think there probably is about enough real content here for around two very decent chapters of a book much wider in scope, so my advice to you if you’re considering reading Strange Loop is to do a little digging and perhaps give that anthology your attention instead."
276,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"I read Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach in my college days. While I loved the book, looking back I realize that the appreciation was not deep enough. I was impressed by the novelty and surface gloss of his thinking, but I was not yet ready to understand the depth of the book. Then I purchased The Mind's I in the eighties, but never read the whole thing. I browsed through it, and read bits and pieces, but never did a close reading. I think I was finally ready to understand his work when I started reading this book a few weeks ago.Some of the best experience in life is when you nurture some thoughts for a long time, and gradually they take shape in your mind, and then one day you read a book that articulates those same thoughts, but in a more organized way. That was my experience with this book. I have been reading a lot about consciousness for the last few years. They covered a wide spectrum from strong dualist views who are convinced that there is something non-physical about our mind, to people who believe that consciousness is a quantum phenomenon, to people who believe it is an universal field-like thing giving every object a degree of consciousness, and then people who believe that it is a very powerful illusion that is almost impossible to shake off. This book makes a very strong case for the last viewpoint.If you are interested in this topic then I think this book should be in your reading list, irrespective of which point-of-view you currently support, as long as you have kept an open mind about it. The arguments here are very strong. Though, I have to say, at times he takes his analogical methods a little too far, and someone can find holes in the parallel he is drawing between the real problem and the analog. Even in those cases his intelligence and insightfulness come through, and the text remains enjoyable. What he presents here is not a scholarly argument. It is intended for curious readers interested in this deep question, and nudges them towards accepting his view. You may not be convinced, but I'll be surprised if he cannot introduce some serious doubts in your current perspective."
277,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6805662-bhashit-parikh,5,"The arguments for consciousness out of purely physical processes are brilliant, and Hofstadter is so much fun to read. The arguments about consciousness arising out of the strange loops is very fascinating to say the least."
278,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24849811-andreea-reads,4,*my brain needs to cool down a bit after this read.
279,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,3,"Douglas Hofstadter is a quirky and entertaining writer, though not as systematic as I would like. He starts off with the interesting insight that the I (or the self, or consciousness) is a strange feedback loop similar to an audio feedback loop or a video feedback loop. Audio feedback takes place when a microphone picks up its own background noise, and then endlessly rebroadcasts it as a screech. Video feedback occurs if a video camera is pointed at the video screen showing what the camera is picking up, thus yielding a similar endless loop.What these phenomena have in common is self-reference, the ability of a machine (or an algorithm or a language or a person) to represent itself. Thus a video screen showing itself showing itself showing itself… is similar to consciousness being aware of itself being aware of itself being aware of itself….Hofstadter goes on to connect these feedback loops with the paradoxes of self-reference important in mathematical history, such as the liar’s paradox. The town liar says that he is lying. If he is lying, he is telling the truth. If he is telling the truth, he is lying. Bertrand Russell developed the Theory of Types so as to prevent self-reference (and paradox) in the foundations of mathematics. But Kurt Godel proved that within Russell’s system there are true statements that cannot be proven, showing that self-referential paradoxes can sneak back in, even when they have been systematically ruled out.Hofstadter’s treatment of Godel’s Proof is one of the best discussions I have seen (and I have read the classic Nagel-Newman introductory text). In a nutshell, Hofstadter points out that a mathematical system as rich as the Russell-Whitehead system can say things about it’s own structure (i.e., be self-referential), even though that has been supposedly ruled out by its own construction rules.What I miss in Hofstadter’s discussion is how the paradoxes of self-reference cast light on consciousness. Hofstadter points out that not all self-reference is paradoxical (there is no truth-teller’s paradox). Self-referential paradoxes in consciousness might be something like Groucho Marx’s joke that he would not belong to a club that would have him as a member. In a more serious vein, self-referential paradox does mirror the human experience of judging (and therefore being different from) oneself.Hofstadter spends a lot of time mourning the premature loss of his wife, and analyzing his sense that she is not completely gone, but lives on in the thought-patterns and self-referential loops that he shared with her. That discussion is touching and personally appealing. Along the way, he wants to argue that consciousness is an illusion, that it is a changing collection of thought-patterns that can be spread over different brains and machines. He argues that he is not the same person that he was the day before, or that he will be the next day, because he is constantly having new experiences and forgetting things.Here I think he goes too far. A person, a self, a consciousness, has a continuity of experience that extends from birth to the present moment, and also envisages the future. This is what it means to be human, to make a single project out of one’s life (thank you, Heidegger), however self-referential that may be. If I am not the same person as my childhood self, then how did I ever grow up?I said I wished Hofstadter were more systematic. Akeel Bilgrami (in Self-Knowledge and Resentment) has gone into much more detail in analyzing how self-reference (or a metalinguistic level of comment) is core to such philosophical concepts as agency, value, intentionality and self-knowledge. Very briefly, to be a moral agent, to value something, to intend something, and to know oneself, all of these core philosophical activities involve not only doing something (which a robot can do), but recognizing that I am doing it. This kind of analysis, to my mind, is extraordinarily fruitful, and what I wish I had seen more of in Hofstadter."
280,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"Hofstadter, who became famous with his 1979 book Gödel, Escher, Bach, now tackles the task of defining the self, “I,” consciousness, and the soul, all of which he sees as the same thing. He approaches the question with both science and philosophy, although the book is more philosophical than scientific.So, what’s the “loop”? He means a feedback loop, like the squeal of a PA system, although he’s more interested in what happens when you point a video camera at its own monitor. What you often get is an image of something that doesn’t really exist—except how can you say it doesn’t exist when you’re looking right at it? The human mind can look at itself, and that, too, can create images of things that “don’t really exist.” Unlike the video setup, though, the human mind can to some degree alter itself based on that image—which in turn can alter what it sees when it next looks at itself.Hofstadter builds on this self-referential feedback loop with forays into mathematics, biology, computer science, brain science, art, music, religion, the work of other philosophers, his own life, and his own and others’ thought experiments. Escher, Bach, and especially Gödel all put in appearances. This isn’t a book that zooms in on one definite answer that renders all others irrelevant. Rather, it gently leads you to think in new ways about “yourself,” which you might never look at again in quite the same way.Hofstadter writes clearly, with creativity, humor, and a unique way of looking at the world. He also makes numerous digressions, which are usually interesting even if not always strictly on point and sometimes too lengthy.He sees no need to invoke nonphysical entities, spirits, or gods to explain self and consciousness, but he also says we’ll never be able to open a human skull and pinpoint the exact brain structure or clump of neurons that house “I.” So, this book isn’t going to please either strict materialists or dogmatic dualists, which is probably a good thing."
281,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3491750-williwaw,4,"Hofstadter presents what strikes me as a convincing philosophical model of a non-dualistic world in which it is unnecessary to divide our experiences into material and spiritual components, or to hold on to the familiar and comforting concept of an immaterial ""soul."" Along the way, the reader is required to jump some pretty formidable hurdles, including a chapter that summarizes Kurt Godel's famous incompleteness theorem. I banged myself up pretty good trying to jump that one (but thanks to some help from a friend, I did attain a certain level of insight).If you are wondering how the ""self"" and ""consciousness"" can be accounted for in relatively materialistic terms, then this book is an excellent starting point. Hofstadter succeeds in presenting his ideas with humor, compassion, and much creativity.Many of the ideas Hofstadter presents in this book are familiar to me because they have materialized out of my own experience. For example: the notion that one personality can overlap with another's (so, in a sense, the dead can temporarily live on in the minds of their friends and loved ones); or the notion that I am not really the same person I was ten years ago (the Ship of Theseus paradox); or the notion of an ""inverted spectrum"" (the question of whether two people see the same ""red,"" or instead actually see different colors but merely call them by the same name?). Hofstadter demolishes the ""inverted spectrum"" thesis with little difficulty. I'll never wonder about that one again! H's conclusions regarding the phenomenon of human consciousness are somewhat tentative, because he's a humble person who is willing to explore opposing points of view and willing to admit that so much remains unknown. Nevertheless, I felt that he succeeded in showing that a materialistic viewpoint is more consistent and plausible than a dualistic viewpoint. Overall, an impressive performance!"
282,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3008879-dominikus,4,"A very personal and insightful book. As a long-time fan of Hofstadter's 'Gödel Escher Bach' I was glad to read this official 'sequel'. Hofstadter professes that he wants to use this book to clarify the points that he tried to make 30 years earlier, especially when it comes to the nature of consciousness. This naturally leads to some repetition: for example, since Gödel's destruction of Principia Mathematica builds his central argument about minds being strange loops, Hofstadter spends some time on that. But fortunately, the whole book is written in a very engaging and entertaining way, so even the more complex parts never feel like a chore.The core idea - spoilers ahead - about consciousness being a phenomenon naturally emerging from the complexity of any symbol processing apparatus is convincingly introduced and explained. Hofstadter's ousting of dualism forces him to arrive at the conclusion that consciousness is an illusion that consciousness plays on itself (in true strange loop fashion) and that ideas like an eternal 'I' or soul could not exist since they would lead to an infinite regress. While he's at killing sacred cows, he also denies the idea of a free will.These somewhat bleak results are loosened by Hofstadter's meditations on the spreading of personalities across minds (so death is more of a fading away than an abrupt ending of a person), ways to measure the size of a soul (hint: empathy is important), and others. Yet, these somewhat meandering chapters also led me to give only four out of five stars. The author takes about half of the book to arrive at the nature of strange loops and dwells long on things that obviously fascinate him but might not be as engaging for the reader. Some editing would have been in order there.Overall, however, this is an important book and Hofstadter was able to convince me of his conclusion when it comes to the nature of consciousness. Every being that feels like having an 'I' should read this."
283,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"A good introduction to Hofstadter's ideas about consciousness, in a considerably shorter package than Godel, Escher, Bach. Hofstadter is at his best in the first half of the book, when he's outlining his idea of the ""strange loop"" and discussing how it connects to his other ideas about the mind. His discussion of Godel and incompleteness is also excellent-- I'd read another book on the same subject, but Hofstadter did a much better job of getting the ideas across. After that, the book goes off on a little bit of a tangent about the degree to which one person's consciousness can spread (at lower levels of resolution and fidelity) to another person's mind. He really believes in the strong form of this idea, which implies that another person's consciousness can run in some degree on a different brain, with all that implies (a sense of interiority, etc.) It's a hard thing to swallow without scientific evidence, and you get the sense that the author might have been unduly influenced in his views by the tragic early death of his wife-- and is engaging in a little bit of wishful philosophizing about her soul's survival. The book returns to form in a rousing deconstruction and refutation of dualism, and concludes nicely with the author applying his ideas to the phenomenons of empathy and friendship. All in all, definitely a nice place to start in your investigation of Philosophy of Mind. "
284,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,3,"I enjoyed reading this foray by Hofstadter into coming to terms with that slippery concept we call 'I'; the style is cheeky, cheerful, very witty (perhaps too witty for some tastes). The subject of this book is elusive and slippery as ever; but it is of interest to anyone trying to grapple with this mercurial subject. Linked with 'I' is the concept of 'self', and by association, 'mind', 'soul', and 'conscience'. Hofstadter masterfully guides us through all the labyrinthian pathways, sometimes playing with us, endlessly punning (perhaps too much so for my taste), yet treats us kindly through the journey. He had many insights to provide, and does not shy away from the paradoxes involved. Nor does he fear to go into some very dense and some quite difficult terrain; but his hand is firm and steady, and he does get you through, even though you might not fully understand every step.Whether he is totally convincing in his conclusions is problematic: and Hofstadter readily acknowledges this. But he feels that what he and we as readers gain from the journey well outweighs any 'negatives' we might feel (they are 'negatives' but only in the sense that it makes us question, perhaps, some of our most cherished sacred cows about ourselves).Whether this is good or bad for you is neither here nor there. Anyone who is intrigued by the idea of who or what ""I"" is [sic] will find this book stimulating and thought-provoking."
285,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537281-ronny,1,"I didn't finish the book.This book is supposedly about consciousness. However, what I read were random ruminations that (at best) briefly connected with the promised subject matter.For instance, near the beginning, the author wrote at length about vegetarianism. Near the end of this section, he briefly segued into the concept of degrees of consciousness, but did not develop it. This was a shame because that would have been interesting and on-topic -- more interesting and on-topic than the vegetarian ruminations that dominated that section.I then started skimming. When I dipped in to read, I encountered more off-topic ruminations.Then I stopped entirely.In and of itself, the book may have been interesting, but the description was deceptive.Maybe the book got on track later on, but that doesn't matter. Going off on a tangent near the beginning is poor writing, and if it alienates the reader early on so s/he doesn't give the book a chance later, that's solely the author's fault.If the book consisted mainly of off-topic ruminations with a quick segue into consciousness, then it's deceptive since the bulk of the book should be about consciousness, not the other way around.Since I got this book for its description (consciousness), I am judging it by that. On that count, it fails."
286,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18930784-me,3,"I've been interested in reading Hofstadter since his name came up as author of Godel, Escher, Bach, as discussed in The Psychopath Test by Jon Ronson, and I realized that this was same person who edited Godel's Proof which I had earlier read. His name came up again in Gleick's 'The Information: A history, a theory, a flood', so then I set off to read his work.Half-way through, I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars. Really enjoyed the commentary on Godel's proof and the idea of consciousness as a similar ""strange loop"" based on abstract symbol system that can be turned upon itself. However, I think the book become rather repetitive, and a bit ""preachy"" over the second half--less backed by analogy to mathematical and physical structures and perhaps a bit too much about Hofstadter's opinions regarding morality and aesthetics (which I concurred with throughout, but felt somewhat detracted rather than enhanced his thesis). Overall, still a very interesting read and recommended. Other readers may find the book much more powerful or rewarding for the same reasons I found it diluted. I am a strange loop."
287,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11041240-zarathustra-goertzel,4,"87.5% good book.I Am a Strange Loop reads like a comfy fireplace chat with a profoundly warmhearted (""large souled"") man. A Strange Loop is in essence a causal-loop among k abstraction levels (with k > 1).E.g., macro-properties influencing micro-happenings, hich in turn make up the macro-properties.The discussion and build-up of strange loops feels like a glorious Safari journey, including his beloved Gödelian loop. There are fun ideas about how we live in each other, etc. (Which, of course, would become even more fun if something akin to Morphic Resonance were to be the case :'D).To be disappointment, however, Douglas does not consider how people can, in a sense, develop past the ""I"" -- in a sense adding yet more abstraction-level distance to the loopiness ;-)He devotes a mere sentence to the topic. Finally, the discussions of Cartesian Egos, Zombies, and Sacred Cows are fairly lackluster and shallow, with some boiling down to ""I don't understand it, so it's wrong"". Seems he's very good at expositing ideas he understands, but not so much at rebutting others (or even mentally modeling others' weird ideas xD).All in all a fairly enjoyable, easy, insightful read :)"
288,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666609-dusty-rhodes,3,"Hofstadter is a victim of his own influence. The ideas in this book are extensions of the ideas he presented in Godel, Escher, Bach and are still interesting thoughts clearly presented. I am a Strange loop is, however, a far inferior book. Or at least, a book of a different style. Hofstadter has traded in his incredibly complex and beautiful structural sense of humor for cringe-worthy puns.That being said, he's not a novelist. The concepts wrestled with here provide an intriguing lens through which to view what exactly consciousness is. The issue is that the quality of the writing varies just as wildly as the focus. His repetition of concepts without the enlightening playfulness of GEB wears on my strange loop.However, if you enjoyed the *ideas* of Hofstadter, read this. Just be prepared for the decline in concern for the craft of creating the book as a whole. Which is, what elevated GEB in the first place."
289,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5632471-carl,3,"Definitely not as good as the author’s masterpiece “Gödel, Escher, Bach”. The book is a valiant but hopeless attempt to understand human consciousness. Hofstadter loves feedback loops, and thinks that feedback loops in our brains give us the “I” feeling. I wasn’t at all convinced.But the book has a couple of interesting ideas. One is that souls have different sizes. Mature adults have fairly large souls (Albert Schweitzer’s was huge), babies have little souls, dogs smaller yet, and mosquitoes and bacteria have teeny tiny souls.Hofstadter seems a pretty mellow guy, so I was surprised at the edge in his comments about his fellow philosopher John Searle."
290,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182456-tom,5,"When I read this I had started Gödel Escher Bach several times and never finished it, while I think GEB is worth reading this is a more accessible presentation of the central theme in it (though without the marvellous distractions of the carrolian dialogues before each chapter and all the great mathematical excursions along the way).I did not think I believed it till I found myself describing it to someone else and now love the idea that we carry around low fidelity models of the people we know and love and that being the only immortality any of us has."
291,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6142157-words-deeds,5,"The ownership (and understanding thereof) of Godel Escher Back (""GEB"") is usually a signpost for one mathlete or coder to another. Oh, there's ""GEB"" in your shelf. You're a dork too!"" It's chock full of metaphors.I a Strange Loop is more sincere. It's probably a better book, definitely more accessible. Moreover it fully explains how an infinite regress can result in progress. I am a thing that knows I'm a thing that knows I'm a thing that .... doesn't know a thing."
292,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/330043-chris-lawnsby,2,"I was incredibly excited to read this book after ""Godel, Escher, Bach."" I was disappointed. I thought this book lacked the excitement and wonder of GEB. Also, I remained totally unconvinced of the basic thesis, even though the guy who wrote it is like 1000 times smarter than I will ever be and has thought about the topic more than I ever will. "
293,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2010962-alec-julien,2,"Oh my god, Hofstadter has lost it. I read the first half of this book, forgiving him his blind faith in 1980s computational philosophy of mind, and mildly intrigued by where he seemed to be going. But then... well, I won't give any spoilers here, but I will say that he has apparently been driven mad by grief and is using bad philosophy in order to shore up a ridiculous position that comforts him."
294,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2373822-rebecca-lowndes,4,"Still plowing through this one. Very engagingly written, though it presupposes that the reader is conversant with theoretical math (which I most definitely am not). But it's very entertaining, and I continue to slog through the theoretical parts in hopes of reaching an epiphany in the here's-how-it-applies-to- your-brain parts. Give it a shot if you want to know how your brain knows you're alive."
295,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16178396-amjad,5,"Possibly my favorite book everCouldn't put it down. Great style. Explains the hardest thing to explain in the world by using intuition pumps, personal stories, mathematics, and analogies. Builds up a repertoire of entities that stay with you the whole book getting enriched every time they're called back to illustrate a point. Hofstadter must really hate mosquitos."
296,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/537565-sophia,2,"He has some interesting thoughts on consciousness, although he takes too long to get reach them. The book could have been half this size and even that's an upgrade to his first attempt: Godel, Escher, Bach. But it's an easy read, has some humor, and is peppered with food for thought."
297,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742016-justin,3,"Not as interesting as Godel Escher Bach, but he's got some good ideas. I just wish he wouldn't try to be witty all the time. The puns are fucking terrible. The book started off strong, but by the end of it I just kept thinking, ""Jesus Christ, just get to the point and shut the fuck up."""
298,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/581433-peter,4,"Hofstadter argues that the human sense of I-ness is an illusory but ineluctable byproduct of the Mind's always-already situatedness within the mind's analogical mesh of arbitrarily complex, nested feedback loops. Could have lost 100 pages, but great anyway."
299,0465030785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7920637-heidi,4,"It's about as strange and as loopy as you would expect. Simple analogies are used to discuss and illustrate some very complex and intriguing ideas. I found it to be quite thought-provoking. It's a much lighter read than ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"", which I am slowly making my way through now. "
