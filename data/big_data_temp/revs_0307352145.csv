“There's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas.”
I read this book for the same reason most people read this book: I am an introvert. I have always been an introvert, and it's a fundamental, sometimes limiting, part of who I am. I've learned to deal with it better over the years - learned to clasp my shaking hands together during presentations, force myself to breathe normally and keep my voice steady, even force myself to make the first move in social situations. Unless you are also an introvert, you probably won't understand the efforts I have to go to (and the psychological strain this puts on me) just to behave in a way that is considered socially acceptable and is desired by employers.It's actually caused me upset and distress for many reasons. Firstly because I find it hard to cope in the many situations where bright, outgoing personalities thrive. Secondly because it's just considered a negative trait. Look at magazines, look at books like How to Win Friends and Influence People, look at job applications asking for ""people persons"". I remember reading teen magazines in high school and seeing stupid articles about how to attract boys - confident, dazzling personalities are a necessity! - and feeling a very real blow to my self-esteem.But I have accepted it as an unfortunate fact of reality for years - the simple conclusion that being introverted is a bad thing. Not a terrible thing, and definitely not an impossible thing to cope with - technology billionaires are often introverts after all - but something limiting (like a lower intelligence) that I must constantly battle against to make it through this world.Until I read this book.Susan Cain uses facts, statistics and her own case studies to show that introverts are greatly successful and powerful, not in spite of their introversion, but because of it. She compares different types of businesses and teamwork to show how extroverts and introverts each excel in different types of business environments. For example, extroverts often lead businesses better when there is little input from other team members; whereas introverts thrive in situations that rely on the input of a team because they are more likely to listen to the other members and implement their ideas.From Harvard Business School students to Ivy League professors to Rosa Parks, Cain looks at the different types of influence introverts and extroverts have. She does not place favour on one or the other, but instead portrays a view of the world in which both have an extremely important part to play - it just so happens that the extroverts tend to be ""louder"" about it. It's an important, engaging book that pulled along even a lover of fiction and fantasy like me. And, though comforting, it is still a respectable study that achieves more than just making introverts feel a little better about themselves. The findings speak for themselves and not only serve to please a shy little weirdo like me, but also make a lot of sense.An important read for introverts and extroverts alike.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"

On sundays I often join the walking club for a long 25km walk, but I prefer to do it alone (and oh, all the pity looks you get!). The idea of surprise parties makes me sick to my stomach, and any event where a thousand people are together is possibly even worse. I dislike small talk, but I probably hate even more how nervous I get when I have to do it. I can feel sad for a bruised tomato no-one wants to buy (hey, he tried his best too, not his fault someone dropped him!), and while everyone else goes to the modern, light apothecary across the street with the super nice people always happy to help, I go to the dark and older one who never has clients (how else will he survive?)Turns out I'm not that weird. I'm just a full blood introvert. And yet, I'm not what you think. I'm not particularly shy, I'm not the grey bird that never says a word and everyone forgets she's around. I'm very opinionated and quite stubborn, and when amongst friends I know well, I can be the loudest person in the room. But still I'm introvert. After being with friends or colleagues, I need recharging time. I need to be alone. I (almost) always think before I talk. I enjoy getting to the bottom of things, I enjoy detective work. And I can go on and on.While reading this book, on occasion I was nodding so hard I thought my head might fall off.There were very little eye-opening surprises in this book, and even a few things I didn't agree with or I would have hoped for her to explore more. Even a few occasions I thought she was idealizing introverts. This book was not perfect, but somehow i feel that it was important for me to read it.Overall, it was quite liberating. I'm not that weird! About a third of us on this planet (and on a website as Goodreads probably a LOT more) are more or less like me - not completely like me, I'm still unique (I insist!)But that might not be an issue. Though some of you might recognize some of my examples above, I've never met someone before that can feel bad for a bruised tomato. So maybe i'm still little weird, and my own unique self. Hoorah"
2,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085121-stephanie-extremely-stable-genius,4,"March 6th was Super Tuesday and I live in that Oh-so-much-talked-about-battle-ground-state of Ohio. I work the elections as a Ballot Judge, which means I hand out the ballots to the voters and give them instructions. I get to talk and talk, for 13 hours straight *sigh*. I try to make it entertaining for the voters, myself and the others I work with because of its repetition, but by 7:30 pm when the polls close I don’t think the language I was using was English.My spiel went something like this…….Me: “Hi. What ballot can I get for you today?”Voter: “Uh…….what do you mean?”Me: “Today we have, Democratic, Republican, Libertarian or Green (I have never given out the last two)”.Voter: “What’s a Green party?”Me: “I’m not sure, but there is next to nothing on their ballot.”Voter: “I’m and independent (code for embarrassed Republican) can’t I have both a Democratic AND Republican ballot?”Me: “No, you must declare one and you will be that party until the next primary. Ohio is a closed primary state.”Voter: “Uh….then give me a *whispers* a Democrat one.”Me: *loudly* “Democratic it is! Take all this to a table and vote, when you are done bring everything back to Rosemary in the red sweater by that machine. Make sure to tear off the stub on the bottom of the ballot…….the one that is marked “do not detach” when you come up to the machine. If you don’t, you will make Rosemary angry (a very sweet and very old woman) and you won’t like her when she’s angry. She will cover you in I Voted stickers.”This resulted in lots of chuckles, but I did it 301 times. I was drained. I slept for 12 hours that night. Twelve. Grant it, I got up at stupid O ‘clock to get to the polls by 6 am and maybe had 4 hours of sleep, but I was just a shell my former self. I am an introvert. Introverts and extroverts are most easily determined by how their energy is drained and how it is refreshed. Extroverts are drained when they have spent too much time alone, and the opposite is true for introverts. So for me, my life force was gone.In the United States our culture is biased towards the extrovert. We are about the loudness, the out there, the utter insanity if you will. In school “poor Johnny is so quiet, he needs to come out of his shell.” I want to scream “Leave him alone…..he’s FINE, he likes his shell!” School rooms now do this Pod thing where they pull four desks together and make these poor kids work as a team. WTF? No way would have that “concept” worked for me and it’s not working for introverted kids.“There’s no I in team” and that is a damn dirty shame.I haven’t worked in an office setting in years, so when I read in this book that office places are arranging offices areas with an open concept, everybody face to face with no walls. Workers going about their day, shooting the shit, getting ideas……brainstorming (which doesn't work). Who in the hell thought that one up? What a nightmare. What if I only tolerate a certain co-worker……now I have to stare at his annoying face all day, every day? How is anything ever accomplished? Companies are beginning to realize this mistake and are changing things up. Google (I think it was them) designed their offices with food, bathrooms and the like all in the center, like a town center, with offices around the edges. It is designed for casual meetings where ideas everyone figured out in their quiet offices are shared and expanded.Introverts are a third to half of the population. Many of these don’t even know they are introverted, because of the push to be extroverted has made them fool themselves into thinking they were extroverts.Another interesting thing I learned from this book is that extroverts are motivated by rewards. They work toward things, and take risks if need be to get to the goal of getting that reward. Extroverts are soooo happy when they get the reward.Introverts are motivated by fear. So they do things more cautiously, careful not to mess things up in the process of getting to a goal. That sounds like me. It’s doesn't sound cool that I am afraid to F things up, but I am.This book is interesting, whether you are an I or an E. Because if you’re not an introvert, odds are you know and love one.Also posted at Shelfinflicted"
3,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly,3,"In a twist that will surprise precisely no one, this book spends a fair amount of time cheering for introverts. What were the odds, right? I assume if you're picking this book up you're on board with that to a certain extent, and likely something of an introvert yourself. This book is certainly for you-or for the perplexed extrovert or ""pseudo-extrovert"" that might be confused by your supposedly mysterious ways. It's a sort of shield, a blockade, a set of reinforced walls that Cain feels it is necessary to throw up around introverts (particularly American introverts) to protect them from the ""Extrovered Ideal,"" of American socialization. The tone of the beginning of the book is thus rather defiant, like Cain is screaming back at everyone she has ever felt pressured by to go to a happy hour or to a dinner party when she had much rather just read a book instead. There's some of this kick-back throughout the book, with plenty of cathartic/sympathetic/rather relatable war stories from introverts just tryin' to make it in an extrovert's world. It is particularly meant to speak to introverts in the high flying business, legal, and/or educational world, where a premium is put on socializing, teamwork, constant connection and multitasking (I am speaking here particularly of the rarefied worlds of Big Law, Wall Street Finance, and Ivy League academia). It's a very career and work focused book, with a surprisingly frequent focus on the bottom line about what traits introverts are more likely to have and how these should be recognized at the top tables in all fields. Her argument, based on one scientific study after another throughout the chapters (deployed like so much artillery), is that introverts tend to think more deeply about problems and persist for longer in trying to solve them. Introverts are supposedly more likely to care about the feelings of others, to make excellent compromising leaders, and to be excellent negotiators (Cain's particular area of expertise) based on their ability to seem soft and actually be tough at the same time. She scorns the merely ""shy"" as extroverts in disguise who share extroverts' traits and want the spotlight but who are just too scared to get it (she would never say this outright, but it is clear that she believes they don't deserve the secret introvert password and is determined to keep out the riffraff). She argues that the extroverts in powerful positions she has seen are more likely to take unjustified risks, to get hopped up on testosterone and the thrill of the chase, to listen to the loudest person in the room, and to walk all over introverts.She readily admits the nuances in these sweeping generalizations. She also admits the worth of extroverts and how introverts greatly enjoy and need their company, both professionally and personally. In addition, she also talks about some legitimate times when introverts may devote time and energy to being extroverted (if they care about something enough- ""Free Trait Theory""). Finally, and in the part that I most appreciated, Cain talks a bit about the ""Situational"" theory of personality- that is, that people's personalities can be completely different in different situations, times and around different people. Therefore, there are very few ""pure"" introverts or ""pure"" extroverts. She also admits that the way that these generalized ""traits"" play out may look very different and may, after all, not be very predictive in any direct way. (Many extroverts may have excellent impulse control, or introverts who care deeply about a cause may act frequently and completely out of character in order to fight for what they believe in.)However, the space devoted to these arguments is much, much smaller than the space devoted to proving, endlessly, how awesome introverts are and why the professional world should value them and stop trying to tell them that they have to be like extroverts because I'm okay and you're okay and it takes all kinds and a village to make the world go round.And honestly? This is a message that's happening to hit me at the right time, when I'm involved in a workplace with a whole lot of extroverts surrounding me. I did find it useful in my particular mindset where I am actively waging a struggle to define my own style in a new profession, since introversion is a part of my identity. I also thought that some of the studies she cited DO make a lot of sense and should be more widely looked at (like the ones that talk about why it's a good idea to ask people to provide feedback and brainstorm online rather than in big meetings or why introverts with closed door offices are more productive or some of the advice to parents about how to cherish their introverted child). I also think that it's nice to have someone sounding the alert that someone speaking quietly is not wrong by default- turn on cable news for thirty seconds and you'll be reminded why that is important.And yet, despite the evident time put into this book, and despite my bias towards it, I couldn't shake the feeling of cynical questioning of what felt like a great deal of pop psychology and arguments made based on feelings, anecdotes and newspaper clippings collected into a narrative. It felt like a file you might keep to make yourself feel better and to express an important part of your identity, rather than a research paper and I'm sure it was aiming at something closer to that crossed with an advice column. There's such a lot of speculation in here, and lots of scientific studies without citations or countervailing evidence brought into play. (For example, it certainly didn't help that the minute after I read one of the more fluffy scientific studies in here about how we Americans as a culture are more drawn to people that display significantly more traditionally dominant body language in pictures I saw it in an issue of Marie Claire in a box near the back of the magazine reconfigured to be about women being attracted to men and how you've gotta look aggressive and Manly to get us ladiezz don't you know?) It just seems like a book written for a specific audience that you can rely on to make that leap to ""just know"" what you mean because they've got an emotional bank of misunderstood years and moments to draw on. In short, it appeals to an ""emotional truth"" built on hundreds of pages of stories and studies that may or may not add up to anything at all. On the one hand, it's maybe okay to create a space for a ""community"" of sorts to feel and process some of that- on the other hand, it will drag down the overall quality of that work into something closer to a melancholy history crossed with a dinner party argument. Therefore, despite its strengths, and despite the personal enjoyment and help that I have taken from the book at this particular time, I can't rate it as more than an above average read. An intellectualized comfort read for introverted professionals, really, if such a specialized category really exists. I can't rate it higher when I feel like one good scholarly journal review would take the whole theory down, especially when it feels like an argument for corporations to pay introverts more a lot of the time. Nonetheless, a lot of interesting questions asked, a lot of self-reflection inspired. Recommended for my fellow introverts if you're at a place where you feel like something like I described above might be helpful to you at this time. Otherwise, I'd say you could skip it or just watch her TED talk instead."
4,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"[Original review, Dec 29 2016]This book, which I had had recommended to me by many friends both on Goodreads and in real life, says plenty of useful and worthwhile things. Using the words not quite in the sense common among academic psychologists, Susan Cain distinguishes between ""extroverts"", whom she characterizes as loud, thick-skinned people who prioritise social interaction, assertiveness and gregariousness, and ""introverts"", quiet, thin-skinned people who prioritise sensitivity, harmony and understanding. She points out that a third to a half of all people are introverts; though many of them have learned how to masquerade successfully as extroverts, since American society encourages extrovert behavior to the point where many introverts feel there is something wrong with them. Why do they prefer to sit and read a book when they could be out making useful business contacts? Cain give reasons to believe that the difference between introversion and extroversion may well be related to underlying brain physiology, and hence beyond the individual's control. But more importantly, she argues that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being introverted. Society needs sensitive, risk-shy introverts just as much as it needs brash, risk-tolerant extroverts. In fact, it may need them more.I find most of the above plausible, though I don't know enough about neurophysiology to be able to say how solid those parts are. What disquiets me most is that the book needed to be written in the first place. It seems to me to say more about modern American society than it does about the differences between introverts and extroverts. As Cain says, many societies - she particularly singles out Asian societies - do not place the same premium on extroverted behavior. If you're an Asian teen, it's regarded as normal to spend your time studying rather than partying. The same is true, though to a lesser extent, of many European societies. Cain's approach is gentle and indirect, but she certainly succeeds in showing how grotesquely skewed the US has become. When a member of an evangelical church says he is only interested in recruiting extroverted people and adds that he's sure Jesus was extroverted, I can't help feeling that something has gone horribly wrong. Even more memorably and presciently (the book was published in 2012), Cain asks at one point how America could have got the idea that the ideal personality type is that of a successful real estate salesman.How indeed?___________________[Update, May 31 2018]A remarkable passage I just read in Gwendolyn Seidman's widely cited paper ""Self-presentation and belonging on Facebook: How personality influences social media use and motivations"" (2012):Extraversion is related to several belongingness-related constructs. Extraverts have more friends, higher quality friendships (Asendorpf & Wilpers, 1998) and more satisfying romantic relationships than introverts (White, Hendrick, & Hendrick, 2004). Thus, it is unsurprising that extraversion is associated with greater Facebook use (Gosling, Augustine, Vazire, Holtzman, & Gaddis, 2011; Wilson, Fornasier, & White, 2010) and more friends (Amichai-Hamburger & Vinitzky, 2010; Moore & McElroy, 2012; Ryan & Xenos, 2011)."
5,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58160628-emily-books-with-emily-fox,4,Very interesting non-fiction about introverts.Definitely could relate with a lot that was said and loved learning more about the advantages of it and how to deal with being an introvert!
6,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,4,"What an affirmation! While listening to this book, I was constantly reminded of Al Franken’s Saturday Night Live character, Stuart Smalley, and his mantra, “I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and doggone it, people like me.” Well, those who understand me do. Full disclosure, according to the Myers-Briggs Personality Test, I’m an ISFJ.There were so many points of affirmation for me—things I intuitively knew. Things I’ve tried to share with others mostly to no avail. This book supplies all the data I need to support my case. Unfortunately, I don’t think the people who need to read/listen this book (extroverts) will.The book is not an “introverts are superior” diatribe but rather an explanation of how we can leverage personality types most effectively. There is no right or best personality type but like life in general, we need to understand each other for more harmonious relationships. Whether these relationships are family, work, or social, applications of understanding are documented throughout the book.There was one example in the book that hit particularly close to home. Although SAT or IQ scores do not support it, people who talk more are perceived as leaders. And, which personality type talks more? Extroverts. Now, assume that both extroverts and introverts have an equal amount of good ideas. Who is going to get their way more? Extroverts. This could be dangerous because they’re going to get their way more meaning that many of their bad ideas are also going to be implemented.Oh, another thing I intuitively knew but now have support for is brainstorming sessions. Studies show the larger the number of people involved in a session, the less effective they are. A 9-member group is less effective than a 6-member group which is less than effective than a 4-member group which is less effective than a 2-member group. The suggestion is to conduct brainstorming sessions electronically. Collect comments and then share them anonymously and build from there. One of the reasons is that most introverts are better writers than speakers.Other examples from the business world give tips for how both introverted and extroverted leaders can best work with their subordinates of each type. Take advantage of each of their strengths. Such as how studies show that introverts “inspect” and extroverts “react”. Neither adjective should be taken as derogatory but instead as strengths. Allow introverts time to examine and solve. Studies show they are more persistent trying to solve unsolvable problems. The famous introvert, Albert Einstein said, “It is not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.” My hero.A final word on the narration—fantastic. If you have the opportunity to listen rather than read this book, I would strongly recommend going with the audio format. Kathe Mazur does a perfect narration in a “Quiet”, calm, soothing voice. Very appropriate “in a noisy world that can’t stop talking”. "
7,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent,3,"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is about being an introvert in today's society.Confession time: I'm a tremendous introvert. I know you're all thinking something along the lines of ""What? A guy who reads constantly and writes over a hundred book reviews a year is an introvert?"" Shocking but true. I could easily go days without human contact. At parties, I'm the guy hanging out near the food or snooping through the host's books or medicine cabinet. I could go into more detail but since I have a feeling most Goodreaders are also introverts, I'll skip it.Basically, the book is a flashing neon sign that says it's okay to be an introvert. Susan Cain chronicles her own struggles as an introvert, as well as showing how America went from being about character to about personality, right around the time movies and TV started getting popular. It covers introverts in all areas, like corporate America, and how introverts are treated in other societies. There's a lengthy section on raising introvert kids, which a lot of parents could use instead of shoving their kids into the shark-infested extrovert waters.Honestly, I could have used this book as a teenager, when people were constantly badgering me to go out more. Scientific discoveries and works of art are rarely made by people who are constantly talking. Cain covers topics like being an introvert in the business world, where people who talk the loudest get their way more often than not, something I see every day in cubeland.Actually, the book gave me insight into the behavior of some of my family. Until he retired, my dad was crabbier than Red Foreman all the time. I used to think he was just an angry asshole but now I think he was an introvert with nowhere to unwind. Now that he's retired, I see how much alike we are. He's actually pretty friendly as long as the visits don't go too long. Susan Cain's writing style is engaging. I felt the repeated examples may have padded the book a bit. While I felt validated by reading it, sometimes it felt like a book a kid named Matthew, who happened to be missing a finger, wrote about how nine-fingered Matthews are the best at everything. I liked it but most of what Cain says seemed pretty obvious. There are no mind-blowing revelations for introverts within. I do recommend extroverts read it, however. 3.5 out of 5 stars."

9,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/886144-brigid,5,"You can also read this review on Flying Kick-a-pow! ReviewsThis is a bit different from what I typically read and review. I don't often read non-fiction, but when my mom got this out of the library and I read the inside flap, I knew I would have to give it a shot. It sounded like something I could relate to and possibly benefit from … and it was. As soon as I started it, I was totally engrossed. And as I made my way through the entire thing, I felt like I was learning more and more about myself.My whole life I've been an introvert. I keep to myself more than the people around me do. I tend to prefer reading/writing to partying. I'm very self-conscious about speaking; when I talk in front of a bunch of unfamiliar people, I stumble over my words and blush and feel like a moron … hence, I usually opt not to speak at all unless someone forces me to and/or speaks to me first.I've grown used to labels like ""shy"" and ""quiet,"" to the rude questions like ""Can you talk?"", ""Do you speak English?"", and ""Have you been in this class the whole year?"" The confrontations and notes from teachers/professors are expected by now. ""You need to speak up more in class,"" ""Don't be shy!"" etc. Just thinking about it right now makes me want to punch a wall. People act as if it's some magical switch I can turn on and off. They think I don't talk much because I'm incompetent, because I'm lazy, because I'm a bitch, because I think I'm better than everyone else. People who know me well can see I'm none of those things (at least, I hope I'm not), but for a lot of people it seems to be a challenge to understand that. It's not that I blame them, because I think it's hard to comprehend what it's like to be an introvert if you haven't experienced it yourself. But still, it's frustrating.What makes being an introvert so hard is that––especially in the US––we are held up to what Susan Cain calls the ""Extrovert Ideal."" That is, we are told our whole lives that the ""ideal"" person is an extrovert––outgoing, confident, well-spoken, etc. Extroverted people are thought of as being more important, more authoritative, and more attractive. If you are a shy, you are more likely to be seen as weak, a pushover, a bad leader, an awkward/unattractive person. We're constantly told that in order to succeed, we need to stand up for ourselves, push others out of the way, be the loudest, take the most risks. If you're a shy/introverted person, you are constantly told that you need to change––that if you continue to be quiet, you're never going to get anywhere in life. You won't get a good job, you won't succeed, no one will want to date you ... you name it. Needless to say, I hate being shy. I'm tired of always being told that I need to speak up more, that I just have to be more confident. It's like, do you think I want to be this way? Do you think I enjoy not being able to say what I want to say, that I feel totally idiotic every time I open my mouth, that I don't even want people to look at me because I'm so self-conscious? Trust me, if I could, I would be more confident. If I could just shut off all the thoughts in my head, I would gladly speak up more often. But I've always felt like my brain just wasn't wired that way. People act as if it's as easy as just speaking up, that the leap from being introverted to being extraverted is as easy as, ""You know what? I'm just not going to be shy today! Yay!""And … yeah. It's not like that at all. It's like, when I'm surrounded by people I don't (or only barely) know, I just go on lockdown. My mind doesn't generate things to say. My mouth refuses to open. I just completely freeze up. And it's not that I don't want to participate in the conversation. I wish talking was easy for me. I do want to contribute. Yet, there's this voice in my head telling me to not say anything, and to just sit back and observe.So, obviously, this is a very frustrating trait to have. It holds me back in a lot of social situations. I have trouble making friends (although I do have friends, so don't worry). I've managed to live for two decades without ever having a boyfriend. My grades have suffered. So on and so forth.I've struggled with this my whole life, I constantly beat myself up about it … I've always wondered what the hell was wrong with me. Why couldn't I just magically gain some confidence? Why couldn't I just suck it up and be a more social person? I've spent my whole life trying to find something to blame, some reason why I've always been like this. Is it because I'm part of a large family, and therefore I've always felt like I should just keep my problems to myself? Is it because I grew up in such an academically competitive town where there was too much pressure to be the star student? Of course, there must be various contributing factors. But according to Cain's book, it may be due more to nature than to nurture than we may think.Cain discusses several studies that relate introversion/extroversion to sensitivity. And apparently, people with more active amygdalae––a part of the brain that plays a significant role in processing memory and emotional reactions––are far more likely to be introverts. People fall roughly into two groups: ""high reactive"" and ""low reactive."" If you are a more high reactive individual, you are more likely to:- React more strongly to stimuli––new sounds, meeting new people, seeing disturbing images, etc.- Be more empathetic towards other people- Be very observational, notice small details- React more emotionally to artwork/music/books/etc.- Be more prone to emotional problems like anxiety/depression- Be very sensitive about what other people think of you, and therefore become timid in social situations where you don't know many peopleThis isn't to say, of course, that more low reactive people don't experience these things, it's just that it tends to happen on a lower scale for them because their amygdalae are not as sensitive. Also, high reactive does not automatically equal introverted and low reactive doesn't automatically equal extroverted, but research suggests a strong correlation between the two traits. But what's most important to realize about levels of reactivity is that they can't be controlled. Cain discusses one study in which infants were tested for how reactive they were to stimuli––and a majority of high-reactive infants grew up to be introverts, while the low-reactive infants tended to grow up to be extroverts. It's studies such as these that suggest we don't choose introversion or extroversion; they are built into our DNA. One can easily fake one or the other. That is, you can be an introvert and still speak a lot and socialize frequently––it's just that, as an introvert, you will be more drained by social interaction. Because introverts are often more high-reactive individuals and therefore react more strongly to stimuli, a room of new faces is much more exhausting to process than it would be for someone who is more low-reactive. I could go on and on about this, but of course––if you want to learn more, I highly suggest reading this book. There's a lot of fascinating information about the subject.Quiet seriously changed the way I think about myself. I still dislike being shy and introverted for many reasons. But after reading this, I also know that I might not have the same creative and observant traits that I have now, if I were extroverted instead. And more importantly, I know that it isn't my fault for being this way––and that millions of people face the same struggle that I do. I don't know if I can say that I really accept who I am, at least not yet. But at least I feel like I understand it a lot better.Over all, I think this book is well-written and well-researched, and Cain narrates it with heart and humor––drawing from her own experience as an introvert alongside her studies of the subject. I thought Quiet was brilliant, and I recommend it to introverts and extroverts alike. ~ Flying Kick-a-pow! Reviews ~"
10,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia,5,"As you can see, i've been mixing up my reading lately, THIS ISN'T ROMANCE YAY!Quiet is a fascinating book about the prejudice that our society faces against introverts, and why it's unfounded, and how, as an introvert, you can overcome that, as well as just KNOW yourself better. I never really classified myself as such before, but reading this, I understand why, if I'm exhausted, all I want to be is alone, and how I'm extroverted only when I can control my environment and how that's a THING! If you're shy or are unsure, this is a great read. I think you'll discover something about yourself, that's why I've recommended to a lot of people lately! "
11,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5119730-yvonne,5,"Thank you, Susan Cain, for writing this remarkable book! As an introvert who has always been regarded as not only quiet, but also timid and weak, this book is very refreshing. It puts into words what many introverts know intuitively; strength does not have to be loud, in your face, or aggressive. Strength and conviction can present themselves quietly without sacrificing effectiveness. Through impressive research, Ms. Cain clearly demonstrates the importance of both personality types and the value of introversion. I only wish that I could have read this book when I was younger so that I would have been more confident and accepting of my own nature. After reading it now, I do feel that I can better articulate the importance of my role in society and take pride in the contributions that introverts have made throughout history."

I am an introvert and PROUD!
I am sure this is not totally surprising considering my huge love of books and writing. I am also sure many users (if not most of us) are introverts here on Goodreads. And Susan Cain is one of us and she celebrates it. This is a book about our strengths, and our weaknesses; it is a book about realising that although we do not fit the ideal model for success, we can still be dramatically successful given the right circumstances and a chance to shine. We are the creative thinkers and the critics. We are the over analysers. We are those that prefer to retire to the inner-workings of our own world when we’ve had enough of people and society. We are those that would rather think than talk. And that is our greatest weapon. 
“There's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas.”
I am going to talk a little bit about me and my own experience. I have done jobs that are characteristically more suited to extroverts. For many years I worked as a theatre front of house manager, overseeing large teams in an extremely busy entertainment venue. I also worked as a running-shoe salesman in a top-end sports shop offering great customer service and advice. What made me effective in such roles was my ability to keep a level head and analyse the situations I was in and then make the best response after thinking things through. I lead from the back. My approach to management was always subtle, but it worked. My point is, and Susan Cain’s point is, we can do all the same things extroverts can do. We will just do them a little bit differently. She does not say that introverts are better people. She does not say that the extrovert ideal is necessarily wrong. What she advocates for is another side of the story, another ideal and another type of person who can use what they have to their own advantage once they understand their worth. 
“Don't think of introversion as something that needs to be cured.”
And this is so important to understand. We need to embrace our introvert nature because it makes us unique and more in control of our thoughts and emotions. I truly wish I understood this simple fact at a younger age because I spent many years miserable as a teen because my personality did not compute with what was considered ideal. So, this is an excellent book and I feel that it will be of immense use to many people, not just introverts. In order to succeed as a species, we need to recognise – and celebrate – the simple fact that we are all uniquely different. 
Some of the most brilliant of people have been introverts

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestQuestion: How do you know if someone is an introvert?Answer: They're going to fucking tell you.Right now, it's very popular to be an introvert. There are various introvert webcomics, TED talks about why introversion is so great, and numerous people who will tell you that they are an introvert and subject you to discussion and analysis of what this means with the same enthusiasm of someone who reads horoscopes. People confess to introversion with the same kind of humble bragginess as self-obsessed artists who roll their eyes when you compliment their art and say it was ""just a sketch.""It's true that being quiet or shy (note: these are not the same thing) used to be considered a bad thing. I grew up at the height of ""party culture,"" when all things club or frat were popular. Jersey Shore was on TV, skirts were short, hair was frosted, and everything was superficial and light. If you couldn't fizz and glitter like a sparkler in everyday conversation, you were weird and everyone hated you. I was weird, and people were not fans of me. I wore all black, read Anne Rice, and listened to Evanescence and The Cure while pondering why all of my classmates were idiots. My scorn probably didn't help, but there was absolutely no way at the time I could have fit it, or been happy doing so.Skimming through the reviews, I noticed I was one of the few self-professed introverts who despised this book. I thought that was interesting, but it's not completely unforeseen. I actually self-describe as a ""social introvert"" or ""false extrovert."" People who meet me for the first time think I'm very extroverted. I can be very loud and chatty, and organize a lot of social events in my office or with friends. But I'm also very uncomfortable in certain social situations and as much as I enjoy being out, I'm sometimes secretly delighted when plans are canceled and enjoy spending time by myself.It's been a while since my psychology days, but there is a chemical basis for introversion and extroversion. One of these lies in the sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous systems. People who are introverted have a lower threshold for being overstimulated, and when they reach that threshold, feel drained and must rest. People who are extroverted, on the other hand, have a lower threshold and need to seek out stimulation in order to get the bar up. If they don't get stimulation, they feel sluggish and depressed. I thought the neurotransmitter in question was dopamine, but a quick Google makes it look like the neurotransmitter in question is actually acetylcholine. #TILI have taken issue with a lot of these pop psychology books. I wasn't a fan of THE SBUTLE ART OF NOT GIVING A F*CK, which seemed like the self-help version of snake oil, and recently also read SNAKES IN SUITS, which was like a Lifetime movie wearing science like it was a pretty dress. This one had a bit more science, but Susan Cain definitely spent way too much time cherry picking her arguments and the end result was me having a bad taste in my mouth and wanting to roll my eyes.I guess I have a few take-away points here. 1. Introverts and extroverts serve different functions in society. Neither is an intrinsically good or bad trait, and they are not binary. Like many human characteristics, these exist on a spectrum.2. We live in a social society, and acting antisocial to coddle your introversion makes you look, well, antisocial (confrontational, against society) instead of asocial, which is just wanting to be left alone.3. It's probably true that a lot of introverts were responsible for inventions because they spent a lot of time alone, but this is not the only type of genius or the only form genius takes. As I said in point #1, humans exist on a spectrum, and there are many different shapes of brilliant minds out there.4. People enjoy belonging to groups. That's why horoscopes are so popular, and why people post their Meyers-Briggs results on their dating websites. We live in an in-group vs. outgroup society - yes, you too, introverts, jeez - and enjoy feeling as though we belong. Introverts like calling themselves introverts because it makes them feel a bond with other introverts (seriously, just read the comments sections of any of the positive reviews for this book), which promotes bursts of probably dopamine.5. The author seems to be claiming that extroverts have the natural advantage and are mean to introverts but then spends a big part of the book shitting all over them. Hypocrite. At the end of the day, you should take books like these with a grain of salt. They're definitely more self-help geared than scientific, in my opinion,and a lot of the arguments and conclusions feel cherry-picked. Introverts may enjoy reading it while vigorously patting themselves on the back, but we as a society are moving in a direction where this is starting to feel kind of redundant and narcissistic.1 star"
15,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,5,"This book blew my mind. I loved it so much that I wish I could give a copy to all of my friends and relatives.Susan Cain does an excellent job of explaining the different strengths between introverts and extroverts, and the history of how America came to idealize extroverts. I agree that as a society we tend to value the gregarious go-getters, the loud talkers, the forceful presenters. But Cain's book reminds us that societies need introverts, too — the thinkers, the listeners, the people who look before leaping. The long, long, long list of introverts in history includes: Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, George Orwell, Marcel Proust, J. K. Rowling, Lewis Carroll, W. B. Yeats, Warren Buffet, Steve Wozniak, Charles Schultz, Al Gore, Rosa Parks, Gandhi...As an introvert, I found the book comforting and inspiring. But extroverts who are in relationships with introverts or who are parents of an introvert would also do well to read this book. The author has good tips for how to handle introverts, especially children.""Love is essential. Gregariousness is optional ... Use your natural powers -- of persistence, concentration, insight and sensitivity -- to do work you love and work that matters. Solve problems, make art, think deeply. Figure out what you are meant to contribute to the world and make sure you contribute it.""Update April 2015I read this book about two years ago, and I think it has been the most influential book I've read in years. Cain's book profoundly changed how I viewed myself, others, and our various roles in society. I have recommended this book to numerous friends, and some of them commented on how grateful they were to have read it. I will add managers and supervisors to the list of people who I think should read this book, because it helps to explain some workplace and group dynamics. While the writing isn't perfect (I remember Cain meanders a bit), I'm leaving my rating at 5 stars because of how powerful and inspirational this book has been."
16,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine,5,"Once upon a time there was a woman who dreaded the staff meeting roundtable, when each person had to share what was good or bad or on their professional plate that week or in their personal life. All five, nine, fifteen pairs of eyes would be upon her as she forced her voice to carry down the table, knocking off as few words as she could to express, “Everything’s great!” before turning her flushed face to the colleague beside her. This same woman could take the stage before an audience in the hundreds at a conference and deliver a speech with poise, loving every moment she was in the spotlight. She’d spin around her shopping cart to avoid meeting an acquaintance in the produce department at the grocery store, then host a wine dinner that night for twenty strangers, her joy bubbling as much as the Champagne she poured, explaining to the assembled crowd the difference between méthode traditionelle and transfer method of production. She could spend hours waiting tables at a busy restaurant, engaging in happy grace and good humor with dozens of customers, but the thought of a Friday night party at a friend’s, hanging out in a kitchen drinking beer with a few people from work? She’d feign a sudden flu or a last-minute family obligation to avoid hours of mindless chatter.That I am an introvert is not news to me. I can’t recall when I first took the Myers-Briggs personality type test, but I should have INFJ tattooed on my forehead, for the results never waver. And at some point, I got the message that being an introvert doesn't mean I'm shy, for I am not; it doesn't mean I'm not a risk-taker, for I am, or that I don’t form deep personal attachments, for I have many. What it does mean, among many things, is that socializing wears me out. I abhor chitchat, loud people, group projects and “going out.” It means I love to lose myself in solitary endeavors. It means I love process, not reward. It means I’d rather just sit and listen. And when I have something to say, please be patient. I’m not a fast talker, I pause a lot, searching for just the right word. And even then you’ll probably have to strain to hear me. Unless I’ve thoroughly rehearsed my responses, I’ll never deliver my thoughts with articulate confidence. There are parts of Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking that made me laugh, even as tears stung my eyes. Knowing that I prefer to be alone—that I have little tolerance for casual social situations—never released me from feeling that I needed to overcome my social awkwardness and impatience, my thin skin and tendency to fret about the future and things beyond my control. I thought these were faults, not characteristics of a personality type shared by millions, most of us existing in contemplative, considerate silence. Through research, anecdotal interviews and personal experiences, Cain explores the ways introverted personalities manifest themselves in the workplace and personal relationships. The section on “highly-sensitive” people struck home. 
The highly sensitive tend to be philosophical or spiritual in their orientation, rather than materialistic or hedonistic. They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions—sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy, and fear. They are highly empathetic…with thinner boundaries separating them from other people’s emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world
 Yes, please. Reading this, I realized one of the reasons I tend to shut myself off and away is because I am overwhelmed by my own helplessness to change the world. I take things so personally and feel them so deeply that I become frozen in place, not knowing how to translate feeling into action. When Cain discusses her professional epiphany, I had another laugh/cry moment. Hers was realizing that she was never cut out to be a corporate lawyer; mine, a university and corporate administrator. There are many aspects of our professions in which we excelled, rising quickly through the ranks. But neither of us is cut out for committee work, for schmoozing and glad-handing, for blowing our own horn—all required in legal circles, ivory towers and boardrooms. I loved the one-on-one time I spent counseling students, building relationships with individual faculty, developing administrative processes and procedures, doing research and yes, presenting at conferences and leading workshops, for which I rehearsed and prepared weeks in advance. But I knew I’d never rise to the ranks of the one in charge; I simply wasn’t built for the social demands and networking required of a Director. So, for fifteen years I left job after job just at the pinnacle of power and success—always the Bridesmaid, never the Bride. I never really knew why, except that something was inherently wrong with me. At last, I accept nothing is wrong with me; denying myself the opportunity to advance was recognition that moving up meant moving into roles for which I was constitutionally not suited. Now I am a writer. And a happy little clam. I work to create niches of social balance to avoid complete isolation—I belong to a book club, a writer’s group, I volunteer, meet friends for coffee. Social media is a great release for me, because I only talk when I want to, I have all the time in the world to construct my thoughts (which I can edit later!) and no one is looking at me as I speak. Quiet has given me permission not to regard my limited in-person social circle as evidence of a failure of personality, but as respect given to my true nature: “Love is essential: gregariousness is optional.” In some ways, working through the theories and examples in this book is exhausting and dispiriting—if I’d had a better understanding of how I function best, would I have made different choices? Yet, the most important choices I’ve made—excelling at and loving parts of my profession that I’m built for and not being swayed by extrinsic rewards to pursue paths for which I am not; the dogged determination that puts me in front of a keyboard every day with few indications that I will be able to make a living doing what I love—I’ve stuck to my temperament. My life’s path hasn’t been without its stumbles, but even without knowing quite what makes me tick, I've been true to my nature. This is Cain’s consistent and loudest message, delivered with the gentle power of an introvert. A Manifesto for Introverts (from Quiet)1.	There’s a word for “people who are in their heads too much”: Thinkers.2.	Solitude is a catalyst for innovation.3.	The next generation of quiet kids can and must be raised to know their own strengths.4.	Sometimes it helps to be a pretend extrovert. There will always be time to be quiet later.5.	But in the long run, staying true to your temperament is key to finding work you love and work that matters.6.	One genuine new relationship is worth a fistful of business cards.7.	It’s OK to cross the street to avoid making small talk.8.	“Quiet leadership” is not an oxymoron.9.	Love is essential; gregariousness is optional.10.	“In a gentle way, you can shake the world.” – Mahatma Ghandi"
17,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,4,"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain is a 2012 Crown publication. I’ve seen Susan Cain’s ‘Ted Talks’, video and knew I would have to read her book, it was just a matter of fitting it into my schedule. As an extreme introvert, this book definitely feels like a form of validation. See? There is nothing wrong with me. There are other people out there just like me, who avoid social situations at all cost, would rather take a good beating than speak publicly, who feel drained after social occasions, and who must have alone time. There are people who, like myself, tried to fake an extrovert personality, but were miserable because it. In a world that is increasingly group oriented, that recognizes the loud, outspoken, forceful personality over the quiet, soft spoken, unassuming temperament, this book is a Godsend. But, while the book explains the tendencies of the introvert and offers some theories on how people develop this type of temperament, and how to cope and compromise in order to fulfill your job duties and family obligations without suffering an overabundance of anxiety or develop depression or a dependence on medication, this book is also a must read for extroverts!Yes, that’s right… extroverts should read this book too, so they can understand that colleague, sibling, or spouse, or child who is quiet, craves alone time, avoids social situations, and would rather not waste time on small talk.  How can employers create a workplace setting that brings out the best of both temperaments? Many people work better and are far more productive when working alone, and have much to contribute, but are often drowned out by the constant cacophony surrounding them. While I agree with nearly everything the author writes, most of the scientific studies and analogies were only moderately interesting and highly debatable. I don’t know if I agreed with all those findings, and this particular section of the books was just a little bit dull. Not everything mentioned here will pertain to every single person who identifies as an introvert. Taking the informal quiz, I answered nearly every question with ‘Yes’, but there were several traits that I do not own, so this is not a ‘one size fits all’ course, and doesn’t try to be, but I think the author covered a tremendous amount of relevant material any introvert can use and relate to. I would not consider this book a ‘self-help’ book, but the author included a few tips and exercises one can use to ease social anxiety and learn to work in groups and speak publicly. There is also a section for parents who may worry about an introverted child, and how to encourage that child, not change them. Overall, I am so happy to see the problems introverts face in an extroverted world, addressed and brought to the forefront. 4 stars"
18,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"Most of this, to be honest, is self-explanatory, but the rest is a fairly comprehensive exploration of how extroversion became a public ideal back in the 1920's, replacing the power of character with personality and the social stigma that has ever since been placed upon people who don't seem vibrant and ebullient. It shouldn't come as any surprise to anyone that 1/3 to 1/2 of all people are introverts, but because we live in a society that places a premium on everything non-introverted, most of us have to fake it to make it, and with that comes exhaustion and misunderstanding, whether with our bosses, our intimates, or with ourselves and our own natures.This book tells us to relax. Be ourselves. Value what you value and understand that some people aren't naturally conflict avoidant, that they like to express anger, surround themselves with a bunch of shallow social jostlers, and that we oughtn't judge our extroverted peers when they jump into decision-making strategies that sink ships and endanger the lives of everyone around them just because they couldn't be bothered to think things through before opening their damn mouths.And please don't judge all the sheep that are impressed by the aggressive blowhards and follow on their every word because they're just so damn charismatic, either.It's okay to think and spend some time alone from others. Really. It might just be the salvation of the world if enough of us just throw off the yoke of social expectations or the stigma of shyness and just get prepared, build up all our talents and reserves in peace, and strike when the time is perfect. We're not unobservant, after all. We just have little patience for bullshit.And even if society has taught us to lie our asses off whenever we're expected to be gregarious and social in all those damn shallow ways that others tell us are the only way to make it in this world, don't despair. The High Social Monitoring we do is a coping mechanism that we've had to develop PRECISELY because we're considered social pariahs. Oh, and GoodReads is a hotbed for a grass-roots introvert revolution. I don't think anyone here will have any real difficulty cultivating contacts and building their networking, because, after all, we're all discussing things that are very important to us and we're diving deep into the material, wallowing in our talents and our passions, and when we rise, And Oh! We will Rise!We will rise like the phoenix from the ashes of social scorn and we will scour the world of all those who would ever deny us our right to sit in silence to read our favorite book or sit in silence to write a chapter in our next brilliant novel.We Will Overcome!(Aside: Some interpretations of this book are mine only and should not be associated with the author.)"

I've always 'kept' this one for myself ( yet I've bought extra copies a few times and have given it as a gift). I feel everyone benefits from this book..'everyone' ... and the process of reading it is a fabulous journey too! Rating: 4.9. Why not a solid 5 star rating? At 'times' I felt the author (an introvert herself), painted a slanted side of the extrovert. [these were just 'small' between-the-line-gut-feelings I felt 'sensitive to']....However:This book is 'excellent'. Its interesting as can be -informative-important- and enjoyable. ...A fast read even 'with' sitting at a table taking notes. (I took 8 long pages of notes)-- it was pure 'joy'....(engaging with this topic). Much to think about, to remember, to discuss. Our book club will talk about this book together Oct. 20th (can't wait). All teachers and parents would benefit from reading this book. *Everyone* would benefit reading this book!I'd suggest this book to EVERYONE!!!"
20,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,5,"Quiet entered my life at a particularly low moment. Allow me to set the scene: I had been on vacation for a week and a half. We were in Colorado, visiting my husband's family, some of whom I had met before, others whom I had not. I knew I wasn't going to be entirely comfortable being around people the whole trip- I'm a huge introvert and I'm self aware enough to know that I need downtime, and quite a bit of it, to feel as if I'm functioning normally. But I didn't realize that my husband, who is just as introverted as I am and who I was counting on to help me through all of the introductions, dinners, conversations, etc, was going to immerse himself in Pokemon Go a majority of the time and essentially leave me to my own devices. As Susan Cain would say, he found a ""restorative niche"" for himself in a digital world. It was hard on me as I didn't have that escape.So, here we are, visiting a friend's home and my daughter, who strangely enough is a huge extrovert (the exact opposite of her parents), is struggling. She's tired, out-of-sorts, and throwing a sulk every ten minutes. I'm meeting yet more people, trying to hold trite conversations, and steer my child, all the while just wanting to retreat into a cave and not talk to anyone for a very long time. Honestly, I felt that way before we reached the party, but things seemed to get much, much worse the moment we arrived. It had been building over the course of the vacation, but that day, my internal clamor reached a boiling point. My husband was oblivious to my growing discomfort as he's catching Pokemon, again. (I don't mean to sound bitter here, but I suppose that I am.) I had forced myself for ten days to be social, keep the smile on my face, keep everything flowing smoothly. To my horror, I realize that I am about to have a panic attack in the middle of this crowd of people, more than half of whom I don't even know. I grab my keys and leave.I drive a couple blocks away, castigating myself for not being able to handle it and just pissed because, once again, like many times in my childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, I feel like I'm failing at life because I'm not a social butterfly. I can't stand to be around strangers for extended periods of time. I've always been this way- overly sensitive to others, noise, motion, events. I really dislike groups, parties, places where I have to circulate with a bunch of people who don't know me or care about anything that I have to say. The tears fell down my cheeks as I opened up my tablet and began reading this book. And I discovered that about half of all people are just like me. Thank you, Susan Cain. Your book gave me the courage to drive back to my friend's house and face the rest of the evening. I am not a pariah. I am an introvert and perhaps I can do a better job figuring out when I've reached my socializing limits before I meltdown.Many of the positive attributes of introverts which Susan describes, I totally have, I've just never considered them as worth the trade-off of the extroverted personality. I notice small details, have a great memory for conversations and events, long past the time when others forget such things. I think carefully about problems and people, devoting time to taking apart small nuances of books and movies, that other people don't even consider, which makes me a good reviewer of media- perfect for my job as a librarian. Susan nailed my general feeling about myself in the introduction: ""Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a man's world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are. Extroversion is an enormously appealing personality style, but we've turned it into an oppressive standard to which most of us feel we must conform."" pg 34 ebook. Yes!My role at the reference desk calls for an extroverted personality but I muddle through it, because I care about the job and helping others. Usually, I come home from work, totally worn out and in need of quiet time to unwind. Susan helped me understand that sometimes ""faking it"" is worth it, if it for a cause that means something to you and that others do the exact same thing that I do. Pull out the mask for the job, but then allow yourself the freedom to be who you really are at home: ""According to Free Trait Theory, we are born and culturally endowed with certain personality traits- introversion, for example- but we can and do act out of character in the service of ""core personal projects."" In other words, introverts are capable of acting like extroverts for the sake of work they consider important, people they love, or anything they value highly."" pg 391 ebook.My favorite parts of the book were about sensitivity and social situations. Take this passage: ""...maybe we didn't choose ... social accessories at random. Maybe we've adopted dark glasses, relaxed body language, and alcohol as signifiers precisely because they camouflage signs of a nervous system on overdrive. Sunglasses prevent others from seeing our eyes dilate with surprise or fear; we know from Kagan's work that a relaxed torso is a hallmark of low reactivity; and alcohol removes our inhibitions and lowers our arousal levels. When you go to a football game and someone offers you a beer, says the personality psychologist Brian Little, ""they're really saying hi, have a glass of extroversion."" pg 277 ebook. I may use that in my life. ""Please hand me that glass of extroversion.""I also really enjoyed learning the differences in thinking: ""Introverts and extroverts also direct their attention differently: if you leave them to their own devices, the introverts tend to sit around wondering about things, imagining things, recalling events from their past, and making plans for the future. The extroverts are more likely to focus on what's happening around them. It's as if extroverts are seeing ""what is"" while their introverted peers are asking ""what if.""  pg 323 ebook. Yeah, I do that too.I can't recommend this book highly enough. It saved an evening for me, but more importantly, it changed the way that I view myself. There is power in knowing that you're not alone. Again, thank you, Susan Cain. Some read-alikes: The Introvert's Way: Living a Quiet Life in a Noisy World by Sophia Dembling (for introversion) or Furiously Happy: A Funny Book About Horrible Things by Jenny Lawson (for more instances of social anxiety)."

And so, as a long-time (although fairly gregarious) introvert, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Not much of it was truly surprising, but still, it's nice to read a book that validates the way I tend to operate anyway.

22,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,2,"Shhh, I'm taking some quiet time.Kidding! I'll be honest. I avoided this book the first time it appeared, when the buzz had it popping up all over. But my introversion has been more than a bit disrespected lately and I was feeling a need for some affirmation. Alas, I'm not sure I found much helpful here.Part One is 'The Extrovert Ideal,' and looks at how the change from the 18th century ideal of personality to 20th century cult of personality emphasized extroversion as a valuable workplace trait. I liked the concept of the two, as the cultural evolution from one to the other makes a great deal of sense, but I'm not sure how accurate that may be. I feel like Americans--and perhaps everyone--has always been responsive to extroverted, charismatic people. Actually, that highlights an error in Cain's thinking, that she frequently conflates traits. To give her credit, she admits from the beginning that there is no uniform definition of 'introversion.' At page 11, she finally defines her terms, but she unfortunately tends to define them in terms of examples:""Still, today's psychologist tend to agree on several important points: for example, that introverts and extroverts differ in the level of outside stimulation that they need to function well. Introverts feel 'just right' with less stimulation, as when they sip wine with a close friend, solve a crossword puzzle, or read a book. Extroverts enjoy the extra bang that comes from activities like meeting new people, skiing slippery slopes, and cranking up the stereo.... Many psychologists would also agree that introverts and extroverts work differently. Extroverts tend to tackle assignments quickly. They make fast (sometimes rash) decisions, and are comfortable multitasking and risk-taking... Introverts often work more slowly and deliberately. They like to focus on one task at a time and can have mighty powers of concentration. They're relatively immune to the lures of wealth and fame.""It's some slippery stuff, because she ends up conflating a number of characteristics, and that's where it can get really fuzzy. This lack of specificity also means relying on anecdotes of how introversion is a helpful trait. Later in the book, she does bring in studies about 'reactivity,' a genetic-based trait that she prefers to call, 'sensitivity.' I've seen the term before, in The Highly Sensitive Person: How to Thrive When the World Overwhelms You, and a lot of it comes from research on reactiveness/responsiveness to stimulation and how that is then interpreted. To be sure, it's interesting stuff, but it doesn't necessarily apply to all introverts, as she points out, ""about 70% of sensitive people are [introverts]"" (page 145). After backtracking to explain the evolutionary basis for selection of sensitivity, she then attempts to tie sensitivity and conscientiousness together. It's a thin, tenuous line to get from introverted to evolutionary sensitivity to conscientiousness and then imply that that's the kind of person you want in your company. As singular issues, each of these is well-presented. She usually cites one researcher and gives an example of a famous person who changed the world with this trait (Eleanor Roosevelt represented the introverted, sensitive and conscientious person). But it feels like both sloppy logic and false aggrandizement. As an introvert, I no more want to be 'special' for these qualities that presumably go with my genetic and personality tendencies than I want to be disrespected.For no particularly good reason, except the fact that it described me better than I've ever been described before, I'm actually a fan of the Jungian-based personality assessment. I think I particularly responded to the Jungian analysis because rather than the two-axis basis, there's other traits that also affect how we interact with the world. I actually think there's quite a continuum between introversion and extroversion, and that these tendencies can be modified by learning, as Cain rightly points out in Section Two.So, about Quiet. I don't think it really added anything to my understanding on introversion and extroversion. In fact, I think it fell into a more extroverted (as she would say) analysis of having to prove the worth of the trait and using famous figures to support her examples only added to that perception. Quiet didn't give me the acknowledgement I was looking for, really, just a lot of cheerleading that I'm (still) a good person for being an introvert. Hopefully, for those new to discovering their introversion, this might encourage them to both understand and respect their approach. Just don't look for many tips. Read this book if:1) You suspect/know you are an introvert but feel badly about it2) You are an extrovert who doesn't get why introverts don't just get out more.For a more rigorous analysis, check out Kelly's review:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
23,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi,4,"This book spoke directly to my soul, to the core of my being.If you’re on this site and reading this, you probably enjoy time alone to read, think and recharge your batteries. It’s not that you’re anti-social, you just prefer having meaningful conversations with one or two people rather than being stuck in a room with a loud group talking about... nothing. Susan Cain’s book will validate you and make you feel you’re not a freak. You don’t need “to come out of your shell.” In fact, there are more of us out there than you’d think. “Introverts” – even the word has negative connotations – make up somewhere between ⅓ and ½ of the population. Cain, who trained as a lawyer but discovered the corporate world wasn’t for her, provides a fascinating look at how current society champions the extrovert ideal. People who speak quickly and loudly (even if they’re not saying much) get praised and promoted. Team-work is encouraged, and there’s no “I” in team, now is there? But introverts, those quiet people who are trying to focus while people are blabbing all around them, have a lot to contribute. Yet they're often ignored.Early sections of the book are devoted to closely examining this extrovert ideal, in a hellishly hilarious Tony Robbins motivation seminar; in the running of a super church; and in studying how Dale Carnegie altered the social landscape with his gung-ho bible How To Win Friends And Influence People.Cain looks at the science of temperament, showing how differences are evident from childbirth – an extended bit about “high and low reactive people” is fascinating. She also shows that introverts might actually be physiologically more “thin-skinned” than extroverts, and how introversion and conscience are connected.Understanding personality types isn’t just theoretical. It has practical applications. Cain suggests how the extroverts in the business world may have caused the 2008 Wall Street crash. And her look at other cultures – Asia, for instance – demonstrates that the extrovert ideal isn’t a universal phenomenon. I found the sections on how introverts learn how to become “fake” extroverts absolutely mind-blowing. There are stories of wildly successful professors and even sales people you’d never classify as introverts but are. I understand this. I think any introvert living in this society has learned, by necessity, how to be more gregarious – through confident voice, posture, attitude – even though it’s not necessarily in his or her nature. I’ve delivered public talks, sat (and talked) on many panels, go to gala openings and for several years had to chat weekly on national TV, always extremely well-prepared (de rigueur for introverts)... but I never really felt or feel completely at ease in these environments. I have to decompress afterwards with close friends. Or go home and read a book.One of the most valuable lessons Cain teaches us is to follow our instincts, especially concerning work and love. To go against our natures could be fatal.Cain also offers up inspiring examples of introverts throughout history: from Rosa Parks and Eleanor Roosevelt to Steve Wozniak and Mahatma Gandhi. Each one is instructive and remarkable. The book gets bogged down near the end by illustrations of how introverts and extroverts can get along. And at times there’s a bit of over-compensating rah-rahing for the underdog. But it’s not introvert = good, extrovert = bad, and after all, most of us aren’t exclusively in one camp or the other. (Plus: is an extrovert really going to read something called Quiet?) This is a remarkable book, and essential reading for teachers, employers and parents. And for all of you thoughtful friends and readers on Goodreads. "
24,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9889835-matthias,3,"Part I: Prelude to the reviewPart II: The review________________________________Part IPrelude: An introvert walks into a bookstoreI read a review on this book today and decided I had to buy it right away. I consider myself somewhat of an introvert, even though not everyone around me agrees on that, because you know, I talk to people and can be pleasant at the same time. Convincing people there's more to the introvert-extrovert distinction than that hasn't always proven easy.I was hoping this book would prove my point, at the very least for me.I went to the Waterstones branch in Brussels, which is a ten minute walk from where I work. I had to be back in thirty minutes, giving me ten minutes at the store itself to look for the book. Yes, when I said ""right away"" earlier, I meant right away. Not half a day could wait.I go in the store and proceed up to the first floor to check out the non-fiction segments. I do not find the book. I put my head and neck in every possible angle, scanning the shelves from every possible perspective, to no avail. Surely, I must be looking in the wrong shelf. Maybe it's downstairs, because they have a table of bestselling non-fiction there as well, so maybe it's there. Yes! I make my way back down and I look and I find nothing. I've been in the store for at least 7 minutes now, so running out of options, I approach two people working for the store, rudely interrupting their conversation which I was trying to avoid intruding upon earlier.They inform me that the book should be there on the shelf, the one I had checked earlier. I pretend I didn't check it earlier and thank them for their kind and helpful information. I go back to the shelf with renewed confidence I would find it this time. Angles. Perspectives. Cold sweat. Alas. I return to the employees, sadly noting that my interruption seemingly meant the end to their conversation, and inquired again. The lady says it's a completely white cover (as opposed to the cover I was subconsciously looking for because of the example I had seen on Goodreads) and mentally kick myself when she escorts me to the shelf to point it out. But, to her consternation and to my relief, it isn't there. Did I check downstairs? I cautiously respond in the affirmative. She will check the computer, she's certain there are copies available. And... Computer says Yes! Victory! It's in the store, but probably still in the storage room. She asks me to wait while she goes to fetch it. I'm already running out of time (I had ran out of time four minutes prior, to be exact), but quietly thank her for her enthusiasm in helping me. She returns five minutes later, visibly having gone through physical efforts to help me out. The copy she hands me is damaged, dirty and it has a sticker on it which I know won't be removed without further damage. In short: the kind of book I avoid buying in all circumstances. I smile, I thank her, and buy the book. Now I'm here, late at work, and with a brand-new dirty damaged book beside me.Yes, this book is proving I'm introverted alright. Yay me. Or maybe I'm confusing lack of being assertive with introversion. Whatever the case, this book will teach. It has already begun doing so, in any case. ________________________________Part IIReview of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking We're amazing and we know it and we don't clap our hands.Before I started reading this book, I was hoping it would do two things: 1. tell me what I wanted to hear 2. tell me what I needed to hear.It gets three stars because it told me what I wanted to hear. This book is the voice of those who are disinclined to use theirs: the introverts. It puts the introverts under a shower of compliments, in the kind of spotlight we're comfortable in: a generous ode that we can absorb from the comfort of our own cozy corner in our own cozy homes, telling us we have a value in this society.This may seem like a ridiculous reason to give stars to a book, but I think it's a good thing that someone gave attention to a group of people who are not used to, and not always comfortable with, getting so much positive feedback. I can imagine it being a helpful outstretched hand to those introverts who have felt misunderstood, out of place or underappreciated. A hand which shows that what they have been struggling with wasn't just inside their mind. It's a fact that society, being largely built on communication and intense interaction, can seem unfit for those who prefer the thinking-mode and absence of interaction most of the time. So on a personal level, this book definitely can have its value. I say ""can"" and am basing my rating on this potential, though for me personally it wasn't such an eye-opener. I think on some level I've always been very secure about my introversion, despite some practical problems as described in the prelude. In a way I find it funny to think about myself operating like that. I surprise myself in these moments, because before those moments I have this sensible and ideal scenario playing out in my mind and after those moments I'm this rational guy being perfectly capable of seeing how ridiculous I was. But that doesn't prevent me from being ridiculous in the moment.Another reason why this book didn't always work for me on the personal level is because it went too far with the compliments. Consider the following excerpt:""If you're an introvert, find your flow by using your gifts. You have the power of persistence, the tenacity to solve complex problems, and the clear-sightedness to avoid pitfalls that trip others up. You enjoy relative freedom from the temptations of superficial prizes like money and status. Indeed, your biggest challenge may be to fully harness your strenghts. You may be so busy trying to appear like a zestful, reward-sensitive extrovert that you undervalue your own talents, or feel underestimated by those around you. But when you're focused on a project that you care about, you'll probably find that your energy is boundless.So stay true to your own nature.""At that point I had a little introverted vomit.It's not an all-together bad book, but segments like these really bring it down for me. Segments like the above read like a cheap horoscope-zodiac segment at the end of some teenage magazine. There's only so much of the ""what I want to hear"" that I can take before I start wondering if there's any truth to it.On a societal level, I don't think this book is as important as it has been made out to be. Introverts indeed consist of a big part of society and thus have helped form it. I'm of the belief that society can't progress by itself. Nothing can be ""expected"" from society. Society shouldn't cater to any particular group, it's the particular groups that have to find or fight for their place and evolve themselves, in turn engendering progress in society. I think introverts have done a very fine job of this before this book came around, and some anecdotes in this book are proof of that. Introverts have thrived in our world, and will continue to do so. Should education systems be reformed to cater to us? Should work environments do the same? I'm not convinced. Proposals like that make the introvert look like an easily damaged little flower, crushed under the weight of these rigid systems, while I think it's exactly these rigid systems that allow introverts to identify themselves as such. So if the point of this book was patting the introvert on the shoulder to say ""You're amazing"", it does that well. But to go from there to ""You need a society that takes better care of you"" is a leap I had difficulties in going along with.There are some practical pointers for introverts, showing how, when or if we should change our behavior to function well in society or, more importantly, in personal relationships with friends, family and partners. The ""need to hear""-portion of the book, so to speak. I think most of the solutions offered have been found instinctively by introverts around the world, but I found it nice to hear there's actually a word for ""restorative niches"". Remembering my long bathroom brakes when I worked in an open office space has become a little less awkward. Getting more familiar with these concepts definitely makes it a lot easier to give this further thought and find ways forward in my sphere of relations. An important problem I have with the book is its premise: ""the introvert/extrovert divide is the most fundamental dimension of personality"".Susan Cain makes it sound like a truism. Maybe it is true, yes. But I have to say ""maybe"" because I don't feel a premise this crucial has been sufficiently backed up.The author tries to do so, referring to experiments and studies where 28% of a group consisting of people possessing an amygdala that is 11% larger than average were 62% more inclined to respond in such and such a way to such and such incentives. The academic back-up felt like a whole lot of cherrypicking. But all those cherries put together did give the impression that they're the only fruit available, giving the idea that the extrovert/introvert divide is indeed inescapable.This leads me to anoher problem: the divide between introverts and extroverts created by the narration itself. It's true, the author sometimes goes out of her way to compliment extroverts as well, mentioning some of their strengths, but that's just the thing: she has to go out of her way to do it. It shows all the more clearly that the natural discourse, through offhand claims and implicit associations, presents the extroverts as ... ""the others"". And if you picture them as the others, naturally all compliments given to introverts can be read as affronts to the extroverts. I can easily imagine some of the examples and assertions leaving a sour taste of any extrovert's mouth reading this book. (at least when these mouths aren't too busy blabbering about the weather ;-) )Should I hold all this against this book specifically? Truth is I have a problem with most non-fiction books (especially self-help) for this reason: they are written to make a point. A very specific point that they keep getting back to, ad nauseam. The more you hit a nail on the head, the less there's left to see of its point. At least for me. Chesterton says it a lot better:“People wonder why the novel is the most popular form of literature; people wonder why it is read more than books of science or books of metaphysics. The reason is very simple; it is merely that the novel is more true than they are.”― G.K. ChestertonI felt this was true in this case as well. I showed ""Quiet"" more patience because the topic is something I really care about and gave a lot of thought to, but in the end it's Chesterton's way of thinking that prevailed in my experience of this book.That said, the three stars are definitely deserved for all the good this book has done for the introverts, in recognizing that other introverts are going through the same thing and in valueing themselves. I just wished it would have described a little less of what we wanted to hear, and would have done much more of what we needed to hear. But maybe we don't ""need"" to hear all that much, anyway. We're amazing and we know it and we don't clap our hands. "

She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.عنوانها: «سکوت: قدرت درون‌گراها در دنیایی که از حرف زدن باز نمی‌ایستد»؛ «سکوت: قدرت درون‌‌گراها در دنیایی که بی‌وقفه حرف می‌زند»؛ «قدرت سکوت: ‏‫قدرت درونگراها در جهانی که قادر نیست از سخن گفتن باز ایستد!»؛ «سکوت: قدرت درون‌گراها در جهانی که از سخن گفتن نمی‌ایستد!»؛ «سکوت»؛ نویسنده سوزان کین؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هشتم ماه سپتامبر سال 2017 میلادیعنوان: سکوت: قدرت درون‌گراها در دنیایی که از حرف زدن باز نمی‌ایستد؛ نویسنده سوزان کین؛ مترجمها نرگس جوادیان‌قمی، نعيمه اعتدال‌مهر؛ تهران، انتشارات منظومه نگاران ؛ 1393؛ در 292ص؛ شابک 9786009433605؛ موضوع درونگرایی و برونگرایی - روابط بین اشخاص، از نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 21معنوان: سکوت: قدرت درون‌‌گراها در دنیایی که بی‌وقفه حرف می‌زند؛ نویسنده: سوزان کین؛ مترجم: سیمین موحد؛ تهران کتابسرای تندیس‏‫، 1395؛ در 366ص؛ شابک 9786001821929؛ چاپ دوم 1396؛ چاپ سوم 197؛‮‬عنوان: قدرت سکوت: ‏‫قدرت درونگراها در جهانی که قادر نیست از سخن گفتن باز ایستد!؛ نویسنده: سوزان کین‏‫؛ مترجم ناهید سپهرپور؛ ویراستار طاهره خیرآبادی؛ تهران نوین توسعه؛ 1395؛ در 389ص؛ شابک 9786009684311؛ چاپ دوم 1397؛عنوان: سکوت: قدرت درون‌گراها در جهانی که از سخن گفتن نمی‌ایستد!؛ نویسنده: سوزان کین؛ مترجم درسا عظیمی؛ تهران البرز‏‫، 1393؛ در 373ص؛ شابک 9789644428982؛ چاپ دوم و سوم 1395؛ چاپ چهارم و پنجم 1396؛ ‬چاپ ششم و هفتم 1397؛عنوان: سکوت؛ نویسنده: سوزان کین؛ مترجم: روح‌اله صادقی؛ کرج، در دانش بهمن، 1395؛ در 460ص؛ شابک 9789641741978؛ فهرست: دیدگاه‌هایی پیرامون کتاب قدرت سکوت؛ یادداشت نویسنده؛ پیش گفتار؛ دو قطب شمال و جنوب خلق و خو؛ بخش اول: برون‌گرای ایده‌آل؛ 1- ظهور «همکار دوست داشتنی توانمند»؛ چگونه برون‌گرایی به ایده‌آل فرهنگی تبدیل شد؛ 2- افسانه‌ی رهبری کاریزماتیک؛ فرهنگ شخصیت محور، صد سال بعد؛ 3- وقتی همکاری خلاقیت را از بین می‌برد؛ ظهور تفکر گروهی جدید و قدرت کار کردن به تنهایی؛ بخش دوم: بیولوژی شما، خویشتن شما؟ 4- آیا خلق و خوی ما سرنوشت ماست؟ ذات، تربیت و فرضیه‌ی ارکید؛ 5- فراتر از خلق و خو؛ نقش اراده‌ی آزاد (و راز سخنرانی در جمع برای درون‌گراها)؛ 6- «فرانکلین سیاست‌مدار بود، اما النور براساس وجدان سخن می‌گفت»؛ چرا به خونسردها بیش از حد بها داده می‌شود؟ 7- چرا وال استریت سقوط کرد و وارن بافت ترقی کرد؟ چگونه درون‌گراها و برون‌گراها به نحو متفاوتی می‌اندیشند (و دوپامین تولید می‌کنند)؛ بخش سوم: آیا همه ‌ی فرهنگ‌ها برون‌گرایی ایده ‌آل را دارند؟ 8- قدرت نرم؛ آسیایی–آمریکایی‌ها و برون‌گرای ایده‌آل؛ بخش چهارم: چگونه عشق بورزیم، چگونه کار کنیم؛ 9- چه زمانی باید خودتان را برون‌گراتر از آنچه واقعاً هستید، نشان دهید؟ 10- شکاف ارتباطی؛ چگونه با تیپ شخصیتی مخالف خود صحبت کنیم؟ 11- پینه‌دوزها و ژنرال‌ها؛ چگونه بچه‌های ساکت را در جهانی که نمی‌تواند صدای آن‌ها را بشنود پرورش دهیم؟ نتیجه: سرزمین عجایب؛ یادداشتی در وصف فداکاری؛ یادداشتی درباره واژه‌های درونگرا و برونگرا؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 13/04/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

“Introversion – along with its cousins sensitivity, seriousness and shyness – is now a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology. Introverts living under the Extrovert ideal are like women in a man’s world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are.”
I came across the author of this outstanding book when we studied for our Library studies last year. We were to present on the topic “What are you passionate about”, and my friend presented on this topic by firstly going to the author's Ted Talk. This talk is in a nutshell an excellent summary of this book. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0KYU... I recommend this as ‘required watching’ before delving into this book, which is serious and requires vast concentration to take away with you the gamut of information that took the author five years to research and present to us.Essentially, Susan Cain worked successfully in what would be an extremely extrovert profession for ten years, before realising this is not the fight she need not be fighting. Imagine being a Wall Street lawyer! Susan states, in a quote I love in relation to reflecting on the lives of her friends and classmates who she envied (in her own quiet way I imagine).
“My college classmates who’d grown up to be writers or psychologists. Today I’m pursuing my own version of both those roles.”
 I’d say she has found her perfect mix. This book is full of information from many professionals and psychologists leading in their field of expertise. I can wholeheartedly understand this book taking five years of research and writing. On introverts as leaders 
“Because of their inclination to listen to others and lack of interest in domineering social situations, introverts are more likely to hear and implement suggestions… Extroverts, on the other hand, can be so intent on putting their own stamp on events that they risk losing others’ good ideas along the way...”
A fascinating concept is that of high reactivity and low reactivity, beginning at birth. Amygdala is the scientific term. Babies that react wildly from early days of life with dilated eyes, higher cortisol levels (stress hormone), flailing arms and legs etc, shows that they are more likely to ‘feel’ to new stimuli. From visiting a fun park to the first day of school, experiencing the ocean for the first time, of course the list could go on and on. Loud noises, a large group environment. There is a reason for reacting to these situations! The research is not this simple, but this is my take home layman’s explanation. It explains 
“sensitivity to novelty in general, not just to people.”
Studies have gone into such depth that high reactivity and sensitivity has been related to such specifics as blue eyes, allergies and hay fever. Very interesting! Food for thought for this reader. It could be said that I am proof of this. This would be relatable to many: 
“Her favorite part of the day was the quiet ten minutes when she walked to the bus along the tree-lined streets of her neighborhood.“
 This is so important to many people. I will put my hand up for my children’s sports drop off straight after work to get the return journey to drive home solo to have 20 minutes of my audio book, aka peace. It is fascinating that this book has taught me so much about myself. The down side of this is the intense self observance I have been carrying out while reading the book. I guess it’s a good thing but I am tired! I have not stopped observing myself and others. I tear up when I see kindness, listen to an emotional speech, when someone says something particularly nice, hear sad news, or just witness sincere acts or words. I’m not simply ‘soft’. I am fascinated by all of this. 
“...about sensitive people is that sometimes they’re highly empathetic. It’s as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people’s emotions and the tragedies and cruelties of the world.”
 It is also a common trait to be ultra observant of others thoughts, feelings and actions.This book has validated certain behaviours of mine. I won't go into details but I am understanding intricacies of my behaviours. Avoidances, not wanting to engage in social media.. nor wanting to be out there like so many others do. I cannot stand the Facebook gloating, the pushing of the 'perfect life' stuff. I really do think so many people do not understand this side of things, but I dare say those will not read this book. American culture is drilled into deeply here, this is not the interesting issue for me personally, but I can see this is an excellent cultural acknowledgment or opinion of the American way of life. Obviously written from an introvert’s prospective, but this is not too uneven. Extroverts would not feel unheard reading this book, either. This book would appeal greatly to those who feel they are quiet reflectives or those who live with and/or parent children with sensitive and high reactive children. Softly spoken ideas are offered to be taken on board if desired. Do we need to vigorously brainstorm and discuss at all times? Or would those who are more quiet be missed out on all together? This has its downside as ideas may be unheard, or lost all together. Also at the younger side of the spectrum, cluster our youngsters in groups together in the classroom, and some of our young people will not cope with this and the assumed way of learning for all will not suit all. Hopefully teachers all around the world can draw these children out and allow them to contribute in their own way. Much in the same way as open planned offices may not be conducive to all adults, either. A lot to ponder on. This really is a great book, one the author I hope would be proud of."
27,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina,4,"My kids claim that I am the biggest introvert ever. I could spend entire weekends reading without talking to a single person. I avoid social events so that I can watch sports on tv, one time even turning down the chance to hear Ron Chernow speak so I could watch Monday night football. If I am around people for a few hours, I declare myself officially done for the day. With these traits of being an introvert extraordinaire, I was giddy when the nonfiction book club decided to read Quiet by Susan Cain as one of its monthly reads. A corporate lawyer turned introvert advocate, Cain would finally unlock the mystery of why introverted people such as myself do better alone or in small group settings than in large public gatherings. Needless to say, I joined in the group read of Quiet determined to find out more about introverted people and what makes us go. Cain’s premise is that if it weren’t for introverts, the world would be devoid of many inventions, writers, and other creative minds. Dr Seuss was an introvert. So were Emily Dickinson, J.D. Salinger, and Albert Einstein, among others. Steve Jobs was an extrovert but his business partner who designed a personal computer was an introvert. At first I thought that Quiet would be the history of famous introverted people and what each has contributed to the world. As one who devours biographies, I would have been happy if this was Cain’s primary goal in producing her book. Yet, soon after listing famous introverts, Cain proceeds to delve into the history of psychological personality studies and how behavioral theorists tested children to see who is an introvert and who is an extrovert. Starting with Jungian theory all the way to present day, Cain showed how both nature and nurture play a role in comprising people’s tendencies. In her research, Cain has discovered that one in three people are introverted by nature, more of us than one originally thinks. While I would have rather the book focus on famous introverts than scientific studies, I did appreciate Cain’s personal anecdotes. A corporate lawyer who feared public speaking, Cain tells readers how she used various coping mechanisms to get her through her work. Some worked, some did not, and eventually she changed careers. What she devised while in her research for this book is that both introverts and extroverts use free trait associations to help them in uncomfortable situations, in layman’s terms, they act opposite of what their nature normally would. It was in this chapter that I thought that maybe I am an extrovert after all because I do love to talk; however, just in small groups. In school I often volunteered answers, but I did poorly in large group settings. My volunteering answers was what Cain refers to as my free trait association for me to act extroverted enough to get through my academic day. The fact that behavioral scientists have devoted studies to this gives me hope that future generations of introverted students will not have things as bad as I did. As a parent, the chapters I found most interesting were the ones referring to raising an introverted child. Americans by nature are the most extroverted nation in the world. A nation of immigrants, go getters not afraid to move across the globe and start anew. By default, schools are designed with extroverted students in mind, even though, as Cain points out, that one in three people are introverted. Teachers today have been told to mix activities with both extroverts and introverts in mind, with some activities catering to both groups of people. Cain does encourage parents that if they can, to visit schools ahead of time. This is not feasible for all, but I did feel encouragement that teachers at the key grades of fourth and eighth, usually found in studies, are developing some group, some partner, and some individual activities so that introverted students do not feel lost in a sea of people throughout the day. If only school for me had been that easy. Cain also contrasts the Asian and Caucasian cultures, pointing out that learning is valued in Asian communities, citing a model community of Cupertino, California. With a public school system primarily Asian, these students excel, only to experience culture shock when they leave for college and then enter working society. Some Cupertino parents have even chosen to commute to China for weeks at a time because the American business world is too fast paced and people oriented for them. Cain also interviewed college students to see how they adapted, some remaining as total introverts, whereas others used free trait associations to excel socially at their colleges. She points out that the Asians have a strong tendency to be introverted and Americans have dubbed them the “model minority.” While Asian students do well academically, the working world continues to be a struggle for them, unless they learn how to adapt to American culture. Like any people, some Asians act like extroverts whereas some are happy as introverts, reflecting society as a whole. Within our nonfiction book club, we had a variety of opinions about Quiet. Some members enjoyed the scientific studies more whereas others preferred the history and parenting sections the most. As one who wanted to find out if I am a true introvert or just someone along the spectrum, I found the entire book intriguing. There was some repetition toward the end, perhaps because Cain ran out of things to say. She is an introvert after all, and maybe she grew tired of presenting introverts to the world. Like many of us introverted bookworms at the nonfiction book club, perhaps Susan Cain decided toward the end of this book to end her free trait associations and act like the true introvert that she is. 3.5 stars rounded up "
28,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20955173-sean-gibson,4,"The only thing less surprising than the fact that a book that extols the virtues of nerds who read books has generally favorable reviews on a site populated with nerds who read books (myself included) is that broccoli tastes as bad as it smells.While it’s certainly possible to cherry pick data and case studies in a way to support virtually any contention (give me an internet connection and a couple of hours and I could put together a pretty solid case, backed up by compelling proof, that the Illuminati embedded subliminal messages in the Gummi Bears theme song in order to make left-handed men over the age of 60 spank themselves anytime someone called them Sally), Cain makes a cogent argument that the Western world’s prioritization of what we generally perceive as extroverted tendencies has not only disadvantaged a large segment of the population (perhaps as much as half), but that we can, with some relatively easy adjustments, not only make life easier for those people, but enable them to contribute to society in an even more meaningful and powerful way. I don’t live squarely on the introverted side of the spectrum, but I’m certainly much closer to that end than the other, and many of Cain’s points—particularly about the stress and strain of operating in a workplace that doesn’t often allow sufficient time for deep thinking or solo reflection—hit home. I felt her points even more acutely, however, as the parent of a burgeoning introvert, and Cain offers up a number of helpful suggestions for helping young children adjust, adapt, and thrive in environments such as school and team sports that seem tailor-made for extroverts. I wish all CEOs and business leaders, people who design office layouts, educators, coaches, parents, and broccoli sniffers would read this book. Even if Cain occasionally goes a little too far in extolling the virtues of introversion, her logic is sound, and she persuasively makes the case for rethinking how we go about work, education, creative activity, socializing, and life in general. (Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go stuff some padding into my underwear so that when someone calls me Sally in 20 years and 9 days, I don’t bruise my tender, bubble-shaped junk compartment.)"
29,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1198255-madeleine,3,"Like the friend whose brutal honesty is never immediately welcome but reveals its necessary truths the more you bitterly and obsessively try to prove her wrong (in your head, of course, always in your head because no one else understands, damnit), this book made me confront things about myself that I always kind of knew but glossed over with conciliatory explanations. I am, according to the battery of Myers-Briggs tests that Dr. Internet has administered to me (and that offer the same result no matter how cleverly I think I've outsmarted the aforementioned countless variations of personality assessments), of the INFP persuasion, just like Virginia Woolf and Sylvia Plath were presumed to be, along with many other notable people who haven't killed themselves (like Tim Burton, Billy Shakes and Albert Camus). All sources stress that it's one of the rarer personality types, which at least begins to explain why I feel so interminably weird compared to other people all the time. But I think my introversion also comes with a tinge of self-loathing, for as much as I dislike the idea of being around crowds of people to the extent that I always took those commercials advertising a pill to treat social anxiety as a personal attack on my personality, my stuttering, socially awkward self who identifies with the fictional characters and real ideas populating book after book better than the world beyond my front door is also maddeningly, desperately eager to be the center of attention. Not that I always know what to do with that attention once I get it, as it's fun for about five minutes before the urge to dive for solitary cover re-assumes control. And I think I tend to resent well-adjusted introverts a little for their totally-alien-to-me experience of being comfortable in their own skins.Which brings us to my biggest problem with this book: The author was entirely too present in this study on introverts. I know, I know: My reviews have gotten to be so totally about me that I feel like a hypocritical dick lobbing such a complaint at this presumably well-meaning book. When I read This is Your Brain on Music, I got so pissed off at the reviewers who complained similarly about how Levitin frequently drew on his own experiences because, c'mon, personal experience counts for something while lending a sense of credibility to the research conducted and the conclusions made: The difference, I think, is that Levitin used himself to bring a high-minded concept down to understandable terms for those of us lacking scientific minds whereas Cain sometimes seemed like she just wanted to talk about herself. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but that would have made a better blog than a book. By falling back on her own brand of introversion, it felt like she was both negating the argument that the personality type expresses itself in an inexhaustibly many ways and also even alienating other expressions of introversion to a degree.Actually, I wasn't always crazy about the kind of people Cain used as examples of introverts who were able to overcome their crippling shyness or need to be alone (because shyness isn't always an introvert-specific trait, as this book did teach me) to function -- nay, thrive -- in the vast, sometimes overwhelming world beyond their rich inner landscapes. I mean, for a book subtitled ""The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,"" it would make sense to use Harvard Business School students, Ivy League professors, academic whiz kids on the cusp of high school and everything after, neuroscientists and Wall Street investors (to name a few) to illustrate the victories that can arise from harnessing one's naturally unassuming, slow-to-action instincts and applying them to real-world scenarios. And that was reassuring and motivating and helpful, sure, but what would have been a little more helpful is seeing how an everyday introvert with a quiet job and a simple existence confronts life's obstacles when confrontation does not come easy. (And, yes, there is a whole section on the ordinary workplace and how open floor plans and the elimination of boundaries and this emphasis on group work and collective brainstorming that are all so in vogue really aren't all that conducive to brilliance and happiness and cohesion and all that. But that was more of an academically detached observation than a personal reality.)I really didn't hate this book. Really. I didn't love it but it did force some personal insight on me that I've probably been needing to hear. Like how facing down one's own unique hell, like public speaking (which, hi, have I mentioned that I stutter?), isn't, like, fatal and is worth overcoming. And that just because the Western ideal favors extroverted characteristics doesn't mean it's better -- and that, in fact, a lot of how I approach the world (I'd rather not talk unless I have something worthwhile to say; I don't want to assert myself at the risk of disrespecting the greater whole) is mirrored in the traditionally Eastern approach. That the person speaking the most or first or loudest is rarely offering the best ideas, as a facade of overconfidence often hides an array of interior doubts. That knowing to pick one's battles and proceeding with a quiet assurance is a strength in its own right. The penultimate chapter was nothing but an exploration of how extro- and introverts complement each other and how the two seemingly at-odds personality types can look inward to identify their outwardly differing approaches to the world. As most people are not like me, it did offer some perspective shifts that I found to be genuinely helpful wisdom in terms of how my perception of myself and others doesn't always align with what they either see or know to be true. For one glorious moment, it even seemed like Cain was talking directly to me in addressing the way that the real-life introverted wife of an extroverted man tended to emotionally distance herself from an argument, as she thought she was keeping herself in check while he thought she was shutting him out, which is a difference in interpretation that never even crossed my conflicted mind. I had perused the table of contents before reading even a word of this book and actually groaned when I saw that the final chapter explores ""how to cultivate quiet kids in a world that can't hear them,"" which I figured would read like a laundry list of all the ways my parents failed me. And, I mean, it did, of course, but after recovering from bursting into tears almost immediately at the beginning of the chapter (because, man, was it ever hitting too close to home), I realized that it was only ostensibly advice for nurturing introverted children so they can happily grow into their places in an ill-fitting world: It was really, truly a comforting pat on the back that reached into the past to assure my inner child (the part of it that isn't a perverted little teenage boy, anyway) that she was never as alone and misunderstood as she felt. And if this book had more of those moments, I might have actually wound up loving it. "
30,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3621230-angie,5,"A must read for everyone, not just introverts. Susan Cain, former Wall Street lawyer and self-described introvert, investigates how introversion has become dangerously scorned in the current American ""Culture of Personality."" I had not fully realized how drastically our cultural values have shifted--and how much American society pushes us to conform--until reading Cain's book. To prove her point, Cain visits American bastions of extroversion promotion, including Harvard Business School, Saddleback Church, Dale Carnegie, Wall Street, and Tony Robbins conferences. She talks with pioneering psychologists and neurologists to explain the studies behind concepts like the dangers of group think, the ability to delay gratification, or the trait called sensitivity. She profiles famous and less-well known introverts to show how the studies play out in real life.Though the many of the activities I'm drawn to (and the things that cause anxiety) scream classic introvert, I have always considered myself an extrovert and frequently put myself in situations where extroverted behavior is valued. However, since quitting my job and globe-hopping for the past two years, I've been surprised (and disappointed) by how often the constant stimulation, new people, and change can drain me--and by how I often feel an overwhelming need for alone time.I found myself relating to many of the points Cain discusses and have since concluded that I'm much more of an introvert than I had thought. (I promise that this isn't just because she does a good job of highlighting all the positive things about introverts!)So for that, I am grateful to have read Quiet, though I can't quite believe it took reading a book to figure that out about myself! I am seeing my preferences in a new light and have much understanding and acceptance regarding the things that interest me (and those that cause me stress). I've been having trouble narrowing down 'what I want to do with my life' and this book has helped me more than any other, because I finally feel like I can accept that the things I really enjoy are just a part of me and can't be ignored. Though the personal application will differ, I suspect many people will come away having learned much more than they expected, if not about themselves, then about people close to them. I had always thought of extroverts and introverts as being on distinct sides of a line, when in fact it's much more of a sliding scale (or perhaps better as two scales: percentage introversion, percentage extroversion). Because we have been culturally pressured and trained to admire extroverted behavior, many of us may be dangerously ignoring our introverted characteristics. This was a game-changing book for me, and I suspect it will be eye-opening to most people who read it."
31,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,5,"I love reading on Friday nights, writing on Saturday afternoons, and having quiet get-togethers on Sunday. But I also enjoy giving presentations at school, tutoring peers in writing, and interacting with various people online and in real life. I'd describe myself as an introvert (and my Meyers-Briggs personality type agrees), though both introverts and extroverts would enjoy this fascinating book by Susan Cain. She provides an intriguing, in-depth perspective on introversion, its connotation in contrasting cultures, and the psychology behind it.A profusion of the nonfiction I've read has contained too much of something - too many random anecdotes, too much scientific jargon, too many unnecessary statistics or explanations. But Quiet has the perfect blend of personal anecdotes, interesting analysis, detailed explanations, and compelling statistics. Cain references various studies conducted by psychologists and discusses several aspects related to introversion, such as the extrovert ideal, how extroverts and introverts can compliment each other and work together, nature v. nature, etc. Here's one passage about sensitive people (who tend to be more introverted) that struck a chord with me:""The other thing Aron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they're highly empathic. It's as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people's emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world. They tend to have unusually strong consciences. They avoid violent movies and TV shows; they're acutely aware of the consequences of a lapse in their own behavior. In social settings they often focus on subjects like personal problems, which others consider 'too heavy'.""I guess I have an excuse for exposing so much of myself on my blog, huh? Anyway, Cain delves into other subjects that are intellectually stimulating too, such as the three things she thinks are important in identifying one's personal project. She even brings up the relationship between Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other famous historical figures.Overall, highly recommended to everyone curious about their own temperaments and how to embrace their natural personalities. One of the best works of nonfiction I've read.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

Also, it was interesting to hear what you can do to help someone with stage fright preform at their best.However, I felt the book repeated itself. Many times I wondered what new information could possibly be discussed, and a lot of times there wasn't really any new information. It just talked about the same material in a circle from a different angle.A lot of the time I felt like this book was written so introverts could feel validated for being an introvert and that they weren't anti-social. They just need socialization in a completely different way than extroverts."

It's perhaps not a surprise that Susan Cain, the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking identifies herself as an introvert. Being quiet, introverted or shy is still seen by many as a problem or handicap to overcome so I can see her motivation for writing it.One this book's premises is that in the last 50 years or so, the Western world moved from a culture of character to a culture of personality, which according to the author has given an advantage to people that enjoyed outgoing, uninhibited personalities. We tend to admire and reward people that exhibit the most gregarious, outgoing traits of extroverts while at the same time undermined and misunderstand those that are most typically seen in more introverted individuals.
Introversion is really about having a preference for lower stimulation environments. So it's just a preference for quiet, for less noise, for less action. Whereas extroverts really crave more stimulation in order to feel at their best.
The author explains that Introversion is a spectrum, and that most of us don't fully fit into an introvert/extrovert definition. It also provides a sort of ""survival guide"" for introverts to help us learn how to better deal with the pressures of living in a world that for the most part rewards those that are extroverts.
Many people believe that introversion is about being antisocial, and that's really a misperception. Because actually it's just that introverts are differently social. So they would prefer to have a glass of wine with a close friend as opposed to going to a loud party full of strangers.
This book helped me understand myself better, identify those traits that makes many of us ""introverts"" different and learn how to use them to our advantage, both on our professional and personal lives. The book is entertaining and well written. If you are interested in learning about introverts, perhaps because you feel like one or someone closed to you does, this book might be of interest to you.After reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking my conclusion is that the world needs both extroverts and introverts and that we all have a role to play.Here's a link to the author's TED TALK which is sort a summarized version of the book:http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_t..."

And the whole idea about needing time out to recover from socialising - I always thought I was just a bit odd, haha.The criticisms that are quite rightly levelled at this book about preaching some kind of binarism between extrovert and introvert are understandable, and am I'm sure that we are all a little too complex for a poorly designed set of questions to provide any sort of sensible analysis or categorisation (would still like to see the questions though...) Most people will be surely be somewhere close to 'ambivert' even if they know themselves to be introverted at heart. For me a major part of young socialisation and growing up was learning to act like an extrovert, if nothing else just to stop people trying to 'bring me out of my shell' or constantly asking what's up as I am 'being quiet'."

For years people have been telling me to come out of my shell and to be more outgoing and I realized I had definitely playing the role of pseudo-extrovert all this time! I enjoyed reading the fact that we introverts actually have power and hidden strengths. The list of famous introverts surprised me, Rosa Parks, Al Gore and Gandhi in particular. The book also shared some insight into the thinking patterns of extroverts. All in all, it was an interesting book though the end did drag on a bit."

37,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5470914-sam,1,"This was the most painful book I have read this summer. I choked it down like bad medicine page after page. Quiet is great self affirmation for someone who considers themselves an introvert, and sees humans as either an extrovert or introvert. Cain certainly thinks she’s the poster child of an introvert, or is she? The book reads like a memoir in parts where she tells stories of her own life, then there are smatterings or small examples in specific parts of people’s lives of how greatness comes in quiet e.g. Steve Wozniak, Gandhi, Rosa Parks. Cain also fancies herself a bit of a child psychologist, on one hand it’s ok for kids to be shy or in their shell, these aren’t bad things, and very normal, but on the other hand we need to nudge and push slowly to get kids out of their quiet place. So which is it?It doesn’t bother me that Cain isn’t a psychologist or economist, but she’s talking through both sides of her mouth, the book is a pity party, she thinks the decisions in modern workplaces are influenced by highly extroverted personalities like those from the Harvard Business School. There’s no backing for this other than the fact that business students are extroverts. Additionally the economic crisis was wholly the fault of extroverts, basically extroverts with their loud voices overpowered the brilliant quiet hardworking, and smart introverts and ran the economy to the ground. I’m afraid you really aren’t brilliant if something has already happened and you didn’t do anything to stop it. In hindsight everything is 20/20, just because you are quiet and something bad is happening saying “I knew it!” doesn’t do much. The circlejerk continues when Cain bangs on about everyone who a douche as being an extrovert. Good guys are introverts, Warren Buffet because of his one speech about the dot com bubble bursting was quiet and well calculated in his words. The rest of the word are greedy businessmen. There’s some sample or thin slicing in her discussions that I find problematic, and read a bit like a tabloid. Susan Cain is clearly appealing to an audience that is already sold to introversion, and stroking those egos. I wish the book had more solutions instead of harping about how bad people are. The book blurs it’s lines through many genres, self help, psychology and a dash of group-think. I consider myself an introvert, but also an extrovert, yes I do believe brilliance happens in unaccompanied activities like running. I charge my batteries during times like this but I also don’t “suffer in silence”. I don’t believe people are fully introverted or extroverted. Reading Khaneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and Mcgonigal’s Willpower Instinct make Cain’s book look hurriedly and thoughtlessly written, there’s little appeal to science. "
38,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,3,"I expected to love, love, love this book. After all, psychology is one of my passions. Also, I am always interested in hearing from some group. And this is saying, ""We, the introverts, are speaking out.""However, the book was neither as powerful nor as interesting as I was hoping....Cain does a great job of blending together different aspects. The three main angles she uses are:1.) Famous people who were introverts. She usually starts her chapters with a story about a wonderful famous person we all know and adore - and then explaining how they were introverted. Rosa Parks, Dale Carnegie, and Eleanor Roosevelt are some of the examples she used.2.) Case studies. This is the real life introvert ""Jane Doe."" She was on this job and thought she would have to quit because she just wasn't outgoing enough. Then she learned that being an introvert was like having a secret superpower! And then she used her introversion to overcome all obstacles! Now she's rich and/or happy. Success!3.) Science - hard and soft. Cain uses both psychology and biology to try and explain the differences between extroverts and introverts. She also explains why introversion might be valuable in evolution and natural selection. She has a fascinating chapter on culture, which emphasizes that although extroversion is worshiped in the USA, many Asian countries value silence, reflection, and understanding over cheerfulness, enthusiasm, and talkativeness. ...This book is at it's best when Cain is exploring how introversion is a valuable and worthy trait or way of being. When she journeys into different places to see how introversion is treated differently there. When she explores how introversion can be a survival aid in the wild and how introverted people can be powerful in their own way.It's exciting and interesting to realize that extroversion - while venerated in America - is actually seen as crass and dumb in many Asian cultures.And it's fun and cool to see different theories of how introverted people and animals are strong in Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection. I liked seeing different species and the benefits and drawbacks they experience from being extroverted or introverted. And I enjoyed seeing how introversion could be a kick-butt evolutionary trait which is often overlooked or thought to be something that needed 'killing off.'I thought about 2/3 of the book were weak, though. For instance, I already know enough about famous figures and do not particularly want or need to read a short biography or story about them. Another thing that bugged me were her ""real life introversion stories."" Here is how an introvert struggled. Here is how he learned to embrace his true self and be happy/rich.The whole book just felt like a big pat on the back. ""Don't worry, introverts, you're okay! Everything's okay! It might seem like the world hates you, but use your strengths! You are really amazing.""And it's not even like I DISAGREE with this message, it's simply that I was expecting more than a rather thinly-veiled self-help book. P.S. I really like the page or two that Cain dedicates to exploring Moses (an alleged introvert) and Aaron (his extroverted mouthpiece). It is also interesting when she lightly touches on whether or not the Church and modern-day Protestants shun and punish introverts as not doing the Lord's work. I like when she questions whether Jesus was an introvert or extrovert (covered in one paragraph, very shallow) and questions whether the Church is pushing an incorrect message on it's followers. (""Real Christians proselytize! How can you be a REAL Christian if you are not gregarious?"") I also like when she uses the teachings and life of Gandhi to emphasize that passivity is NOT submissiveness. All these subjects were things I wished she'd explored in greater depth."

All these adjectives and more describe my experience with this amazing book.I'm very much an introvert. I try to avoid social functions as much as possible, but I do love meeting every so often with my dear friends one-on-one. If I do end up at a party, you can bet I'm the one keeping the corner warm. I am an avid reader, a knitter, a sometimes writer, a nerd, and an engineer. My idea of a perfect evening is one spent in the comfort of my apartment, cat in lap, book in hand, coffee at my side. My idea of a perfect vacation is one where I can go to my favorite coffee shop and read. In college, my favorite classes were Differential Equations (in which I, the only female, got a perfect score on the final), Physics, and Fluids. Ever since elementary school, I dreaded a school performances, such as Christmas programs or poetry recitals. At work meetings, I am more likely to listen to everything and be note-taker than I am to present or volunteer ideas.Lately, my boss has said that I need to step things up, become more ""out there"" and confident. Inwardly, I despaired. Wasn't I working hard enough? What was holding me back? Why couldn't I just blurt things out in meetings? Why did I constantly sound nervous, even if I really wasn't? Was there any hope for me to change?And then, like a sign from heaven, I saw this book in the ""New Books"" display at Barnes and Nobles (BTW, I happen to swing by the bookstore at least once a week during lunch - sometimes to purchase, but mostly to pass the time). I remembered a friend had read this and really enjoyed it, and I figured it would help me figure out myself.""Figure myself out"" would be an understatement; it's as if this book were written specifically for me! Cain breaks down what it means to be an introvert. Turns out despite what my sister is constantly telling me, I'm not weird (alright, not too weird). I have talents and skills. I have a place. And it's not my fault I can't always speak up and make my voice heard. A lot of it is because of how our workforce, our employers, our coworkers, our society functions. Our biology, our parents, our surroundings make us the introverted beings we are. It's just that school and work and the outside world try to tell us that being quiet, that listening and ruminating over things is wrong, that we should be quick to speak and blurt whatever is on our mind.I've known I was an introvert for a while, but it was so refreshing and liberating to learn that there were others with my ""problem"". That I wasn't alone. And, most importantly, I can overcome, nay thrive, in this Extroverted world. And that is the second gift Cain gives us in this book: how to be an Introvert in an Extrovert world and not want to choke yourself at night.I feel like, after reading Quiet, I have a plan for facing my ""work problems"". I feel like I can take the challenge my boss has placed in front of me and succeed. Although a part of me still wishes I could crawl back to my desk and burrow there, I think this book has given me the tools and encouragement I need to speak up.If you are an introvert, you definitely need to read this book. Even if you aren't an introvert, this is a great book to understanding how they think and act. I'm definitely passing this along to everyone I know."
40,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Years ago, my division manager at work had everybody in the division take the Meyer Briggs personality test. Then we spent time in a workshop, to understand the implications of our personality types. One of the dimensions of the test is extroversion/introversion (E or I types). This book offers a very satisfying account of what it means to be an introvert. Generally Western cultures admire extroverts, while Asian cultures admire introverts. Both types of personalities offer value to society. Groups of people who are introverts are best with an extroverted leader, while groups of extroverts are best with an introverted leader.Many introverts find it difficult to live in a society that values extroversion more highly. As a result, many introverts pretend to be extroverts in certain social situations. But they cannot maintain this pretension indefinitely, and at some point in time they must ""recharge"" their internal batteries with quiet and solitude. The book makes a major point here: It's perfectly OK to pretend to be an extrovert for periods of time--as long as you do this while you are working at something that you truly love.The book has useful practical advice for introverts. If you are an introvert and your husband or wife is an extrovert, there is much to be said about how to maintain or improve your relationship. If you are raising a child who is an introvert, it is important to understand how to encourage the child to follow his/her innate abilities.Back in the 1940's and 1950's, Alex Osborn was plagued by the lack of creativity in his advertising agency. So, he wrote some books introducing the concept of ""brainstorming"". The idea is for people get together in groups and toss out ideas without fear of ridicule--the more ideas, the better. The problem is, in the 1960's, studies showed that brainstorming is not efficient; you can get more, good ideas if people simply think creatively in solitude. Committees simply are not as productive as the sum of individuals working alone. We are so inculcated with the idea that brainstorming is best--but this is really just a reflection of the dominance of extroversion in our society. "

I was hoping for a bit more knowledge or ‘self help’ regarding being an introvert in an average every day life, Not as an award winning introverted lecturer, or an introverted Lawyer or CEO."
42,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"It is stated at the start that this book’s purpose is to improve a reader's relationship with others. The book can thus be viewed as a book of the self-help genre. Its aim is to advise introverts on ways by which they can improve their relationships with extroverts, and vice versa. It compares behavioral traits of both introverts and extroverts, showing in what ways they are similar and how they differ. The author mentions books about and summarizes studies related to extroversion and introversion, conducted over the years and up to today. The book begins with a quick test by which readers can determine where they stand on the introvert / extrovert scale. The test takes only a few minutes and gives the reader an immediate connection with the topics to be discussed. Both my husband and I took the test. We both received the same score, indicating that we are both strong introverts. It is interesting to note that although we had the same score, we did not answer all questions in the same way. This led to a lively discussion and a fun start to the book! Twenty questions are to be answered with a yes or a no. The book demonstrates clearly that in America it is the extroverts that hold sway--in the government, in business and in most educational institutions. It is an important and valuable statement that is being made. This is often to the detriment of introverts and to society as a whole. While the author professes the importance and value of both the introvert and the extrovert way of thinking, given the suppression of introverts in society today, it is introverts she lauds most, giving example after example of their accomplishments. I didn’t need to be convinced. For me, it is OBVIOUS that society benefits from the presence of both. The book verges on becoming a manifesto for introverts. This appeals to me no more than society's pronounced favoritism of extroverts! The book accomplishes well what it has set out to do, but I am rarely enthused by books of the self-help genre. It does advise readers on how their relationships can be improved. It also explains how schools can be adapted to better suit the needs of introverts, without hampering the situation for extroverts. I do however find much of the advice given as being rather obvious. The sections I like most are those that are scientifically oriented. I like for example the parts about how the brain functions; sections about the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex and the connection to dopamine are interesting. Many studies are referred to, but how exactly each was performed is skimmed over in too brief a manner. We are told what the results have for implications, but skeptic that I am, I was not always convinced! I need more details. To add depth, opposing points of view should have been added. Intuitively, I agree with the conclusions drawn, but I would have preferred more solid proof. Too many generalizations/simplifications are made. Over and over again we are told that so and so was an introvert and so and so an extrovert. This is all too simple! Individuals are mixes of introvert and extrovert qualities. Instead, an analysis of the tangled mix of traits that make up real people is what I was looking for. At one point Moses is classified as an introvert! This was just too much for me. The author swiftly classifies famous people as being either introvert or extrovert with little analysis of their specific character traits. I find this too categorical. We are told that Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, would never have written the books she wrote and become the ""bold thinker"" that she became had she not been left alone to read books in her youth. Where is the proof in that?! The author generalizes and simplifies all too often. The book is directed primarily toward Americans. I do not appreciate this slant. There is only a brief discussion of Asian American immigrants. Asian Americans of Chinese background are classified as introverts. Europeans are in a bunch grouped with Americans. I would have preferred a more in-depth, nuanced analysis of national and cultural differences.I wish the book had been more globally and more scientifically oriented. It has too many generalizations. It is basically a self-help book, a genre that does not appeal to me, so I guess it is not so bad that I nevertheless felt it to be worth reading. I would have preferred more in-depth analyses concerning how individuals are complicated mixes of introversion and extroversion. We are not one or the other, as was so often stated in reference to the people mentioned. The narration of the audiobook by Kathe Mazur started out very fast, but eventually she slows down. Her rapid speed had me chuckling at the beginning. Why? Because it is the extroverts, not us introverts that talk fast! Didn’t the producers of the audiobook realize the incongruity?! We introverts need time to stop and think and time to examine the ideas floating around in our heads. The narration is easy to follow once Mazur has slowed down. She has a soft, pleasant voice, a perfect match for introverts, the central protagonists of the book. The question is how many extroverts read this book. It is interesting to think about why this may be so."
43,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,5,"This book is very insightful and informative. I watched Susan Cain's TED talk once and I was fascinated being an introvert myself. As a kid I was shy, serious, studious with a little bit of social anxiety and although as I grew up, I outgrew my shyness and got more confident socially, there have been many situations where I questioned myself. Once when I was out on a trip with a big group of college friends, everyone was getting along so well and they seemed to be having so much fun together but I felt so lonely and left out and I was like, ''What's wrong with me''? Turns out I'm just an introvert. Then, I found this book. It describes in detail what introversion and extroversion is and what are the traits associated with both personalities. Where in most areas (or cultures), the introversion or shyness is viewed in a negative light, the writer states that it's an essential trait and how powerful it could be and it should be valued just as extroversion is. I found this book very interesting to read because she presents her ideas by using data gathered from case studies, research and her own personal experiences and from other people. She has also provided analysis of many famous personalities and how their temperaments shaped their actions and how essential their role was. Many definitions are provided for introversion-extroversion and how our genes and our environment play a role in shaping our personalities. There is no personality type better than the other but creating a balance is very important to bring out the best in both. The message in short is- value your individuality and do things the way you want and not because you have to conform to certain cultural norms. It also tells how both personalities can strike a balance between both traits. Also, both extroverts and introverts can lead a fulfilling life without changing their core values or trying to be someone they are not, the power lies in knowing who you are, what your abilities are and using them to the best.After reading this book, I feel like I can understand myself a little better now, what my motivations are and what makes me the way I am. I recommend this book to both introverts and extroverts as it can help them understand the qualities in themselves and in each other."

45,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1230817-lori,5,"I'm really excited about all the works about introverts that's been coming out lately, I think mainly because of this book. I'm not sure if extroverts would have enjoyed this book as much as me, because Cain works hard to prove the merits and necessity of introverts in our society, while down-playing all the reasons why we should have an extrovert ideal. In fact, I think some extroverts would feel a bit offended at this book. But I don't care. I've lived my whole life feeling like there was something wrong with me. I need to speak up, get out there, sell myself, basically become something that I'm not. This book made me realize there's nothing wrong with me, and that I actually have strengths that my extroverted friends, relatives, etc., do not. Instead of constantly seeing myself as disadvantaged because I suck at small talk, don't know how to talk myself up in interviews, and am just a shy person, I just feel like I know myself better. I think teachers should read this book. And I'm going to stop, because this isn't so much as a book review as a blog post or something. This is a total self-help book for introverts. Thank you Cain!**I should also say that Cain uses extensive research and interviews to show the strengths of introverts, so it's actually a pretty scientific book (though made so that it's easy for the every day person like me to understand). I was really surprised at the amount of research done on the differences between introverts and extroverts, especially because the research often shows introverts in a good, positive light, unlike what most people think when they hear the word introvert.

First of all, as far as the audio format goes, they couldn’t have chosen a better narrator. Kathe Mazur’s voice fits the tone of the book perfectly–quiet and measured, yet firm. I basically just want to listen to every audiobook she’s ever narrated. Back to Quiet –I think Susan Cain did a stellar job of exploring the introverted personality type. She sites a number of studies and scientific theories to support her thesis that introversion is an undervalued trait in modern American society. Introverts have just as much to offer the world as extroverts and their unique strengths must be utilized for a society to be truly healthy.

47,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"When I was young, my grandfather, an intelligent farmer, used to call me an introvert, as I sat happily in the corner, spending my free time reading books or writing in my notebooks. I looked up at him, I believe I was around the age of eight or so, with crinkled eyebrows. He explained what it meant. But I didn't have a puzzled look on my face because I didn't understand the word, I was puzzled because he said it like he disapproved. Like it was a bad thing. My aunt, the doctor, immediately came to my defense and said, ""Janine, just tell him that you're not an introvert, you're just introspective."" That became my motto in life. I said it often, mostly because I felt those were big words and others would think I was smart. I never thought about it much later in life until I read this book. Cain talks about the virtues of being an introvert but how society has come to prize the personality traits of the extrovert. Being a pretty extreme extrovert, at first, I didn't think this book was for me. But then I thought back to when I was eight, and realized with shock and I wasn't just a person who could be both, although I was, I am, but I went from one extreme to the other. When I was a child, I was the most introverted person I know. Using the word shy to describe me didn't cut it. I would skip class altogether if I was even a minute late, to avoid the fear of having to walk into the classroom with everyone looking at me. Speeches had me thinking thoughts of jumping out of trees just to break a bone so I could get out of giving the speech. Now, I love nothing better than walking into a room full of strange people. It's just a room full of fifty new friends! And talking in front of people? I have to hold myself back in group exercises just so I don't hog the limelight. How did such a huge change occur? I'll tell you how, because of work, school, and problems socially, I was forced into it. As I began to read this book, I saw a lot of truth in what Cain was saying. Extroverts really are prized now, not just socially but in the workplace as well. At the last company I worked for, I sat in cubicles, was encouraged constantly to hold meetings and ""group think"" up ideas. How different it would have been if I was allowed even one hour a day without interruptions! What has made us so concerned with having these qualities? I am homeschooling my children and every time I come across someone who disapproves it's always because of lack of ""socialization"". My five-year-old son has no trouble talking to anyone and being friendly, I think he gets it from me. But he also loves to play by himself. He might get this from me as well! He creates his best Lego creations when left alone for hours at a time. Why is this a bad thing? As Cain points out, some of the best innovators of our time were quiet thinkers. And we might not have had some of those great inventions or works of art had these people been forced to ""socialize"" as children instead of left alone. And really, what is the big deal with needing socialization being such a big part of schooling? Why can't it be found outside of school? I recently watched a documentary about the current school systems and, as most people know, we (The United States), rank very low in all areas of education. In fact, when American children were tested in various areas against other countries of the world, we consistently ranked on the bottom in almost all areas except one. Can you guess what it is? Self-confidence. American children are said to have the highest self-confidence compared to all other countries. How do we explain this to our children? We're idiots but we have pride! Is this because we're placing such importance on making our children extroverts? Some of the case studies Cain uses to show examples of her theories kept me riveted. She also had a twenty question test in case you weren't sure where you stood. The more traits she gave as examples of introverts and extroverts, the less sure I became of which I was. Ask anyone which I was as a child, they would have said introvert, hands down. Ask anyone I know right now, and in a second they'd say extrovert. So I took her test to see where I stood. I thought I was only doubting myself, and that it would show pretty conclusively that I was an extrovert. But in fact, I was split almost exactly down the middle. I love meeting new people, and often feel energized at the end of a big party. But I also get rejuvinated from having alone time every day. Even back in college, when I was one of the most social people around, my roomates all knew that they risked certain death if they bothered me during my ""break time"". I have no problems going to movies alone, and one of my favorite things to do is go out to lunch or dinner at a nice restaurant with a good book as a dinner companion. People look at me weird, but I could care less. Whenever I go out or have a party my motto is always ""The more the merrier"". So where did I stand on this chart? The advice for public speaking for introverts wasn't going to help me. And to say I should have quit reading the book halfway through because I considered myself an extrovert would have had me missing out on some very interesting information. I really enjoyed this book. And I disagree that this book is only for introverts. I think the biggest benefit this book had for me is the eye opener to how we have been pressured to become more extroverted over the years and how we see this change everywhere, from schools, to the workplace, to advertising, to even moralistic behavior. I think all can benefit from having a greater awareness of this personality trait in everyone they know. If you're an extrovert, wouldn't it benefit you from having a better understanding to where your introverted team leader is coming from? And another realization for me, is how I know see my son, who has the tendency to play alone. I now am more aware of how I treat him, and make sure I no longer fall into that stereotypical reaction of ""Why don't you try harder to make friends?"" routine. There's nothing wrong with being an introvert, and if this book has any major theme, that's it. That being said, even though I very much enjoyed this book, I only gave it three stars for a couple of reasons. First of all, I feel like the middle of the road people such as myself were somewhat ignored. Where do we stand? How do we relate better to people and situations? Then there were the case studies. As I mentioned earlier, they were very interesting and really helped in relating to the particular example's Cain discussed. But after a while, they became tedious, and didn't hold my attention as well as the first half of the book. I still think many can benefit from reading this though. It was fun, and I look forward to discussing it with my book club.  ClassicsDefined.com"
48,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"I never really thought of myself as introverted until relatively recently, within the last year or so, when I declined an invitation to go out with a group of friends to the bar and one of them said ""Fine, be introverted then! Hope you enjoy sitting home alone with your cats!"" (She meant it in a teasing, only partially bitchy way, but I didn't take offense. I DO enjoy sitting home alone with my cats.)My semi-bitchy friend actually helped me define a big part of myself. Until then, I just thought of myself as ""the most anti-social Libra ever"", and poked fun at myself for not wanting to go out all the time, or being overwhelmed by loud, boisterous people, or needing time to just be alone - what my boyfriend calls ""cave-dwelling"". I made these things a joke because, according to society, it's not normal to want to spend so much time alone. I'm supposed to be a fun, out-going social butterfly. The thought exhausts me. So, when I read this, it was like someone opened up my head and singled out these aspects of my personality and then wrote them down. It was fascinating to read this book and learn about myself. I see things about my past in a completely new light. Like the situation above. I'd be more than happy to sit at home with a few friends and drink, but going to a bar to drink among a huge crowd just held no appeal. Or like how I approach my work. The sections of this book pertaining to corporate expectations and office structure were fascinating to me, and really allowed me to look at my job and approach to work differently. I'm a good employee and good at my job, but I don't aspire to be in the limelight. I don't MIND recognition or attention for a job well done, but it's not something I seek out. So, when I was recently offered a job with a new company, I had my choice of being in a ""client liaison"" position or a ""analysis and testing"" position, and I took the latter, even though it's a position with less recognition and lower pay. The thought of having to constantly be professionally social with strangers gives me anxiety, though, so it was a no-brainer for me. But when I discussed my decision with friends, they called me crazy to have turned down the higher paying position. As though money is the only criteria worth considering. (A point that this book makes well.)I'm going to miss the job I'm leaving though, because it did give me a kind of structured socialization. I get along great with my team, and there, I'm far more socially outgoing than I would be otherwise. I've worked with many of these people for several years, I trust and respect them, and they are people I consider real friends. Soon I'll be working 100% from home, so my social interaction will be drastically reduced. I may be introverted, but I do need that interaction. The hard part for me will be actually initiating it. I have a tendency to, uhh, forget to be social. I forget to call and text people, even though I mean to do it. But being social is just never at the forefront of my mind. I'll have to work on that. But then there's online communities, which is a completely different world. I have always been more open and (dare I say it?) chatty online than in my ""real life"" social interactions. Maybe it's the anonymity, or the fact that it's text-based, or the fact that the community I'm in here is one that is full of like-minded people with similar interests. People I can relate and talk to easily. I don't know, but I'm quite different online than off. Offline, I don't really do chit-chat, or small talk, and I'm often at a loss as to what I should say in a light social situation, despite there being 10 dozen possibilities running through my mind. I usually settle for silence, though, because by the time I've thought through a plethora of ""Nice weather"" or ""Your hair looks nice"" nothing comments, it's been an awkwardly long time, and I know it, and anything that I say at that point would just sound forced and fake, so I just... don't. That feeling that I just mentioned, about feeling forced and fake, is such a strong one for me that it sometimes overwhelms me when I really don't want it to, and it often feels to me like I come across as being cold and unfeeling when I really just don't know what to say to show how affected I really am. It was only when the book started talking about being 'sensitive' that it started to click. I've always been overly affected by emotionally charged situations. If you read some of my reviews of tear-jerker books, I mention this frequently. I remember when I was a kid, there was a show called Rescue 911 that my mom liked to watch. It was always some traumatic situation - a car wreck or an injured hiker or a woman trapped in a housefire, etc, and the show focused on the EMTs and firefighters and police called out to help. That show would always make me cry. Always. Every single episode. It didn't matter whether the people made it out OK, or if they all died, I would be in tears. I could just imagine how scary it would be and I had such respect for the kind of people who could deal with that kind of trauma every day and keep it together enough to help. It would all just overwhelm me, and I would cry. My point here, and how this relates to my last paragraph, is that my dad would often poke fun at me for getting upset over the show, and so I learned to hide that I was upset... oftentimes laughing to cover it. Laughing. As I got older into my teens, I just stopped showing that sensitivity in front of others at all, and unfortunately, that's carried over into my adult life. So now, when I feel strong emotions, it's easier for me to let them out when I'm alone, even though it makes me seem heartless to not show them when it's appropriate. Like at my grandma's funeral earlier this year, when my entire extended family was crying and talking and interacting, and I was stoically sitting in the pew, just thinking about her and how much I'll miss her. After the service, when I was alone, I completely lost my shit. I loved that woman, dammit. She was awesome.Anyway, if you're still reading, sorry for the overshare. What I'm getting at is that I loved how this book made me feel normal. It's well-researched, well-written, and engaging, and I'm incredibly glad that I read it. I think that it will... maybe not CHANGE my life, so much as improve it. I now know more about why I do certain things, and that's empowering. I can relate better to my boyfriend (an extrovert), and in my new job, and in social situations. And I can try to work on the things that I now recognize hinder me more than help me. Definitely a fascinating read. Highly recommended. "
49,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,5,"So...Just read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, (2012) by Susan Cain, Crown Publishers.I liked this book, and why not -- an in-depth defense of people like me! Although I confess, I never thought that introverts would need to be explained to extroverts. I thought we were self-evident, and it was the other, noisy, dominant half of the world that was inexplicable. (They still are.) It possibly needs a companion volume -- Noisy: the hegemony of people with nothing helpful to say who still won't shut up, or something. (Cue reality TV, talk radio, and horrible crush parties with loud music, where you couldn't hear anyone even if they were interesting.) Anyway.This made a curious juxtaposition with my last-read book Fossil Horses. MacFadden, a scientist, argued like a scientist; Cain, a lawyer, argues like a lawyer. I discern the differences even as I appreciate the advocacy. Cain develops her case through illustrative anecdotes, and references to science, psychology, and history as needed. Very readable. I confess, I hadn't thought of extroversion as the American cultural ideal, even as I have witnessed plenty of the cited behaviors. My world tends to be divided practically into ""people who read"" and ""everybody else"", which cuts unevenly across the extrovert/introvert divide, with the obvious bias.I sort of want to go out and press this book upon ""everybody else"", but one sees the inherent problem with that. I hope its message can cut through the noise somehow, nonetheless.Recommended.Ta, L."

I once again learned that every path has a value, also a quiet one and a whispering voice is not less valid, just less loud. Basically already that is more than enough to recommend it.If you consider yourself an introvert and doubt your own worth in comparison with more outgoing or established people, this is for you.If you are in any way interested in the introvert - extrovert spectrum, this will give you some very good understanding. For me the Quiet Revolution is a bit over the top, but that came after the book and doesn't make it any less valuable. "

"
52,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"I feel sure Quiet will become the benchmark book on the topic of introversion. This is because it not only thoroughly explains introversion but champions it. It’s a book by an introvert for introverts, to help them understand themselves and feel proud of who they are. It’s also a book for extroverts, but especially those extroverts who are convinced that introversion is a flaw. Cain will have them wishing they were introverts. Quiet is inarguably biased in favor of introversion, but that’s the point. Up to one-half of Americans are introverted. It’s absurd that introversion is scoffed at as much as it is. The time has come for the introverted label to be a compliment rather than a criticism. This book is a leap in that direction.Cain covered many facets of introversion, from the intriguing “highly sensitive” subset (which describes about 20% of all introverts) to differences in the Eastern and Western worlds to the introverted child (specifically in the classroom, which favors extroverts). Also explored is the age-old question of nature versus nurture and brain differences between extroverts and introverts--plus more. I greatly enjoyed the Eastern versus Western section. America, and the Western world in general, has what Cain dubs an “Extrovert Ideal.” The opposite is true in the East. Whereas in the West, introversion is viewed as a weakness to be conquered, in the East, it’s considered a strength; extroversion is frowned upon, viewed as something that must be tamed. The general sentiment is that extroverts are overwhelming people, wasting others’ time with empty chatter. It’s in this section that Cain profiled Don Chen, an Asian-American student studying at Harvard business school, a very extroverted place. He’s the embodiment of introversion and must feign extroversion daily to get through his classes and general life as part of the school. Feigning extroversion is draining, and Chen needs solitude every day to recharge. This is how it is for all introverts, and Cain stressed repeatedly that it’s not a defect, just a difference. Chen has an intimate group of friends (entirely Asian-American save for one introverted white American man). He’s keenly aware of the differences between his little group and his extroverted classmates. He notes how frequently the extroverts participate in classes while he rarely does and how boisterous they are when together in the cafeteria. Though he admires some of their qualities, he mostly doesn’t understand them. In his mind, they disrespectfully waste classmates’ and professors’ time with their talk, failing to get to the point quickly. If this section sounds borderline racist, it isn’t. Rather, it recognizes that different cultures value different qualities and is a powerful example of introversion as a desirable trait. Chen’s story is one of many in this enlightening book. To support all points, Cain profiled real people, some living, some dead (such as Rosa Parks and Dale Carnegie). The (carefully indexed) research is fascinating in itself, but the real-life examples supporting her research are vital. They round out Quiet to push it beyond dry textbook. I’d read a lot about introversion before reading Quiet, and I bypassed this book for years because others said it offers nothing new on the topic. Readers who’ve read numerous books on the topic or have researched the topic extensively may feel this way. I didn’t. In each chapter, I learned--and was utterly engrossed. Introverts will find Quiet relatable and affirming. Extroverts will find Quiet demystifies introverts thoroughly and will appreciate them more. Both will find it extremely illuminating."
53,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36434323-melindam,4,"3,6 starsWell.... as I am an introvert, I obviously need to comtemplate before writing a review, right? :)But all in all, I am glad I listened to this book. The narrator was excellent.Also, it was a very interesting, insightful, informative read and of course there were lots of issues raised to which I could totally relate, even though sometimes I was a bit confused about what Susan Cain was ultimately trying to prove.I wish I could have read this book as a I teenager as well as my extrovert mother! :)I am from Central-Eastern Europe, so of course not all things ""translate"" directly into how society is working in Hungary as opposed to how things are in the US, but the personal issues are there and are quite universal."
54,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose,5,"This has been probably the one review I've been most intimidated to write for the longest time, and it's not because Susan Cain's ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" isn't a strongly asserted and powerful work. I could sing its respective praises for days. The fact of the matter is - this book really hit me at the heart of my core for so many measures in my life as an introvert. I find it hard to expound just how much this book had an impact on me personally.I could tell you about many things about my person that embody me as an introvert. That I'm quiet spoken and don't speak unless I have something important to say. That small talk isn't something I'm comfortable that I'm not fond of confrontations (though many of you have read my extended written rants about various matters of controversy with very little hesitation). That I tend to spend time alone to recharge my batteries even when I'm called to do things in any scale of extroversion. That my emotional intelligence is very high and I can sympathize/emphathize with people for matters of their experience (though this also makes me highly sensitive).For most of my life, I've been told that these very natural matters of my disposition were wrong. And goodness forbid did that make my life complicated because I didn't feel like people understood who I was. I was even led to believe that I was actually shy, not introverted (many people confuse the two, there is a difference.) Yet the more I learned about the dynamic of introversion and extroversion and how they functioned, I realized that the fundamental difference between them were the derived sources of energy that one functions with in day to day living. That there's nothing wrong with being introverted versus extroverted in a society that - in mainstream notations, champions the latter.This book had me thinking for days after I finished it.I liked that Cain's narrative focuses on the positive contributions and the inherent strengths that lie in introversion because it's widely stereotyped. That stereotyping actually harms our society more than we ourselves may realize in the daily grind, not just individually. By trying to mold people into one acceptable standard, we often lose out on what unique strengths and contributions one may have from going away from such a standard. Narratives like ""Quiet"" have relevance not just in recognizing the distinct psychological functions and differences we have as individuals, but also in the relationships and contributions we have in our professions, our activities, and even wider perceptions of our society in general.I appreciated the expansion on famous figures like Rosa Parks in terms of her backstory and identity as an introvert and how that shaped her responses (I'll have to pick up ""Quiet Strength"" at some point). I also appreciated hearing Cain's own struggles with coming to terms with her introversion, and even the story of the Harvard Business student. There are so many individual stories in this narrative and Cain gives a thorough examination of the details within. It's amazing just how much work and thought went into expounding these issues and individual narratives. This narrative examines introversion not only as a social construct, but individual - delving into narratives of biological, psychological, and sociological importance. There's an examination on the level of intorversion among different cultures, how introspection is valuable to creativity versus ""groupthink"", how extroversion and introversion are not mutually exclusive (and situations that call for each). I came out of it all with not only a fresh perspective on how valuable introverts are to the fabric of society, but also a greater sense of self-worth for my own traits. And that's something to be thankful for. My hope is that with more people who pick up ""Quiet"" and realize how important our individual attributes are, that it'll provide for more opportunities to be creative and to value each other in our relationships regardless of differences, for our unique strengths regardless of how their expressed or from where they come.Overall score: 5/5 stars"

My credentials include cheerfully working from home, getting overstimulated in quiet libraries, and keeping in touch with my closest friends almost entirely by snail mail. I have been known to feel oversocialised sitting in a darkened room, listening to people two rooms away watch a film.As far as a lot of media is concerned, I may as well be a pet hamster. ""Care for your introvert."" Try not to interrupt them. Don't go in their nest while they're sleeping. Offer them a way out when you're at a party, in case they run out of carrot sticks and want to go home. I may as well also be a complete rarity: a third of people don't get hissy when you take their carrot sticks away; come the fuck on.So, what I liked about Quiet was that it didn't make me feel like a special snowflake or someone's hamster.But also... the section on introversion in leadership and the workplace has actually boosted my confidence a lot (apart from being really interesting). I've worked for a few people, and the times it's worked best have been the times where they give me a broad, bullet-pointed list of what they want to have happened by what time, and then they go away until that time. The best boss I ever had used to say it was a good day if we never spoke to each other except when one of us brought the other coffee - and I was inclined to agree with him. Faced with common-sense-logic, which seems to say that 5000 feedback sessions and an open-plan office with communal ball-pit are what millennials are looking for, I wanted this narrative. It was useful to hear. Maybe it's less useful if you're the sort of person who's been reading this sort of thing for years. For me, it was a helpful reminder.I remember a little interesting neurological detail, but not a lot - I can get more than that keyword-searching the Scientific American website, if I want to - and a fair bit of interesting historical anecdote. I remember coming away with a renewed respect for anyone who parents, especially by themselves, as well as a sense of purpose about working for myself and by myself - which I'm happy to say I'm now doing. It turns out, a lot of the time, that people who contract you for work over the internet don't really give a shit about your sparkling and gracious personality. They just want to know you're conscientious and you know what you're talking about and you'll do things when you say you will. I vaguely credit Susan Cain with giving me the impetus to go and do what I want to do, and not to feel like I have to be constantly nice to people I don't know. Now I just think, it's okay, I have character, and then put my headphones back in."
56,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5524572-kristin-hackett-superspacechick,4,"As a self proclaimed introvert, I've been meaning to read this book for so long. My sister in law gave me a copy for Christmas so I prioritized it as a January read and I'm so glad I did. I really enjoyed the in depth look at what constitutes an introvert vs. an extrovert. Quiet even redefined the meaning of the word sensitive for me. I've never considered myself sensitive before but to pull a quote, ""highly sensitive people tend to be keen observers who look before they leap. They arrange their lives in ways that limit surprises. They’re often sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, pain, coffee... Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments—both physical and emotional—unusually deeply. They tend to notice subtleties that others miss—another person’s shift in mood, say, or a lightbulb burning a touch too brightly.""- this is 100% spot on for me. While I do agree with a lot of what Susan Cain wrote, I do think it's difficult to classify people into only one of two categories. She did stress that just because someone is an introvert, it doesn't mean that 1) they got there the same way as someone else or 2) that both people will have exactly the same traits. There are still variables to consider. Overall, I loved that Quiet is a celebrated look at introversion and the strengths that those with introverted qualities possess. There were a few anecdotes that weren't the most interesting (or relevant like the chapter on raising children), but I still found value in reading them. "
57,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,5,"I am an introvert and proud of it and so is the author and she believes there is strength in quietness and I think she is right. She has helped me understand myself more and I am glad of that. Introverts don't like novelty and the first day of school is usually traumatic as mine was. As children, introverts like to daydream, play inside and their feelings are easily hurt. ""They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. . ."" They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy and fear."" They "". . . tend to speak softly because that's how they prefer others to communicate with them.""Shy people hate confrontations and will avoid them at all costs and the author believes it is better so.

58,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,2,"Why is it that the “ideal” person is extroverted? That we pride social skills and being outgoing? All while a deeply gifted thinker who prefers to be in his/her head is described as lacking these traits. Looking at it from an evolutionary standpoint, there is a reason why introverts exist, so why do we rate it as second best? Being a true-blue introvert, I turned to Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a world that can’t stop talking” to answer these questions (and maybe propose new ones). Susan Cain divides “Quiet” into four main sections with the first focusing on the history and description of the rise of extroverts, the differences in leadership styles of introverts and extroverts, and the myths surrounding them. This section begins “Quiet” with a slow and unmemorable beginning. Cain focuses more of an effort on real-life case studies versus actual scientific studies, bypassing any professional data or even her own opinions. The studies which are mentioned are not “earth-shattering” in depth nor do they truly correlate to her hypothesis. In fact, much of the hypothesis is lost and the flow is not seamless or clear. On one hand, this makes the reading understandable and accessible for the less scientifically-inclined reader, but to others craving more research; Cain leaves something to be desired. Some of Cain’s examples which could be perceived as “witty” (Craig Newark of Craigslist fame, Dr. Suess, and Moses from the Bible) are underdeveloped and also lose connection with the hypothesis. Cain is often abrupt and cuts herself short. Furthermore, many of the chapters begin in the same exact way (both format and creativity) which is tedious and creates a loss of interest. The second section of “Quiet” describes some of the brain and neurological aspects of introverts featuring more science than the first section. Cain’s work is a bit more compelling in this respect and certainly more interesting. However, it still isn’t clear what she is trying to prove as she mostly just describes how introverts “are”. Plus, most of the findings are self-explanatory and even obvious. Again, the reader will not be blown away. I have read MANY “brain books” (psychology/neurology, science, and biology) and generally, I am left both flabbergasted and repeating information I’ve read to anyone who will listen. This was not the case with “Quiet” as only a small dose of information felt standout. As the second portion progresses, Cain does present tests and experimentation results more confidentially (however, there is a lack of elaboration). The third section of “Quiet” is comparatively shorter, as Cain explains the conformities and values of the Asian cultures while in the fourth section, Cain offers tips and lifestyle adaptations for introverts in various areas such as work, romance, parenting, play, etc. At this point, “Quiet” appears to be more of a self-help book. The latter end of the book is overly focused on parenting and schooling of children causing me to feel alienated and distanced (having no children). Furthermore, the “Conclusion” is weak and sums up the book which actually reinforces how few points are made. Simply, “Quiet"" is not what I expected. Instead of explaining “why” introverts are the way they are; Cain described “how” they are with an absence of data I would have preferred. All in all though, it has been confirmed (which I already knew) that I am indeed an introvert."
59,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A lance is broken for the needs of introverted people Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Whether one opposes the sanguine with the phlegmatic nature, the wild daredevil the thoughtful inventor or merely the introversion the extroversion, the temperament is and remains in specific proportions decisive for a human being. The author has re-examined this fact with an unconventional approach, opening up exciting and critical viewing angles. Times are changing. In the 19th century, it was still commonplace to be modest, humble and unobtrusive. Starting from the advertising industry in the 1920s and 1930s, it continued to run to the idealistic goal of total superficiality. Ads began to play with people's fear of the negative connotations of ominous, alien observers, and the appearance and ability to attract more and more attention. The new religion of narcissism was supported by an entrepreneurial mentality that understood handshaking qualities, dazzling rhetoric, and slick eloquence as signs of business qualification.Thus, when the loudest and most risk-taking specimens of the managerial species, elite colleges that encourage elbow mentality-driven, superficial behavior, occupy key positions, one or the other financial market collapse is no longer surprising. The flowers of this development on the example of today's America could seem bizarre if the consequences were not so serious. Thus, adjectives such as shy and quiet or just hints of a sly-boy mentality are dismissed as entirely negative and peculiar. Whether in school, work or private life, who does not understand playing on the highly sophisticated keyboard of interpersonal communication, quickly falls through the typical rust. Sensitive children, even as babies, are prone to intensified reactions to external stimuli, are more empathetic and need seeming timidity as a protective mechanism against a formally overwhelming universe. At the same time, individuals naturally endowed with a more robust psychic scaffolding sound lighthearted, but also more emotionless, to their surroundings.Parents of quieter, a manageable circle of friends their naming and lonely hobbies devoted children are remembered, not only subtle, the importance of popularity and dazzling charm. However, very peculiar that silent children are put under depression or misanthropic suspicion, while too vital, joyful young people are sedated with Ritalin. If the favors of loneliness have been well into adulthood, there is a wide range of seminars that can enhance eloquence, demeanor, and be talking skills to the point of sales genius. Several relationship problems are likely based on the well measurable differences between different natures, even by MRI. While extroverts can bathe in crowds every awaken minute and shy away from loneliness, the relationship is reversed by introverts. This involves interpersonal explosives in itself when the mantra of the attractive opposites once no longer pulls, and the supposed truce of the relationship beginning is over. Additional spontaneous emotional responses provoke the fact that extroverts interpret specific aggressive behavior as interest and attention while introverts feel injured and attacked. Assessing the damage caused to the economy by incorrectly designing work processes and their surroundings is difficult or even impossible. If one adds the increased disinclination of introverts in a loud open-plan atmosphere, including the wasted potential, because gifted thinkers find no peace to work out ideas and concepts undisturbed, the overall economic damage can be immense. The cultural differences show a contrarian approach of the Asians, where a European-American behavior style is considered a stupid waste of time for listeners. Tranquility and contemplation have a different meaning, superficiality and the glorification of narcissistic principles are considered less desirable. Another, quite thoughtful approach.Eine Lanze gebrochen für die Bedürfnisse der introvertierten MenschenansammlungsvermeiderOb man dem sanguinischen das phlegmatische Naturell entgegenstellt, dem wilden Draufgänger den nachdenklichen Tüftler oder schlicht der Introvertiertheit die Extrovertiertheit, das Temperament ist und bleibt zu bestimmten Anteilen maßgebend für einen Menschen. Die Autorin hat diesen Umstand mit einer unkonventionellen Herangehensweise neu beleuchtet und damit interessante und kritische Betrachtungswinkel eröffnet.So ändern sich die Zeiten. War es im 19 Jahrhundert noch gang und gäbe, bescheiden, demütig und unaufdringlich zu sein, begann, ausgehend von der Werbeindustrie, in den 1920er und 1930er Jahren, ein bis heute andauernder Lauf auf das ideelle Ziel der totalen Oberflächlichkeit. Anzeigen begannen mit der Angst der Menschen vor negativen Assoziationen ominöser, fremder Beobachter zu spielen und das Äußere sowie die Fähigkeit zu gefallen, immer mehr ins Rampenlicht zu rücken. Unterstützung fand die neue Religion des Narzissmus von einer Unternehmermentalität, die Handschlagqualitäten, blendende Rhetorik und aalglatte Eloquenz als Zeichen betriebswirtschaftlicher Qualifikation auffasste. Wenn auf diese Weise immer die lautesten und risikofreudigsten Exemplare der Managerspezies, von zu ellbogenmentalitätsgesteuerten, oberflächlichen Verhalten animierenden Elitehochschulen, Schlüsselpositionen besetzen, verwundert der eine oder andere Finanzmarktkollaps gar nicht mehr.Die Blüten dieser Entwicklung am Beispiel des heutigen Amerikas könnten skurril anmuten, wären die daraus resultierenden Konsequenzen nicht derart gravierend. So werden Adjektive wie schüchtern und ruhig oder nur Andeutungen einer Eigenbrötlermentalität als durchwegs negativ und absonderlich abgetan. Sei es in Schule, Beruf oder Privatleben, wer nicht versteht auf der hochkomplexen Klaviatur zwischenmenschlicher Kommunikation zu spielen, fällt leicht einmal durch den sozialen Rost.Sensible Kinder neigen schon als Babys zu verstärkten Reaktionen auf äußere Reize, sind einfühlsamer und benötigen die scheinbare Furchtsamkeit als Schutzmechanismus gegen ein sie mit Eindrücken förmlich erschlagendes Universum. Gleichzeitig wirken von Natur aus mit einem robusteren psychischen Gerüst ausgestattete Individuen unbeschwerter, aber auch emotionsloser auf ihre Umgebung. Eltern ruhiger, einen überschaubaren Freundeskreis ihr Eigen nennender und sich einsamen Hobbies widmender Kinder werden, nicht nur durch die Blume, an die Wichtigkeit von Beliebtheit und blendendem Charme erinnert. Doch sehr eigentümlich, dass stille Kinder unter Depressions- oder Misanthropiegeneralverdacht gestellt werden, während allzu vitale, lebensfrohe junge Menschen mit Ritalin sediert werden.Sollte sich die Favorisierung der Einsamkeit bis ins Erwachsenenalter durchgeschlagen haben, gibt es eine breite Palette an Seminarangeboten, die Beredsamkeit, Auftreten und Plauschkompetenzen bis hin zum Verkaufsgenie steigern können. Etliche Beziehungsprobleme dürften auf den, auch per MRT gut messbaren Unterschieden zwischen verschiedenen Naturellen basieren. Während Extrovertierte jede wache Minute in Menschenmengen baden könnten und Einsamkeit scheuen, kehrt sich das Verhältnis bei Introvertierten um. Das birgt zwischenmenschlichen Sprengstoff in sich, wenn das Mantra von den sich anziehenden Gegensätzen einmal nicht mehr richtig zieht und der vermeintliche Waffenstillstand des Beziehungsbeginns vorüber ist. Zusätzliche spontane emotionale Reaktionen provoziert die Tatsache, dass Extrovertierte bestimmtes, aggressives Verhalten als Interesse und Aufmerksamkeit interpretieren, während Introvertierte sich verletzt und angegriffen fühlen.Den für die Wirtschaft entstandenen Schaden durch falsche Konzeption von Arbeitsabläufen samt deren Umgebungen einzuschätzen mutet schwer bis unmöglich an. Wenn man die verstärkte Krankheitsneigung Introvertierter in lauter Großraumbüroatmosphäre inklusive dem verschwendeten Potential, weil begnadete Denker keine Ruhe finden, um Ideen und Konzepte ungestört ausarbeiten zu können, addiert, dürfte der gesamtvolkswirtschaftliche Schaden immens sein.Die kulturellen Unterschiede zeigen eine konträre Herangehensweise der Asiaten, bei denen ein europäisch-amerikanisches Gebaren als unhöfliche Verschwendung der Zeit von Zuhörern gewertet wird. Ruhe und Kontemplation haben eine andere Bedeutung, Oberflächlichkeit und die Verherrlichung narzisstischer Prinzipien gelten als wenig erstrebenswert. Ein anderer, durchaus in Erwägung zu ziehender Ansatz."

Susan Cain, former Wall Street lawyer and self-described introvert, investigates how introversion has become dangerously scorned in the current American ""Culture of Personality."" I had not fully realized how drastically our cultural values have shifted--and how much American society pushes us to conform--until reading Cain's book. To prove her point, Cain visits American bastions of extroversion promotion, including Harvard Business School, Saddleback Church, Dale Carnegie, Wall Street, and Tony Robbins conferences. She talks with pioneering psychologists and neurologists to explain the studies behind concepts like the dangers of group think, the ability to delay gratification, or the trait called sensitivity. She profiles famous and less-well known introverts to show how the studies play out in real life.Though the many of the activities I'm drawn to (and the things that cause anxiety) scream classic introvert, I have always considered myself an extrovert and frequently put myself in situations where extroverted behavior is valued. However, since quitting my job and globe-hopping for the past two years, I've been surprised (and disappointed) by how often the constant stimulation, new people, and change can drain me--and by how I often feel an overwhelming need for alone time.I found myself relating to many of the points Cain discusses and have since concluded that I'm much more of an introvert than I had thought. (I promise that this isn't just because she does a good job of highlighting all the positive things about introverts!)So for that, I am grateful to have read Quiet, though I can't quite believe it took reading a book to figure that out about myself! I am seeing my preferences in a new light and have much understanding and acceptance regarding the things that interest me (and those that cause me stress). I've been having trouble narrowing down 'what I want to do with my life' and this book has helped me more than any other, because I finally feel like I can accept that the things I really enjoy are just a part of me and can't be ignored. Though the personal application will differ, I suspect many people will come away having learned much more than they expected, if not about themselves, then about people close to them. I had always thought of extroverts and introverts as being on distinct sides of a line, when in fact it's much more of a sliding scale (or perhaps better as two scales: percentage introversion, percentage extroversion). Because we have been culturally pressured and trained to admire extroverted behavior, many of us may be dangerously ignoring our introverted characteristics. This was a game-changing book for me, and I suspect it will be eye-opening to most people who read it."

But I also enjoy giving presentations at school, tutoring peers in writing, and interacting with various people online and in real life. I'd describe myself as an introvert (and my Meyers-Briggs personality type agrees), though both introverts and extroverts would enjoy this fascinating book by Susan Cain. She provides an intriguing, in-depth perspective on introversion, its connotation in contrasting cultures, and the psychology behind it.A profusion of the nonfiction I've read has contained too much of something - too many random anecdotes, too much scientific jargon, too many unnecessary statistics or explanations. But Quiet has the perfect blend of personal anecdotes, interesting analysis, detailed explanations, and compelling statistics. Cain references various studies conducted by psychologists and discusses several aspects related to introversion, such as the extrovert ideal, how extroverts and introverts can compliment each other and work together, nature v. nature, etc. Here's one passage about sensitive people (who tend to be more introverted) that struck a chord with me:""The other thing Aron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they're highly empathic. It's as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people's emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world. They tend to have unusually strong consciences. They avoid violent movies and TV shows; they're acutely aware of the consequences of a lapse in their own behavior. In social settings they often focus on subjects like personal problems, which others consider 'too heavy'.""I guess I have an excuse for exposing so much of myself on my blog, huh? Anyway, Cain delves into other subjects that are intellectually stimulating too, such as the three things she thinks are important in identifying one's personal project. She even brings up the relationship between Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other famous historical figures.Overall, highly recommended to everyone curious about their own temperaments and how to embrace their natural personalities. One of the best works of nonfiction I've read.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

Many times I wondered what new information could possibly be discussed, and a lot of times there wasn't really any new information.

It's perhaps not a surprise that Susan Cain, the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking identifies herself as an introvert. Being quiet, introverted or shy is still seen by many as a problem or handicap to overcome so I can see her motivation for writing it.One this book's premises is that in the last 50 years or so, the Western world moved from a culture of character to a culture of personality, which according to the author has given an advantage to people that enjoyed outgoing, uninhibited personalities. We tend to admire and reward people that exhibit the most gregarious, outgoing traits of extroverts while at the same time undermined and misunderstand those that are most typically seen in more introverted individuals.
Introversion is really about having a preference for lower stimulation environments. So it's just a preference for quiet, for less noise, for less action. Whereas extroverts really crave more stimulation in order to feel at their best.
The author explains that Introversion is a spectrum, and that most of us don't fully fit into an introvert/extrovert definition. It also provides a sort of ""survival guide"" for introverts to help us learn how to better deal with the pressures of living in a world that for the most part rewards those that are extroverts.
Many people believe that introversion is about being antisocial, and that's really a misperception. Because actually it's just that introverts are differently social. So they would prefer to have a glass of wine with a close friend as opposed to going to a loud party full of strangers.
This book helped me understand myself better, identify those traits that makes many of us ""introverts"" different and learn how to use them to our advantage, both on our professional and personal lives. The book is entertaining and well written. If you are interested in learning about introverts, perhaps because you feel like one or someone closed to you does, this book might be of interest to you.After reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking my conclusion is that the world needs both extroverts and introverts and that we all have a role to play.Here's a link to the author's TED TALK which is sort a summarized version of the book:http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_t..."

And the whole idea about needing time out to recover from socialising - I always thought I was just a bit odd, haha.The criticisms that are quite rightly levelled at this book about preaching some kind of binarism between extrovert and introvert are understandable, and am I'm sure that we are all a little too complex for a poorly designed set of questions to provide any sort of sensible analysis or categorisation (would still like to see the questions though...) Most people will be surely be somewhere close to 'ambivert' even if they know themselves to be introverted at heart. For me a major part of young socialisation and growing up was learning to act like an extrovert, if nothing else just to stop people trying to 'bring me out of my shell' or constantly asking what's up as I am 'being quiet'."

For years people have been telling me to come out of my shell and to be more outgoing and I realized I had definitely playing the role of pseudo-extrovert all this time! I enjoyed reading the fact that we introverts actually have power and hidden strengths. The list of famous introverts surprised me, Rosa Parks, Al Gore and Gandhi in particular. The book also shared some insight into the thinking patterns of extroverts. All in all, it was an interesting book though the end did drag on a bit."

67,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5470914-sam,1,"This was the most painful book I have read this summer. I choked it down like bad medicine page after page. Quiet is great self affirmation for someone who considers themselves an introvert, and sees humans as either an extrovert or introvert. Cain certainly thinks she’s the poster child of an introvert, or is she? The book reads like a memoir in parts where she tells stories of her own life, then there are smatterings or small examples in specific parts of people’s lives of how greatness comes in quiet e.g. Steve Wozniak, Gandhi, Rosa Parks. Cain also fancies herself a bit of a child psychologist, on one hand it’s ok for kids to be shy or in their shell, these aren’t bad things, and very normal, but on the other hand we need to nudge and push slowly to get kids out of their quiet place. So which is it?It doesn’t bother me that Cain isn’t a psychologist or economist, but she’s talking through both sides of her mouth, the book is a pity party, she thinks the decisions in modern workplaces are influenced by highly extroverted personalities like those from the Harvard Business School. There’s no backing for this other than the fact that business students are extroverts. Additionally the economic crisis was wholly the fault of extroverts, basically extroverts with their loud voices overpowered the brilliant quiet hardworking, and smart introverts and ran the economy to the ground. I’m afraid you really aren’t brilliant if something has already happened and you didn’t do anything to stop it. In hindsight everything is 20/20, just because you are quiet and something bad is happening saying “I knew it!” doesn’t do much. The circlejerk continues when Cain bangs on about everyone who a douche as being an extrovert. Good guys are introverts, Warren Buffet because of his one speech about the dot com bubble bursting was quiet and well calculated in his words. The rest of the word are greedy businessmen. There’s some sample or thin slicing in her discussions that I find problematic, and read a bit like a tabloid. Susan Cain is clearly appealing to an audience that is already sold to introversion, and stroking those egos. I wish the book had more solutions instead of harping about how bad people are. The book blurs it’s lines through many genres, self help, psychology and a dash of group-think. I consider myself an introvert, but also an extrovert, yes I do believe brilliance happens in unaccompanied activities like running. I charge my batteries during times like this but I also don’t “suffer in silence”. I don’t believe people are fully introverted or extroverted. Reading Khaneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and Mcgonigal’s Willpower Instinct make Cain’s book look hurriedly and thoughtlessly written, there’s little appeal to science. "
68,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,3,"I expected to love, love, love this book. After all, psychology is one of my passions. Also, I am always interested in hearing from some group. And this is saying, ""We, the introverts, are speaking out.""However, the book was neither as powerful nor as interesting as I was hoping....Cain does a great job of blending together different aspects. The three main angles she uses are:1.) Famous people who were introverts. She usually starts her chapters with a story about a wonderful famous person we all know and adore - and then explaining how they were introverted. Rosa Parks, Dale Carnegie, and Eleanor Roosevelt are some of the examples she used.2.) Case studies. This is the real life introvert ""Jane Doe."" She was on this job and thought she would have to quit because she just wasn't outgoing enough. Then she learned that being an introvert was like having a secret superpower! And then she used her introversion to overcome all obstacles! Now she's rich and/or happy. Success!3.) Science - hard and soft. Cain uses both psychology and biology to try and explain the differences between extroverts and introverts. She also explains why introversion might be valuable in evolution and natural selection. She has a fascinating chapter on culture, which emphasizes that although extroversion is worshiped in the USA, many Asian countries value silence, reflection, and understanding over cheerfulness, enthusiasm, and talkativeness. ...This book is at it's best when Cain is exploring how introversion is a valuable and worthy trait or way of being. When she journeys into different places to see how introversion is treated differently there. When she explores how introversion can be a survival aid in the wild and how introverted people can be powerful in their own way.It's exciting and interesting to realize that extroversion - while venerated in America - is actually seen as crass and dumb in many Asian cultures.And it's fun and cool to see different theories of how introverted people and animals are strong in Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection. I liked seeing different species and the benefits and drawbacks they experience from being extroverted or introverted. And I enjoyed seeing how introversion could be a kick-butt evolutionary trait which is often overlooked or thought to be something that needed 'killing off.'I thought about 2/3 of the book were weak, though. For instance, I already know enough about famous figures and do not particularly want or need to read a short biography or story about them. Another thing that bugged me were her ""real life introversion stories."" Here is how an introvert struggled. Here is how he learned to embrace his true self and be happy/rich.The whole book just felt like a big pat on the back. ""Don't worry, introverts, you're okay! Everything's okay! It might seem like the world hates you, but use your strengths! You are really amazing.""And it's not even like I DISAGREE with this message, it's simply that I was expecting more than a rather thinly-veiled self-help book. P.S. I really like the page or two that Cain dedicates to exploring Moses (an alleged introvert) and Aaron (his extroverted mouthpiece). It is also interesting when she lightly touches on whether or not the Church and modern-day Protestants shun and punish introverts as not doing the Lord's work. I like when she questions whether Jesus was an introvert or extrovert (covered in one paragraph, very shallow) and questions whether the Church is pushing an incorrect message on it's followers. (""Real Christians proselytize! How can you be a REAL Christian if you are not gregarious?"") I also like when she uses the teachings and life of Gandhi to emphasize that passivity is NOT submissiveness. All these subjects were things I wished she'd explored in greater depth."

All these adjectives and more describe my experience with this amazing book.I'm very much an introvert. I try to avoid social functions as much as possible, but I do love meeting every so often with my dear friends one-on-one. If I do end up at a party, you can bet I'm the one keeping the corner warm. I am an avid reader, a knitter, a sometimes writer, a nerd, and an engineer. My idea of a perfect evening is one spent in the comfort of my apartment, cat in lap, book in hand, coffee at my side. My idea of a perfect vacation is one where I can go to my favorite coffee shop and read. In college, my favorite classes were Differential Equations (in which I, the only female, got a perfect score on the final), Physics, and Fluids. Ever since elementary school, I dreaded a school performances, such as Christmas programs or poetry recitals. At work meetings, I am more likely to listen to everything and be note-taker than I am to present or volunteer ideas.Lately, my boss has said that I need to step things up, become more ""out there"" and confident. Inwardly, I despaired. Wasn't I working hard enough? What was holding me back? Why couldn't I just blurt things out in meetings? Why did I constantly sound nervous, even if I really wasn't? Was there any hope for me to change?And then, like a sign from heaven, I saw this book in the ""New Books"" display at Barnes and Nobles (BTW, I happen to swing by the bookstore at least once a week during lunch - sometimes to purchase, but mostly to pass the time). I remembered a friend had read this and really enjoyed it, and I figured it would help me figure out myself.""Figure myself out"" would be an understatement; it's as if this book were written specifically for me! Cain breaks down what it means to be an introvert. Turns out despite what my sister is constantly telling me, I'm not weird (alright, not too weird). I have talents and skills. I have a place. And it's not my fault I can't always speak up and make my voice heard. A lot of it is because of how our workforce, our employers, our coworkers, our society functions. Our biology, our parents, our surroundings make us the introverted beings we are. It's just that school and work and the outside world try to tell us that being quiet, that listening and ruminating over things is wrong, that we should be quick to speak and blurt whatever is on our mind.I've known I was an introvert for a while, but it was so refreshing and liberating to learn that there were others with my ""problem"". That I wasn't alone. And, most importantly, I can overcome, nay thrive, in this Extroverted world. And that is the second gift Cain gives us in this book: how to be an Introvert in an Extrovert world and not want to choke yourself at night.I feel like, after reading Quiet, I have a plan for facing my ""work problems"". I feel like I can take the challenge my boss has placed in front of me and succeed. Although a part of me still wishes I could crawl back to my desk and burrow there, I think this book has given me the tools and encouragement I need to speak up.If you are an introvert, you definitely need to read this book. Even if you aren't an introvert, this is a great book to understanding how they think and act. I'm definitely passing this along to everyone I know."
70,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Years ago, my division manager at work had everybody in the division take the Meyer Briggs personality test. Then we spent time in a workshop, to understand the implications of our personality types. One of the dimensions of the test is extroversion/introversion (E or I types). This book offers a very satisfying account of what it means to be an introvert. Generally Western cultures admire extroverts, while Asian cultures admire introverts. Both types of personalities offer value to society. Groups of people who are introverts are best with an extroverted leader, while groups of extroverts are best with an introverted leader.Many introverts find it difficult to live in a society that values extroversion more highly. As a result, many introverts pretend to be extroverts in certain social situations. But they cannot maintain this pretension indefinitely, and at some point in time they must ""recharge"" their internal batteries with quiet and solitude. The book makes a major point here: It's perfectly OK to pretend to be an extrovert for periods of time--as long as you do this while you are working at something that you truly love.The book has useful practical advice for introverts. If you are an introvert and your husband or wife is an extrovert, there is much to be said about how to maintain or improve your relationship. If you are raising a child who is an introvert, it is important to understand how to encourage the child to follow his/her innate abilities.Back in the 1940's and 1950's, Alex Osborn was plagued by the lack of creativity in his advertising agency. So, he wrote some books introducing the concept of ""brainstorming"". The idea is for people get together in groups and toss out ideas without fear of ridicule--the more ideas, the better. The problem is, in the 1960's, studies showed that brainstorming is not efficient; you can get more, good ideas if people simply think creatively in solitude. Committees simply are not as productive as the sum of individuals working alone. We are so inculcated with the idea that brainstorming is best--but this is really just a reflection of the dominance of extroversion in our society. "
71,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4811203-emily-b,3,"As an introvert and psychology graduate this was an interesting read however it was not what I was expecting. I felt like it wasn’t as accessible as it could have been. It seems very focused on introverts in or who wish to be in very high powered job roles. Which isn’t my world. I was hoping for a bit more knowledge or ‘self help’ regarding being an introvert in an average every day life, Not as an award winning introverted lecturer, or an introverted Lawyer or CEO."
72,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"It is stated at the start that this book’s purpose is to improve a reader's relationship with others. The book can thus be viewed as a book of the self-help genre. Its aim is to advise introverts on ways by which they can improve their relationships with extroverts, and vice versa. It compares behavioral traits of both introverts and extroverts, showing in what ways they are similar and how they differ. The author mentions books about and summarizes studies related to extroversion and introversion, conducted over the years and up to today. The book begins with a quick test by which readers can determine where they stand on the introvert / extrovert scale. The test takes only a few minutes and gives the reader an immediate connection with the topics to be discussed. Both my husband and I took the test. We both received the same score, indicating that we are both strong introverts. It is interesting to note that although we had the same score, we did not answer all questions in the same way. This led to a lively discussion and a fun start to the book! Twenty questions are to be answered with a yes or a no. The book demonstrates clearly that in America it is the extroverts that hold sway--in the government, in business and in most educational institutions. It is an important and valuable statement that is being made. This is often to the detriment of introverts and to society as a whole. While the author professes the importance and value of both the introvert and the extrovert way of thinking, given the suppression of introverts in society today, it is introverts she lauds most, giving example after example of their accomplishments. I didn’t need to be convinced. For me, it is OBVIOUS that society benefits from the presence of both. The book verges on becoming a manifesto for introverts. This appeals to me no more than society's pronounced favoritism of extroverts! The book accomplishes well what it has set out to do, but I am rarely enthused by books of the self-help genre. It does advise readers on how their relationships can be improved. It also explains how schools can be adapted to better suit the needs of introverts, without hampering the situation for extroverts. I do however find much of the advice given as being rather obvious. The sections I like most are those that are scientifically oriented. I like for example the parts about how the brain functions; sections about the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex and the connection to dopamine are interesting. Many studies are referred to, but how exactly each was performed is skimmed over in too brief a manner. We are told what the results have for implications, but skeptic that I am, I was not always convinced! I need more details. To add depth, opposing points of view should have been added. Intuitively, I agree with the conclusions drawn, but I would have preferred more solid proof. Too many generalizations/simplifications are made. Over and over again we are told that so and so was an introvert and so and so an extrovert. This is all too simple! Individuals are mixes of introvert and extrovert qualities. Instead, an analysis of the tangled mix of traits that make up real people is what I was looking for. At one point Moses is classified as an introvert! This was just too much for me. The author swiftly classifies famous people as being either introvert or extrovert with little analysis of their specific character traits. I find this too categorical. We are told that Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, would never have written the books she wrote and become the ""bold thinker"" that she became had she not been left alone to read books in her youth. Where is the proof in that?! The author generalizes and simplifies all too often. The book is directed primarily toward Americans. I do not appreciate this slant. There is only a brief discussion of Asian American immigrants. Asian Americans of Chinese background are classified as introverts. Europeans are in a bunch grouped with Americans. I would have preferred a more in-depth, nuanced analysis of national and cultural differences.I wish the book had been more globally and more scientifically oriented. It has too many generalizations. It is basically a self-help book, a genre that does not appeal to me, so I guess it is not so bad that I nevertheless felt it to be worth reading. I would have preferred more in-depth analyses concerning how individuals are complicated mixes of introversion and extroversion. We are not one or the other, as was so often stated in reference to the people mentioned. The narration of the audiobook by Kathe Mazur started out very fast, but eventually she slows down. Her rapid speed had me chuckling at the beginning. Why? Because it is the extroverts, not us introverts that talk fast! Didn’t the producers of the audiobook realize the incongruity?! We introverts need time to stop and think and time to examine the ideas floating around in our heads. The narration is easy to follow once Mazur has slowed down. She has a soft, pleasant voice, a perfect match for introverts, the central protagonists of the book. The question is how many extroverts read this book. It is interesting to think about why this may be so."
73,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,5,"This book is very insightful and informative. I watched Susan Cain's TED talk once and I was fascinated being an introvert myself. As a kid I was shy, serious, studious with a little bit of social anxiety and although as I grew up, I outgrew my shyness and got more confident socially, there have been many situations where I questioned myself. Once when I was out on a trip with a big group of college friends, everyone was getting along so well and they seemed to be having so much fun together but I felt so lonely and left out and I was like, ''What's wrong with me''? Turns out I'm just an introvert. Then, I found this book. It describes in detail what introversion and extroversion is and what are the traits associated with both personalities. Where in most areas (or cultures), the introversion or shyness is viewed in a negative light, the writer states that it's an essential trait and how powerful it could be and it should be valued just as extroversion is. I found this book very interesting to read because she presents her ideas by using data gathered from case studies, research and her own personal experiences and from other people. She has also provided analysis of many famous personalities and how their temperaments shaped their actions and how essential their role was. Many definitions are provided for introversion-extroversion and how our genes and our environment play a role in shaping our personalities. There is no personality type better than the other but creating a balance is very important to bring out the best in both. The message in short is- value your individuality and do things the way you want and not because you have to conform to certain cultural norms. It also tells how both personalities can strike a balance between both traits. Also, both extroverts and introverts can lead a fulfilling life without changing their core values or trying to be someone they are not, the power lies in knowing who you are, what your abilities are and using them to the best.After reading this book, I feel like I can understand myself a little better now, what my motivations are and what makes me the way I am. I recommend this book to both introverts and extroverts as it can help them understand the qualities in themselves and in each other."
74,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2598642-catelyn-may,4,"I loved this book. As an introvert, I felt like someone was finally telling my side of the story, and understanding my life in general. Definitely going to loan it to some extroverted family members. "
75,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1230817-lori,5,"I'm really excited about all the works about introverts that's been coming out lately, I think mainly because of this book. I'm not sure if extroverts would have enjoyed this book as much as me, because Cain works hard to prove the merits and necessity of introverts in our society, while down-playing all the reasons why we should have an extrovert ideal. In fact, I think some extroverts would feel a bit offended at this book. But I don't care. I've lived my whole life feeling like there was something wrong with me. I need to speak up, get out there, sell myself, basically become something that I'm not. This book made me realize there's nothing wrong with me, and that I actually have strengths that my extroverted friends, relatives, etc., do not. Instead of constantly seeing myself as disadvantaged because I suck at small talk, don't know how to talk myself up in interviews, and am just a shy person, I just feel like I know myself better. I think teachers should read this book. And I'm going to stop, because this isn't so much as a book review as a blog post or something. This is a total self-help book for introverts. Thank you Cain!**I should also say that Cain uses extensive research and interviews to show the strengths of introverts, so it's actually a pretty scientific book (though made so that it's easy for the every day person like me to understand). I was really surprised at the amount of research done on the differences between introverts and extroverts, especially because the research often shows introverts in a good, positive light, unlike what most people think when they hear the word introvert.

First of all, as far as the audio format goes, they couldn’t have chosen a better narrator. Kathe Mazur’s voice fits the tone of the book perfectly–quiet and measured, yet firm. I basically just want to listen to every audiobook she’s ever narrated. Back to Quiet –I think Susan Cain did a stellar job of exploring the introverted personality type. She sites a number of studies and scientific theories to support her thesis that introversion is an undervalued trait in modern American society. Introverts have just as much to offer the world as extroverts and their unique strengths must be utilized for a society to be truly healthy.

77,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"When I was young, my grandfather, an intelligent farmer, used to call me an introvert, as I sat happily in the corner, spending my free time reading books or writing in my notebooks. I looked up at him, I believe I was around the age of eight or so, with crinkled eyebrows. He explained what it meant. But I didn't have a puzzled look on my face because I didn't understand the word, I was puzzled because he said it like he disapproved. Like it was a bad thing. My aunt, the doctor, immediately came to my defense and said, ""Janine, just tell him that you're not an introvert, you're just introspective."" That became my motto in life. I said it often, mostly because I felt those were big words and others would think I was smart. I never thought about it much later in life until I read this book. Cain talks about the virtues of being an introvert but how society has come to prize the personality traits of the extrovert. Being a pretty extreme extrovert, at first, I didn't think this book was for me. But then I thought back to when I was eight, and realized with shock and I wasn't just a person who could be both, although I was, I am, but I went from one extreme to the other. When I was a child, I was the most introverted person I know. Using the word shy to describe me didn't cut it. I would skip class altogether if I was even a minute late, to avoid the fear of having to walk into the classroom with everyone looking at me. Speeches had me thinking thoughts of jumping out of trees just to break a bone so I could get out of giving the speech. Now, I love nothing better than walking into a room full of strange people. It's just a room full of fifty new friends! And talking in front of people? I have to hold myself back in group exercises just so I don't hog the limelight. How did such a huge change occur? I'll tell you how, because of work, school, and problems socially, I was forced into it. As I began to read this book, I saw a lot of truth in what Cain was saying. Extroverts really are prized now, not just socially but in the workplace as well. At the last company I worked for, I sat in cubicles, was encouraged constantly to hold meetings and ""group think"" up ideas. How different it would have been if I was allowed even one hour a day without interruptions! What has made us so concerned with having these qualities? I am homeschooling my children and every time I come across someone who disapproves it's always because of lack of ""socialization"". My five-year-old son has no trouble talking to anyone and being friendly, I think he gets it from me. But he also loves to play by himself. He might get this from me as well! He creates his best Lego creations when left alone for hours at a time. Why is this a bad thing? As Cain points out, some of the best innovators of our time were quiet thinkers. And we might not have had some of those great inventions or works of art had these people been forced to ""socialize"" as children instead of left alone. And really, what is the big deal with needing socialization being such a big part of schooling? Why can't it be found outside of school? I recently watched a documentary about the current school systems and, as most people know, we (The United States), rank very low in all areas of education. In fact, when American children were tested in various areas against other countries of the world, we consistently ranked on the bottom in almost all areas except one. Can you guess what it is? Self-confidence. American children are said to have the highest self-confidence compared to all other countries. How do we explain this to our children? We're idiots but we have pride! Is this because we're placing such importance on making our children extroverts? Some of the case studies Cain uses to show examples of her theories kept me riveted. She also had a twenty question test in case you weren't sure where you stood. The more traits she gave as examples of introverts and extroverts, the less sure I became of which I was. Ask anyone which I was as a child, they would have said introvert, hands down. Ask anyone I know right now, and in a second they'd say extrovert. So I took her test to see where I stood. I thought I was only doubting myself, and that it would show pretty conclusively that I was an extrovert. But in fact, I was split almost exactly down the middle. I love meeting new people, and often feel energized at the end of a big party. But I also get rejuvinated from having alone time every day. Even back in college, when I was one of the most social people around, my roomates all knew that they risked certain death if they bothered me during my ""break time"". I have no problems going to movies alone, and one of my favorite things to do is go out to lunch or dinner at a nice restaurant with a good book as a dinner companion. People look at me weird, but I could care less. Whenever I go out or have a party my motto is always ""The more the merrier"". So where did I stand on this chart? The advice for public speaking for introverts wasn't going to help me. And to say I should have quit reading the book halfway through because I considered myself an extrovert would have had me missing out on some very interesting information. I really enjoyed this book. And I disagree that this book is only for introverts. I think the biggest benefit this book had for me is the eye opener to how we have been pressured to become more extroverted over the years and how we see this change everywhere, from schools, to the workplace, to advertising, to even moralistic behavior. I think all can benefit from having a greater awareness of this personality trait in everyone they know. If you're an extrovert, wouldn't it benefit you from having a better understanding to where your introverted team leader is coming from? And another realization for me, is how I know see my son, who has the tendency to play alone. I now am more aware of how I treat him, and make sure I no longer fall into that stereotypical reaction of ""Why don't you try harder to make friends?"" routine. There's nothing wrong with being an introvert, and if this book has any major theme, that's it. That being said, even though I very much enjoyed this book, I only gave it three stars for a couple of reasons. First of all, I feel like the middle of the road people such as myself were somewhat ignored. Where do we stand? How do we relate better to people and situations? Then there were the case studies. As I mentioned earlier, they were very interesting and really helped in relating to the particular example's Cain discussed. But after a while, they became tedious, and didn't hold my attention as well as the first half of the book. I still think many can benefit from reading this though. It was fun, and I look forward to discussing it with my book club.  ClassicsDefined.com"
78,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"I never really thought of myself as introverted until relatively recently, within the last year or so, when I declined an invitation to go out with a group of friends to the bar and one of them said ""Fine, be introverted then! Hope you enjoy sitting home alone with your cats!"" (She meant it in a teasing, only partially bitchy way, but I didn't take offense. I DO enjoy sitting home alone with my cats.)My semi-bitchy friend actually helped me define a big part of myself. Until then, I just thought of myself as ""the most anti-social Libra ever"", and poked fun at myself for not wanting to go out all the time, or being overwhelmed by loud, boisterous people, or needing time to just be alone - what my boyfriend calls ""cave-dwelling"". I made these things a joke because, according to society, it's not normal to want to spend so much time alone. I'm supposed to be a fun, out-going social butterfly. The thought exhausts me. So, when I read this, it was like someone opened up my head and singled out these aspects of my personality and then wrote them down. It was fascinating to read this book and learn about myself. I see things about my past in a completely new light. Like the situation above. I'd be more than happy to sit at home with a few friends and drink, but going to a bar to drink among a huge crowd just held no appeal. Or like how I approach my work. The sections of this book pertaining to corporate expectations and office structure were fascinating to me, and really allowed me to look at my job and approach to work differently. I'm a good employee and good at my job, but I don't aspire to be in the limelight. I don't MIND recognition or attention for a job well done, but it's not something I seek out. So, when I was recently offered a job with a new company, I had my choice of being in a ""client liaison"" position or a ""analysis and testing"" position, and I took the latter, even though it's a position with less recognition and lower pay. The thought of having to constantly be professionally social with strangers gives me anxiety, though, so it was a no-brainer for me. But when I discussed my decision with friends, they called me crazy to have turned down the higher paying position. As though money is the only criteria worth considering. (A point that this book makes well.)I'm going to miss the job I'm leaving though, because it did give me a kind of structured socialization. I get along great with my team, and there, I'm far more socially outgoing than I would be otherwise. I've worked with many of these people for several years, I trust and respect them, and they are people I consider real friends. Soon I'll be working 100% from home, so my social interaction will be drastically reduced. I may be introverted, but I do need that interaction. The hard part for me will be actually initiating it. I have a tendency to, uhh, forget to be social. I forget to call and text people, even though I mean to do it. But being social is just never at the forefront of my mind. I'll have to work on that. But then there's online communities, which is a completely different world. I have always been more open and (dare I say it?) chatty online than in my ""real life"" social interactions. Maybe it's the anonymity, or the fact that it's text-based, or the fact that the community I'm in here is one that is full of like-minded people with similar interests. People I can relate and talk to easily. I don't know, but I'm quite different online than off. Offline, I don't really do chit-chat, or small talk, and I'm often at a loss as to what I should say in a light social situation, despite there being 10 dozen possibilities running through my mind. I usually settle for silence, though, because by the time I've thought through a plethora of ""Nice weather"" or ""Your hair looks nice"" nothing comments, it's been an awkwardly long time, and I know it, and anything that I say at that point would just sound forced and fake, so I just... don't. That feeling that I just mentioned, about feeling forced and fake, is such a strong one for me that it sometimes overwhelms me when I really don't want it to, and it often feels to me like I come across as being cold and unfeeling when I really just don't know what to say to show how affected I really am. It was only when the book started talking about being 'sensitive' that it started to click. I've always been overly affected by emotionally charged situations. If you read some of my reviews of tear-jerker books, I mention this frequently. I remember when I was a kid, there was a show called Rescue 911 that my mom liked to watch. It was always some traumatic situation - a car wreck or an injured hiker or a woman trapped in a housefire, etc, and the show focused on the EMTs and firefighters and police called out to help. That show would always make me cry. Always. Every single episode. It didn't matter whether the people made it out OK, or if they all died, I would be in tears. I could just imagine how scary it would be and I had such respect for the kind of people who could deal with that kind of trauma every day and keep it together enough to help. It would all just overwhelm me, and I would cry. My point here, and how this relates to my last paragraph, is that my dad would often poke fun at me for getting upset over the show, and so I learned to hide that I was upset... oftentimes laughing to cover it. Laughing. As I got older into my teens, I just stopped showing that sensitivity in front of others at all, and unfortunately, that's carried over into my adult life. So now, when I feel strong emotions, it's easier for me to let them out when I'm alone, even though it makes me seem heartless to not show them when it's appropriate. Like at my grandma's funeral earlier this year, when my entire extended family was crying and talking and interacting, and I was stoically sitting in the pew, just thinking about her and how much I'll miss her. After the service, when I was alone, I completely lost my shit. I loved that woman, dammit. She was awesome.Anyway, if you're still reading, sorry for the overshare. What I'm getting at is that I loved how this book made me feel normal. It's well-researched, well-written, and engaging, and I'm incredibly glad that I read it. I think that it will... maybe not CHANGE my life, so much as improve it. I now know more about why I do certain things, and that's empowering. I can relate better to my boyfriend (an extrovert), and in my new job, and in social situations. And I can try to work on the things that I now recognize hinder me more than help me. Definitely a fascinating read. Highly recommended. "
79,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,5,"So...Just read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, (2012) by Susan Cain, Crown Publishers.I liked this book, and why not -- an in-depth defense of people like me! Although I confess, I never thought that introverts would need to be explained to extroverts. I thought we were self-evident, and it was the other, noisy, dominant half of the world that was inexplicable. (They still are.) It possibly needs a companion volume -- Noisy: the hegemony of people with nothing helpful to say who still won't shut up, or something. (Cue reality TV, talk radio, and horrible crush parties with loud music, where you couldn't hear anyone even if they were interesting.) Anyway.This made a curious juxtaposition with my last-read book Fossil Horses. MacFadden, a scientist, argued like a scientist; Cain, a lawyer, argues like a lawyer. I discern the differences even as I appreciate the advocacy. Cain develops her case through illustrative anecdotes, and references to science, psychology, and history as needed. Very readable. I confess, I hadn't thought of extroversion as the American cultural ideal, even as I have witnessed plenty of the cited behaviors. My world tends to be divided practically into ""people who read"" and ""everybody else"", which cuts unevenly across the extrovert/introvert divide, with the obvious bias.I sort of want to go out and press this book upon ""everybody else"", but one sees the inherent problem with that. I hope its message can cut through the noise somehow, nonetheless.Recommended.Ta, L."

I once again learned that every path has a value, also a quiet one and a whispering voice is not less valid, just less loud. Basically already that is more than enough to recommend it.If you consider yourself an introvert and doubt your own worth in comparison with more outgoing or established people, this is for you.If you are in any way interested in the introvert - extrovert spectrum, this will give you some very good understanding. For me the Quiet Revolution is a bit over the top, but that came after the book and doesn't make it any less valuable. "

"
82,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"I feel sure Quiet will become the benchmark book on the topic of introversion. This is because it not only thoroughly explains introversion but champions it. It’s a book by an introvert for introverts, to help them understand themselves and feel proud of who they are. It’s also a book for extroverts, but especially those extroverts who are convinced that introversion is a flaw. Cain will have them wishing they were introverts. Quiet is inarguably biased in favor of introversion, but that’s the point. Up to one-half of Americans are introverted. It’s absurd that introversion is scoffed at as much as it is. The time has come for the introverted label to be a compliment rather than a criticism. This book is a leap in that direction.Cain covered many facets of introversion, from the intriguing “highly sensitive” subset (which describes about 20% of all introverts) to differences in the Eastern and Western worlds to the introverted child (specifically in the classroom, which favors extroverts). Also explored is the age-old question of nature versus nurture and brain differences between extroverts and introverts--plus more. I greatly enjoyed the Eastern versus Western section. America, and the Western world in general, has what Cain dubs an “Extrovert Ideal.” The opposite is true in the East. Whereas in the West, introversion is viewed as a weakness to be conquered, in the East, it’s considered a strength; extroversion is frowned upon, viewed as something that must be tamed. The general sentiment is that extroverts are overwhelming people, wasting others’ time with empty chatter. It’s in this section that Cain profiled Don Chen, an Asian-American student studying at Harvard business school, a very extroverted place. He’s the embodiment of introversion and must feign extroversion daily to get through his classes and general life as part of the school. Feigning extroversion is draining, and Chen needs solitude every day to recharge. This is how it is for all introverts, and Cain stressed repeatedly that it’s not a defect, just a difference. Chen has an intimate group of friends (entirely Asian-American save for one introverted white American man). He’s keenly aware of the differences between his little group and his extroverted classmates. He notes how frequently the extroverts participate in classes while he rarely does and how boisterous they are when together in the cafeteria. Though he admires some of their qualities, he mostly doesn’t understand them. In his mind, they disrespectfully waste classmates’ and professors’ time with their talk, failing to get to the point quickly. If this section sounds borderline racist, it isn’t. Rather, it recognizes that different cultures value different qualities and is a powerful example of introversion as a desirable trait. Chen’s story is one of many in this enlightening book. To support all points, Cain profiled real people, some living, some dead (such as Rosa Parks and Dale Carnegie). The (carefully indexed) research is fascinating in itself, but the real-life examples supporting her research are vital. They round out Quiet to push it beyond dry textbook. I’d read a lot about introversion before reading Quiet, and I bypassed this book for years because others said it offers nothing new on the topic. Readers who’ve read numerous books on the topic or have researched the topic extensively may feel this way. I didn’t. In each chapter, I learned--and was utterly engrossed. Introverts will find Quiet relatable and affirming. Extroverts will find Quiet demystifies introverts thoroughly and will appreciate them more. Both will find it extremely illuminating."

The narrator was excellent.Also, it was a very interesting, insightful, informative read and of course there were lots of issues raised to which I could totally relate, even though sometimes I was a bit confused about what Susan Cain was ultimately trying to prove.I wish I could have read this book as a I teenager as well as my extrovert mother! :)I am from Central-Eastern Europe, so of course not all things ""translate"" directly into how society is working in Hungary as opposed to how things are in the US, but the personal issues are there and are quite universal."
84,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose,5,"This has been probably the one review I've been most intimidated to write for the longest time, and it's not because Susan Cain's ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" isn't a strongly asserted and powerful work. I could sing its respective praises for days. The fact of the matter is - this book really hit me at the heart of my core for so many measures in my life as an introvert. I find it hard to expound just how much this book had an impact on me personally.I could tell you about many things about my person that embody me as an introvert. That I'm quiet spoken and don't speak unless I have something important to say. That small talk isn't something I'm comfortable that I'm not fond of confrontations (though many of you have read my extended written rants about various matters of controversy with very little hesitation). That I tend to spend time alone to recharge my batteries even when I'm called to do things in any scale of extroversion. That my emotional intelligence is very high and I can sympathize/emphathize with people for matters of their experience (though this also makes me highly sensitive).For most of my life, I've been told that these very natural matters of my disposition were wrong. And goodness forbid did that make my life complicated because I didn't feel like people understood who I was. I was even led to believe that I was actually shy, not introverted (many people confuse the two, there is a difference.) Yet the more I learned about the dynamic of introversion and extroversion and how they functioned, I realized that the fundamental difference between them were the derived sources of energy that one functions with in day to day living. That there's nothing wrong with being introverted versus extroverted in a society that - in mainstream notations, champions the latter.This book had me thinking for days after I finished it.I liked that Cain's narrative focuses on the positive contributions and the inherent strengths that lie in introversion because it's widely stereotyped. That stereotyping actually harms our society more than we ourselves may realize in the daily grind, not just individually. By trying to mold people into one acceptable standard, we often lose out on what unique strengths and contributions one may have from going away from such a standard. Narratives like ""Quiet"" have relevance not just in recognizing the distinct psychological functions and differences we have as individuals, but also in the relationships and contributions we have in our professions, our activities, and even wider perceptions of our society in general.I appreciated the expansion on famous figures like Rosa Parks in terms of her backstory and identity as an introvert and how that shaped her responses (I'll have to pick up ""Quiet Strength"" at some point). I also appreciated hearing Cain's own struggles with coming to terms with her introversion, and even the story of the Harvard Business student. There are so many individual stories in this narrative and Cain gives a thorough examination of the details within. It's amazing just how much work and thought went into expounding these issues and individual narratives. This narrative examines introversion not only as a social construct, but individual - delving into narratives of biological, psychological, and sociological importance. There's an examination on the level of intorversion among different cultures, how introspection is valuable to creativity versus ""groupthink"", how extroversion and introversion are not mutually exclusive (and situations that call for each). I came out of it all with not only a fresh perspective on how valuable introverts are to the fabric of society, but also a greater sense of self-worth for my own traits. And that's something to be thankful for. My hope is that with more people who pick up ""Quiet"" and realize how important our individual attributes are, that it'll provide for more opportunities to be creative and to value each other in our relationships regardless of differences, for our unique strengths regardless of how their expressed or from where they come.Overall score: 5/5 stars"

My credentials include cheerfully working from home, getting overstimulated in quiet libraries, and keeping in touch with my closest friends almost entirely by snail mail. I have been known to feel oversocialised sitting in a darkened room, listening to people two rooms away watch a film.As far as a lot of media is concerned, I may as well be a pet hamster. ""Care for your introvert."" Try not to interrupt them. Don't go in their nest while they're sleeping. Offer them a way out when you're at a party, in case they run out of carrot sticks and want to go home. I may as well also be a complete rarity: a third of people don't get hissy when you take their carrot sticks away; come the fuck on.So, what I liked about Quiet was that it didn't make me feel like a special snowflake or someone's hamster.But also... the section on introversion in leadership and the workplace has actually boosted my confidence a lot (apart from being really interesting). I've worked for a few people, and the times it's worked best have been the times where they give me a broad, bullet-pointed list of what they want to have happened by what time, and then they go away until that time. The best boss I ever had used to say it was a good day if we never spoke to each other except when one of us brought the other coffee - and I was inclined to agree with him. Faced with common-sense-logic, which seems to say that 5000 feedback sessions and an open-plan office with communal ball-pit are what millennials are looking for, I wanted this narrative. It was useful to hear. Maybe it's less useful if you're the sort of person who's been reading this sort of thing for years. For me, it was a helpful reminder.I remember a little interesting neurological detail, but not a lot - I can get more than that keyword-searching the Scientific American website, if I want to - and a fair bit of interesting historical anecdote. I remember coming away with a renewed respect for anyone who parents, especially by themselves, as well as a sense of purpose about working for myself and by myself - which I'm happy to say I'm now doing. It turns out, a lot of the time, that people who contract you for work over the internet don't really give a shit about your sparkling and gracious personality. They just want to know you're conscientious and you know what you're talking about and you'll do things when you say you will. I vaguely credit Susan Cain with giving me the impetus to go and do what I want to do, and not to feel like I have to be constantly nice to people I don't know. Now I just think, it's okay, I have character, and then put my headphones back in."
86,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5524572-kristin-hackett-superspacechick,4,"As a self proclaimed introvert, I've been meaning to read this book for so long. My sister in law gave me a copy for Christmas so I prioritized it as a January read and I'm so glad I did. I really enjoyed the in depth look at what constitutes an introvert vs. an extrovert. Quiet even redefined the meaning of the word sensitive for me. I've never considered myself sensitive before but to pull a quote, ""highly sensitive people tend to be keen observers who look before they leap. They arrange their lives in ways that limit surprises. They’re often sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, pain, coffee... Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments—both physical and emotional—unusually deeply. They tend to notice subtleties that others miss—another person’s shift in mood, say, or a lightbulb burning a touch too brightly.""- this is 100% spot on for me. While I do agree with a lot of what Susan Cain wrote, I do think it's difficult to classify people into only one of two categories. She did stress that just because someone is an introvert, it doesn't mean that 1) they got there the same way as someone else or 2) that both people will have exactly the same traits. There are still variables to consider. Overall, I loved that Quiet is a celebrated look at introversion and the strengths that those with introverted qualities possess. There were a few anecdotes that weren't the most interesting (or relevant like the chapter on raising children), but I still found value in reading them. "

She has helped me understand myself more and I am glad of that. Introverts don't like novelty and the first day of school is usually traumatic as mine was. As children, introverts like to daydream, play inside and their feelings are easily hurt. ""They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. . ."" They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy and fear.""

88,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,2,"Why is it that the “ideal” person is extroverted? That we pride social skills and being outgoing? All while a deeply gifted thinker who prefers to be in his/her head is described as lacking these traits. Looking at it from an evolutionary standpoint, there is a reason why introverts exist, so why do we rate it as second best? Being a true-blue introvert, I turned to Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a world that can’t stop talking” to answer these questions (and maybe propose new ones). Susan Cain divides “Quiet” into four main sections with the first focusing on the history and description of the rise of extroverts, the differences in leadership styles of introverts and extroverts, and the myths surrounding them. This section begins “Quiet” with a slow and unmemorable beginning. Cain focuses more of an effort on real-life case studies versus actual scientific studies, bypassing any professional data or even her own opinions. The studies which are mentioned are not “earth-shattering” in depth nor do they truly correlate to her hypothesis. In fact, much of the hypothesis is lost and the flow is not seamless or clear. On one hand, this makes the reading understandable and accessible for the less scientifically-inclined reader, but to others craving more research; Cain leaves something to be desired. Some of Cain’s examples which could be perceived as “witty” (Craig Newark of Craigslist fame, Dr. Suess, and Moses from the Bible) are underdeveloped and also lose connection with the hypothesis. Cain is often abrupt and cuts herself short. Furthermore, many of the chapters begin in the same exact way (both format and creativity) which is tedious and creates a loss of interest. The second section of “Quiet” describes some of the brain and neurological aspects of introverts featuring more science than the first section. Cain’s work is a bit more compelling in this respect and certainly more interesting. However, it still isn’t clear what she is trying to prove as she mostly just describes how introverts “are”. Plus, most of the findings are self-explanatory and even obvious. Again, the reader will not be blown away. I have read MANY “brain books” (psychology/neurology, science, and biology) and generally, I am left both flabbergasted and repeating information I’ve read to anyone who will listen. This was not the case with “Quiet” as only a small dose of information felt standout. As the second portion progresses, Cain does present tests and experimentation results more confidentially (however, there is a lack of elaboration). The third section of “Quiet” is comparatively shorter, as Cain explains the conformities and values of the Asian cultures while in the fourth section, Cain offers tips and lifestyle adaptations for introverts in various areas such as work, romance, parenting, play, etc. At this point, “Quiet” appears to be more of a self-help book. The latter end of the book is overly focused on parenting and schooling of children causing me to feel alienated and distanced (having no children). Furthermore, the “Conclusion” is weak and sums up the book which actually reinforces how few points are made. Simply, “Quiet"" is not what I expected. Instead of explaining “why” introverts are the way they are; Cain described “how” they are with an absence of data I would have preferred. All in all though, it has been confirmed (which I already knew) that I am indeed an introvert."
89,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A lance is broken for the needs of introverted people Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Whether one opposes the sanguine with the phlegmatic nature, the wild daredevil the thoughtful inventor or merely the introversion the extroversion, the temperament is and remains in specific proportions decisive for a human being. The author has re-examined this fact with an unconventional approach, opening up exciting and critical viewing angles. Times are changing. In the 19th century, it was still commonplace to be modest, humble and unobtrusive. Starting from the advertising industry in the 1920s and 1930s, it continued to run to the idealistic goal of total superficiality. Ads began to play with people's fear of the negative connotations of ominous, alien observers, and the appearance and ability to attract more and more attention. The new religion of narcissism was supported by an entrepreneurial mentality that understood handshaking qualities, dazzling rhetoric, and slick eloquence as signs of business qualification.Thus, when the loudest and most risk-taking specimens of the managerial species, elite colleges that encourage elbow mentality-driven, superficial behavior, occupy key positions, one or the other financial market collapse is no longer surprising. The flowers of this development on the example of today's America could seem bizarre if the consequences were not so serious. Thus, adjectives such as shy and quiet or just hints of a sly-boy mentality are dismissed as entirely negative and peculiar. Whether in school, work or private life, who does not understand playing on the highly sophisticated keyboard of interpersonal communication, quickly falls through the typical rust. Sensitive children, even as babies, are prone to intensified reactions to external stimuli, are more empathetic and need seeming timidity as a protective mechanism against a formally overwhelming universe. At the same time, individuals naturally endowed with a more robust psychic scaffolding sound lighthearted, but also more emotionless, to their surroundings.Parents of quieter, a manageable circle of friends their naming and lonely hobbies devoted children are remembered, not only subtle, the importance of popularity and dazzling charm. However, very peculiar that silent children are put under depression or misanthropic suspicion, while too vital, joyful young people are sedated with Ritalin. If the favors of loneliness have been well into adulthood, there is a wide range of seminars that can enhance eloquence, demeanor, and be talking skills to the point of sales genius. Several relationship problems are likely based on the well measurable differences between different natures, even by MRI. While extroverts can bathe in crowds every awaken minute and shy away from loneliness, the relationship is reversed by introverts. This involves interpersonal explosives in itself when the mantra of the attractive opposites once no longer pulls, and the supposed truce of the relationship beginning is over. Additional spontaneous emotional responses provoke the fact that extroverts interpret specific aggressive behavior as interest and attention while introverts feel injured and attacked. Assessing the damage caused to the economy by incorrectly designing work processes and their surroundings is difficult or even impossible. If one adds the increased disinclination of introverts in a loud open-plan atmosphere, including the wasted potential, because gifted thinkers find no peace to work out ideas and concepts undisturbed, the overall economic damage can be immense. The cultural differences show a contrarian approach of the Asians, where a European-American behavior style is considered a stupid waste of time for listeners. Tranquility and contemplation have a different meaning, superficiality and the glorification of narcissistic principles are considered less desirable. Another, quite thoughtful approach.Eine Lanze gebrochen für die Bedürfnisse der introvertierten MenschenansammlungsvermeiderOb man dem sanguinischen das phlegmatische Naturell entgegenstellt, dem wilden Draufgänger den nachdenklichen Tüftler oder schlicht der Introvertiertheit die Extrovertiertheit, das Temperament ist und bleibt zu bestimmten Anteilen maßgebend für einen Menschen. Die Autorin hat diesen Umstand mit einer unkonventionellen Herangehensweise neu beleuchtet und damit interessante und kritische Betrachtungswinkel eröffnet.So ändern sich die Zeiten. War es im 19 Jahrhundert noch gang und gäbe, bescheiden, demütig und unaufdringlich zu sein, begann, ausgehend von der Werbeindustrie, in den 1920er und 1930er Jahren, ein bis heute andauernder Lauf auf das ideelle Ziel der totalen Oberflächlichkeit. Anzeigen begannen mit der Angst der Menschen vor negativen Assoziationen ominöser, fremder Beobachter zu spielen und das Äußere sowie die Fähigkeit zu gefallen, immer mehr ins Rampenlicht zu rücken. Unterstützung fand die neue Religion des Narzissmus von einer Unternehmermentalität, die Handschlagqualitäten, blendende Rhetorik und aalglatte Eloquenz als Zeichen betriebswirtschaftlicher Qualifikation auffasste. Wenn auf diese Weise immer die lautesten und risikofreudigsten Exemplare der Managerspezies, von zu ellbogenmentalitätsgesteuerten, oberflächlichen Verhalten animierenden Elitehochschulen, Schlüsselpositionen besetzen, verwundert der eine oder andere Finanzmarktkollaps gar nicht mehr.Die Blüten dieser Entwicklung am Beispiel des heutigen Amerikas könnten skurril anmuten, wären die daraus resultierenden Konsequenzen nicht derart gravierend. So werden Adjektive wie schüchtern und ruhig oder nur Andeutungen einer Eigenbrötlermentalität als durchwegs negativ und absonderlich abgetan. Sei es in Schule, Beruf oder Privatleben, wer nicht versteht auf der hochkomplexen Klaviatur zwischenmenschlicher Kommunikation zu spielen, fällt leicht einmal durch den sozialen Rost.Sensible Kinder neigen schon als Babys zu verstärkten Reaktionen auf äußere Reize, sind einfühlsamer und benötigen die scheinbare Furchtsamkeit als Schutzmechanismus gegen ein sie mit Eindrücken förmlich erschlagendes Universum. Gleichzeitig wirken von Natur aus mit einem robusteren psychischen Gerüst ausgestattete Individuen unbeschwerter, aber auch emotionsloser auf ihre Umgebung. Eltern ruhiger, einen überschaubaren Freundeskreis ihr Eigen nennender und sich einsamen Hobbies widmender Kinder werden, nicht nur durch die Blume, an die Wichtigkeit von Beliebtheit und blendendem Charme erinnert. Doch sehr eigentümlich, dass stille Kinder unter Depressions- oder Misanthropiegeneralverdacht gestellt werden, während allzu vitale, lebensfrohe junge Menschen mit Ritalin sediert werden.Sollte sich die Favorisierung der Einsamkeit bis ins Erwachsenenalter durchgeschlagen haben, gibt es eine breite Palette an Seminarangeboten, die Beredsamkeit, Auftreten und Plauschkompetenzen bis hin zum Verkaufsgenie steigern können. Etliche Beziehungsprobleme dürften auf den, auch per MRT gut messbaren Unterschieden zwischen verschiedenen Naturellen basieren. Während Extrovertierte jede wache Minute in Menschenmengen baden könnten und Einsamkeit scheuen, kehrt sich das Verhältnis bei Introvertierten um. Das birgt zwischenmenschlichen Sprengstoff in sich, wenn das Mantra von den sich anziehenden Gegensätzen einmal nicht mehr richtig zieht und der vermeintliche Waffenstillstand des Beziehungsbeginns vorüber ist. Zusätzliche spontane emotionale Reaktionen provoziert die Tatsache, dass Extrovertierte bestimmtes, aggressives Verhalten als Interesse und Aufmerksamkeit interpretieren, während Introvertierte sich verletzt und angegriffen fühlen.Den für die Wirtschaft entstandenen Schaden durch falsche Konzeption von Arbeitsabläufen samt deren Umgebungen einzuschätzen mutet schwer bis unmöglich an. Wenn man die verstärkte Krankheitsneigung Introvertierter in lauter Großraumbüroatmosphäre inklusive dem verschwendeten Potential, weil begnadete Denker keine Ruhe finden, um Ideen und Konzepte ungestört ausarbeiten zu können, addiert, dürfte der gesamtvolkswirtschaftliche Schaden immens sein.Die kulturellen Unterschiede zeigen eine konträre Herangehensweise der Asiaten, bei denen ein europäisch-amerikanisches Gebaren als unhöfliche Verschwendung der Zeit von Zuhörern gewertet wird. Ruhe und Kontemplation haben eine andere Bedeutung, Oberflächlichkeit und die Verherrlichung narzisstischer Prinzipien gelten als wenig erstrebenswert. Ein anderer, durchaus in Erwägung zu ziehender Ansatz."
90,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3621230-angie,5,"A must read for everyone, not just introverts. Susan Cain, former Wall Street lawyer and self-described introvert, investigates how introversion has become dangerously scorned in the current American ""Culture of Personality."" I had not fully realized how drastically our cultural values have shifted--and how much American society pushes us to conform--until reading Cain's book. To prove her point, Cain visits American bastions of extroversion promotion, including Harvard Business School, Saddleback Church, Dale Carnegie, Wall Street, and Tony Robbins conferences. She talks with pioneering psychologists and neurologists to explain the studies behind concepts like the dangers of group think, the ability to delay gratification, or the trait called sensitivity. She profiles famous and less-well known introverts to show how the studies play out in real life.Though the many of the activities I'm drawn to (and the things that cause anxiety) scream classic introvert, I have always considered myself an extrovert and frequently put myself in situations where extroverted behavior is valued. However, since quitting my job and globe-hopping for the past two years, I've been surprised (and disappointed) by how often the constant stimulation, new people, and change can drain me--and by how I often feel an overwhelming need for alone time.I found myself relating to many of the points Cain discusses and have since concluded that I'm much more of an introvert than I had thought. (I promise that this isn't just because she does a good job of highlighting all the positive things about introverts!)So for that, I am grateful to have read Quiet, though I can't quite believe it took reading a book to figure that out about myself! I am seeing my preferences in a new light and have much understanding and acceptance regarding the things that interest me (and those that cause me stress). I've been having trouble narrowing down 'what I want to do with my life' and this book has helped me more than any other, because I finally feel like I can accept that the things I really enjoy are just a part of me and can't be ignored. Though the personal application will differ, I suspect many people will come away having learned much more than they expected, if not about themselves, then about people close to them. I had always thought of extroverts and introverts as being on distinct sides of a line, when in fact it's much more of a sliding scale (or perhaps better as two scales: percentage introversion, percentage extroversion). Because we have been culturally pressured and trained to admire extroverted behavior, many of us may be dangerously ignoring our introverted characteristics. This was a game-changing book for me, and I suspect it will be eye-opening to most people who read it."

But I also enjoy giving presentations at school, tutoring peers in writing, and interacting with various people online and in real life. I'd describe myself as an introvert (and my Meyers-Briggs personality type agrees), though both introverts and extroverts would enjoy this fascinating book by Susan Cain. She provides an intriguing, in-depth perspective on introversion, its connotation in contrasting cultures, and the psychology behind it.A profusion of the nonfiction I've read has contained too much of something - too many random anecdotes, too much scientific jargon, too many unnecessary statistics or explanations. But Quiet has the perfect blend of personal anecdotes, interesting analysis, detailed explanations, and compelling statistics. Cain references various studies conducted by psychologists and discusses several aspects related to introversion, such as the extrovert ideal, how extroverts and introverts can compliment each other and work together, nature v. nature, etc. Here's one passage about sensitive people (who tend to be more introverted) that struck a chord with me:""The other thing Aron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they're highly empathic. It's as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people's emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world. They tend to have unusually strong consciences. They avoid violent movies and TV shows; they're acutely aware of the consequences of a lapse in their own behavior. In social settings they often focus on subjects like personal problems, which others consider 'too heavy'.""I guess I have an excuse for exposing so much of myself on my blog, huh? Anyway, Cain delves into other subjects that are intellectually stimulating too, such as the three things she thinks are important in identifying one's personal project. She even brings up the relationship between Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other famous historical figures.Overall, highly recommended to everyone curious about their own temperaments and how to embrace their natural personalities. One of the best works of nonfiction I've read.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

It's perhaps not a surprise that Susan Cain, the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking identifies herself as an introvert. Being quiet, introverted or shy is still seen by many as a problem or handicap to overcome so I can see her motivation for writing it.One this book's premises is that in the last 50 years or so, the Western world moved from a culture of character to a culture of personality, which according to the author has given an advantage to people that enjoyed outgoing, uninhibited personalities. We tend to admire and reward people that exhibit the most gregarious, outgoing traits of extroverts while at the same time undermined and misunderstand those that are most typically seen in more introverted individuals.
Introversion is really about having a preference for lower stimulation environments. So it's just a preference for quiet, for less noise, for less action. Whereas extroverts really crave more stimulation in order to feel at their best.
The author explains that Introversion is a spectrum, and that most of us don't fully fit into an introvert/extrovert definition. It also provides a sort of ""survival guide"" for introverts to help us learn how to better deal with the pressures of living in a world that for the most part rewards those that are extroverts.
Many people believe that introversion is about being antisocial, and that's really a misperception. Because actually it's just that introverts are differently social. So they would prefer to have a glass of wine with a close friend as opposed to going to a loud party full of strangers.
This book helped me understand myself better, identify those traits that makes many of us ""introverts"" different and learn how to use them to our advantage, both on our professional and personal lives. The book is entertaining and well written. If you are interested in learning about introverts, perhaps because you feel like one or someone closed to you does, this book might be of interest to you.After reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking my conclusion is that the world needs both extroverts and introverts and that we all have a role to play.Here's a link to the author's TED TALK which is sort a summarized version of the book:http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_t..."

And the whole idea about needing time out to recover from socialising - I always thought I was just a bit odd, haha.The criticisms that are quite rightly levelled at this book about preaching some kind of binarism between extrovert and introvert are understandable, and am I'm sure that we are all a little too complex for a poorly designed set of questions to provide any sort of sensible analysis or categorisation (would still like to see the questions though...) Most people will be surely be somewhere close to 'ambivert' even if they know themselves to be introverted at heart. For me a major part of young socialisation and growing up was learning to act like an extrovert, if nothing else just to stop people trying to 'bring me out of my shell' or constantly asking what's up as I am 'being quiet'."
95,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena,4,"I really liked this book, especially the beginning part. I so needed to read it. For years people have been telling me to come out of my shell and to be more outgoing and I realized I had definitely playing the role of pseudo-extrovert all this time! I enjoyed reading the fact that we introverts actually have power and hidden strengths. The list of famous introverts surprised me, Rosa Parks, Al Gore and Gandhi in particular. The book also shared some insight into the thinking patterns of extroverts. All in all, it was an interesting book though the end did drag on a bit."
96,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2765658-steve-walker,4,"I was able to obtain a pre-pub reader's copy of Susan Cain's new book.This is a useful book for the introvert forced to be in the public eye.By public eye I mean more than 1 or 2 people. I, as an introvert, gained a better understanding of why I am the way I am. Most introverts will find helpful tips and info on dealing with work and daily matters. Now if I could only have enough money to move away and live in seclusion. ;-)"
97,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5470914-sam,1,"This was the most painful book I have read this summer. I choked it down like bad medicine page after page. Quiet is great self affirmation for someone who considers themselves an introvert, and sees humans as either an extrovert or introvert. Cain certainly thinks she’s the poster child of an introvert, or is she? The book reads like a memoir in parts where she tells stories of her own life, then there are smatterings or small examples in specific parts of people’s lives of how greatness comes in quiet e.g. Steve Wozniak, Gandhi, Rosa Parks. Cain also fancies herself a bit of a child psychologist, on one hand it’s ok for kids to be shy or in their shell, these aren’t bad things, and very normal, but on the other hand we need to nudge and push slowly to get kids out of their quiet place. So which is it?It doesn’t bother me that Cain isn’t a psychologist or economist, but she’s talking through both sides of her mouth, the book is a pity party, she thinks the decisions in modern workplaces are influenced by highly extroverted personalities like those from the Harvard Business School. There’s no backing for this other than the fact that business students are extroverts. Additionally the economic crisis was wholly the fault of extroverts, basically extroverts with their loud voices overpowered the brilliant quiet hardworking, and smart introverts and ran the economy to the ground. I’m afraid you really aren’t brilliant if something has already happened and you didn’t do anything to stop it. In hindsight everything is 20/20, just because you are quiet and something bad is happening saying “I knew it!” doesn’t do much. The circlejerk continues when Cain bangs on about everyone who a douche as being an extrovert. Good guys are introverts, Warren Buffet because of his one speech about the dot com bubble bursting was quiet and well calculated in his words. The rest of the word are greedy businessmen. There’s some sample or thin slicing in her discussions that I find problematic, and read a bit like a tabloid. Susan Cain is clearly appealing to an audience that is already sold to introversion, and stroking those egos. I wish the book had more solutions instead of harping about how bad people are. The book blurs it’s lines through many genres, self help, psychology and a dash of group-think. I consider myself an introvert, but also an extrovert, yes I do believe brilliance happens in unaccompanied activities like running. I charge my batteries during times like this but I also don’t “suffer in silence”. I don’t believe people are fully introverted or extroverted. Reading Khaneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and Mcgonigal’s Willpower Instinct make Cain’s book look hurriedly and thoughtlessly written, there’s little appeal to science. "
98,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,3,"I expected to love, love, love this book. After all, psychology is one of my passions. Also, I am always interested in hearing from some group. And this is saying, ""We, the introverts, are speaking out.""However, the book was neither as powerful nor as interesting as I was hoping....Cain does a great job of blending together different aspects. The three main angles she uses are:1.) Famous people who were introverts. She usually starts her chapters with a story about a wonderful famous person we all know and adore - and then explaining how they were introverted. Rosa Parks, Dale Carnegie, and Eleanor Roosevelt are some of the examples she used.2.) Case studies. This is the real life introvert ""Jane Doe."" She was on this job and thought she would have to quit because she just wasn't outgoing enough. Then she learned that being an introvert was like having a secret superpower! And then she used her introversion to overcome all obstacles! Now she's rich and/or happy. Success!3.) Science - hard and soft. Cain uses both psychology and biology to try and explain the differences between extroverts and introverts. She also explains why introversion might be valuable in evolution and natural selection. She has a fascinating chapter on culture, which emphasizes that although extroversion is worshiped in the USA, many Asian countries value silence, reflection, and understanding over cheerfulness, enthusiasm, and talkativeness. ...This book is at it's best when Cain is exploring how introversion is a valuable and worthy trait or way of being. When she journeys into different places to see how introversion is treated differently there. When she explores how introversion can be a survival aid in the wild and how introverted people can be powerful in their own way.It's exciting and interesting to realize that extroversion - while venerated in America - is actually seen as crass and dumb in many Asian cultures.And it's fun and cool to see different theories of how introverted people and animals are strong in Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection. I liked seeing different species and the benefits and drawbacks they experience from being extroverted or introverted. And I enjoyed seeing how introversion could be a kick-butt evolutionary trait which is often overlooked or thought to be something that needed 'killing off.'I thought about 2/3 of the book were weak, though. For instance, I already know enough about famous figures and do not particularly want or need to read a short biography or story about them. Another thing that bugged me were her ""real life introversion stories."" Here is how an introvert struggled. Here is how he learned to embrace his true self and be happy/rich.The whole book just felt like a big pat on the back. ""Don't worry, introverts, you're okay! Everything's okay! It might seem like the world hates you, but use your strengths! You are really amazing.""And it's not even like I DISAGREE with this message, it's simply that I was expecting more than a rather thinly-veiled self-help book. P.S. I really like the page or two that Cain dedicates to exploring Moses (an alleged introvert) and Aaron (his extroverted mouthpiece). It is also interesting when she lightly touches on whether or not the Church and modern-day Protestants shun and punish introverts as not doing the Lord's work. I like when she questions whether Jesus was an introvert or extrovert (covered in one paragraph, very shallow) and questions whether the Church is pushing an incorrect message on it's followers. (""Real Christians proselytize! How can you be a REAL Christian if you are not gregarious?"") I also like when she uses the teachings and life of Gandhi to emphasize that passivity is NOT submissiveness. All these subjects were things I wished she'd explored in greater depth."
99,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light,5,"Eye-opener. Astounding. Life-changing. Inspirational. Insightful. All these adjectives and more describe my experience with this amazing book.I'm very much an introvert. I try to avoid social functions as much as possible, but I do love meeting every so often with my dear friends one-on-one. If I do end up at a party, you can bet I'm the one keeping the corner warm. I am an avid reader, a knitter, a sometimes writer, a nerd, and an engineer. My idea of a perfect evening is one spent in the comfort of my apartment, cat in lap, book in hand, coffee at my side. My idea of a perfect vacation is one where I can go to my favorite coffee shop and read. In college, my favorite classes were Differential Equations (in which I, the only female, got a perfect score on the final), Physics, and Fluids. Ever since elementary school, I dreaded a school performances, such as Christmas programs or poetry recitals. At work meetings, I am more likely to listen to everything and be note-taker than I am to present or volunteer ideas.Lately, my boss has said that I need to step things up, become more ""out there"" and confident. Inwardly, I despaired. Wasn't I working hard enough? What was holding me back? Why couldn't I just blurt things out in meetings? Why did I constantly sound nervous, even if I really wasn't? Was there any hope for me to change?And then, like a sign from heaven, I saw this book in the ""New Books"" display at Barnes and Nobles (BTW, I happen to swing by the bookstore at least once a week during lunch - sometimes to purchase, but mostly to pass the time). I remembered a friend had read this and really enjoyed it, and I figured it would help me figure out myself.""Figure myself out"" would be an understatement; it's as if this book were written specifically for me! Cain breaks down what it means to be an introvert. Turns out despite what my sister is constantly telling me, I'm not weird (alright, not too weird). I have talents and skills. I have a place. And it's not my fault I can't always speak up and make my voice heard. A lot of it is because of how our workforce, our employers, our coworkers, our society functions. Our biology, our parents, our surroundings make us the introverted beings we are. It's just that school and work and the outside world try to tell us that being quiet, that listening and ruminating over things is wrong, that we should be quick to speak and blurt whatever is on our mind.I've known I was an introvert for a while, but it was so refreshing and liberating to learn that there were others with my ""problem"". That I wasn't alone. And, most importantly, I can overcome, nay thrive, in this Extroverted world. And that is the second gift Cain gives us in this book: how to be an Introvert in an Extrovert world and not want to choke yourself at night.I feel like, after reading Quiet, I have a plan for facing my ""work problems"". I feel like I can take the challenge my boss has placed in front of me and succeed. Although a part of me still wishes I could crawl back to my desk and burrow there, I think this book has given me the tools and encouragement I need to speak up.If you are an introvert, you definitely need to read this book. Even if you aren't an introvert, this is a great book to understanding how they think and act. I'm definitely passing this along to everyone I know."
100,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Years ago, my division manager at work had everybody in the division take the Meyer Briggs personality test. Then we spent time in a workshop, to understand the implications of our personality types. One of the dimensions of the test is extroversion/introversion (E or I types). This book offers a very satisfying account of what it means to be an introvert. Generally Western cultures admire extroverts, while Asian cultures admire introverts. Both types of personalities offer value to society. Groups of people who are introverts are best with an extroverted leader, while groups of extroverts are best with an introverted leader.Many introverts find it difficult to live in a society that values extroversion more highly. As a result, many introverts pretend to be extroverts in certain social situations. But they cannot maintain this pretension indefinitely, and at some point in time they must ""recharge"" their internal batteries with quiet and solitude. The book makes a major point here: It's perfectly OK to pretend to be an extrovert for periods of time--as long as you do this while you are working at something that you truly love.The book has useful practical advice for introverts. If you are an introvert and your husband or wife is an extrovert, there is much to be said about how to maintain or improve your relationship. If you are raising a child who is an introvert, it is important to understand how to encourage the child to follow his/her innate abilities.Back in the 1940's and 1950's, Alex Osborn was plagued by the lack of creativity in his advertising agency. So, he wrote some books introducing the concept of ""brainstorming"". The idea is for people get together in groups and toss out ideas without fear of ridicule--the more ideas, the better. The problem is, in the 1960's, studies showed that brainstorming is not efficient; you can get more, good ideas if people simply think creatively in solitude. Committees simply are not as productive as the sum of individuals working alone. We are so inculcated with the idea that brainstorming is best--but this is really just a reflection of the dominance of extroversion in our society. "
101,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4811203-emily-b,3,"As an introvert and psychology graduate this was an interesting read however it was not what I was expecting. I felt like it wasn’t as accessible as it could have been. It seems very focused on introverts in or who wish to be in very high powered job roles. Which isn’t my world. I was hoping for a bit more knowledge or ‘self help’ regarding being an introvert in an average every day life, Not as an award winning introverted lecturer, or an introverted Lawyer or CEO."
102,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"It is stated at the start that this book’s purpose is to improve a reader's relationship with others. The book can thus be viewed as a book of the self-help genre. Its aim is to advise introverts on ways by which they can improve their relationships with extroverts, and vice versa. It compares behavioral traits of both introverts and extroverts, showing in what ways they are similar and how they differ. The author mentions books about and summarizes studies related to extroversion and introversion, conducted over the years and up to today. The book begins with a quick test by which readers can determine where they stand on the introvert / extrovert scale. The test takes only a few minutes and gives the reader an immediate connection with the topics to be discussed. Both my husband and I took the test. We both received the same score, indicating that we are both strong introverts. It is interesting to note that although we had the same score, we did not answer all questions in the same way. This led to a lively discussion and a fun start to the book! Twenty questions are to be answered with a yes or a no. The book demonstrates clearly that in America it is the extroverts that hold sway--in the government, in business and in most educational institutions. It is an important and valuable statement that is being made. This is often to the detriment of introverts and to society as a whole. While the author professes the importance and value of both the introvert and the extrovert way of thinking, given the suppression of introverts in society today, it is introverts she lauds most, giving example after example of their accomplishments. I didn’t need to be convinced. For me, it is OBVIOUS that society benefits from the presence of both. The book verges on becoming a manifesto for introverts. This appeals to me no more than society's pronounced favoritism of extroverts! The book accomplishes well what it has set out to do, but I am rarely enthused by books of the self-help genre. It does advise readers on how their relationships can be improved. It also explains how schools can be adapted to better suit the needs of introverts, without hampering the situation for extroverts. I do however find much of the advice given as being rather obvious. The sections I like most are those that are scientifically oriented. I like for example the parts about how the brain functions; sections about the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex and the connection to dopamine are interesting. Many studies are referred to, but how exactly each was performed is skimmed over in too brief a manner. We are told what the results have for implications, but skeptic that I am, I was not always convinced! I need more details. To add depth, opposing points of view should have been added. Intuitively, I agree with the conclusions drawn, but I would have preferred more solid proof. Too many generalizations/simplifications are made. Over and over again we are told that so and so was an introvert and so and so an extrovert. This is all too simple! Individuals are mixes of introvert and extrovert qualities. Instead, an analysis of the tangled mix of traits that make up real people is what I was looking for. At one point Moses is classified as an introvert! This was just too much for me. The author swiftly classifies famous people as being either introvert or extrovert with little analysis of their specific character traits. I find this too categorical. We are told that Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, would never have written the books she wrote and become the ""bold thinker"" that she became had she not been left alone to read books in her youth. Where is the proof in that?! The author generalizes and simplifies all too often. The book is directed primarily toward Americans. I do not appreciate this slant. There is only a brief discussion of Asian American immigrants. Asian Americans of Chinese background are classified as introverts. Europeans are in a bunch grouped with Americans. I would have preferred a more in-depth, nuanced analysis of national and cultural differences.I wish the book had been more globally and more scientifically oriented. It has too many generalizations. It is basically a self-help book, a genre that does not appeal to me, so I guess it is not so bad that I nevertheless felt it to be worth reading. I would have preferred more in-depth analyses concerning how individuals are complicated mixes of introversion and extroversion. We are not one or the other, as was so often stated in reference to the people mentioned. The narration of the audiobook by Kathe Mazur started out very fast, but eventually she slows down. Her rapid speed had me chuckling at the beginning. Why? Because it is the extroverts, not us introverts that talk fast! Didn’t the producers of the audiobook realize the incongruity?! We introverts need time to stop and think and time to examine the ideas floating around in our heads. The narration is easy to follow once Mazur has slowed down. She has a soft, pleasant voice, a perfect match for introverts, the central protagonists of the book. The question is how many extroverts read this book. It is interesting to think about why this may be so."
103,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,5,"This book is very insightful and informative. I watched Susan Cain's TED talk once and I was fascinated being an introvert myself. As a kid I was shy, serious, studious with a little bit of social anxiety and although as I grew up, I outgrew my shyness and got more confident socially, there have been many situations where I questioned myself. Once when I was out on a trip with a big group of college friends, everyone was getting along so well and they seemed to be having so much fun together but I felt so lonely and left out and I was like, ''What's wrong with me''? Turns out I'm just an introvert. Then, I found this book. It describes in detail what introversion and extroversion is and what are the traits associated with both personalities. Where in most areas (or cultures), the introversion or shyness is viewed in a negative light, the writer states that it's an essential trait and how powerful it could be and it should be valued just as extroversion is. I found this book very interesting to read because she presents her ideas by using data gathered from case studies, research and her own personal experiences and from other people. She has also provided analysis of many famous personalities and how their temperaments shaped their actions and how essential their role was. Many definitions are provided for introversion-extroversion and how our genes and our environment play a role in shaping our personalities. There is no personality type better than the other but creating a balance is very important to bring out the best in both. The message in short is- value your individuality and do things the way you want and not because you have to conform to certain cultural norms. It also tells how both personalities can strike a balance between both traits. Also, both extroverts and introverts can lead a fulfilling life without changing their core values or trying to be someone they are not, the power lies in knowing who you are, what your abilities are and using them to the best.After reading this book, I feel like I can understand myself a little better now, what my motivations are and what makes me the way I am. I recommend this book to both introverts and extroverts as it can help them understand the qualities in themselves and in each other."
104,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2598642-catelyn-may,4,"I loved this book. As an introvert, I felt like someone was finally telling my side of the story, and understanding my life in general. Definitely going to loan it to some extroverted family members. "
105,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1230817-lori,5,"I'm really excited about all the works about introverts that's been coming out lately, I think mainly because of this book. I'm not sure if extroverts would have enjoyed this book as much as me, because Cain works hard to prove the merits and necessity of introverts in our society, while down-playing all the reasons why we should have an extrovert ideal. In fact, I think some extroverts would feel a bit offended at this book. But I don't care. I've lived my whole life feeling like there was something wrong with me. I need to speak up, get out there, sell myself, basically become something that I'm not. This book made me realize there's nothing wrong with me, and that I actually have strengths that my extroverted friends, relatives, etc., do not. Instead of constantly seeing myself as disadvantaged because I suck at small talk, don't know how to talk myself up in interviews, and am just a shy person, I just feel like I know myself better. I think teachers should read this book. And I'm going to stop, because this isn't so much as a book review as a blog post or something. This is a total self-help book for introverts. Thank you Cain!**I should also say that Cain uses extensive research and interviews to show the strengths of introverts, so it's actually a pretty scientific book (though made so that it's easy for the every day person like me to understand). I was really surprised at the amount of research done on the differences between introverts and extroverts, especially because the research often shows introverts in a good, positive light, unlike what most people think when they hear the word introvert.

First of all, as far as the audio format goes, they couldn’t have chosen a better narrator. Kathe Mazur’s voice fits the tone of the book perfectly–quiet and measured, yet firm. I basically just want to listen to every audiobook she’s ever narrated. Back to Quiet –I think Susan Cain did a stellar job of exploring the introverted personality type. She sites a number of studies and scientific theories to support her thesis that introversion is an undervalued trait in modern American society. Introverts have just as much to offer the world as extroverts and their unique strengths must be utilized for a society to be truly healthy.

107,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"When I was young, my grandfather, an intelligent farmer, used to call me an introvert, as I sat happily in the corner, spending my free time reading books or writing in my notebooks. I looked up at him, I believe I was around the age of eight or so, with crinkled eyebrows. He explained what it meant. But I didn't have a puzzled look on my face because I didn't understand the word, I was puzzled because he said it like he disapproved. Like it was a bad thing. My aunt, the doctor, immediately came to my defense and said, ""Janine, just tell him that you're not an introvert, you're just introspective."" That became my motto in life. I said it often, mostly because I felt those were big words and others would think I was smart. I never thought about it much later in life until I read this book. Cain talks about the virtues of being an introvert but how society has come to prize the personality traits of the extrovert. Being a pretty extreme extrovert, at first, I didn't think this book was for me. But then I thought back to when I was eight, and realized with shock and I wasn't just a person who could be both, although I was, I am, but I went from one extreme to the other. When I was a child, I was the most introverted person I know. Using the word shy to describe me didn't cut it. I would skip class altogether if I was even a minute late, to avoid the fear of having to walk into the classroom with everyone looking at me. Speeches had me thinking thoughts of jumping out of trees just to break a bone so I could get out of giving the speech. Now, I love nothing better than walking into a room full of strange people. It's just a room full of fifty new friends! And talking in front of people? I have to hold myself back in group exercises just so I don't hog the limelight. How did such a huge change occur? I'll tell you how, because of work, school, and problems socially, I was forced into it. As I began to read this book, I saw a lot of truth in what Cain was saying. Extroverts really are prized now, not just socially but in the workplace as well. At the last company I worked for, I sat in cubicles, was encouraged constantly to hold meetings and ""group think"" up ideas. How different it would have been if I was allowed even one hour a day without interruptions! What has made us so concerned with having these qualities? I am homeschooling my children and every time I come across someone who disapproves it's always because of lack of ""socialization"". My five-year-old son has no trouble talking to anyone and being friendly, I think he gets it from me. But he also loves to play by himself. He might get this from me as well! He creates his best Lego creations when left alone for hours at a time. Why is this a bad thing? As Cain points out, some of the best innovators of our time were quiet thinkers. And we might not have had some of those great inventions or works of art had these people been forced to ""socialize"" as children instead of left alone. And really, what is the big deal with needing socialization being such a big part of schooling? Why can't it be found outside of school? I recently watched a documentary about the current school systems and, as most people know, we (The United States), rank very low in all areas of education. In fact, when American children were tested in various areas against other countries of the world, we consistently ranked on the bottom in almost all areas except one. Can you guess what it is? Self-confidence. American children are said to have the highest self-confidence compared to all other countries. How do we explain this to our children? We're idiots but we have pride! Is this because we're placing such importance on making our children extroverts? Some of the case studies Cain uses to show examples of her theories kept me riveted. She also had a twenty question test in case you weren't sure where you stood. The more traits she gave as examples of introverts and extroverts, the less sure I became of which I was. Ask anyone which I was as a child, they would have said introvert, hands down. Ask anyone I know right now, and in a second they'd say extrovert. So I took her test to see where I stood. I thought I was only doubting myself, and that it would show pretty conclusively that I was an extrovert. But in fact, I was split almost exactly down the middle. I love meeting new people, and often feel energized at the end of a big party. But I also get rejuvinated from having alone time every day. Even back in college, when I was one of the most social people around, my roomates all knew that they risked certain death if they bothered me during my ""break time"". I have no problems going to movies alone, and one of my favorite things to do is go out to lunch or dinner at a nice restaurant with a good book as a dinner companion. People look at me weird, but I could care less. Whenever I go out or have a party my motto is always ""The more the merrier"". So where did I stand on this chart? The advice for public speaking for introverts wasn't going to help me. And to say I should have quit reading the book halfway through because I considered myself an extrovert would have had me missing out on some very interesting information. I really enjoyed this book. And I disagree that this book is only for introverts. I think the biggest benefit this book had for me is the eye opener to how we have been pressured to become more extroverted over the years and how we see this change everywhere, from schools, to the workplace, to advertising, to even moralistic behavior. I think all can benefit from having a greater awareness of this personality trait in everyone they know. If you're an extrovert, wouldn't it benefit you from having a better understanding to where your introverted team leader is coming from? And another realization for me, is how I know see my son, who has the tendency to play alone. I now am more aware of how I treat him, and make sure I no longer fall into that stereotypical reaction of ""Why don't you try harder to make friends?"" routine. There's nothing wrong with being an introvert, and if this book has any major theme, that's it. That being said, even though I very much enjoyed this book, I only gave it three stars for a couple of reasons. First of all, I feel like the middle of the road people such as myself were somewhat ignored. Where do we stand? How do we relate better to people and situations? Then there were the case studies. As I mentioned earlier, they were very interesting and really helped in relating to the particular example's Cain discussed. But after a while, they became tedious, and didn't hold my attention as well as the first half of the book. I still think many can benefit from reading this though. It was fun, and I look forward to discussing it with my book club.  ClassicsDefined.com"
108,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"I never really thought of myself as introverted until relatively recently, within the last year or so, when I declined an invitation to go out with a group of friends to the bar and one of them said ""Fine, be introverted then! Hope you enjoy sitting home alone with your cats!"" (She meant it in a teasing, only partially bitchy way, but I didn't take offense. I DO enjoy sitting home alone with my cats.)My semi-bitchy friend actually helped me define a big part of myself. Until then, I just thought of myself as ""the most anti-social Libra ever"", and poked fun at myself for not wanting to go out all the time, or being overwhelmed by loud, boisterous people, or needing time to just be alone - what my boyfriend calls ""cave-dwelling"". I made these things a joke because, according to society, it's not normal to want to spend so much time alone. I'm supposed to be a fun, out-going social butterfly. The thought exhausts me. So, when I read this, it was like someone opened up my head and singled out these aspects of my personality and then wrote them down. It was fascinating to read this book and learn about myself. I see things about my past in a completely new light. Like the situation above. I'd be more than happy to sit at home with a few friends and drink, but going to a bar to drink among a huge crowd just held no appeal. Or like how I approach my work. The sections of this book pertaining to corporate expectations and office structure were fascinating to me, and really allowed me to look at my job and approach to work differently. I'm a good employee and good at my job, but I don't aspire to be in the limelight. I don't MIND recognition or attention for a job well done, but it's not something I seek out. So, when I was recently offered a job with a new company, I had my choice of being in a ""client liaison"" position or a ""analysis and testing"" position, and I took the latter, even though it's a position with less recognition and lower pay. The thought of having to constantly be professionally social with strangers gives me anxiety, though, so it was a no-brainer for me. But when I discussed my decision with friends, they called me crazy to have turned down the higher paying position. As though money is the only criteria worth considering. (A point that this book makes well.)I'm going to miss the job I'm leaving though, because it did give me a kind of structured socialization. I get along great with my team, and there, I'm far more socially outgoing than I would be otherwise. I've worked with many of these people for several years, I trust and respect them, and they are people I consider real friends. Soon I'll be working 100% from home, so my social interaction will be drastically reduced. I may be introverted, but I do need that interaction. The hard part for me will be actually initiating it. I have a tendency to, uhh, forget to be social. I forget to call and text people, even though I mean to do it. But being social is just never at the forefront of my mind. I'll have to work on that. But then there's online communities, which is a completely different world. I have always been more open and (dare I say it?) chatty online than in my ""real life"" social interactions. Maybe it's the anonymity, or the fact that it's text-based, or the fact that the community I'm in here is one that is full of like-minded people with similar interests. People I can relate and talk to easily. I don't know, but I'm quite different online than off. Offline, I don't really do chit-chat, or small talk, and I'm often at a loss as to what I should say in a light social situation, despite there being 10 dozen possibilities running through my mind. I usually settle for silence, though, because by the time I've thought through a plethora of ""Nice weather"" or ""Your hair looks nice"" nothing comments, it's been an awkwardly long time, and I know it, and anything that I say at that point would just sound forced and fake, so I just... don't. That feeling that I just mentioned, about feeling forced and fake, is such a strong one for me that it sometimes overwhelms me when I really don't want it to, and it often feels to me like I come across as being cold and unfeeling when I really just don't know what to say to show how affected I really am. It was only when the book started talking about being 'sensitive' that it started to click. I've always been overly affected by emotionally charged situations. If you read some of my reviews of tear-jerker books, I mention this frequently. I remember when I was a kid, there was a show called Rescue 911 that my mom liked to watch. It was always some traumatic situation - a car wreck or an injured hiker or a woman trapped in a housefire, etc, and the show focused on the EMTs and firefighters and police called out to help. That show would always make me cry. Always. Every single episode. It didn't matter whether the people made it out OK, or if they all died, I would be in tears. I could just imagine how scary it would be and I had such respect for the kind of people who could deal with that kind of trauma every day and keep it together enough to help. It would all just overwhelm me, and I would cry. My point here, and how this relates to my last paragraph, is that my dad would often poke fun at me for getting upset over the show, and so I learned to hide that I was upset... oftentimes laughing to cover it. Laughing. As I got older into my teens, I just stopped showing that sensitivity in front of others at all, and unfortunately, that's carried over into my adult life. So now, when I feel strong emotions, it's easier for me to let them out when I'm alone, even though it makes me seem heartless to not show them when it's appropriate. Like at my grandma's funeral earlier this year, when my entire extended family was crying and talking and interacting, and I was stoically sitting in the pew, just thinking about her and how much I'll miss her. After the service, when I was alone, I completely lost my shit. I loved that woman, dammit. She was awesome.Anyway, if you're still reading, sorry for the overshare. What I'm getting at is that I loved how this book made me feel normal. It's well-researched, well-written, and engaging, and I'm incredibly glad that I read it. I think that it will... maybe not CHANGE my life, so much as improve it. I now know more about why I do certain things, and that's empowering. I can relate better to my boyfriend (an extrovert), and in my new job, and in social situations. And I can try to work on the things that I now recognize hinder me more than help me. Definitely a fascinating read. Highly recommended. "
109,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,5,"So...Just read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, (2012) by Susan Cain, Crown Publishers.I liked this book, and why not -- an in-depth defense of people like me! Although I confess, I never thought that introverts would need to be explained to extroverts. I thought we were self-evident, and it was the other, noisy, dominant half of the world that was inexplicable. (They still are.) It possibly needs a companion volume -- Noisy: the hegemony of people with nothing helpful to say who still won't shut up, or something. (Cue reality TV, talk radio, and horrible crush parties with loud music, where you couldn't hear anyone even if they were interesting.) Anyway.This made a curious juxtaposition with my last-read book Fossil Horses. MacFadden, a scientist, argued like a scientist; Cain, a lawyer, argues like a lawyer. I discern the differences even as I appreciate the advocacy. Cain develops her case through illustrative anecdotes, and references to science, psychology, and history as needed. Very readable. I confess, I hadn't thought of extroversion as the American cultural ideal, even as I have witnessed plenty of the cited behaviors. My world tends to be divided practically into ""people who read"" and ""everybody else"", which cuts unevenly across the extrovert/introvert divide, with the obvious bias.I sort of want to go out and press this book upon ""everybody else"", but one sees the inherent problem with that. I hope its message can cut through the noise somehow, nonetheless.Recommended.Ta, L."
110,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48197248-stephan,5,"This book helped me understand myself better and made me feel better about myself in a difficult time. I once again learned that every path has a value, also a quiet one and a whispering voice is not less valid, just less loud. Basically already that is more than enough to recommend it.If you consider yourself an introvert and doubt your own worth in comparison with more outgoing or established people, this is for you.If you are in any way interested in the introvert - extrovert spectrum, this will give you some very good understanding. For me the Quiet Revolution is a bit over the top, but that came after the book and doesn't make it any less valuable. "
111,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6979065-sylvia,4,"As a true 'introvert' or as I would rather prefer to label it a true 'intermediate' ... a definite so-glad-I-read-this-book for me. And yes, please; a bit of Quiet around me would be most Welcome so that I could Hear my own Quietness & Inner Senses ;-)It explained so many things about me, myself and I - in relation to where I stand in this very loud world that surrounds me everywhere. "
112,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"I feel sure Quiet will become the benchmark book on the topic of introversion. This is because it not only thoroughly explains introversion but champions it. It’s a book by an introvert for introverts, to help them understand themselves and feel proud of who they are. It’s also a book for extroverts, but especially those extroverts who are convinced that introversion is a flaw. Cain will have them wishing they were introverts. Quiet is inarguably biased in favor of introversion, but that’s the point. Up to one-half of Americans are introverted. It’s absurd that introversion is scoffed at as much as it is. The time has come for the introverted label to be a compliment rather than a criticism. This book is a leap in that direction.Cain covered many facets of introversion, from the intriguing “highly sensitive” subset (which describes about 20% of all introverts) to differences in the Eastern and Western worlds to the introverted child (specifically in the classroom, which favors extroverts). Also explored is the age-old question of nature versus nurture and brain differences between extroverts and introverts--plus more. I greatly enjoyed the Eastern versus Western section. America, and the Western world in general, has what Cain dubs an “Extrovert Ideal.” The opposite is true in the East. Whereas in the West, introversion is viewed as a weakness to be conquered, in the East, it’s considered a strength; extroversion is frowned upon, viewed as something that must be tamed. The general sentiment is that extroverts are overwhelming people, wasting others’ time with empty chatter. It’s in this section that Cain profiled Don Chen, an Asian-American student studying at Harvard business school, a very extroverted place. He’s the embodiment of introversion and must feign extroversion daily to get through his classes and general life as part of the school. Feigning extroversion is draining, and Chen needs solitude every day to recharge. This is how it is for all introverts, and Cain stressed repeatedly that it’s not a defect, just a difference. Chen has an intimate group of friends (entirely Asian-American save for one introverted white American man). He’s keenly aware of the differences between his little group and his extroverted classmates. He notes how frequently the extroverts participate in classes while he rarely does and how boisterous they are when together in the cafeteria. Though he admires some of their qualities, he mostly doesn’t understand them. In his mind, they disrespectfully waste classmates’ and professors’ time with their talk, failing to get to the point quickly. If this section sounds borderline racist, it isn’t. Rather, it recognizes that different cultures value different qualities and is a powerful example of introversion as a desirable trait. Chen’s story is one of many in this enlightening book. To support all points, Cain profiled real people, some living, some dead (such as Rosa Parks and Dale Carnegie). The (carefully indexed) research is fascinating in itself, but the real-life examples supporting her research are vital. They round out Quiet to push it beyond dry textbook. I’d read a lot about introversion before reading Quiet, and I bypassed this book for years because others said it offers nothing new on the topic. Readers who’ve read numerous books on the topic or have researched the topic extensively may feel this way. I didn’t. In each chapter, I learned--and was utterly engrossed. Introverts will find Quiet relatable and affirming. Extroverts will find Quiet demystifies introverts thoroughly and will appreciate them more. Both will find it extremely illuminating."
113,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36434323-melindam,4,"3,6 starsWell.... as I am an introvert, I obviously need to comtemplate before writing a review, right? :)But all in all, I am glad I listened to this book. The narrator was excellent.Also, it was a very interesting, insightful, informative read and of course there were lots of issues raised to which I could totally relate, even though sometimes I was a bit confused about what Susan Cain was ultimately trying to prove.I wish I could have read this book as a I teenager as well as my extrovert mother! :)I am from Central-Eastern Europe, so of course not all things ""translate"" directly into how society is working in Hungary as opposed to how things are in the US, but the personal issues are there and are quite universal."
114,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose,5,"This has been probably the one review I've been most intimidated to write for the longest time, and it's not because Susan Cain's ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" isn't a strongly asserted and powerful work. I could sing its respective praises for days. The fact of the matter is - this book really hit me at the heart of my core for so many measures in my life as an introvert. I find it hard to expound just how much this book had an impact on me personally.I could tell you about many things about my person that embody me as an introvert. That I'm quiet spoken and don't speak unless I have something important to say. That small talk isn't something I'm comfortable that I'm not fond of confrontations (though many of you have read my extended written rants about various matters of controversy with very little hesitation). That I tend to spend time alone to recharge my batteries even when I'm called to do things in any scale of extroversion. That my emotional intelligence is very high and I can sympathize/emphathize with people for matters of their experience (though this also makes me highly sensitive).For most of my life, I've been told that these very natural matters of my disposition were wrong. And goodness forbid did that make my life complicated because I didn't feel like people understood who I was. I was even led to believe that I was actually shy, not introverted (many people confuse the two, there is a difference.) Yet the more I learned about the dynamic of introversion and extroversion and how they functioned, I realized that the fundamental difference between them were the derived sources of energy that one functions with in day to day living. That there's nothing wrong with being introverted versus extroverted in a society that - in mainstream notations, champions the latter.This book had me thinking for days after I finished it.I liked that Cain's narrative focuses on the positive contributions and the inherent strengths that lie in introversion because it's widely stereotyped. That stereotyping actually harms our society more than we ourselves may realize in the daily grind, not just individually. By trying to mold people into one acceptable standard, we often lose out on what unique strengths and contributions one may have from going away from such a standard. Narratives like ""Quiet"" have relevance not just in recognizing the distinct psychological functions and differences we have as individuals, but also in the relationships and contributions we have in our professions, our activities, and even wider perceptions of our society in general.I appreciated the expansion on famous figures like Rosa Parks in terms of her backstory and identity as an introvert and how that shaped her responses (I'll have to pick up ""Quiet Strength"" at some point). I also appreciated hearing Cain's own struggles with coming to terms with her introversion, and even the story of the Harvard Business student. There are so many individual stories in this narrative and Cain gives a thorough examination of the details within. It's amazing just how much work and thought went into expounding these issues and individual narratives. This narrative examines introversion not only as a social construct, but individual - delving into narratives of biological, psychological, and sociological importance. There's an examination on the level of intorversion among different cultures, how introspection is valuable to creativity versus ""groupthink"", how extroversion and introversion are not mutually exclusive (and situations that call for each). I came out of it all with not only a fresh perspective on how valuable introverts are to the fabric of society, but also a greater sense of self-worth for my own traits. And that's something to be thankful for. My hope is that with more people who pick up ""Quiet"" and realize how important our individual attributes are, that it'll provide for more opportunities to be creative and to value each other in our relationships regardless of differences, for our unique strengths regardless of how their expressed or from where they come.Overall score: 5/5 stars"
115,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,4,"There are a load of books I've marked ""to be reviewed"", and just completely ignored - it was 2013 when I read this! - so here goes, let's make the list a bit smaller.Here's the moment where I'm supposed to tell you I'm an introvert, so let's get that out of the way: obviously I am. My credentials include cheerfully working from home, getting overstimulated in quiet libraries, and keeping in touch with my closest friends almost entirely by snail mail. I have been known to feel oversocialised sitting in a darkened room, listening to people two rooms away watch a film.As far as a lot of media is concerned, I may as well be a pet hamster. ""Care for your introvert."" Try not to interrupt them. Don't go in their nest while they're sleeping. Offer them a way out when you're at a party, in case they run out of carrot sticks and want to go home. I may as well also be a complete rarity: a third of people don't get hissy when you take their carrot sticks away; come the fuck on.So, what I liked about Quiet was that it didn't make me feel like a special snowflake or someone's hamster.But also... the section on introversion in leadership and the workplace has actually boosted my confidence a lot (apart from being really interesting). I've worked for a few people, and the times it's worked best have been the times where they give me a broad, bullet-pointed list of what they want to have happened by what time, and then they go away until that time. The best boss I ever had used to say it was a good day if we never spoke to each other except when one of us brought the other coffee - and I was inclined to agree with him. Faced with common-sense-logic, which seems to say that 5000 feedback sessions and an open-plan office with communal ball-pit are what millennials are looking for, I wanted this narrative. It was useful to hear. Maybe it's less useful if you're the sort of person who's been reading this sort of thing for years. For me, it was a helpful reminder.I remember a little interesting neurological detail, but not a lot - I can get more than that keyword-searching the Scientific American website, if I want to - and a fair bit of interesting historical anecdote. I remember coming away with a renewed respect for anyone who parents, especially by themselves, as well as a sense of purpose about working for myself and by myself - which I'm happy to say I'm now doing. It turns out, a lot of the time, that people who contract you for work over the internet don't really give a shit about your sparkling and gracious personality. They just want to know you're conscientious and you know what you're talking about and you'll do things when you say you will. I vaguely credit Susan Cain with giving me the impetus to go and do what I want to do, and not to feel like I have to be constantly nice to people I don't know. Now I just think, it's okay, I have character, and then put my headphones back in."
116,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5524572-kristin-hackett-superspacechick,4,"As a self proclaimed introvert, I've been meaning to read this book for so long. My sister in law gave me a copy for Christmas so I prioritized it as a January read and I'm so glad I did. I really enjoyed the in depth look at what constitutes an introvert vs. an extrovert. Quiet even redefined the meaning of the word sensitive for me. I've never considered myself sensitive before but to pull a quote, ""highly sensitive people tend to be keen observers who look before they leap. They arrange their lives in ways that limit surprises. They’re often sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, pain, coffee... Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments—both physical and emotional—unusually deeply. They tend to notice subtleties that others miss—another person’s shift in mood, say, or a lightbulb burning a touch too brightly.""- this is 100% spot on for me. While I do agree with a lot of what Susan Cain wrote, I do think it's difficult to classify people into only one of two categories. She did stress that just because someone is an introvert, it doesn't mean that 1) they got there the same way as someone else or 2) that both people will have exactly the same traits. There are still variables to consider. Overall, I loved that Quiet is a celebrated look at introversion and the strengths that those with introverted qualities possess. There were a few anecdotes that weren't the most interesting (or relevant like the chapter on raising children), but I still found value in reading them. "
117,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,5,"I am an introvert and proud of it and so is the author and she believes there is strength in quietness and I think she is right. She has helped me understand myself more and I am glad of that. Introverts don't like novelty and the first day of school is usually traumatic as mine was. As children, introverts like to daydream, play inside and their feelings are easily hurt. ""They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. . ."" They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy and fear."" They "". . . tend to speak softly because that's how they prefer others to communicate with them.""Shy people hate confrontations and will avoid them at all costs and the author believes it is better so.

118,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,2,"Why is it that the “ideal” person is extroverted? That we pride social skills and being outgoing? All while a deeply gifted thinker who prefers to be in his/her head is described as lacking these traits. Looking at it from an evolutionary standpoint, there is a reason why introverts exist, so why do we rate it as second best? Being a true-blue introvert, I turned to Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a world that can’t stop talking” to answer these questions (and maybe propose new ones). Susan Cain divides “Quiet” into four main sections with the first focusing on the history and description of the rise of extroverts, the differences in leadership styles of introverts and extroverts, and the myths surrounding them. This section begins “Quiet” with a slow and unmemorable beginning. Cain focuses more of an effort on real-life case studies versus actual scientific studies, bypassing any professional data or even her own opinions. The studies which are mentioned are not “earth-shattering” in depth nor do they truly correlate to her hypothesis. In fact, much of the hypothesis is lost and the flow is not seamless or clear. On one hand, this makes the reading understandable and accessible for the less scientifically-inclined reader, but to others craving more research; Cain leaves something to be desired. Some of Cain’s examples which could be perceived as “witty” (Craig Newark of Craigslist fame, Dr. Suess, and Moses from the Bible) are underdeveloped and also lose connection with the hypothesis. Cain is often abrupt and cuts herself short. Furthermore, many of the chapters begin in the same exact way (both format and creativity) which is tedious and creates a loss of interest. The second section of “Quiet” describes some of the brain and neurological aspects of introverts featuring more science than the first section. Cain’s work is a bit more compelling in this respect and certainly more interesting. However, it still isn’t clear what she is trying to prove as she mostly just describes how introverts “are”. Plus, most of the findings are self-explanatory and even obvious. Again, the reader will not be blown away. I have read MANY “brain books” (psychology/neurology, science, and biology) and generally, I am left both flabbergasted and repeating information I’ve read to anyone who will listen. This was not the case with “Quiet” as only a small dose of information felt standout. As the second portion progresses, Cain does present tests and experimentation results more confidentially (however, there is a lack of elaboration). The third section of “Quiet” is comparatively shorter, as Cain explains the conformities and values of the Asian cultures while in the fourth section, Cain offers tips and lifestyle adaptations for introverts in various areas such as work, romance, parenting, play, etc. At this point, “Quiet” appears to be more of a self-help book. The latter end of the book is overly focused on parenting and schooling of children causing me to feel alienated and distanced (having no children). Furthermore, the “Conclusion” is weak and sums up the book which actually reinforces how few points are made. Simply, “Quiet"" is not what I expected. Instead of explaining “why” introverts are the way they are; Cain described “how” they are with an absence of data I would have preferred. All in all though, it has been confirmed (which I already knew) that I am indeed an introvert."
119,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A lance is broken for the needs of introverted people Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Whether one opposes the sanguine with the phlegmatic nature, the wild daredevil the thoughtful inventor or merely the introversion the extroversion, the temperament is and remains in specific proportions decisive for a human being. The author has re-examined this fact with an unconventional approach, opening up exciting and critical viewing angles. Times are changing. In the 19th century, it was still commonplace to be modest, humble and unobtrusive. Starting from the advertising industry in the 1920s and 1930s, it continued to run to the idealistic goal of total superficiality. Ads began to play with people's fear of the negative connotations of ominous, alien observers, and the appearance and ability to attract more and more attention. The new religion of narcissism was supported by an entrepreneurial mentality that understood handshaking qualities, dazzling rhetoric, and slick eloquence as signs of business qualification.Thus, when the loudest and most risk-taking specimens of the managerial species, elite colleges that encourage elbow mentality-driven, superficial behavior, occupy key positions, one or the other financial market collapse is no longer surprising. The flowers of this development on the example of today's America could seem bizarre if the consequences were not so serious. Thus, adjectives such as shy and quiet or just hints of a sly-boy mentality are dismissed as entirely negative and peculiar. Whether in school, work or private life, who does not understand playing on the highly sophisticated keyboard of interpersonal communication, quickly falls through the typical rust. Sensitive children, even as babies, are prone to intensified reactions to external stimuli, are more empathetic and need seeming timidity as a protective mechanism against a formally overwhelming universe. At the same time, individuals naturally endowed with a more robust psychic scaffolding sound lighthearted, but also more emotionless, to their surroundings.Parents of quieter, a manageable circle of friends their naming and lonely hobbies devoted children are remembered, not only subtle, the importance of popularity and dazzling charm. However, very peculiar that silent children are put under depression or misanthropic suspicion, while too vital, joyful young people are sedated with Ritalin. If the favors of loneliness have been well into adulthood, there is a wide range of seminars that can enhance eloquence, demeanor, and be talking skills to the point of sales genius. Several relationship problems are likely based on the well measurable differences between different natures, even by MRI. While extroverts can bathe in crowds every awaken minute and shy away from loneliness, the relationship is reversed by introverts. This involves interpersonal explosives in itself when the mantra of the attractive opposites once no longer pulls, and the supposed truce of the relationship beginning is over. Additional spontaneous emotional responses provoke the fact that extroverts interpret specific aggressive behavior as interest and attention while introverts feel injured and attacked. Assessing the damage caused to the economy by incorrectly designing work processes and their surroundings is difficult or even impossible. If one adds the increased disinclination of introverts in a loud open-plan atmosphere, including the wasted potential, because gifted thinkers find no peace to work out ideas and concepts undisturbed, the overall economic damage can be immense. The cultural differences show a contrarian approach of the Asians, where a European-American behavior style is considered a stupid waste of time for listeners. Tranquility and contemplation have a different meaning, superficiality and the glorification of narcissistic principles are considered less desirable. Another, quite thoughtful approach.Eine Lanze gebrochen für die Bedürfnisse der introvertierten MenschenansammlungsvermeiderOb man dem sanguinischen das phlegmatische Naturell entgegenstellt, dem wilden Draufgänger den nachdenklichen Tüftler oder schlicht der Introvertiertheit die Extrovertiertheit, das Temperament ist und bleibt zu bestimmten Anteilen maßgebend für einen Menschen. Die Autorin hat diesen Umstand mit einer unkonventionellen Herangehensweise neu beleuchtet und damit interessante und kritische Betrachtungswinkel eröffnet.So ändern sich die Zeiten. War es im 19 Jahrhundert noch gang und gäbe, bescheiden, demütig und unaufdringlich zu sein, begann, ausgehend von der Werbeindustrie, in den 1920er und 1930er Jahren, ein bis heute andauernder Lauf auf das ideelle Ziel der totalen Oberflächlichkeit. Anzeigen begannen mit der Angst der Menschen vor negativen Assoziationen ominöser, fremder Beobachter zu spielen und das Äußere sowie die Fähigkeit zu gefallen, immer mehr ins Rampenlicht zu rücken. Unterstützung fand die neue Religion des Narzissmus von einer Unternehmermentalität, die Handschlagqualitäten, blendende Rhetorik und aalglatte Eloquenz als Zeichen betriebswirtschaftlicher Qualifikation auffasste. Wenn auf diese Weise immer die lautesten und risikofreudigsten Exemplare der Managerspezies, von zu ellbogenmentalitätsgesteuerten, oberflächlichen Verhalten animierenden Elitehochschulen, Schlüsselpositionen besetzen, verwundert der eine oder andere Finanzmarktkollaps gar nicht mehr.Die Blüten dieser Entwicklung am Beispiel des heutigen Amerikas könnten skurril anmuten, wären die daraus resultierenden Konsequenzen nicht derart gravierend. So werden Adjektive wie schüchtern und ruhig oder nur Andeutungen einer Eigenbrötlermentalität als durchwegs negativ und absonderlich abgetan.

Gleichzeitig wirken von Natur aus mit einem robusteren psychischen Gerüst ausgestattete Individuen unbeschwerter, aber auch emotionsloser auf ihre Umgebung. Eltern ruhiger, einen überschaubaren Freundeskreis ihr Eigen nennender und sich einsamen Hobbies widmender Kinder werden, nicht nur durch die Blume, an die Wichtigkeit von Beliebtheit und blendendem Charme erinnert.

Etliche Beziehungsprobleme dürften auf den, auch per MRT gut messbaren Unterschieden zwischen verschiedenen Naturellen basieren. Während Extrovertierte jede wache Minute in Menschenmengen baden könnten und Einsamkeit scheuen, kehrt sich das Verhältnis bei Introvertierten um. Das birgt zwischenmenschlichen Sprengstoff in sich, wenn das Mantra von den sich anziehenden Gegensätzen einmal nicht mehr richtig zieht und der vermeintliche Waffenstillstand des Beziehungsbeginns vorüber ist. Zusätzliche spontane emotionale Reaktionen provoziert die Tatsache, dass Extrovertierte bestimmtes, aggressives Verhalten als Interesse und Aufmerksamkeit interpretieren, während Introvertierte sich verletzt und angegriffen fühlen.Den für die Wirtschaft entstandenen Schaden durch falsche Konzeption von Arbeitsabläufen samt deren Umgebungen einzuschätzen mutet schwer bis unmöglich an.

Ein anderer, durchaus in Erwägung zu ziehender Ansatz."

Susan Cain, former Wall Street lawyer and self-described introvert, investigates how introversion has become dangerously scorned in the current American ""Culture of Personality."" I had not fully realized how drastically our cultural values have shifted--and how much American society pushes us to conform--until reading Cain's book. To prove her point, Cain visits American bastions of extroversion promotion, including Harvard Business School, Saddleback Church, Dale Carnegie, Wall Street, and Tony Robbins conferences. She talks with pioneering psychologists and neurologists to explain the studies behind concepts like the dangers of group think, the ability to delay gratification, or the trait called sensitivity. She profiles famous and less-well known introverts to show how the studies play out in real life.Though the many of the activities I'm drawn to (and the things that cause anxiety) scream classic introvert, I have always considered myself an extrovert and frequently put myself in situations where extroverted behavior is valued. However, since quitting my job and globe-hopping for the past two years, I've been surprised (and disappointed) by how often the constant stimulation, new people, and change can drain me--and by how I often feel an overwhelming need for alone time.I found myself relating to many of the points Cain discusses and have since concluded that I'm much more of an introvert than I had thought. (I promise that this isn't just because she does a good job of highlighting all the positive things about introverts!)So for that, I am grateful to have read Quiet, though I can't quite believe it took reading a book to figure that out about myself! I am seeing my preferences in a new light and have much understanding and acceptance regarding the things that interest me (and those that cause me stress). I've been having trouble narrowing down 'what I want to do with my life' and this book has helped me more than any other, because I finally feel like I can accept that the things I really enjoy are just a part of me and can't be ignored. Though the personal application will differ, I suspect many people will come away having learned much more than they expected, if not about themselves, then about people close to them. I had always thought of extroverts and introverts as being on distinct sides of a line, when in fact it's much more of a sliding scale (or perhaps better as two scales: percentage introversion, percentage extroversion). Because we have been culturally pressured and trained to admire extroverted behavior, many of us may be dangerously ignoring our introverted characteristics. This was a game-changing book for me, and I suspect it will be eye-opening to most people who read it."

But I also enjoy giving presentations at school, tutoring peers in writing, and interacting with various people online and in real life. I'd describe myself as an introvert (and my Meyers-Briggs personality type agrees), though both introverts and extroverts would enjoy this fascinating book by Susan Cain. She provides an intriguing, in-depth perspective on introversion, its connotation in contrasting cultures, and the psychology behind it.A profusion of the nonfiction I've read has contained too much of something - too many random anecdotes, too much scientific jargon, too many unnecessary statistics or explanations. But Quiet has the perfect blend of personal anecdotes, interesting analysis, detailed explanations, and compelling statistics. Cain references various studies conducted by psychologists and discusses several aspects related to introversion, such as the extrovert ideal, how extroverts and introverts can compliment each other and work together, nature v. nature, etc. Here's one passage about sensitive people (who tend to be more introverted) that struck a chord with me:""The other thing Aron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they're highly empathic. It's as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people's emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world. They tend to have unusually strong consciences. They avoid violent movies and TV shows; they're acutely aware of the consequences of a lapse in their own behavior. In social settings they often focus on subjects like personal problems, which others consider 'too heavy'.""I guess I have an excuse for exposing so much of myself on my blog, huh? Anyway, Cain delves into other subjects that are intellectually stimulating too, such as the three things she thinks are important in identifying one's personal project. She even brings up the relationship between Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other famous historical figures.Overall, highly recommended to everyone curious about their own temperaments and how to embrace their natural personalities. One of the best works of nonfiction I've read.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

I was really excited to read it, because I knew this book was very popular. Also, I love nonfiction. I love the ability to learn from a book.I believe I learned from this book. It was interesting to hear why my best friend, who is one of the biggest introverts ever fits perfectly with me (I'm a huge extravert). Also, it was interesting to hear what you can do to help someone with stage fright preform at their best.However, I felt the book repeated itself. Many times I wondered what new information could possibly be discussed, and a lot of times there wasn't really any new information. It just talked about the same material in a circle from a different angle.A lot of the time I felt like this book was written so introverts could feel validated for being an introvert and that they weren't anti-social. They just need socialization in a completely different way than extroverts."

It's perhaps not a surprise that Susan Cain, the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking identifies herself as an introvert. Being quiet, introverted or shy is still seen by many as a problem or handicap to overcome so I can see her motivation for writing it.One this book's premises is that in the last 50 years or so, the Western world moved from a culture of character to a culture of personality, which according to the author has given an advantage to people that enjoyed outgoing, uninhibited personalities. We tend to admire and reward people that exhibit the most gregarious, outgoing traits of extroverts while at the same time undermined and misunderstand those that are most typically seen in more introverted individuals.
Introversion is really about having a preference for lower stimulation environments. So it's just a preference for quiet, for less noise, for less action. Whereas extroverts really crave more stimulation in order to feel at their best.
The author explains that Introversion is a spectrum, and that most of us don't fully fit into an introvert/extrovert definition. It also provides a sort of ""survival guide"" for introverts to help us learn how to better deal with the pressures of living in a world that for the most part rewards those that are extroverts.
Many people believe that introversion is about being antisocial, and that's really a misperception. Because actually it's just that introverts are differently social. So they would prefer to have a glass of wine with a close friend as opposed to going to a loud party full of strangers.
This book helped me understand myself better, identify those traits that makes many of us ""introverts"" different and learn how to use them to our advantage, both on our professional and personal lives. The book is entertaining and well written. If you are interested in learning about introverts, perhaps because you feel like one or someone closed to you does, this book might be of interest to you.After reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking my conclusion is that the world needs both extroverts and introverts and that we all have a role to play.Here's a link to the author's TED TALK which is sort a summarized version of the book:http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_t..."

And the whole idea about needing time out to recover from socialising - I always thought I was just a bit odd, haha.The criticisms that are quite rightly levelled at this book about preaching some kind of binarism between extrovert and introvert are understandable, and am I'm sure that we are all a little too complex for a poorly designed set of questions to provide any sort of sensible analysis or categorisation (would still like to see the questions though...) Most people will be surely be somewhere close to 'ambivert' even if they know themselves to be introverted at heart. For me a major part of young socialisation and growing up was learning to act like an extrovert, if nothing else just to stop people trying to 'bring me out of my shell' or constantly asking what's up as I am 'being quiet'."
125,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena,4,"I really liked this book, especially the beginning part. I so needed to read it. For years people have been telling me to come out of my shell and to be more outgoing and I realized I had definitely playing the role of pseudo-extrovert all this time! I enjoyed reading the fact that we introverts actually have power and hidden strengths. The list of famous introverts surprised me, Rosa Parks, Al Gore and Gandhi in particular. The book also shared some insight into the thinking patterns of extroverts. All in all, it was an interesting book though the end did drag on a bit."

127,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5470914-sam,1,"This was the most painful book I have read this summer. I choked it down like bad medicine page after page. Quiet is great self affirmation for someone who considers themselves an introvert, and sees humans as either an extrovert or introvert. Cain certainly thinks she’s the poster child of an introvert, or is she? The book reads like a memoir in parts where she tells stories of her own life, then there are smatterings or small examples in specific parts of people’s lives of how greatness comes in quiet e.g. Steve Wozniak, Gandhi, Rosa Parks. Cain also fancies herself a bit of a child psychologist, on one hand it’s ok for kids to be shy or in their shell, these aren’t bad things, and very normal, but on the other hand we need to nudge and push slowly to get kids out of their quiet place. So which is it?It doesn’t bother me that Cain isn’t a psychologist or economist, but she’s talking through both sides of her mouth, the book is a pity party, she thinks the decisions in modern workplaces are influenced by highly extroverted personalities like those from the Harvard Business School. There’s no backing for this other than the fact that business students are extroverts. Additionally the economic crisis was wholly the fault of extroverts, basically extroverts with their loud voices overpowered the brilliant quiet hardworking, and smart introverts and ran the economy to the ground. I’m afraid you really aren’t brilliant if something has already happened and you didn’t do anything to stop it. In hindsight everything is 20/20, just because you are quiet and something bad is happening saying “I knew it!” doesn’t do much. The circlejerk continues when Cain bangs on about everyone who a douche as being an extrovert. Good guys are introverts, Warren Buffet because of his one speech about the dot com bubble bursting was quiet and well calculated in his words. The rest of the word are greedy businessmen. There’s some sample or thin slicing in her discussions that I find problematic, and read a bit like a tabloid. Susan Cain is clearly appealing to an audience that is already sold to introversion, and stroking those egos. I wish the book had more solutions instead of harping about how bad people are. The book blurs it’s lines through many genres, self help, psychology and a dash of group-think. I consider myself an introvert, but also an extrovert, yes I do believe brilliance happens in unaccompanied activities like running. I charge my batteries during times like this but I also don’t “suffer in silence”. I don’t believe people are fully introverted or extroverted. Reading Khaneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and Mcgonigal’s Willpower Instinct make Cain’s book look hurriedly and thoughtlessly written, there’s little appeal to science. "
128,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,3,"I expected to love, love, love this book. After all, psychology is one of my passions. Also, I am always interested in hearing from some group. And this is saying, ""We, the introverts, are speaking out.""However, the book was neither as powerful nor as interesting as I was hoping....Cain does a great job of blending together different aspects. The three main angles she uses are:1.) Famous people who were introverts. She usually starts her chapters with a story about a wonderful famous person we all know and adore - and then explaining how they were introverted. Rosa Parks, Dale Carnegie, and Eleanor Roosevelt are some of the examples she used.2.) Case studies. This is the real life introvert ""Jane Doe."" She was on this job and thought she would have to quit because she just wasn't outgoing enough. Then she learned that being an introvert was like having a secret superpower! And then she used her introversion to overcome all obstacles! Now she's rich and/or happy. Success!3.) Science - hard and soft. Cain uses both psychology and biology to try and explain the differences between extroverts and introverts. She also explains why introversion might be valuable in evolution and natural selection. She has a fascinating chapter on culture, which emphasizes that although extroversion is worshiped in the USA, many Asian countries value silence, reflection, and understanding over cheerfulness, enthusiasm, and talkativeness. ...This book is at it's best when Cain is exploring how introversion is a valuable and worthy trait or way of being. When she journeys into different places to see how introversion is treated differently there. When she explores how introversion can be a survival aid in the wild and how introverted people can be powerful in their own way.It's exciting and interesting to realize that extroversion - while venerated in America - is actually seen as crass and dumb in many Asian cultures.And it's fun and cool to see different theories of how introverted people and animals are strong in Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection. I liked seeing different species and the benefits and drawbacks they experience from being extroverted or introverted. And I enjoyed seeing how introversion could be a kick-butt evolutionary trait which is often overlooked or thought to be something that needed 'killing off.'I thought about 2/3 of the book were weak, though. For instance, I already know enough about famous figures and do not particularly want or need to read a short biography or story about them. Another thing that bugged me were her ""real life introversion stories."" Here is how an introvert struggled. Here is how he learned to embrace his true self and be happy/rich.The whole book just felt like a big pat on the back. ""Don't worry, introverts, you're okay! Everything's okay! It might seem like the world hates you, but use your strengths! You are really amazing.""And it's not even like I DISAGREE with this message, it's simply that I was expecting more than a rather thinly-veiled self-help book. P.S. I really like the page or two that Cain dedicates to exploring Moses (an alleged introvert) and Aaron (his extroverted mouthpiece). It is also interesting when she lightly touches on whether or not the Church and modern-day Protestants shun and punish introverts as not doing the Lord's work. I like when she questions whether Jesus was an introvert or extrovert (covered in one paragraph, very shallow) and questions whether the Church is pushing an incorrect message on it's followers. (""Real Christians proselytize! How can you be a REAL Christian if you are not gregarious?"") I also like when she uses the teachings and life of Gandhi to emphasize that passivity is NOT submissiveness. All these subjects were things I wished she'd explored in greater depth."

All these adjectives and more describe my experience with this amazing book.I'm very much an introvert. I try to avoid social functions as much as possible, but I do love meeting every so often with my dear friends one-on-one. If I do end up at a party, you can bet I'm the one keeping the corner warm. I am an avid reader, a knitter, a sometimes writer, a nerd, and an engineer. My idea of a perfect evening is one spent in the comfort of my apartment, cat in lap, book in hand, coffee at my side. My idea of a perfect vacation is one where I can go to my favorite coffee shop and read. In college, my favorite classes were Differential Equations (in which I, the only female, got a perfect score on the final), Physics, and Fluids. Ever since elementary school, I dreaded a school performances, such as Christmas programs or poetry recitals. At work meetings, I am more likely to listen to everything and be note-taker than I am to present or volunteer ideas.Lately, my boss has said that I need to step things up, become more ""out there"" and confident. Inwardly, I despaired. Wasn't I working hard enough? What was holding me back? Why couldn't I just blurt things out in meetings? Why did I constantly sound nervous, even if I really wasn't? Was there any hope for me to change?And then, like a sign from heaven, I saw this book in the ""New Books"" display at Barnes and Nobles (BTW, I happen to swing by the bookstore at least once a week during lunch - sometimes to purchase, but mostly to pass the time). I remembered a friend had read this and really enjoyed it, and I figured it would help me figure out myself.""Figure myself out"" would be an understatement; it's as if this book were written specifically for me! Cain breaks down what it means to be an introvert. Turns out despite what my sister is constantly telling me, I'm not weird (alright, not too weird). I have talents and skills. I have a place. And it's not my fault I can't always speak up and make my voice heard. A lot of it is because of how our workforce, our employers, our coworkers, our society functions. Our biology, our parents, our surroundings make us the introverted beings we are. It's just that school and work and the outside world try to tell us that being quiet, that listening and ruminating over things is wrong, that we should be quick to speak and blurt whatever is on our mind.I've known I was an introvert for a while, but it was so refreshing and liberating to learn that there were others with my ""problem"". That I wasn't alone. And, most importantly, I can overcome, nay thrive, in this Extroverted world. And that is the second gift Cain gives us in this book: how to be an Introvert in an Extrovert world and not want to choke yourself at night.I feel like, after reading Quiet, I have a plan for facing my ""work problems"". I feel like I can take the challenge my boss has placed in front of me and succeed. Although a part of me still wishes I could crawl back to my desk and burrow there, I think this book has given me the tools and encouragement I need to speak up.If you are an introvert, you definitely need to read this book. Even if you aren't an introvert, this is a great book to understanding how they think and act. I'm definitely passing this along to everyone I know."
130,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Years ago, my division manager at work had everybody in the division take the Meyer Briggs personality test. Then we spent time in a workshop, to understand the implications of our personality types. One of the dimensions of the test is extroversion/introversion (E or I types). This book offers a very satisfying account of what it means to be an introvert. Generally Western cultures admire extroverts, while Asian cultures admire introverts. Both types of personalities offer value to society. Groups of people who are introverts are best with an extroverted leader, while groups of extroverts are best with an introverted leader.Many introverts find it difficult to live in a society that values extroversion more highly. As a result, many introverts pretend to be extroverts in certain social situations. But they cannot maintain this pretension indefinitely, and at some point in time they must ""recharge"" their internal batteries with quiet and solitude. The book makes a major point here: It's perfectly OK to pretend to be an extrovert for periods of time--as long as you do this while you are working at something that you truly love.The book has useful practical advice for introverts. If you are an introvert and your husband or wife is an extrovert, there is much to be said about how to maintain or improve your relationship. If you are raising a child who is an introvert, it is important to understand how to encourage the child to follow his/her innate abilities.Back in the 1940's and 1950's, Alex Osborn was plagued by the lack of creativity in his advertising agency. So, he wrote some books introducing the concept of ""brainstorming"". The idea is for people get together in groups and toss out ideas without fear of ridicule--the more ideas, the better. The problem is, in the 1960's, studies showed that brainstorming is not efficient; you can get more, good ideas if people simply think creatively in solitude. Committees simply are not as productive as the sum of individuals working alone. We are so inculcated with the idea that brainstorming is best--but this is really just a reflection of the dominance of extroversion in our society. "

I felt like it wasn’t as accessible as it could have been. It seems very focused on introverts in or who wish to be in very high powered job roles. Which isn’t my world. I was hoping for a bit more knowledge or ‘self help’ regarding being an introvert in an average every day life, Not as an award winning introverted lecturer, or an introverted Lawyer or CEO."
132,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"It is stated at the start that this book’s purpose is to improve a reader's relationship with others. The book can thus be viewed as a book of the self-help genre. Its aim is to advise introverts on ways by which they can improve their relationships with extroverts, and vice versa. It compares behavioral traits of both introverts and extroverts, showing in what ways they are similar and how they differ. The author mentions books about and summarizes studies related to extroversion and introversion, conducted over the years and up to today. The book begins with a quick test by which readers can determine where they stand on the introvert / extrovert scale. The test takes only a few minutes and gives the reader an immediate connection with the topics to be discussed. Both my husband and I took the test. We both received the same score, indicating that we are both strong introverts. It is interesting to note that although we had the same score, we did not answer all questions in the same way. This led to a lively discussion and a fun start to the book! Twenty questions are to be answered with a yes or a no. The book demonstrates clearly that in America it is the extroverts that hold sway--in the government, in business and in most educational institutions. It is an important and valuable statement that is being made. This is often to the detriment of introverts and to society as a whole. While the author professes the importance and value of both the introvert and the extrovert way of thinking, given the suppression of introverts in society today, it is introverts she lauds most, giving example after example of their accomplishments. I didn’t need to be convinced. For me, it is OBVIOUS that society benefits from the presence of both. The book verges on becoming a manifesto for introverts. This appeals to me no more than society's pronounced favoritism of extroverts! The book accomplishes well what it has set out to do, but I am rarely enthused by books of the self-help genre. It does advise readers on how their relationships can be improved. It also explains how schools can be adapted to better suit the needs of introverts, without hampering the situation for extroverts. I do however find much of the advice given as being rather obvious. The sections I like most are those that are scientifically oriented. I like for example the parts about how the brain functions; sections about the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex and the connection to dopamine are interesting. Many studies are referred to, but how exactly each was performed is skimmed over in too brief a manner. We are told what the results have for implications, but skeptic that I am, I was not always convinced! I need more details. To add depth, opposing points of view should have been added. Intuitively, I agree with the conclusions drawn, but I would have preferred more solid proof. Too many generalizations/simplifications are made. Over and over again we are told that so and so was an introvert and so and so an extrovert. This is all too simple! Individuals are mixes of introvert and extrovert qualities. Instead, an analysis of the tangled mix of traits that make up real people is what I was looking for. At one point Moses is classified as an introvert! This was just too much for me. The author swiftly classifies famous people as being either introvert or extrovert with little analysis of their specific character traits. I find this too categorical. We are told that Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, would never have written the books she wrote and become the ""bold thinker"" that she became had she not been left alone to read books in her youth. Where is the proof in that?! The author generalizes and simplifies all too often. The book is directed primarily toward Americans. I do not appreciate this slant. There is only a brief discussion of Asian American immigrants. Asian Americans of Chinese background are classified as introverts. Europeans are in a bunch grouped with Americans. I would have preferred a more in-depth, nuanced analysis of national and cultural differences.I wish the book had been more globally and more scientifically oriented. It has too many generalizations. It is basically a self-help book, a genre that does not appeal to me, so I guess it is not so bad that I nevertheless felt it to be worth reading. I would have preferred more in-depth analyses concerning how individuals are complicated mixes of introversion and extroversion. We are not one or the other, as was so often stated in reference to the people mentioned. The narration of the audiobook by Kathe Mazur started out very fast, but eventually she slows down. Her rapid speed had me chuckling at the beginning. Why? Because it is the extroverts, not us introverts that talk fast! Didn’t the producers of the audiobook realize the incongruity?! We introverts need time to stop and think and time to examine the ideas floating around in our heads. The narration is easy to follow once Mazur has slowed down. She has a soft, pleasant voice, a perfect match for introverts, the central protagonists of the book. The question is how many extroverts read this book. It is interesting to think about why this may be so."
133,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,5,"This book is very insightful and informative. I watched Susan Cain's TED talk once and I was fascinated being an introvert myself. As a kid I was shy, serious, studious with a little bit of social anxiety and although as I grew up, I outgrew my shyness and got more confident socially, there have been many situations where I questioned myself. Once when I was out on a trip with a big group of college friends, everyone was getting along so well and they seemed to be having so much fun together but I felt so lonely and left out and I was like, ''What's wrong with me''? Turns out I'm just an introvert. Then, I found this book. It describes in detail what introversion and extroversion is and what are the traits associated with both personalities. Where in most areas (or cultures), the introversion or shyness is viewed in a negative light, the writer states that it's an essential trait and how powerful it could be and it should be valued just as extroversion is. I found this book very interesting to read because she presents her ideas by using data gathered from case studies, research and her own personal experiences and from other people. She has also provided analysis of many famous personalities and how their temperaments shaped their actions and how essential their role was. Many definitions are provided for introversion-extroversion and how our genes and our environment play a role in shaping our personalities. There is no personality type better than the other but creating a balance is very important to bring out the best in both. The message in short is- value your individuality and do things the way you want and not because you have to conform to certain cultural norms. It also tells how both personalities can strike a balance between both traits. Also, both extroverts and introverts can lead a fulfilling life without changing their core values or trying to be someone they are not, the power lies in knowing who you are, what your abilities are and using them to the best.After reading this book, I feel like I can understand myself a little better now, what my motivations are and what makes me the way I am. I recommend this book to both introverts and extroverts as it can help them understand the qualities in themselves and in each other."

I'm not sure if extroverts would have enjoyed this book as much as me, because Cain works hard to prove the merits and necessity of introverts in our society, while down-playing all the reasons why we should have an extrovert ideal. In fact, I think some extroverts would feel a bit offended at this book. But I don't care. I've lived my whole life feeling like there was something wrong with me. I need to speak up, get out there, sell myself, basically become something that I'm not. This book made me realize there's nothing wrong with me, and that I actually have strengths that my extroverted friends, relatives, etc., do not. Instead of constantly seeing myself as disadvantaged because I suck at small talk, don't know how to talk myself up in interviews, and am just a shy person, I just feel like I know myself better. I think teachers should read this book. And I'm going to stop, because this isn't so much as a book review as a blog post or something. This is a total self-help book for introverts. Thank you Cain!**I should also say that Cain uses extensive research and interviews to show the strengths of introverts, so it's actually a pretty scientific book (though made so that it's easy for the every day person like me to understand). I was really surprised at the amount of research done on the differences between introverts and extroverts, especially because the research often shows introverts in a good, positive light, unlike what most people think when they hear the word introvert.

First of all, as far as the audio format goes, they couldn’t have chosen a better narrator. Kathe Mazur’s voice fits the tone of the book perfectly–quiet and measured, yet firm. I basically just want to listen to every audiobook she’s ever narrated. Back to Quiet –I think Susan Cain did a stellar job of exploring the introverted personality type. She sites a number of studies and scientific theories to support her thesis that introversion is an undervalued trait in modern American society. Introverts have just as much to offer the world as extroverts and their unique strengths must be utilized for a society to be truly healthy.

137,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"When I was young, my grandfather, an intelligent farmer, used to call me an introvert, as I sat happily in the corner, spending my free time reading books or writing in my notebooks. I looked up at him, I believe I was around the age of eight or so, with crinkled eyebrows. He explained what it meant. But I didn't have a puzzled look on my face because I didn't understand the word, I was puzzled because he said it like he disapproved. Like it was a bad thing. My aunt, the doctor, immediately came to my defense and said, ""Janine, just tell him that you're not an introvert, you're just introspective."" That became my motto in life. I said it often, mostly because I felt those were big words and others would think I was smart. I never thought about it much later in life until I read this book. Cain talks about the virtues of being an introvert but how society has come to prize the personality traits of the extrovert. Being a pretty extreme extrovert, at first, I didn't think this book was for me. But then I thought back to when I was eight, and realized with shock and I wasn't just a person who could be both, although I was, I am, but I went from one extreme to the other. When I was a child, I was the most introverted person I know. Using the word shy to describe me didn't cut it. I would skip class altogether if I was even a minute late, to avoid the fear of having to walk into the classroom with everyone looking at me. Speeches had me thinking thoughts of jumping out of trees just to break a bone so I could get out of giving the speech. Now, I love nothing better than walking into a room full of strange people. It's just a room full of fifty new friends! And talking in front of people? I have to hold myself back in group exercises just so I don't hog the limelight. How did such a huge change occur? I'll tell you how, because of work, school, and problems socially, I was forced into it. As I began to read this book, I saw a lot of truth in what Cain was saying. Extroverts really are prized now, not just socially but in the workplace as well. At the last company I worked for, I sat in cubicles, was encouraged constantly to hold meetings and ""group think"" up ideas. How different it would have been if I was allowed even one hour a day without interruptions! What has made us so concerned with having these qualities? I am homeschooling my children and every time I come across someone who disapproves it's always because of lack of ""socialization"". My five-year-old son has no trouble talking to anyone and being friendly, I think he gets it from me. But he also loves to play by himself. He might get this from me as well! He creates his best Lego creations when left alone for hours at a time. Why is this a bad thing? As Cain points out, some of the best innovators of our time were quiet thinkers. And we might not have had some of those great inventions or works of art had these people been forced to ""socialize"" as children instead of left alone. And really, what is the big deal with needing socialization being such a big part of schooling? Why can't it be found outside of school? I recently watched a documentary about the current school systems and, as most people know, we (The United States), rank very low in all areas of education. In fact, when American children were tested in various areas against other countries of the world, we consistently ranked on the bottom in almost all areas except one. Can you guess what it is? Self-confidence. American children are said to have the highest self-confidence compared to all other countries. How do we explain this to our children? We're idiots but we have pride! Is this because we're placing such importance on making our children extroverts? Some of the case studies Cain uses to show examples of her theories kept me riveted. She also had a twenty question test in case you weren't sure where you stood. The more traits she gave as examples of introverts and extroverts, the less sure I became of which I was. Ask anyone which I was as a child, they would have said introvert, hands down. Ask anyone I know right now, and in a second they'd say extrovert. So I took her test to see where I stood. I thought I was only doubting myself, and that it would show pretty conclusively that I was an extrovert. But in fact, I was split almost exactly down the middle. I love meeting new people, and often feel energized at the end of a big party. But I also get rejuvinated from having alone time every day. Even back in college, when I was one of the most social people around, my roomates all knew that they risked certain death if they bothered me during my ""break time"". I have no problems going to movies alone, and one of my favorite things to do is go out to lunch or dinner at a nice restaurant with a good book as a dinner companion. People look at me weird, but I could care less. Whenever I go out or have a party my motto is always ""The more the merrier"". So where did I stand on this chart? The advice for public speaking for introverts wasn't going to help me. And to say I should have quit reading the book halfway through because I considered myself an extrovert would have had me missing out on some very interesting information. I really enjoyed this book. And I disagree that this book is only for introverts. I think the biggest benefit this book had for me is the eye opener to how we have been pressured to become more extroverted over the years and how we see this change everywhere, from schools, to the workplace, to advertising, to even moralistic behavior. I think all can benefit from having a greater awareness of this personality trait in everyone they know. If you're an extrovert, wouldn't it benefit you from having a better understanding to where your introverted team leader is coming from? And another realization for me, is how I know see my son, who has the tendency to play alone. I now am more aware of how I treat him, and make sure I no longer fall into that stereotypical reaction of ""Why don't you try harder to make friends?"" routine. There's nothing wrong with being an introvert, and if this book has any major theme, that's it. That being said, even though I very much enjoyed this book, I only gave it three stars for a couple of reasons. First of all, I feel like the middle of the road people such as myself were somewhat ignored. Where do we stand? How do we relate better to people and situations? Then there were the case studies. As I mentioned earlier, they were very interesting and really helped in relating to the particular example's Cain discussed. But after a while, they became tedious, and didn't hold my attention as well as the first half of the book. I still think many can benefit from reading this though. It was fun, and I look forward to discussing it with my book club.  ClassicsDefined.com"
138,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"I never really thought of myself as introverted until relatively recently, within the last year or so, when I declined an invitation to go out with a group of friends to the bar and one of them said ""Fine, be introverted then! Hope you enjoy sitting home alone with your cats!"" (She meant it in a teasing, only partially bitchy way, but I didn't take offense. I DO enjoy sitting home alone with my cats.)My semi-bitchy friend actually helped me define a big part of myself. Until then, I just thought of myself as ""the most anti-social Libra ever"", and poked fun at myself for not wanting to go out all the time, or being overwhelmed by loud, boisterous people, or needing time to just be alone - what my boyfriend calls ""cave-dwelling"". I made these things a joke because, according to society, it's not normal to want to spend so much time alone. I'm supposed to be a fun, out-going social butterfly. The thought exhausts me. So, when I read this, it was like someone opened up my head and singled out these aspects of my personality and then wrote them down. It was fascinating to read this book and learn about myself. I see things about my past in a completely new light. Like the situation above. I'd be more than happy to sit at home with a few friends and drink, but going to a bar to drink among a huge crowd just held no appeal. Or like how I approach my work. The sections of this book pertaining to corporate expectations and office structure were fascinating to me, and really allowed me to look at my job and approach to work differently. I'm a good employee and good at my job, but I don't aspire to be in the limelight. I don't MIND recognition or attention for a job well done, but it's not something I seek out. So, when I was recently offered a job with a new company, I had my choice of being in a ""client liaison"" position or a ""analysis and testing"" position, and I took the latter, even though it's a position with less recognition and lower pay. The thought of having to constantly be professionally social with strangers gives me anxiety, though, so it was a no-brainer for me. But when I discussed my decision with friends, they called me crazy to have turned down the higher paying position. As though money is the only criteria worth considering. (A point that this book makes well.)I'm going to miss the job I'm leaving though, because it did give me a kind of structured socialization. I get along great with my team, and there, I'm far more socially outgoing than I would be otherwise. I've worked with many of these people for several years, I trust and respect them, and they are people I consider real friends. Soon I'll be working 100% from home, so my social interaction will be drastically reduced. I may be introverted, but I do need that interaction. The hard part for me will be actually initiating it. I have a tendency to, uhh, forget to be social. I forget to call and text people, even though I mean to do it. But being social is just never at the forefront of my mind. I'll have to work on that. But then there's online communities, which is a completely different world. I have always been more open and (dare I say it?) chatty online than in my ""real life"" social interactions. Maybe it's the anonymity, or the fact that it's text-based, or the fact that the community I'm in here is one that is full of like-minded people with similar interests. People I can relate and talk to easily. I don't know, but I'm quite different online than off. Offline, I don't really do chit-chat, or small talk, and I'm often at a loss as to what I should say in a light social situation, despite there being 10 dozen possibilities running through my mind. I usually settle for silence, though, because by the time I've thought through a plethora of ""Nice weather"" or ""Your hair looks nice"" nothing comments, it's been an awkwardly long time, and I know it, and anything that I say at that point would just sound forced and fake, so I just... don't. That feeling that I just mentioned, about feeling forced and fake, is such a strong one for me that it sometimes overwhelms me when I really don't want it to, and it often feels to me like I come across as being cold and unfeeling when I really just don't know what to say to show how affected I really am. It was only when the book started talking about being 'sensitive' that it started to click. I've always been overly affected by emotionally charged situations. If you read some of my reviews of tear-jerker books, I mention this frequently. I remember when I was a kid, there was a show called Rescue 911 that my mom liked to watch. It was always some traumatic situation - a car wreck or an injured hiker or a woman trapped in a housefire, etc, and the show focused on the EMTs and firefighters and police called out to help. That show would always make me cry. Always. Every single episode. It didn't matter whether the people made it out OK, or if they all died, I would be in tears. I could just imagine how scary it would be and I had such respect for the kind of people who could deal with that kind of trauma every day and keep it together enough to help. It would all just overwhelm me, and I would cry. My point here, and how this relates to my last paragraph, is that my dad would often poke fun at me for getting upset over the show, and so I learned to hide that I was upset... oftentimes laughing to cover it. Laughing. As I got older into my teens, I just stopped showing that sensitivity in front of others at all, and unfortunately, that's carried over into my adult life. So now, when I feel strong emotions, it's easier for me to let them out when I'm alone, even though it makes me seem heartless to not show them when it's appropriate. Like at my grandma's funeral earlier this year, when my entire extended family was crying and talking and interacting, and I was stoically sitting in the pew, just thinking about her and how much I'll miss her. After the service, when I was alone, I completely lost my shit. I loved that woman, dammit. She was awesome.Anyway, if you're still reading, sorry for the overshare. What I'm getting at is that I loved how this book made me feel normal. It's well-researched, well-written, and engaging, and I'm incredibly glad that I read it. I think that it will... maybe not CHANGE my life, so much as improve it. I now know more about why I do certain things, and that's empowering. I can relate better to my boyfriend (an extrovert), and in my new job, and in social situations. And I can try to work on the things that I now recognize hinder me more than help me. Definitely a fascinating read. Highly recommended. "
139,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,5,"So...Just read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, (2012) by Susan Cain, Crown Publishers.I liked this book, and why not -- an in-depth defense of people like me! Although I confess, I never thought that introverts would need to be explained to extroverts. I thought we were self-evident, and it was the other, noisy, dominant half of the world that was inexplicable. (They still are.) It possibly needs a companion volume -- Noisy: the hegemony of people with nothing helpful to say who still won't shut up, or something. (Cue reality TV, talk radio, and horrible crush parties with loud music, where you couldn't hear anyone even if they were interesting.) Anyway.This made a curious juxtaposition with my last-read book Fossil Horses. MacFadden, a scientist, argued like a scientist; Cain, a lawyer, argues like a lawyer. I discern the differences even as I appreciate the advocacy. Cain develops her case through illustrative anecdotes, and references to science, psychology, and history as needed. Very readable. I confess, I hadn't thought of extroversion as the American cultural ideal, even as I have witnessed plenty of the cited behaviors. My world tends to be divided practically into ""people who read"" and ""everybody else"", which cuts unevenly across the extrovert/introvert divide, with the obvious bias.I sort of want to go out and press this book upon ""everybody else"", but one sees the inherent problem with that. I hope its message can cut through the noise somehow, nonetheless.Recommended.Ta, L."
140,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48197248-stephan,5,"This book helped me understand myself better and made me feel better about myself in a difficult time. I once again learned that every path has a value, also a quiet one and a whispering voice is not less valid, just less loud. Basically already that is more than enough to recommend it.If you consider yourself an introvert and doubt your own worth in comparison with more outgoing or established people, this is for you.If you are in any way interested in the introvert - extrovert spectrum, this will give you some very good understanding. For me the Quiet Revolution is a bit over the top, but that came after the book and doesn't make it any less valuable. "

And yes, please; a bit of Quiet around me would be most Welcome so that I could Hear my own Quietness & Inner Senses ;-)It explained so many things about me, myself and I - in relation to where I stand in this very loud world that surrounds me everywhere. "
142,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"I feel sure Quiet will become the benchmark book on the topic of introversion. This is because it not only thoroughly explains introversion but champions it. It’s a book by an introvert for introverts, to help them understand themselves and feel proud of who they are. It’s also a book for extroverts, but especially those extroverts who are convinced that introversion is a flaw. Cain will have them wishing they were introverts. Quiet is inarguably biased in favor of introversion, but that’s the point. Up to one-half of Americans are introverted. It’s absurd that introversion is scoffed at as much as it is. The time has come for the introverted label to be a compliment rather than a criticism. This book is a leap in that direction.Cain covered many facets of introversion, from the intriguing “highly sensitive” subset (which describes about 20% of all introverts) to differences in the Eastern and Western worlds to the introverted child (specifically in the classroom, which favors extroverts). Also explored is the age-old question of nature versus nurture and brain differences between extroverts and introverts--plus more. I greatly enjoyed the Eastern versus Western section. America, and the Western world in general, has what Cain dubs an “Extrovert Ideal.” The opposite is true in the East. Whereas in the West, introversion is viewed as a weakness to be conquered, in the East, it’s considered a strength; extroversion is frowned upon, viewed as something that must be tamed. The general sentiment is that extroverts are overwhelming people, wasting others’ time with empty chatter. It’s in this section that Cain profiled Don Chen, an Asian-American student studying at Harvard business school, a very extroverted place. He’s the embodiment of introversion and must feign extroversion daily to get through his classes and general life as part of the school. Feigning extroversion is draining, and Chen needs solitude every day to recharge. This is how it is for all introverts, and Cain stressed repeatedly that it’s not a defect, just a difference. Chen has an intimate group of friends (entirely Asian-American save for one introverted white American man). He’s keenly aware of the differences between his little group and his extroverted classmates. He notes how frequently the extroverts participate in classes while he rarely does and how boisterous they are when together in the cafeteria. Though he admires some of their qualities, he mostly doesn’t understand them. In his mind, they disrespectfully waste classmates’ and professors’ time with their talk, failing to get to the point quickly. If this section sounds borderline racist, it isn’t. Rather, it recognizes that different cultures value different qualities and is a powerful example of introversion as a desirable trait. Chen’s story is one of many in this enlightening book. To support all points, Cain profiled real people, some living, some dead (such as Rosa Parks and Dale Carnegie). The (carefully indexed) research is fascinating in itself, but the real-life examples supporting her research are vital. They round out Quiet to push it beyond dry textbook. I’d read a lot about introversion before reading Quiet, and I bypassed this book for years because others said it offers nothing new on the topic. Readers who’ve read numerous books on the topic or have researched the topic extensively may feel this way. I didn’t. In each chapter, I learned--and was utterly engrossed. Introverts will find Quiet relatable and affirming. Extroverts will find Quiet demystifies introverts thoroughly and will appreciate them more. Both will find it extremely illuminating."
143,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36434323-melindam,4,"3,6 starsWell.... as I am an introvert, I obviously need to comtemplate before writing a review, right? :)But all in all, I am glad I listened to this book. The narrator was excellent.Also, it was a very interesting, insightful, informative read and of course there were lots of issues raised to which I could totally relate, even though sometimes I was a bit confused about what Susan Cain was ultimately trying to prove.I wish I could have read this book as a I teenager as well as my extrovert mother! :)I am from Central-Eastern Europe, so of course not all things ""translate"" directly into how society is working in Hungary as opposed to how things are in the US, but the personal issues are there and are quite universal."
144,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose,5,"This has been probably the one review I've been most intimidated to write for the longest time, and it's not because Susan Cain's ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" isn't a strongly asserted and powerful work. I could sing its respective praises for days. The fact of the matter is - this book really hit me at the heart of my core for so many measures in my life as an introvert. I find it hard to expound just how much this book had an impact on me personally.I could tell you about many things about my person that embody me as an introvert. That I'm quiet spoken and don't speak unless I have something important to say. That small talk isn't something I'm comfortable that I'm not fond of confrontations (though many of you have read my extended written rants about various matters of controversy with very little hesitation). That I tend to spend time alone to recharge my batteries even when I'm called to do things in any scale of extroversion. That my emotional intelligence is very high and I can sympathize/emphathize with people for matters of their experience (though this also makes me highly sensitive).For most of my life, I've been told that these very natural matters of my disposition were wrong. And goodness forbid did that make my life complicated because I didn't feel like people understood who I was. I was even led to believe that I was actually shy, not introverted (many people confuse the two, there is a difference.) Yet the more I learned about the dynamic of introversion and extroversion and how they functioned, I realized that the fundamental difference between them were the derived sources of energy that one functions with in day to day living. That there's nothing wrong with being introverted versus extroverted in a society that - in mainstream notations, champions the latter.This book had me thinking for days after I finished it.I liked that Cain's narrative focuses on the positive contributions and the inherent strengths that lie in introversion because it's widely stereotyped. That stereotyping actually harms our society more than we ourselves may realize in the daily grind, not just individually. By trying to mold people into one acceptable standard, we often lose out on what unique strengths and contributions one may have from going away from such a standard. Narratives like ""Quiet"" have relevance not just in recognizing the distinct psychological functions and differences we have as individuals, but also in the relationships and contributions we have in our professions, our activities, and even wider perceptions of our society in general.I appreciated the expansion on famous figures like Rosa Parks in terms of her backstory and identity as an introvert and how that shaped her responses (I'll have to pick up ""Quiet Strength"" at some point). I also appreciated hearing Cain's own struggles with coming to terms with her introversion, and even the story of the Harvard Business student. There are so many individual stories in this narrative and Cain gives a thorough examination of the details within. It's amazing just how much work and thought went into expounding these issues and individual narratives. This narrative examines introversion not only as a social construct, but individual - delving into narratives of biological, psychological, and sociological importance. There's an examination on the level of intorversion among different cultures, how introspection is valuable to creativity versus ""groupthink"", how extroversion and introversion are not mutually exclusive (and situations that call for each). I came out of it all with not only a fresh perspective on how valuable introverts are to the fabric of society, but also a greater sense of self-worth for my own traits. And that's something to be thankful for. My hope is that with more people who pick up ""Quiet"" and realize how important our individual attributes are, that it'll provide for more opportunities to be creative and to value each other in our relationships regardless of differences, for our unique strengths regardless of how their expressed or from where they come.Overall score: 5/5 stars"
145,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,4,"There are a load of books I've marked ""to be reviewed"", and just completely ignored - it was 2013 when I read this! - so here goes, let's make the list a bit smaller.Here's the moment where I'm supposed to tell you I'm an introvert, so let's get that out of the way: obviously I am. My credentials include cheerfully working from home, getting overstimulated in quiet libraries, and keeping in touch with my closest friends almost entirely by snail mail. I have been known to feel oversocialised sitting in a darkened room, listening to people two rooms away watch a film.As far as a lot of media is concerned, I may as well be a pet hamster. ""Care for your introvert."" Try not to interrupt them. Don't go in their nest while they're sleeping. Offer them a way out when you're at a party, in case they run out of carrot sticks and want to go home. I may as well also be a complete rarity: a third of people don't get hissy when you take their carrot sticks away; come the fuck on.So, what I liked about Quiet was that it didn't make me feel like a special snowflake or someone's hamster.But also... the section on introversion in leadership and the workplace has actually boosted my confidence a lot (apart from being really interesting). I've worked for a few people, and the times it's worked best have been the times where they give me a broad, bullet-pointed list of what they want to have happened by what time, and then they go away until that time. The best boss I ever had used to say it was a good day if we never spoke to each other except when one of us brought the other coffee - and I was inclined to agree with him. Faced with common-sense-logic, which seems to say that 5000 feedback sessions and an open-plan office with communal ball-pit are what millennials are looking for, I wanted this narrative. It was useful to hear. Maybe it's less useful if you're the sort of person who's been reading this sort of thing for years. For me, it was a helpful reminder.I remember a little interesting neurological detail, but not a lot - I can get more than that keyword-searching the Scientific American website, if I want to - and a fair bit of interesting historical anecdote. I remember coming away with a renewed respect for anyone who parents, especially by themselves, as well as a sense of purpose about working for myself and by myself - which I'm happy to say I'm now doing. It turns out, a lot of the time, that people who contract you for work over the internet don't really give a shit about your sparkling and gracious personality. They just want to know you're conscientious and you know what you're talking about and you'll do things when you say you will. I vaguely credit Susan Cain with giving me the impetus to go and do what I want to do, and not to feel like I have to be constantly nice to people I don't know. Now I just think, it's okay, I have character, and then put my headphones back in."
146,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5524572-kristin-hackett-superspacechick,4,"As a self proclaimed introvert, I've been meaning to read this book for so long. My sister in law gave me a copy for Christmas so I prioritized it as a January read and I'm so glad I did. I really enjoyed the in depth look at what constitutes an introvert vs. an extrovert. Quiet even redefined the meaning of the word sensitive for me. I've never considered myself sensitive before but to pull a quote, ""highly sensitive people tend to be keen observers who look before they leap. They arrange their lives in ways that limit surprises. They’re often sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, pain, coffee... Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments—both physical and emotional—unusually deeply. They tend to notice subtleties that others miss—another person’s shift in mood, say, or a lightbulb burning a touch too brightly.""- this is 100% spot on for me. While I do agree with a lot of what Susan Cain wrote, I do think it's difficult to classify people into only one of two categories. She did stress that just because someone is an introvert, it doesn't mean that 1) they got there the same way as someone else or 2) that both people will have exactly the same traits. There are still variables to consider. Overall, I loved that Quiet is a celebrated look at introversion and the strengths that those with introverted qualities possess. There were a few anecdotes that weren't the most interesting (or relevant like the chapter on raising children), but I still found value in reading them. "

She has helped me understand myself more and I am glad of that. Introverts don't like novelty and the first day of school is usually traumatic as mine was. As children, introverts like to daydream, play inside and their feelings are easily hurt. ""They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. . ."" They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy and fear."" They "". . . tend to speak softly because that's how they prefer others to communicate with them.""Shy people hate confrontations and will avoid them at all costs and the author believes it is better so.

All while a deeply gifted thinker who prefers to be in his/her head is described as lacking these traits. Looking at it from an evolutionary standpoint, there is a reason why introverts exist, so why do we rate it as second best? Being a true-blue introvert, I turned to Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a world that can’t stop talking” to answer these questions (and maybe propose new ones). Susan Cain divides “Quiet” into four main sections with the first focusing on the history and description of the rise of extroverts, the differences in leadership styles of introverts and extroverts, and the myths surrounding them. This section begins “Quiet” with a slow and unmemorable beginning. Cain focuses more of an effort on real-life case studies versus actual scientific studies, bypassing any professional data or even her own opinions. The studies which are mentioned are not “earth-shattering” in depth nor do they truly correlate to her hypothesis. In fact, much of the hypothesis is lost and the flow is not seamless or clear. On one hand, this makes the reading understandable and accessible for the less scientifically-inclined reader, but to others craving more research; Cain leaves something to be desired. Some of Cain’s examples which could be perceived as “witty” (Craig Newark of Craigslist fame, Dr. Suess, and Moses from the Bible) are underdeveloped and also lose connection with the hypothesis. Cain is often abrupt and cuts herself short. Furthermore, many of the chapters begin in the same exact way (both format and creativity) which is tedious and creates a loss of interest. The second section of “Quiet” describes some of the brain and neurological aspects of introverts featuring more science than the first section. Cain’s work is a bit more compelling in this respect and certainly more interesting. However, it still isn’t clear what she is trying to prove as she mostly just describes how introverts “are”. Plus, most of the findings are self-explanatory and even obvious. Again, the reader will not be blown away. I have read MANY “brain books” (psychology/neurology, science, and biology) and generally, I am left both flabbergasted and repeating information I’ve read to anyone who will listen. This was not the case with “Quiet” as only a small dose of information felt standout. As the second portion progresses, Cain does present tests and experimentation results more confidentially (however, there is a lack of elaboration). The third section of “Quiet” is comparatively shorter, as Cain explains the conformities and values of the Asian cultures while in the fourth section, Cain offers tips and lifestyle adaptations for introverts in various areas such as work, romance, parenting, play, etc. At this point, “Quiet” appears to be more of a self-help book. The latter end of the book is overly focused on parenting and schooling of children causing me to feel alienated and distanced (having no children). Furthermore, the “Conclusion” is weak and sums up the book which actually reinforces how few points are made. Simply, “Quiet"" is not what I expected. Instead of explaining “why” introverts are the way they are; Cain described “how” they are with an absence of data I would have preferred. All in all though, it has been confirmed (which I already knew) that I am indeed an introvert."
149,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A lance is broken for the needs of introverted people Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Whether one opposes the sanguine with the phlegmatic nature, the wild daredevil the thoughtful inventor or merely the introversion the extroversion, the temperament is and remains in specific proportions decisive for a human being. The author has re-examined this fact with an unconventional approach, opening up exciting and critical viewing angles. Times are changing. In the 19th century, it was still commonplace to be modest, humble and unobtrusive. Starting from the advertising industry in the 1920s and 1930s, it continued to run to the idealistic goal of total superficiality. Ads began to play with people's fear of the negative connotations of ominous, alien observers, and the appearance and ability to attract more and more attention. The new religion of narcissism was supported by an entrepreneurial mentality that understood handshaking qualities, dazzling rhetoric, and slick eloquence as signs of business qualification.Thus, when the loudest and most risk-taking specimens of the managerial species, elite colleges that encourage elbow mentality-driven, superficial behavior, occupy key positions, one or the other financial market collapse is no longer surprising. The flowers of this development on the example of today's America could seem bizarre if the consequences were not so serious. Thus, adjectives such as shy and quiet or just hints of a sly-boy mentality are dismissed as entirely negative and peculiar. Whether in school, work or private life, who does not understand playing on the highly sophisticated keyboard of interpersonal communication, quickly falls through the typical rust. Sensitive children, even as babies, are prone to intensified reactions to external stimuli, are more empathetic and need seeming timidity as a protective mechanism against a formally overwhelming universe. At the same time, individuals naturally endowed with a more robust psychic scaffolding sound lighthearted, but also more emotionless, to their surroundings.Parents of quieter, a manageable circle of friends their naming and lonely hobbies devoted children are remembered, not only subtle, the importance of popularity and dazzling charm. However, very peculiar that silent children are put under depression or misanthropic suspicion, while too vital, joyful young people are sedated with Ritalin. If the favors of loneliness have been well into adulthood, there is a wide range of seminars that can enhance eloquence, demeanor, and be talking skills to the point of sales genius. Several relationship problems are likely based on the well measurable differences between different natures, even by MRI. While extroverts can bathe in crowds every awaken minute and shy away from loneliness, the relationship is reversed by introverts. This involves interpersonal explosives in itself when the mantra of the attractive opposites once no longer pulls, and the supposed truce of the relationship beginning is over. Additional spontaneous emotional responses provoke the fact that extroverts interpret specific aggressive behavior as interest and attention while introverts feel injured and attacked. Assessing the damage caused to the economy by incorrectly designing work processes and their surroundings is difficult or even impossible. If one adds the increased disinclination of introverts in a loud open-plan atmosphere, including the wasted potential, because gifted thinkers find no peace to work out ideas and concepts undisturbed, the overall economic damage can be immense. The cultural differences show a contrarian approach of the Asians, where a European-American behavior style is considered a stupid waste of time for listeners. Tranquility and contemplation have a different meaning, superficiality and the glorification of narcissistic principles are considered less desirable. Another, quite thoughtful approach.Eine Lanze gebrochen für die Bedürfnisse der introvertierten MenschenansammlungsvermeiderOb man dem sanguinischen das phlegmatische Naturell entgegenstellt, dem wilden Draufgänger den nachdenklichen Tüftler oder schlicht der Introvertiertheit die Extrovertiertheit, das Temperament ist und bleibt zu bestimmten Anteilen maßgebend für einen Menschen. Die Autorin hat diesen Umstand mit einer unkonventionellen Herangehensweise neu beleuchtet und damit interessante und kritische Betrachtungswinkel eröffnet.So ändern sich die Zeiten. War es im 19 Jahrhundert noch gang und gäbe, bescheiden, demütig und unaufdringlich zu sein, begann, ausgehend von der Werbeindustrie, in den 1920er und 1930er Jahren, ein bis heute andauernder Lauf auf das ideelle Ziel der totalen Oberflächlichkeit. Anzeigen begannen mit der Angst der Menschen vor negativen Assoziationen ominöser, fremder Beobachter zu spielen und das Äußere sowie die Fähigkeit zu gefallen, immer mehr ins Rampenlicht zu rücken. Unterstützung fand die neue Religion des Narzissmus von einer Unternehmermentalität, die Handschlagqualitäten, blendende Rhetorik und aalglatte Eloquenz als Zeichen betriebswirtschaftlicher Qualifikation auffasste. Wenn auf diese Weise immer die lautesten und risikofreudigsten Exemplare der Managerspezies, von zu ellbogenmentalitätsgesteuerten, oberflächlichen Verhalten animierenden Elitehochschulen, Schlüsselpositionen besetzen, verwundert der eine oder andere Finanzmarktkollaps gar nicht mehr.Die Blüten dieser Entwicklung am Beispiel des heutigen Amerikas könnten skurril anmuten, wären die daraus resultierenden Konsequenzen nicht derart gravierend. So werden Adjektive wie schüchtern und ruhig oder nur Andeutungen einer Eigenbrötlermentalität als durchwegs negativ und absonderlich abgetan. Sei es in Schule, Beruf oder Privatleben, wer nicht versteht auf der hochkomplexen Klaviatur zwischenmenschlicher Kommunikation zu spielen, fällt leicht einmal durch den sozialen Rost.Sensible Kinder neigen schon als Babys zu verstärkten Reaktionen auf äußere Reize, sind einfühlsamer und benötigen die scheinbare Furchtsamkeit als Schutzmechanismus gegen ein sie mit Eindrücken förmlich erschlagendes Universum. Gleichzeitig wirken von Natur aus mit einem robusteren psychischen Gerüst ausgestattete Individuen unbeschwerter, aber auch emotionsloser auf ihre Umgebung. Eltern ruhiger, einen überschaubaren Freundeskreis ihr Eigen nennender und sich einsamen Hobbies widmender Kinder werden, nicht nur durch die Blume, an die Wichtigkeit von Beliebtheit und blendendem Charme erinnert. Doch sehr eigentümlich, dass stille Kinder unter Depressions- oder Misanthropiegeneralverdacht gestellt werden, während allzu vitale, lebensfrohe junge Menschen mit Ritalin sediert werden.Sollte sich die Favorisierung der Einsamkeit bis ins Erwachsenenalter durchgeschlagen haben, gibt es eine breite Palette an Seminarangeboten, die Beredsamkeit, Auftreten und Plauschkompetenzen bis hin zum Verkaufsgenie steigern können. Etliche Beziehungsprobleme dürften auf den, auch per MRT gut messbaren Unterschieden zwischen verschiedenen Naturellen basieren. Während Extrovertierte jede wache Minute in Menschenmengen baden könnten und Einsamkeit scheuen, kehrt sich das Verhältnis bei Introvertierten um. Das birgt zwischenmenschlichen Sprengstoff in sich, wenn das Mantra von den sich anziehenden Gegensätzen einmal nicht mehr richtig zieht und der vermeintliche Waffenstillstand des Beziehungsbeginns vorüber ist. Zusätzliche spontane emotionale Reaktionen provoziert die Tatsache, dass Extrovertierte bestimmtes, aggressives Verhalten als Interesse und Aufmerksamkeit interpretieren, während Introvertierte sich verletzt und angegriffen fühlen.Den für die Wirtschaft entstandenen Schaden durch falsche Konzeption von Arbeitsabläufen samt deren Umgebungen einzuschätzen mutet schwer bis unmöglich an. Wenn man die verstärkte Krankheitsneigung Introvertierter in lauter Großraumbüroatmosphäre inklusive dem verschwendeten Potential, weil begnadete Denker keine Ruhe finden, um Ideen und Konzepte ungestört ausarbeiten zu können, addiert, dürfte der gesamtvolkswirtschaftliche Schaden immens sein.Die kulturellen Unterschiede zeigen eine konträre Herangehensweise der Asiaten, bei denen ein europäisch-amerikanisches Gebaren als unhöfliche Verschwendung der Zeit von Zuhörern gewertet wird. Ruhe und Kontemplation haben eine andere Bedeutung, Oberflächlichkeit und die Verherrlichung narzisstischer Prinzipien gelten als wenig erstrebenswert. Ein anderer, durchaus in Erwägung zu ziehender Ansatz."

Susan Cain, former Wall Street lawyer and self-described introvert, investigates how introversion has become dangerously scorned in the current American ""Culture of Personality."" I had not fully realized how drastically our cultural values have shifted--and how much American society pushes us to conform--until reading Cain's book. To prove her point, Cain visits American bastions of extroversion promotion, including Harvard Business School, Saddleback Church, Dale Carnegie, Wall Street, and Tony Robbins conferences. She talks with pioneering psychologists and neurologists to explain the studies behind concepts like the dangers of group think, the ability to delay gratification, or the trait called sensitivity. She profiles famous and less-well known introverts to show how the studies play out in real life.Though the many of the activities I'm drawn to (and the things that cause anxiety) scream classic introvert, I have always considered myself an extrovert and frequently put myself in situations where extroverted behavior is valued. However, since quitting my job and globe-hopping for the past two years, I've been surprised (and disappointed) by how often the constant stimulation, new people, and change can drain me--and by how I often feel an overwhelming need for alone time.I found myself relating to many of the points Cain discusses and have since concluded that I'm much more of an introvert than I had thought. (I promise that this isn't just because she does a good job of highlighting all the positive things about introverts!)So for that, I am grateful to have read Quiet, though I can't quite believe it took reading a book to figure that out about myself! I am seeing my preferences in a new light and have much understanding and acceptance regarding the things that interest me (and those that cause me stress). I've been having trouble narrowing down 'what I want to do with my life' and this book has helped me more than any other, because I finally feel like I can accept that the things I really enjoy are just a part of me and can't be ignored. Though the personal application will differ, I suspect many people will come away having learned much more than they expected, if not about themselves, then about people close to them. I had always thought of extroverts and introverts as being on distinct sides of a line, when in fact it's much more of a sliding scale (or perhaps better as two scales: percentage introversion, percentage extroversion). Because we have been culturally pressured and trained to admire extroverted behavior, many of us may be dangerously ignoring our introverted characteristics. This was a game-changing book for me, and I suspect it will be eye-opening to most people who read it."
151,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,5,"I love reading on Friday nights, writing on Saturday afternoons, and having quiet get-togethers on Sunday. But I also enjoy giving presentations at school, tutoring peers in writing, and interacting with various people online and in real life. I'd describe myself as an introvert (and my Meyers-Briggs personality type agrees), though both introverts and extroverts would enjoy this fascinating book by Susan Cain. She provides an intriguing, in-depth perspective on introversion, its connotation in contrasting cultures, and the psychology behind it.A profusion of the nonfiction I've read has contained too much of something - too many random anecdotes, too much scientific jargon, too many unnecessary statistics or explanations. But Quiet has the perfect blend of personal anecdotes, interesting analysis, detailed explanations, and compelling statistics. Cain references various studies conducted by psychologists and discusses several aspects related to introversion, such as the extrovert ideal, how extroverts and introverts can compliment each other and work together, nature v. nature, etc. Here's one passage about sensitive people (who tend to be more introverted) that struck a chord with me:""The other thing Aron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they're highly empathic. It's as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people's emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world. They tend to have unusually strong consciences. They avoid violent movies and TV shows; they're acutely aware of the consequences of a lapse in their own behavior. In social settings they often focus on subjects like personal problems, which others consider 'too heavy'.""I guess I have an excuse for exposing so much of myself on my blog, huh? Anyway, Cain delves into other subjects that are intellectually stimulating too, such as the three things she thinks are important in identifying one's personal project. She even brings up the relationship between Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other famous historical figures.Overall, highly recommended to everyone curious about their own temperaments and how to embrace their natural personalities. One of the best works of nonfiction I've read.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

I was really excited to read it, because I knew this book was very popular. Also, I love nonfiction. I love the ability to learn from a book.I believe I learned from this book. It was interesting to hear why my best friend, who is one of the biggest introverts ever fits perfectly with me (I'm a huge extravert). Also, it was interesting to hear what you can do to help someone with stage fright preform at their best.However, I felt the book repeated itself. Many times I wondered what new information could possibly be discussed, and a lot of times there wasn't really any new information. It just talked about the same material in a circle from a different angle.A lot of the time I felt like this book was written so introverts could feel validated for being an introvert and that they weren't anti-social. They just need socialization in a completely different way than extroverts."

It's perhaps not a surprise that Susan Cain, the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking identifies herself as an introvert. Being quiet, introverted or shy is still seen by many as a problem or handicap to overcome so I can see her motivation for writing it.One this book's premises is that in the last 50 years or so, the Western world moved from a culture of character to a culture of personality, which according to the author has given an advantage to people that enjoyed outgoing, uninhibited personalities. We tend to admire and reward people that exhibit the most gregarious, outgoing traits of extroverts while at the same time undermined and misunderstand those that are most typically seen in more introverted individuals.
Introversion is really about having a preference for lower stimulation environments. So it's just a preference for quiet, for less noise, for less action. Whereas extroverts really crave more stimulation in order to feel at their best.
The author explains that Introversion is a spectrum, and that most of us don't fully fit into an introvert/extrovert definition. It also provides a sort of ""survival guide"" for introverts to help us learn how to better deal with the pressures of living in a world that for the most part rewards those that are extroverts.
Many people believe that introversion is about being antisocial, and that's really a misperception. Because actually it's just that introverts are differently social. So they would prefer to have a glass of wine with a close friend as opposed to going to a loud party full of strangers.
This book helped me understand myself better, identify those traits that makes many of us ""introverts"" different and learn how to use them to our advantage, both on our professional and personal lives. The book is entertaining and well written. If you are interested in learning about introverts, perhaps because you feel like one or someone closed to you does, this book might be of interest to you.After reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking my conclusion is that the world needs both extroverts and introverts and that we all have a role to play.Here's a link to the author's TED TALK which is sort a summarized version of the book:http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_t..."

And the whole idea about needing time out to recover from socialising - I always thought I was just a bit odd, haha.The criticisms that are quite rightly levelled at this book about preaching some kind of binarism between extrovert and introvert are understandable, and am I'm sure that we are all a little too complex for a poorly designed set of questions to provide any sort of sensible analysis or categorisation (would still like to see the questions though...) Most people will be surely be somewhere close to 'ambivert' even if they know themselves to be introverted at heart. For me a major part of young socialisation and growing up was learning to act like an extrovert, if nothing else just to stop people trying to 'bring me out of my shell' or constantly asking what's up as I am 'being quiet'."
155,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena,4,"I really liked this book, especially the beginning part. I so needed to read it. For years people have been telling me to come out of my shell and to be more outgoing and I realized I had definitely playing the role of pseudo-extrovert all this time! I enjoyed reading the fact that we introverts actually have power and hidden strengths. The list of famous introverts surprised me, Rosa Parks, Al Gore and Gandhi in particular. The book also shared some insight into the thinking patterns of extroverts. All in all, it was an interesting book though the end did drag on a bit."

157,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5470914-sam,1,"This was the most painful book I have read this summer. I choked it down like bad medicine page after page. Quiet is great self affirmation for someone who considers themselves an introvert, and sees humans as either an extrovert or introvert. Cain certainly thinks she’s the poster child of an introvert, or is she? The book reads like a memoir in parts where she tells stories of her own life, then there are smatterings or small examples in specific parts of people’s lives of how greatness comes in quiet e.g. Steve Wozniak, Gandhi, Rosa Parks. Cain also fancies herself a bit of a child psychologist, on one hand it’s ok for kids to be shy or in their shell, these aren’t bad things, and very normal, but on the other hand we need to nudge and push slowly to get kids out of their quiet place. So which is it?It doesn’t bother me that Cain isn’t a psychologist or economist, but she’s talking through both sides of her mouth, the book is a pity party, she thinks the decisions in modern workplaces are influenced by highly extroverted personalities like those from the Harvard Business School. There’s no backing for this other than the fact that business students are extroverts. Additionally the economic crisis was wholly the fault of extroverts, basically extroverts with their loud voices overpowered the brilliant quiet hardworking, and smart introverts and ran the economy to the ground. I’m afraid you really aren’t brilliant if something has already happened and you didn’t do anything to stop it. In hindsight everything is 20/20, just because you are quiet and something bad is happening saying “I knew it!” doesn’t do much. The circlejerk continues when Cain bangs on about everyone who a douche as being an extrovert. Good guys are introverts, Warren Buffet because of his one speech about the dot com bubble bursting was quiet and well calculated in his words. The rest of the word are greedy businessmen. There’s some sample or thin slicing in her discussions that I find problematic, and read a bit like a tabloid. Susan Cain is clearly appealing to an audience that is already sold to introversion, and stroking those egos. I wish the book had more solutions instead of harping about how bad people are. The book blurs it’s lines through many genres, self help, psychology and a dash of group-think. I consider myself an introvert, but also an extrovert, yes I do believe brilliance happens in unaccompanied activities like running. I charge my batteries during times like this but I also don’t “suffer in silence”. I don’t believe people are fully introverted or extroverted. Reading Khaneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and Mcgonigal’s Willpower Instinct make Cain’s book look hurriedly and thoughtlessly written, there’s little appeal to science. "
158,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,3,"I expected to love, love, love this book. After all, psychology is one of my passions. Also, I am always interested in hearing from some group. And this is saying, ""We, the introverts, are speaking out.""However, the book was neither as powerful nor as interesting as I was hoping....Cain does a great job of blending together different aspects. The three main angles she uses are:1.) Famous people who were introverts. She usually starts her chapters with a story about a wonderful famous person we all know and adore - and then explaining how they were introverted. Rosa Parks, Dale Carnegie, and Eleanor Roosevelt are some of the examples she used.2.) Case studies. This is the real life introvert ""Jane Doe."" She was on this job and thought she would have to quit because she just wasn't outgoing enough. Then she learned that being an introvert was like having a secret superpower! And then she used her introversion to overcome all obstacles! Now she's rich and/or happy. Success!3.) Science - hard and soft. Cain uses both psychology and biology to try and explain the differences between extroverts and introverts. She also explains why introversion might be valuable in evolution and natural selection. She has a fascinating chapter on culture, which emphasizes that although extroversion is worshiped in the USA, many Asian countries value silence, reflection, and understanding over cheerfulness, enthusiasm, and talkativeness. ...This book is at it's best when Cain is exploring how introversion is a valuable and worthy trait or way of being. When she journeys into different places to see how introversion is treated differently there. When she explores how introversion can be a survival aid in the wild and how introverted people can be powerful in their own way.It's exciting and interesting to realize that extroversion - while venerated in America - is actually seen as crass and dumb in many Asian cultures.And it's fun and cool to see different theories of how introverted people and animals are strong in Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection. I liked seeing different species and the benefits and drawbacks they experience from being extroverted or introverted. And I enjoyed seeing how introversion could be a kick-butt evolutionary trait which is often overlooked or thought to be something that needed 'killing off.'I thought about 2/3 of the book were weak, though. For instance, I already know enough about famous figures and do not particularly want or need to read a short biography or story about them. Another thing that bugged me were her ""real life introversion stories."" Here is how an introvert struggled. Here is how he learned to embrace his true self and be happy/rich.The whole book just felt like a big pat on the back. ""Don't worry, introverts, you're okay! Everything's okay! It might seem like the world hates you, but use your strengths! You are really amazing.""And it's not even like I DISAGREE with this message, it's simply that I was expecting more than a rather thinly-veiled self-help book. P.S. I really like the page or two that Cain dedicates to exploring Moses (an alleged introvert) and Aaron (his extroverted mouthpiece). It is also interesting when she lightly touches on whether or not the Church and modern-day Protestants shun and punish introverts as not doing the Lord's work. I like when she questions whether Jesus was an introvert or extrovert (covered in one paragraph, very shallow) and questions whether the Church is pushing an incorrect message on it's followers. (""Real Christians proselytize! How can you be a REAL Christian if you are not gregarious?"") I also like when she uses the teachings and life of Gandhi to emphasize that passivity is NOT submissiveness. All these subjects were things I wished she'd explored in greater depth."

All these adjectives and more describe my experience with this amazing book.I'm very much an introvert. I try to avoid social functions as much as possible, but I do love meeting every so often with my dear friends one-on-one. If I do end up at a party, you can bet I'm the one keeping the corner warm. I am an avid reader, a knitter, a sometimes writer, a nerd, and an engineer. My idea of a perfect evening is one spent in the comfort of my apartment, cat in lap, book in hand, coffee at my side. My idea of a perfect vacation is one where I can go to my favorite coffee shop and read. In college, my favorite classes were Differential Equations (in which I, the only female, got a perfect score on the final), Physics, and Fluids. Ever since elementary school, I dreaded a school performances, such as Christmas programs or poetry recitals. At work meetings, I am more likely to listen to everything and be note-taker than I am to present or volunteer ideas.Lately, my boss has said that I need to step things up, become more ""out there"" and confident. Inwardly, I despaired. Wasn't I working hard enough? What was holding me back? Why couldn't I just blurt things out in meetings? Why did I constantly sound nervous, even if I really wasn't? Was there any hope for me to change?And then, like a sign from heaven, I saw this book in the ""New Books"" display at Barnes and Nobles (BTW, I happen to swing by the bookstore at least once a week during lunch - sometimes to purchase, but mostly to pass the time). I remembered a friend had read this and really enjoyed it, and I figured it would help me figure out myself.""Figure myself out"" would be an understatement; it's as if this book were written specifically for me! Cain breaks down what it means to be an introvert. Turns out despite what my sister is constantly telling me, I'm not weird (alright, not too weird). I have talents and skills. I have a place. And it's not my fault I can't always speak up and make my voice heard. A lot of it is because of how our workforce, our employers, our coworkers, our society functions. Our biology, our parents, our surroundings make us the introverted beings we are. It's just that school and work and the outside world try to tell us that being quiet, that listening and ruminating over things is wrong, that we should be quick to speak and blurt whatever is on our mind.I've known I was an introvert for a while, but it was so refreshing and liberating to learn that there were others with my ""problem"". That I wasn't alone. And, most importantly, I can overcome, nay thrive, in this Extroverted world. And that is the second gift Cain gives us in this book: how to be an Introvert in an Extrovert world and not want to choke yourself at night.I feel like, after reading Quiet, I have a plan for facing my ""work problems"". I feel like I can take the challenge my boss has placed in front of me and succeed. Although a part of me still wishes I could crawl back to my desk and burrow there, I think this book has given me the tools and encouragement I need to speak up.If you are an introvert, you definitely need to read this book. Even if you aren't an introvert, this is a great book to understanding how they think and act. I'm definitely passing this along to everyone I know."
160,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Years ago, my division manager at work had everybody in the division take the Meyer Briggs personality test. Then we spent time in a workshop, to understand the implications of our personality types. One of the dimensions of the test is extroversion/introversion (E or I types). This book offers a very satisfying account of what it means to be an introvert. Generally Western cultures admire extroverts, while Asian cultures admire introverts. Both types of personalities offer value to society. Groups of people who are introverts are best with an extroverted leader, while groups of extroverts are best with an introverted leader.Many introverts find it difficult to live in a society that values extroversion more highly. As a result, many introverts pretend to be extroverts in certain social situations. But they cannot maintain this pretension indefinitely, and at some point in time they must ""recharge"" their internal batteries with quiet and solitude. The book makes a major point here: It's perfectly OK to pretend to be an extrovert for periods of time--as long as you do this while you are working at something that you truly love.The book has useful practical advice for introverts. If you are an introvert and your husband or wife is an extrovert, there is much to be said about how to maintain or improve your relationship. If you are raising a child who is an introvert, it is important to understand how to encourage the child to follow his/her innate abilities.Back in the 1940's and 1950's, Alex Osborn was plagued by the lack of creativity in his advertising agency. So, he wrote some books introducing the concept of ""brainstorming"". The idea is for people get together in groups and toss out ideas without fear of ridicule--the more ideas, the better. The problem is, in the 1960's, studies showed that brainstorming is not efficient; you can get more, good ideas if people simply think creatively in solitude. Committees simply are not as productive as the sum of individuals working alone. We are so inculcated with the idea that brainstorming is best--but this is really just a reflection of the dominance of extroversion in our society. "

I felt like it wasn’t as accessible as it could have been. It seems very focused on introverts in or who wish to be in very high powered job roles. Which isn’t my world. I was hoping for a bit more knowledge or ‘self help’ regarding being an introvert in an average every day life, Not as an award winning introverted lecturer, or an introverted Lawyer or CEO."
162,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"It is stated at the start that this book’s purpose is to improve a reader's relationship with others. The book can thus be viewed as a book of the self-help genre. Its aim is to advise introverts on ways by which they can improve their relationships with extroverts, and vice versa. It compares behavioral traits of both introverts and extroverts, showing in what ways they are similar and how they differ. The author mentions books about and summarizes studies related to extroversion and introversion, conducted over the years and up to today. The book begins with a quick test by which readers can determine where they stand on the introvert / extrovert scale. The test takes only a few minutes and gives the reader an immediate connection with the topics to be discussed. Both my husband and I took the test. We both received the same score, indicating that we are both strong introverts. It is interesting to note that although we had the same score, we did not answer all questions in the same way. This led to a lively discussion and a fun start to the book! Twenty questions are to be answered with a yes or a no. The book demonstrates clearly that in America it is the extroverts that hold sway--in the government, in business and in most educational institutions. It is an important and valuable statement that is being made. This is often to the detriment of introverts and to society as a whole. While the author professes the importance and value of both the introvert and the extrovert way of thinking, given the suppression of introverts in society today, it is introverts she lauds most, giving example after example of their accomplishments. I didn’t need to be convinced. For me, it is OBVIOUS that society benefits from the presence of both. The book verges on becoming a manifesto for introverts. This appeals to me no more than society's pronounced favoritism of extroverts! The book accomplishes well what it has set out to do, but I am rarely enthused by books of the self-help genre. It does advise readers on how their relationships can be improved. It also explains how schools can be adapted to better suit the needs of introverts, without hampering the situation for extroverts. I do however find much of the advice given as being rather obvious. The sections I like most are those that are scientifically oriented. I like for example the parts about how the brain functions; sections about the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex and the connection to dopamine are interesting. Many studies are referred to, but how exactly each was performed is skimmed over in too brief a manner. We are told what the results have for implications, but skeptic that I am, I was not always convinced! I need more details. To add depth, opposing points of view should have been added. Intuitively, I agree with the conclusions drawn, but I would have preferred more solid proof. Too many generalizations/simplifications are made. Over and over again we are told that so and so was an introvert and so and so an extrovert. This is all too simple! Individuals are mixes of introvert and extrovert qualities. Instead, an analysis of the tangled mix of traits that make up real people is what I was looking for. At one point Moses is classified as an introvert! This was just too much for me. The author swiftly classifies famous people as being either introvert or extrovert with little analysis of their specific character traits. I find this too categorical. We are told that Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, would never have written the books she wrote and become the ""bold thinker"" that she became had she not been left alone to read books in her youth. Where is the proof in that?! The author generalizes and simplifies all too often. The book is directed primarily toward Americans. I do not appreciate this slant. There is only a brief discussion of Asian American immigrants. Asian Americans of Chinese background are classified as introverts. Europeans are in a bunch grouped with Americans. I would have preferred a more in-depth, nuanced analysis of national and cultural differences.I wish the book had been more globally and more scientifically oriented. It has too many generalizations. It is basically a self-help book, a genre that does not appeal to me, so I guess it is not so bad that I nevertheless felt it to be worth reading. I would have preferred more in-depth analyses concerning how individuals are complicated mixes of introversion and extroversion. We are not one or the other, as was so often stated in reference to the people mentioned. The narration of the audiobook by Kathe Mazur started out very fast, but eventually she slows down. Her rapid speed had me chuckling at the beginning. Why? Because it is the extroverts, not us introverts that talk fast! Didn’t the producers of the audiobook realize the incongruity?! We introverts need time to stop and think and time to examine the ideas floating around in our heads. The narration is easy to follow once Mazur has slowed down. She has a soft, pleasant voice, a perfect match for introverts, the central protagonists of the book. The question is how many extroverts read this book. It is interesting to think about why this may be so."
163,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,5,"This book is very insightful and informative. I watched Susan Cain's TED talk once and I was fascinated being an introvert myself. As a kid I was shy, serious, studious with a little bit of social anxiety and although as I grew up, I outgrew my shyness and got more confident socially, there have been many situations where I questioned myself. Once when I was out on a trip with a big group of college friends, everyone was getting along so well and they seemed to be having so much fun together but I felt so lonely and left out and I was like, ''What's wrong with me''? Turns out I'm just an introvert. Then, I found this book. It describes in detail what introversion and extroversion is and what are the traits associated with both personalities. Where in most areas (or cultures), the introversion or shyness is viewed in a negative light, the writer states that it's an essential trait and how powerful it could be and it should be valued just as extroversion is. I found this book very interesting to read because she presents her ideas by using data gathered from case studies, research and her own personal experiences and from other people. She has also provided analysis of many famous personalities and how their temperaments shaped their actions and how essential their role was. Many definitions are provided for introversion-extroversion and how our genes and our environment play a role in shaping our personalities. There is no personality type better than the other but creating a balance is very important to bring out the best in both. The message in short is- value your individuality and do things the way you want and not because you have to conform to certain cultural norms. It also tells how both personalities can strike a balance between both traits. Also, both extroverts and introverts can lead a fulfilling life without changing their core values or trying to be someone they are not, the power lies in knowing who you are, what your abilities are and using them to the best.After reading this book, I feel like I can understand myself a little better now, what my motivations are and what makes me the way I am. I recommend this book to both introverts and extroverts as it can help them understand the qualities in themselves and in each other."

165,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1230817-lori,5,"I'm really excited about all the works about introverts that's been coming out lately, I think mainly because of this book. I'm not sure if extroverts would have enjoyed this book as much as me, because Cain works hard to prove the merits and necessity of introverts in our society, while down-playing all the reasons why we should have an extrovert ideal. In fact, I think some extroverts would feel a bit offended at this book. But I don't care. I've lived my whole life feeling like there was something wrong with me. I need to speak up, get out there, sell myself, basically become something that I'm not. This book made me realize there's nothing wrong with me, and that I actually have strengths that my extroverted friends, relatives, etc., do not. Instead of constantly seeing myself as disadvantaged because I suck at small talk, don't know how to talk myself up in interviews, and am just a shy person, I just feel like I know myself better. I think teachers should read this book. And I'm going to stop, because this isn't so much as a book review as a blog post or something. This is a total self-help book for introverts. Thank you Cain!**I should also say that Cain uses extensive research and interviews to show the strengths of introverts, so it's actually a pretty scientific book (though made so that it's easy for the every day person like me to understand). I was really surprised at the amount of research done on the differences between introverts and extroverts, especially because the research often shows introverts in a good, positive light, unlike what most people think when they hear the word introvert.

First of all, as far as the audio format goes, they couldn’t have chosen a better narrator. Kathe Mazur’s voice fits the tone of the book perfectly–quiet and measured, yet firm. I basically just want to listen to every audiobook she’s ever narrated. Back to Quiet –I think Susan Cain did a stellar job of exploring the introverted personality type. She sites a number of studies and scientific theories to support her thesis that introversion is an undervalued trait in modern American society. Introverts have just as much to offer the world as extroverts and their unique strengths must be utilized for a society to be truly healthy.

167,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"When I was young, my grandfather, an intelligent farmer, used to call me an introvert, as I sat happily in the corner, spending my free time reading books or writing in my notebooks. I looked up at him, I believe I was around the age of eight or so, with crinkled eyebrows. He explained what it meant. But I didn't have a puzzled look on my face because I didn't understand the word, I was puzzled because he said it like he disapproved. Like it was a bad thing. My aunt, the doctor, immediately came to my defense and said, ""Janine, just tell him that you're not an introvert, you're just introspective."" That became my motto in life. I said it often, mostly because I felt those were big words and others would think I was smart. I never thought about it much later in life until I read this book. Cain talks about the virtues of being an introvert but how society has come to prize the personality traits of the extrovert. Being a pretty extreme extrovert, at first, I didn't think this book was for me. But then I thought back to when I was eight, and realized with shock and I wasn't just a person who could be both, although I was, I am, but I went from one extreme to the other. When I was a child, I was the most introverted person I know. Using the word shy to describe me didn't cut it. I would skip class altogether if I was even a minute late, to avoid the fear of having to walk into the classroom with everyone looking at me. Speeches had me thinking thoughts of jumping out of trees just to break a bone so I could get out of giving the speech. Now, I love nothing better than walking into a room full of strange people. It's just a room full of fifty new friends! And talking in front of people? I have to hold myself back in group exercises just so I don't hog the limelight. How did such a huge change occur? I'll tell you how, because of work, school, and problems socially, I was forced into it. As I began to read this book, I saw a lot of truth in what Cain was saying. Extroverts really are prized now, not just socially but in the workplace as well. At the last company I worked for, I sat in cubicles, was encouraged constantly to hold meetings and ""group think"" up ideas. How different it would have been if I was allowed even one hour a day without interruptions! What has made us so concerned with having these qualities? I am homeschooling my children and every time I come across someone who disapproves it's always because of lack of ""socialization"". My five-year-old son has no trouble talking to anyone and being friendly, I think he gets it from me. But he also loves to play by himself. He might get this from me as well! He creates his best Lego creations when left alone for hours at a time. Why is this a bad thing? As Cain points out, some of the best innovators of our time were quiet thinkers. And we might not have had some of those great inventions or works of art had these people been forced to ""socialize"" as children instead of left alone. And really, what is the big deal with needing socialization being such a big part of schooling? Why can't it be found outside of school? I recently watched a documentary about the current school systems and, as most people know, we (The United States), rank very low in all areas of education. In fact, when American children were tested in various areas against other countries of the world, we consistently ranked on the bottom in almost all areas except one. Can you guess what it is? Self-confidence. American children are said to have the highest self-confidence compared to all other countries. How do we explain this to our children? We're idiots but we have pride! Is this because we're placing such importance on making our children extroverts? Some of the case studies Cain uses to show examples of her theories kept me riveted. She also had a twenty question test in case you weren't sure where you stood. The more traits she gave as examples of introverts and extroverts, the less sure I became of which I was. Ask anyone which I was as a child, they would have said introvert, hands down. Ask anyone I know right now, and in a second they'd say extrovert. So I took her test to see where I stood. I thought I was only doubting myself, and that it would show pretty conclusively that I was an extrovert. But in fact, I was split almost exactly down the middle. I love meeting new people, and often feel energized at the end of a big party. But I also get rejuvinated from having alone time every day. Even back in college, when I was one of the most social people around, my roomates all knew that they risked certain death if they bothered me during my ""break time"". I have no problems going to movies alone, and one of my favorite things to do is go out to lunch or dinner at a nice restaurant with a good book as a dinner companion. People look at me weird, but I could care less. Whenever I go out or have a party my motto is always ""The more the merrier"". So where did I stand on this chart? The advice for public speaking for introverts wasn't going to help me. And to say I should have quit reading the book halfway through because I considered myself an extrovert would have had me missing out on some very interesting information. I really enjoyed this book. And I disagree that this book is only for introverts. I think the biggest benefit this book had for me is the eye opener to how we have been pressured to become more extroverted over the years and how we see this change everywhere, from schools, to the workplace, to advertising, to even moralistic behavior. I think all can benefit from having a greater awareness of this personality trait in everyone they know. If you're an extrovert, wouldn't it benefit you from having a better understanding to where your introverted team leader is coming from? And another realization for me, is how I know see my son, who has the tendency to play alone. I now am more aware of how I treat him, and make sure I no longer fall into that stereotypical reaction of ""Why don't you try harder to make friends?"" routine. There's nothing wrong with being an introvert, and if this book has any major theme, that's it. That being said, even though I very much enjoyed this book, I only gave it three stars for a couple of reasons. First of all, I feel like the middle of the road people such as myself were somewhat ignored. Where do we stand? How do we relate better to people and situations? Then there were the case studies. As I mentioned earlier, they were very interesting and really helped in relating to the particular example's Cain discussed. But after a while, they became tedious, and didn't hold my attention as well as the first half of the book. I still think many can benefit from reading this though. It was fun, and I look forward to discussing it with my book club.  ClassicsDefined.com"
168,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"I never really thought of myself as introverted until relatively recently, within the last year or so, when I declined an invitation to go out with a group of friends to the bar and one of them said ""Fine, be introverted then! Hope you enjoy sitting home alone with your cats!"" (She meant it in a teasing, only partially bitchy way, but I didn't take offense. I DO enjoy sitting home alone with my cats.)My semi-bitchy friend actually helped me define a big part of myself. Until then, I just thought of myself as ""the most anti-social Libra ever"", and poked fun at myself for not wanting to go out all the time, or being overwhelmed by loud, boisterous people, or needing time to just be alone - what my boyfriend calls ""cave-dwelling"". I made these things a joke because, according to society, it's not normal to want to spend so much time alone. I'm supposed to be a fun, out-going social butterfly. The thought exhausts me. So, when I read this, it was like someone opened up my head and singled out these aspects of my personality and then wrote them down. It was fascinating to read this book and learn about myself. I see things about my past in a completely new light. Like the situation above. I'd be more than happy to sit at home with a few friends and drink, but going to a bar to drink among a huge crowd just held no appeal. Or like how I approach my work. The sections of this book pertaining to corporate expectations and office structure were fascinating to me, and really allowed me to look at my job and approach to work differently. I'm a good employee and good at my job, but I don't aspire to be in the limelight. I don't MIND recognition or attention for a job well done, but it's not something I seek out. So, when I was recently offered a job with a new company, I had my choice of being in a ""client liaison"" position or a ""analysis and testing"" position, and I took the latter, even though it's a position with less recognition and lower pay. The thought of having to constantly be professionally social with strangers gives me anxiety, though, so it was a no-brainer for me. But when I discussed my decision with friends, they called me crazy to have turned down the higher paying position. As though money is the only criteria worth considering. (A point that this book makes well.)I'm going to miss the job I'm leaving though, because it did give me a kind of structured socialization. I get along great with my team, and there, I'm far more socially outgoing than I would be otherwise. I've worked with many of these people for several years, I trust and respect them, and they are people I consider real friends. Soon I'll be working 100% from home, so my social interaction will be drastically reduced. I may be introverted, but I do need that interaction. The hard part for me will be actually initiating it. I have a tendency to, uhh, forget to be social. I forget to call and text people, even though I mean to do it. But being social is just never at the forefront of my mind. I'll have to work on that. But then there's online communities, which is a completely different world. I have always been more open and (dare I say it?) chatty online than in my ""real life"" social interactions. Maybe it's the anonymity, or the fact that it's text-based, or the fact that the community I'm in here is one that is full of like-minded people with similar interests. People I can relate and talk to easily. I don't know, but I'm quite different online than off. Offline, I don't really do chit-chat, or small talk, and I'm often at a loss as to what I should say in a light social situation, despite there being 10 dozen possibilities running through my mind. I usually settle for silence, though, because by the time I've thought through a plethora of ""Nice weather"" or ""Your hair looks nice"" nothing comments, it's been an awkwardly long time, and I know it, and anything that I say at that point would just sound forced and fake, so I just... don't. That feeling that I just mentioned, about feeling forced and fake, is such a strong one for me that it sometimes overwhelms me when I really don't want it to, and it often feels to me like I come across as being cold and unfeeling when I really just don't know what to say to show how affected I really am. It was only when the book started talking about being 'sensitive' that it started to click. I've always been overly affected by emotionally charged situations. If you read some of my reviews of tear-jerker books, I mention this frequently. I remember when I was a kid, there was a show called Rescue 911 that my mom liked to watch. It was always some traumatic situation - a car wreck or an injured hiker or a woman trapped in a housefire, etc, and the show focused on the EMTs and firefighters and police called out to help. That show would always make me cry. Always. Every single episode. It didn't matter whether the people made it out OK, or if they all died, I would be in tears. I could just imagine how scary it would be and I had such respect for the kind of people who could deal with that kind of trauma every day and keep it together enough to help. It would all just overwhelm me, and I would cry. My point here, and how this relates to my last paragraph, is that my dad would often poke fun at me for getting upset over the show, and so I learned to hide that I was upset... oftentimes laughing to cover it. Laughing. As I got older into my teens, I just stopped showing that sensitivity in front of others at all, and unfortunately, that's carried over into my adult life. So now, when I feel strong emotions, it's easier for me to let them out when I'm alone, even though it makes me seem heartless to not show them when it's appropriate. Like at my grandma's funeral earlier this year, when my entire extended family was crying and talking and interacting, and I was stoically sitting in the pew, just thinking about her and how much I'll miss her. After the service, when I was alone, I completely lost my shit. I loved that woman, dammit. She was awesome.Anyway, if you're still reading, sorry for the overshare. What I'm getting at is that I loved how this book made me feel normal. It's well-researched, well-written, and engaging, and I'm incredibly glad that I read it. I think that it will... maybe not CHANGE my life, so much as improve it. I now know more about why I do certain things, and that's empowering. I can relate better to my boyfriend (an extrovert), and in my new job, and in social situations. And I can try to work on the things that I now recognize hinder me more than help me. Definitely a fascinating read. Highly recommended. "
169,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,5,"So...Just read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, (2012) by Susan Cain, Crown Publishers.I liked this book, and why not -- an in-depth defense of people like me! Although I confess, I never thought that introverts would need to be explained to extroverts. I thought we were self-evident, and it was the other, noisy, dominant half of the world that was inexplicable. (They still are.) It possibly needs a companion volume -- Noisy: the hegemony of people with nothing helpful to say who still won't shut up, or something. (Cue reality TV, talk radio, and horrible crush parties with loud music, where you couldn't hear anyone even if they were interesting.) Anyway.This made a curious juxtaposition with my last-read book Fossil Horses. MacFadden, a scientist, argued like a scientist; Cain, a lawyer, argues like a lawyer. I discern the differences even as I appreciate the advocacy. Cain develops her case through illustrative anecdotes, and references to science, psychology, and history as needed. Very readable. I confess, I hadn't thought of extroversion as the American cultural ideal, even as I have witnessed plenty of the cited behaviors. My world tends to be divided practically into ""people who read"" and ""everybody else"", which cuts unevenly across the extrovert/introvert divide, with the obvious bias.I sort of want to go out and press this book upon ""everybody else"", but one sees the inherent problem with that. I hope its message can cut through the noise somehow, nonetheless.Recommended.Ta, L."

Basically already that is more than enough to recommend it.If you consider yourself an introvert and doubt your own worth in comparison with more outgoing or established people, this is for you.If you are in any way interested in the introvert - extrovert spectrum, this will give you some very good understanding. For me the Quiet Revolution is a bit over the top, but that came after the book and doesn't make it any less valuable. "

"
172,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"I feel sure Quiet will become the benchmark book on the topic of introversion. This is because it not only thoroughly explains introversion but champions it. It’s a book by an introvert for introverts, to help them understand themselves and feel proud of who they are. It’s also a book for extroverts, but especially those extroverts who are convinced that introversion is a flaw. Cain will have them wishing they were introverts. Quiet is inarguably biased in favor of introversion, but that’s the point. Up to one-half of Americans are introverted. It’s absurd that introversion is scoffed at as much as it is. The time has come for the introverted label to be a compliment rather than a criticism. This book is a leap in that direction.Cain covered many facets of introversion, from the intriguing “highly sensitive” subset (which describes about 20% of all introverts) to differences in the Eastern and Western worlds to the introverted child (specifically in the classroom, which favors extroverts). Also explored is the age-old question of nature versus nurture and brain differences between extroverts and introverts--plus more. I greatly enjoyed the Eastern versus Western section. America, and the Western world in general, has what Cain dubs an “Extrovert Ideal.” The opposite is true in the East. Whereas in the West, introversion is viewed as a weakness to be conquered, in the East, it’s considered a strength; extroversion is frowned upon, viewed as something that must be tamed. The general sentiment is that extroverts are overwhelming people, wasting others’ time with empty chatter. It’s in this section that Cain profiled Don Chen, an Asian-American student studying at Harvard business school, a very extroverted place. He’s the embodiment of introversion and must feign extroversion daily to get through his classes and general life as part of the school. Feigning extroversion is draining, and Chen needs solitude every day to recharge. This is how it is for all introverts, and Cain stressed repeatedly that it’s not a defect, just a difference. Chen has an intimate group of friends (entirely Asian-American save for one introverted white American man). He’s keenly aware of the differences between his little group and his extroverted classmates. He notes how frequently the extroverts participate in classes while he rarely does and how boisterous they are when together in the cafeteria. Though he admires some of their qualities, he mostly doesn’t understand them. In his mind, they disrespectfully waste classmates’ and professors’ time with their talk, failing to get to the point quickly. If this section sounds borderline racist, it isn’t. Rather, it recognizes that different cultures value different qualities and is a powerful example of introversion as a desirable trait. Chen’s story is one of many in this enlightening book. To support all points, Cain profiled real people, some living, some dead (such as Rosa Parks and Dale Carnegie). The (carefully indexed) research is fascinating in itself, but the real-life examples supporting her research are vital. They round out Quiet to push it beyond dry textbook. I’d read a lot about introversion before reading Quiet, and I bypassed this book for years because others said it offers nothing new on the topic. Readers who’ve read numerous books on the topic or have researched the topic extensively may feel this way. I didn’t. In each chapter, I learned--and was utterly engrossed. Introverts will find Quiet relatable and affirming. Extroverts will find Quiet demystifies introverts thoroughly and will appreciate them more. Both will find it extremely illuminating."

The narrator was excellent.Also, it was a very interesting, insightful, informative read and of course there were lots of issues raised to which I could totally relate, even though sometimes I was a bit confused about what Susan Cain was ultimately trying to prove.I wish I could have read this book as a I teenager as well as my extrovert mother! :)I am from Central-Eastern Europe, so of course not all things ""translate"" directly into how society is working in Hungary as opposed to how things are in the US, but the personal issues are there and are quite universal."
174,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose,5,"This has been probably the one review I've been most intimidated to write for the longest time, and it's not because Susan Cain's ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" isn't a strongly asserted and powerful work. I could sing its respective praises for days. The fact of the matter is - this book really hit me at the heart of my core for so many measures in my life as an introvert. I find it hard to expound just how much this book had an impact on me personally.I could tell you about many things about my person that embody me as an introvert. That I'm quiet spoken and don't speak unless I have something important to say. That small talk isn't something I'm comfortable that I'm not fond of confrontations (though many of you have read my extended written rants about various matters of controversy with very little hesitation). That I tend to spend time alone to recharge my batteries even when I'm called to do things in any scale of extroversion. That my emotional intelligence is very high and I can sympathize/emphathize with people for matters of their experience (though this also makes me highly sensitive).For most of my life, I've been told that these very natural matters of my disposition were wrong. And goodness forbid did that make my life complicated because I didn't feel like people understood who I was. I was even led to believe that I was actually shy, not introverted (many people confuse the two, there is a difference.) Yet the more I learned about the dynamic of introversion and extroversion and how they functioned, I realized that the fundamental difference between them were the derived sources of energy that one functions with in day to day living. That there's nothing wrong with being introverted versus extroverted in a society that - in mainstream notations, champions the latter.This book had me thinking for days after I finished it.I liked that Cain's narrative focuses on the positive contributions and the inherent strengths that lie in introversion because it's widely stereotyped. That stereotyping actually harms our society more than we ourselves may realize in the daily grind, not just individually. By trying to mold people into one acceptable standard, we often lose out on what unique strengths and contributions one may have from going away from such a standard. Narratives like ""Quiet"" have relevance not just in recognizing the distinct psychological functions and differences we have as individuals, but also in the relationships and contributions we have in our professions, our activities, and even wider perceptions of our society in general.I appreciated the expansion on famous figures like Rosa Parks in terms of her backstory and identity as an introvert and how that shaped her responses (I'll have to pick up ""Quiet Strength"" at some point). I also appreciated hearing Cain's own struggles with coming to terms with her introversion, and even the story of the Harvard Business student. There are so many individual stories in this narrative and Cain gives a thorough examination of the details within. It's amazing just how much work and thought went into expounding these issues and individual narratives. This narrative examines introversion not only as a social construct, but individual - delving into narratives of biological, psychological, and sociological importance. There's an examination on the level of intorversion among different cultures, how introspection is valuable to creativity versus ""groupthink"", how extroversion and introversion are not mutually exclusive (and situations that call for each). I came out of it all with not only a fresh perspective on how valuable introverts are to the fabric of society, but also a greater sense of self-worth for my own traits. And that's something to be thankful for. My hope is that with more people who pick up ""Quiet"" and realize how important our individual attributes are, that it'll provide for more opportunities to be creative and to value each other in our relationships regardless of differences, for our unique strengths regardless of how their expressed or from where they come.Overall score: 5/5 stars"

My credentials include cheerfully working from home, getting overstimulated in quiet libraries, and keeping in touch with my closest friends almost entirely by snail mail. I have been known to feel oversocialised sitting in a darkened room, listening to people two rooms away watch a film.As far as a lot of media is concerned, I may as well be a pet hamster. ""Care for your introvert."" Try not to interrupt them. Don't go in their nest while they're sleeping. Offer them a way out when you're at a party, in case they run out of carrot sticks and want to go home. I may as well also be a complete rarity: a third of people don't get hissy when you take their carrot sticks away; come the fuck on.So, what I liked about Quiet was that it didn't make me feel like a special snowflake or someone's hamster.But also... the section on introversion in leadership and the workplace has actually boosted my confidence a lot (apart from being really interesting). I've worked for a few people, and the times it's worked best have been the times where they give me a broad, bullet-pointed list of what they want to have happened by what time, and then they go away until that time. The best boss I ever had used to say it was a good day if we never spoke to each other except when one of us brought the other coffee - and I was inclined to agree with him. Faced with common-sense-logic, which seems to say that 5000 feedback sessions and an open-plan office with communal ball-pit are what millennials are looking for, I wanted this narrative. It was useful to hear. Maybe it's less useful if you're the sort of person who's been reading this sort of thing for years. For me, it was a helpful reminder.I remember a little interesting neurological detail, but not a lot - I can get more than that keyword-searching the Scientific American website, if I want to - and a fair bit of interesting historical anecdote. I remember coming away with a renewed respect for anyone who parents, especially by themselves, as well as a sense of purpose about working for myself and by myself - which I'm happy to say I'm now doing. It turns out, a lot of the time, that people who contract you for work over the internet don't really give a shit about your sparkling and gracious personality. They just want to know you're conscientious and you know what you're talking about and you'll do things when you say you will. I vaguely credit Susan Cain with giving me the impetus to go and do what I want to do, and not to feel like I have to be constantly nice to people I don't know. Now I just think, it's okay, I have character, and then put my headphones back in."
176,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5524572-kristin-hackett-superspacechick,4,"As a self proclaimed introvert, I've been meaning to read this book for so long. My sister in law gave me a copy for Christmas so I prioritized it as a January read and I'm so glad I did. I really enjoyed the in depth look at what constitutes an introvert vs. an extrovert. Quiet even redefined the meaning of the word sensitive for me. I've never considered myself sensitive before but to pull a quote, ""highly sensitive people tend to be keen observers who look before they leap. They arrange their lives in ways that limit surprises. They’re often sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, pain, coffee... Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments—both physical and emotional—unusually deeply. They tend to notice subtleties that others miss—another person’s shift in mood, say, or a lightbulb burning a touch too brightly.""- this is 100% spot on for me. While I do agree with a lot of what Susan Cain wrote, I do think it's difficult to classify people into only one of two categories. She did stress that just because someone is an introvert, it doesn't mean that 1) they got there the same way as someone else or 2) that both people will have exactly the same traits. There are still variables to consider. Overall, I loved that Quiet is a celebrated look at introversion and the strengths that those with introverted qualities possess. There were a few anecdotes that weren't the most interesting (or relevant like the chapter on raising children), but I still found value in reading them. "

She has helped me understand myself more and I am glad of that. Introverts don't like novelty and the first day of school is usually traumatic as mine was. As children, introverts like to daydream, play inside and their feelings are easily hurt. ""They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. . ."" They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy and fear."" They "". . . tend to speak softly because that's how they prefer others to communicate with them.""Shy people hate confrontations and will avoid them at all costs and the author believes it is better so. ""Scores of studies have shown that venting doesn't sooth anger; it fuels it.""This is a great book for people who have always felt that their shyness makes them less worthy than the more gregarious in the world."
178,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,2,"Why is it that the “ideal” person is extroverted? That we pride social skills and being outgoing? All while a deeply gifted thinker who prefers to be in his/her head is described as lacking these traits. Looking at it from an evolutionary standpoint, there is a reason why introverts exist, so why do we rate it as second best? Being a true-blue introvert, I turned to Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a world that can’t stop talking” to answer these questions (and maybe propose new ones). Susan Cain divides “Quiet” into four main sections with the first focusing on the history and description of the rise of extroverts, the differences in leadership styles of introverts and extroverts, and the myths surrounding them. This section begins “Quiet” with a slow and unmemorable beginning. Cain focuses more of an effort on real-life case studies versus actual scientific studies, bypassing any professional data or even her own opinions. The studies which are mentioned are not “earth-shattering” in depth nor do they truly correlate to her hypothesis. In fact, much of the hypothesis is lost and the flow is not seamless or clear. On one hand, this makes the reading understandable and accessible for the less scientifically-inclined reader, but to others craving more research; Cain leaves something to be desired. Some of Cain’s examples which could be perceived as “witty” (Craig Newark of Craigslist fame, Dr. Suess, and Moses from the Bible) are underdeveloped and also lose connection with the hypothesis. Cain is often abrupt and cuts herself short. Furthermore, many of the chapters begin in the same exact way (both format and creativity) which is tedious and creates a loss of interest. The second section of “Quiet” describes some of the brain and neurological aspects of introverts featuring more science than the first section. Cain’s work is a bit more compelling in this respect and certainly more interesting. However, it still isn’t clear what she is trying to prove as she mostly just describes how introverts “are”. Plus, most of the findings are self-explanatory and even obvious. Again, the reader will not be blown away. I have read MANY “brain books” (psychology/neurology, science, and biology) and generally, I am left both flabbergasted and repeating information I’ve read to anyone who will listen. This was not the case with “Quiet” as only a small dose of information felt standout. As the second portion progresses, Cain does present tests and experimentation results more confidentially (however, there is a lack of elaboration). The third section of “Quiet” is comparatively shorter, as Cain explains the conformities and values of the Asian cultures while in the fourth section, Cain offers tips and lifestyle adaptations for introverts in various areas such as work, romance, parenting, play, etc. At this point, “Quiet” appears to be more of a self-help book. The latter end of the book is overly focused on parenting and schooling of children causing me to feel alienated and distanced (having no children). Furthermore, the “Conclusion” is weak and sums up the book which actually reinforces how few points are made. Simply, “Quiet"" is not what I expected. Instead of explaining “why” introverts are the way they are; Cain described “how” they are with an absence of data I would have preferred. All in all though, it has been confirmed (which I already knew) that I am indeed an introvert."
179,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A lance is broken for the needs of introverted people Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Whether one opposes the sanguine with the phlegmatic nature, the wild daredevil the thoughtful inventor or merely the introversion the extroversion, the temperament is and remains in specific proportions decisive for a human being. The author has re-examined this fact with an unconventional approach, opening up exciting and critical viewing angles. Times are changing. In the 19th century, it was still commonplace to be modest, humble and unobtrusive. Starting from the advertising industry in the 1920s and 1930s, it continued to run to the idealistic goal of total superficiality. Ads began to play with people's fear of the negative connotations of ominous, alien observers, and the appearance and ability to attract more and more attention. The new religion of narcissism was supported by an entrepreneurial mentality that understood handshaking qualities, dazzling rhetoric, and slick eloquence as signs of business qualification.Thus, when the loudest and most risk-taking specimens of the managerial species, elite colleges that encourage elbow mentality-driven, superficial behavior, occupy key positions, one or the other financial market collapse is no longer surprising. The flowers of this development on the example of today's America could seem bizarre if the consequences were not so serious. Thus, adjectives such as shy and quiet or just hints of a sly-boy mentality are dismissed as entirely negative and peculiar. Whether in school, work or private life, who does not understand playing on the highly sophisticated keyboard of interpersonal communication, quickly falls through the typical rust. Sensitive children, even as babies, are prone to intensified reactions to external stimuli, are more empathetic and need seeming timidity as a protective mechanism against a formally overwhelming universe. At the same time, individuals naturally endowed with a more robust psychic scaffolding sound lighthearted, but also more emotionless, to their surroundings.Parents of quieter, a manageable circle of friends their naming and lonely hobbies devoted children are remembered, not only subtle, the importance of popularity and dazzling charm. However, very peculiar that silent children are put under depression or misanthropic suspicion, while too vital, joyful young people are sedated with Ritalin. If the favors of loneliness have been well into adulthood, there is a wide range of seminars that can enhance eloquence, demeanor, and be talking skills to the point of sales genius. Several relationship problems are likely based on the well measurable differences between different natures, even by MRI. While extroverts can bathe in crowds every awaken minute and shy away from loneliness, the relationship is reversed by introverts. This involves interpersonal explosives in itself when the mantra of the attractive opposites once no longer pulls, and the supposed truce of the relationship beginning is over. Additional spontaneous emotional responses provoke the fact that extroverts interpret specific aggressive behavior as interest and attention while introverts feel injured and attacked. Assessing the damage caused to the economy by incorrectly designing work processes and their surroundings is difficult or even impossible. If one adds the increased disinclination of introverts in a loud open-plan atmosphere, including the wasted potential, because gifted thinkers find no peace to work out ideas and concepts undisturbed, the overall economic damage can be immense. The cultural differences show a contrarian approach of the Asians, where a European-American behavior style is considered a stupid waste of time for listeners. Tranquility and contemplation have a different meaning, superficiality and the glorification of narcissistic principles are considered less desirable. Another, quite thoughtful approach.Eine Lanze gebrochen für die Bedürfnisse der introvertierten MenschenansammlungsvermeiderOb man dem sanguinischen das phlegmatische Naturell entgegenstellt, dem wilden Draufgänger den nachdenklichen Tüftler oder schlicht der Introvertiertheit die Extrovertiertheit, das Temperament ist und bleibt zu bestimmten Anteilen maßgebend für einen Menschen. Die Autorin hat diesen Umstand mit einer unkonventionellen Herangehensweise neu beleuchtet und damit interessante und kritische Betrachtungswinkel eröffnet.So ändern sich die Zeiten. War es im 19 Jahrhundert noch gang und gäbe, bescheiden, demütig und unaufdringlich zu sein, begann, ausgehend von der Werbeindustrie, in den 1920er und 1930er Jahren, ein bis heute andauernder Lauf auf das ideelle Ziel der totalen Oberflächlichkeit. Anzeigen begannen mit der Angst der Menschen vor negativen Assoziationen ominöser, fremder Beobachter zu spielen und das Äußere sowie die Fähigkeit zu gefallen, immer mehr ins Rampenlicht zu rücken. Unterstützung fand die neue Religion des Narzissmus von einer Unternehmermentalität, die Handschlagqualitäten, blendende Rhetorik und aalglatte Eloquenz als Zeichen betriebswirtschaftlicher Qualifikation auffasste. Wenn auf diese Weise immer die lautesten und risikofreudigsten Exemplare der Managerspezies, von zu ellbogenmentalitätsgesteuerten, oberflächlichen Verhalten animierenden Elitehochschulen, Schlüsselpositionen besetzen, verwundert der eine oder andere Finanzmarktkollaps gar nicht mehr.Die Blüten dieser Entwicklung am Beispiel des heutigen Amerikas könnten skurril anmuten, wären die daraus resultierenden Konsequenzen nicht derart gravierend. So werden Adjektive wie schüchtern und ruhig oder nur Andeutungen einer Eigenbrötlermentalität als durchwegs negativ und absonderlich abgetan. Sei es in Schule, Beruf oder Privatleben, wer nicht versteht auf der hochkomplexen Klaviatur zwischenmenschlicher Kommunikation zu spielen, fällt leicht einmal durch den sozialen Rost.Sensible Kinder neigen schon als Babys zu verstärkten Reaktionen auf äußere Reize, sind einfühlsamer und benötigen die scheinbare Furchtsamkeit als Schutzmechanismus gegen ein sie mit Eindrücken förmlich erschlagendes Universum. Gleichzeitig wirken von Natur aus mit einem robusteren psychischen Gerüst ausgestattete Individuen unbeschwerter, aber auch emotionsloser auf ihre Umgebung. Eltern ruhiger, einen überschaubaren Freundeskreis ihr Eigen nennender und sich einsamen Hobbies widmender Kinder werden, nicht nur durch die Blume, an die Wichtigkeit von Beliebtheit und blendendem Charme erinnert. Doch sehr eigentümlich, dass stille Kinder unter Depressions- oder Misanthropiegeneralverdacht gestellt werden, während allzu vitale, lebensfrohe junge Menschen mit Ritalin sediert werden.Sollte sich die Favorisierung der Einsamkeit bis ins Erwachsenenalter durchgeschlagen haben, gibt es eine breite Palette an Seminarangeboten, die Beredsamkeit, Auftreten und Plauschkompetenzen bis hin zum Verkaufsgenie steigern können. Etliche Beziehungsprobleme dürften auf den, auch per MRT gut messbaren Unterschieden zwischen verschiedenen Naturellen basieren. Während Extrovertierte jede wache Minute in Menschenmengen baden könnten und Einsamkeit scheuen, kehrt sich das Verhältnis bei Introvertierten um. Das birgt zwischenmenschlichen Sprengstoff in sich, wenn das Mantra von den sich anziehenden Gegensätzen einmal nicht mehr richtig zieht und der vermeintliche Waffenstillstand des Beziehungsbeginns vorüber ist. Zusätzliche spontane emotionale Reaktionen provoziert die Tatsache, dass Extrovertierte bestimmtes, aggressives Verhalten als Interesse und Aufmerksamkeit interpretieren, während Introvertierte sich verletzt und angegriffen fühlen.Den für die Wirtschaft entstandenen Schaden durch falsche Konzeption von Arbeitsabläufen samt deren Umgebungen einzuschätzen mutet schwer bis unmöglich an. Wenn man die verstärkte Krankheitsneigung Introvertierter in lauter Großraumbüroatmosphäre inklusive dem verschwendeten Potential, weil begnadete Denker keine Ruhe finden, um Ideen und Konzepte ungestört ausarbeiten zu können, addiert, dürfte der gesamtvolkswirtschaftliche Schaden immens sein.Die kulturellen Unterschiede zeigen eine konträre Herangehensweise der Asiaten, bei denen ein europäisch-amerikanisches Gebaren als unhöfliche Verschwendung der Zeit von Zuhörern gewertet wird. Ruhe und Kontemplation haben eine andere Bedeutung, Oberflächlichkeit und die Verherrlichung narzisstischer Prinzipien gelten als wenig erstrebenswert. Ein anderer, durchaus in Erwägung zu ziehender Ansatz."

Susan Cain, former Wall Street lawyer and self-described introvert, investigates how introversion has become dangerously scorned in the current American ""Culture of Personality."" I had not fully realized how drastically our cultural values have shifted--and how much American society pushes us to conform--until reading Cain's book. To prove her point, Cain visits American bastions of extroversion promotion, including Harvard Business School, Saddleback Church, Dale Carnegie, Wall Street, and Tony Robbins conferences. She talks with pioneering psychologists and neurologists to explain the studies behind concepts like the dangers of group think, the ability to delay gratification, or the trait called sensitivity. She profiles famous and less-well known introverts to show how the studies play out in real life.Though the many of the activities I'm drawn to (and the things that cause anxiety) scream classic introvert, I have always considered myself an extrovert and frequently put myself in situations where extroverted behavior is valued. However, since quitting my job and globe-hopping for the past two years, I've been surprised (and disappointed) by how often the constant stimulation, new people, and change can drain me--and by how I often feel an overwhelming need for alone time.I found myself relating to many of the points Cain discusses and have since concluded that I'm much more of an introvert than I had thought. (I promise that this isn't just because she does a good job of highlighting all the positive things about introverts!)So for that, I am grateful to have read Quiet, though I can't quite believe it took reading a book to figure that out about myself! I am seeing my preferences in a new light and have much understanding and acceptance regarding the things that interest me (and those that cause me stress). I've been having trouble narrowing down 'what I want to do with my life' and this book has helped me more than any other, because I finally feel like I can accept that the things I really enjoy are just a part of me and can't be ignored. Though the personal application will differ, I suspect many people will come away having learned much more than they expected, if not about themselves, then about people close to them. I had always thought of extroverts and introverts as being on distinct sides of a line, when in fact it's much more of a sliding scale (or perhaps better as two scales: percentage introversion, percentage extroversion). Because we have been culturally pressured and trained to admire extroverted behavior, many of us may be dangerously ignoring our introverted characteristics. This was a game-changing book for me, and I suspect it will be eye-opening to most people who read it."

But I also enjoy giving presentations at school, tutoring peers in writing, and interacting with various people online and in real life. I'd describe myself as an introvert (and my Meyers-Briggs personality type agrees), though both introverts and extroverts would enjoy this fascinating book by Susan Cain. She provides an intriguing, in-depth perspective on introversion, its connotation in contrasting cultures, and the psychology behind it.A profusion of the nonfiction I've read has contained too much of something - too many random anecdotes, too much scientific jargon, too many unnecessary statistics or explanations. But Quiet has the perfect blend of personal anecdotes, interesting analysis, detailed explanations, and compelling statistics. Cain references various studies conducted by psychologists and discusses several aspects related to introversion, such as the extrovert ideal, how extroverts and introverts can compliment each other and work together, nature v. nature, etc. Here's one passage about sensitive people (who tend to be more introverted) that struck a chord with me:""The other thing Aron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they're highly empathic. It's as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people's emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world. They tend to have unusually strong consciences. They avoid violent movies and TV shows; they're acutely aware of the consequences of a lapse in their own behavior. In social settings they often focus on subjects like personal problems, which others consider 'too heavy'.""I guess I have an excuse for exposing so much of myself on my blog, huh? Anyway, Cain delves into other subjects that are intellectually stimulating too, such as the three things she thinks are important in identifying one's personal project. She even brings up the relationship between Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other famous historical figures.Overall, highly recommended to everyone curious about their own temperaments and how to embrace their natural personalities. One of the best works of nonfiction I've read.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

Also, it was interesting to hear what you can do to help someone with stage fright preform at their best.However, I felt the book repeated itself. Many times I wondered what new information could possibly be discussed, and a lot of times there wasn't really any new information. It just talked about the same material in a circle from a different angle.A lot of the time I felt like this book was written so introverts could feel validated for being an introvert and that they weren't anti-social.

It's perhaps not a surprise that Susan Cain, the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking identifies herself as an introvert. Being quiet, introverted or shy is still seen by many as a problem or handicap to overcome so I can see her motivation for writing it.One this book's premises is that in the last 50 years or so, the Western world moved from a culture of character to a culture of personality, which according to the author has given an advantage to people that enjoyed outgoing, uninhibited personalities. We tend to admire and reward people that exhibit the most gregarious, outgoing traits of extroverts while at the same time undermined and misunderstand those that are most typically seen in more introverted individuals.
Introversion is really about having a preference for lower stimulation environments. So it's just a preference for quiet, for less noise, for less action. Whereas extroverts really crave more stimulation in order to feel at their best.
The author explains that Introversion is a spectrum, and that most of us don't fully fit into an introvert/extrovert definition. It also provides a sort of ""survival guide"" for introverts to help us learn how to better deal with the pressures of living in a world that for the most part rewards those that are extroverts.
Many people believe that introversion is about being antisocial, and that's really a misperception. Because actually it's just that introverts are differently social. So they would prefer to have a glass of wine with a close friend as opposed to going to a loud party full of strangers.
This book helped me understand myself better, identify those traits that makes many of us ""introverts"" different and learn how to use them to our advantage, both on our professional and personal lives. The book is entertaining and well written. If you are interested in learning about introverts, perhaps because you feel like one or someone closed to you does, this book might be of interest to you.After reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking my conclusion is that the world needs both extroverts and introverts and that we all have a role to play.Here's a link to the author's TED TALK which is sort a summarized version of the book:http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_t..."

And the whole idea about needing time out to recover from socialising - I always thought I was just a bit odd, haha.The criticisms that are quite rightly levelled at this book about preaching some kind of binarism between extrovert and introvert are understandable, and am I'm sure that we are all a little too complex for a poorly designed set of questions to provide any sort of sensible analysis or categorisation (would still like to see the questions though...) Most people will be surely be somewhere close to 'ambivert' even if they know themselves to be introverted at heart. For me a major part of young socialisation and growing up was learning to act like an extrovert, if nothing else just to stop people trying to 'bring me out of my shell' or constantly asking what's up as I am 'being quiet'."

For years people have been telling me to come out of my shell and to be more outgoing and I realized I had definitely playing the role of pseudo-extrovert all this time! I enjoyed reading the fact that we introverts actually have power and hidden strengths. The list of famous introverts surprised me, Rosa Parks, Al Gore and Gandhi in particular. The book also shared some insight into the thinking patterns of extroverts. All in all, it was an interesting book though the end did drag on a bit."

187,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5470914-sam,1,"This was the most painful book I have read this summer. I choked it down like bad medicine page after page. Quiet is great self affirmation for someone who considers themselves an introvert, and sees humans as either an extrovert or introvert. Cain certainly thinks she’s the poster child of an introvert, or is she? The book reads like a memoir in parts where she tells stories of her own life, then there are smatterings or small examples in specific parts of people’s lives of how greatness comes in quiet e.g. Steve Wozniak, Gandhi, Rosa Parks. Cain also fancies herself a bit of a child psychologist, on one hand it’s ok for kids to be shy or in their shell, these aren’t bad things, and very normal, but on the other hand we need to nudge and push slowly to get kids out of their quiet place. So which is it?It doesn’t bother me that Cain isn’t a psychologist or economist, but she’s talking through both sides of her mouth, the book is a pity party, she thinks the decisions in modern workplaces are influenced by highly extroverted personalities like those from the Harvard Business School. There’s no backing for this other than the fact that business students are extroverts. Additionally the economic crisis was wholly the fault of extroverts, basically extroverts with their loud voices overpowered the brilliant quiet hardworking, and smart introverts and ran the economy to the ground. I’m afraid you really aren’t brilliant if something has already happened and you didn’t do anything to stop it. In hindsight everything is 20/20, just because you are quiet and something bad is happening saying “I knew it!” doesn’t do much. The circlejerk continues when Cain bangs on about everyone who a douche as being an extrovert. Good guys are introverts, Warren Buffet because of his one speech about the dot com bubble bursting was quiet and well calculated in his words. The rest of the word are greedy businessmen. There’s some sample or thin slicing in her discussions that I find problematic, and read a bit like a tabloid. Susan Cain is clearly appealing to an audience that is already sold to introversion, and stroking those egos. I wish the book had more solutions instead of harping about how bad people are. The book blurs it’s lines through many genres, self help, psychology and a dash of group-think. I consider myself an introvert, but also an extrovert, yes I do believe brilliance happens in unaccompanied activities like running. I charge my batteries during times like this but I also don’t “suffer in silence”. I don’t believe people are fully introverted or extroverted. Reading Khaneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and Mcgonigal’s Willpower Instinct make Cain’s book look hurriedly and thoughtlessly written, there’s little appeal to science. "
188,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,3,"I expected to love, love, love this book. After all, psychology is one of my passions. Also, I am always interested in hearing from some group. And this is saying, ""We, the introverts, are speaking out.""However, the book was neither as powerful nor as interesting as I was hoping....Cain does a great job of blending together different aspects. The three main angles she uses are:1.) Famous people who were introverts. She usually starts her chapters with a story about a wonderful famous person we all know and adore - and then explaining how they were introverted. Rosa Parks, Dale Carnegie, and Eleanor Roosevelt are some of the examples she used.2.) Case studies. This is the real life introvert ""Jane Doe."" She was on this job and thought she would have to quit because she just wasn't outgoing enough. Then she learned that being an introvert was like having a secret superpower! And then she used her introversion to overcome all obstacles! Now she's rich and/or happy. Success!3.) Science - hard and soft. Cain uses both psychology and biology to try and explain the differences between extroverts and introverts. She also explains why introversion might be valuable in evolution and natural selection. She has a fascinating chapter on culture, which emphasizes that although extroversion is worshiped in the USA, many Asian countries value silence, reflection, and understanding over cheerfulness, enthusiasm, and talkativeness. ...This book is at it's best when Cain is exploring how introversion is a valuable and worthy trait or way of being. When she journeys into different places to see how introversion is treated differently there. When she explores how introversion can be a survival aid in the wild and how introverted people can be powerful in their own way.It's exciting and interesting to realize that extroversion - while venerated in America - is actually seen as crass and dumb in many Asian cultures.And it's fun and cool to see different theories of how introverted people and animals are strong in Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection. I liked seeing different species and the benefits and drawbacks they experience from being extroverted or introverted. And I enjoyed seeing how introversion could be a kick-butt evolutionary trait which is often overlooked or thought to be something that needed 'killing off.'I thought about 2/3 of the book were weak, though. For instance, I already know enough about famous figures and do not particularly want or need to read a short biography or story about them. Another thing that bugged me were her ""real life introversion stories."" Here is how an introvert struggled. Here is how he learned to embrace his true self and be happy/rich.The whole book just felt like a big pat on the back. ""Don't worry, introverts, you're okay! Everything's okay! It might seem like the world hates you, but use your strengths! You are really amazing.""And it's not even like I DISAGREE with this message, it's simply that I was expecting more than a rather thinly-veiled self-help book. P.S. I really like the page or two that Cain dedicates to exploring Moses (an alleged introvert) and Aaron (his extroverted mouthpiece). It is also interesting when she lightly touches on whether or not the Church and modern-day Protestants shun and punish introverts as not doing the Lord's work. I like when she questions whether Jesus was an introvert or extrovert (covered in one paragraph, very shallow) and questions whether the Church is pushing an incorrect message on it's followers. (""Real Christians proselytize! How can you be a REAL Christian if you are not gregarious?"") I also like when she uses the teachings and life of Gandhi to emphasize that passivity is NOT submissiveness. All these subjects were things I wished she'd explored in greater depth."

All these adjectives and more describe my experience with this amazing book.I'm very much an introvert. I try to avoid social functions as much as possible, but I do love meeting every so often with my dear friends one-on-one. If I do end up at a party, you can bet I'm the one keeping the corner warm. I am an avid reader, a knitter, a sometimes writer, a nerd, and an engineer. My idea of a perfect evening is one spent in the comfort of my apartment, cat in lap, book in hand, coffee at my side. My idea of a perfect vacation is one where I can go to my favorite coffee shop and read. In college, my favorite classes were Differential Equations (in which I, the only female, got a perfect score on the final), Physics, and Fluids. Ever since elementary school, I dreaded a school performances, such as Christmas programs or poetry recitals. At work meetings, I am more likely to listen to everything and be note-taker than I am to present or volunteer ideas.Lately, my boss has said that I need to step things up, become more ""out there"" and confident. Inwardly, I despaired. Wasn't I working hard enough? What was holding me back? Why couldn't I just blurt things out in meetings? Why did I constantly sound nervous, even if I really wasn't? Was there any hope for me to change?And then, like a sign from heaven, I saw this book in the ""New Books"" display at Barnes and Nobles (BTW, I happen to swing by the bookstore at least once a week during lunch - sometimes to purchase, but mostly to pass the time). I remembered a friend had read this and really enjoyed it, and I figured it would help me figure out myself.""Figure myself out"" would be an understatement; it's as if this book were written specifically for me! Cain breaks down what it means to be an introvert. Turns out despite what my sister is constantly telling me, I'm not weird (alright, not too weird). I have talents and skills. I have a place. And it's not my fault I can't always speak up and make my voice heard. A lot of it is because of how our workforce, our employers, our coworkers, our society functions. Our biology, our parents, our surroundings make us the introverted beings we are. It's just that school and work and the outside world try to tell us that being quiet, that listening and ruminating over things is wrong, that we should be quick to speak and blurt whatever is on our mind.I've known I was an introvert for a while, but it was so refreshing and liberating to learn that there were others with my ""problem"". That I wasn't alone. And, most importantly, I can overcome, nay thrive, in this Extroverted world. And that is the second gift Cain gives us in this book: how to be an Introvert in an Extrovert world and not want to choke yourself at night.I feel like, after reading Quiet, I have a plan for facing my ""work problems"". I feel like I can take the challenge my boss has placed in front of me and succeed. Although a part of me still wishes I could crawl back to my desk and burrow there, I think this book has given me the tools and encouragement I need to speak up.If you are an introvert, you definitely need to read this book. Even if you aren't an introvert, this is a great book to understanding how they think and act. I'm definitely passing this along to everyone I know."
190,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Years ago, my division manager at work had everybody in the division take the Meyer Briggs personality test. Then we spent time in a workshop, to understand the implications of our personality types. One of the dimensions of the test is extroversion/introversion (E or I types). This book offers a very satisfying account of what it means to be an introvert. Generally Western cultures admire extroverts, while Asian cultures admire introverts. Both types of personalities offer value to society. Groups of people who are introverts are best with an extroverted leader, while groups of extroverts are best with an introverted leader.Many introverts find it difficult to live in a society that values extroversion more highly. As a result, many introverts pretend to be extroverts in certain social situations. But they cannot maintain this pretension indefinitely, and at some point in time they must ""recharge"" their internal batteries with quiet and solitude. The book makes a major point here: It's perfectly OK to pretend to be an extrovert for periods of time--as long as you do this while you are working at something that you truly love.The book has useful practical advice for introverts. If you are an introvert and your husband or wife is an extrovert, there is much to be said about how to maintain or improve your relationship. If you are raising a child who is an introvert, it is important to understand how to encourage the child to follow his/her innate abilities.Back in the 1940's and 1950's, Alex Osborn was plagued by the lack of creativity in his advertising agency. So, he wrote some books introducing the concept of ""brainstorming"". The idea is for people get together in groups and toss out ideas without fear of ridicule--the more ideas, the better. The problem is, in the 1960's, studies showed that brainstorming is not efficient; you can get more, good ideas if people simply think creatively in solitude. Committees simply are not as productive as the sum of individuals working alone. We are so inculcated with the idea that brainstorming is best--but this is really just a reflection of the dominance of extroversion in our society. "
191,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4811203-emily-b,3,"As an introvert and psychology graduate this was an interesting read however it was not what I was expecting. I felt like it wasn’t as accessible as it could have been. It seems very focused on introverts in or who wish to be in very high powered job roles. Which isn’t my world. I was hoping for a bit more knowledge or ‘self help’ regarding being an introvert in an average every day life, Not as an award winning introverted lecturer, or an introverted Lawyer or CEO."
192,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"It is stated at the start that this book’s purpose is to improve a reader's relationship with others. The book can thus be viewed as a book of the self-help genre. Its aim is to advise introverts on ways by which they can improve their relationships with extroverts, and vice versa. It compares behavioral traits of both introverts and extroverts, showing in what ways they are similar and how they differ. The author mentions books about and summarizes studies related to extroversion and introversion, conducted over the years and up to today. The book begins with a quick test by which readers can determine where they stand on the introvert / extrovert scale. The test takes only a few minutes and gives the reader an immediate connection with the topics to be discussed. Both my husband and I took the test. We both received the same score, indicating that we are both strong introverts. It is interesting to note that although we had the same score, we did not answer all questions in the same way. This led to a lively discussion and a fun start to the book! Twenty questions are to be answered with a yes or a no. The book demonstrates clearly that in America it is the extroverts that hold sway--in the government, in business and in most educational institutions. It is an important and valuable statement that is being made. This is often to the detriment of introverts and to society as a whole. While the author professes the importance and value of both the introvert and the extrovert way of thinking, given the suppression of introverts in society today, it is introverts she lauds most, giving example after example of their accomplishments. I didn’t need to be convinced. For me, it is OBVIOUS that society benefits from the presence of both. The book verges on becoming a manifesto for introverts. This appeals to me no more than society's pronounced favoritism of extroverts! The book accomplishes well what it has set out to do, but I am rarely enthused by books of the self-help genre. It does advise readers on how their relationships can be improved. It also explains how schools can be adapted to better suit the needs of introverts, without hampering the situation for extroverts. I do however find much of the advice given as being rather obvious. The sections I like most are those that are scientifically oriented. I like for example the parts about how the brain functions; sections about the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex and the connection to dopamine are interesting. Many studies are referred to, but how exactly each was performed is skimmed over in too brief a manner. We are told what the results have for implications, but skeptic that I am, I was not always convinced! I need more details. To add depth, opposing points of view should have been added. Intuitively, I agree with the conclusions drawn, but I would have preferred more solid proof. Too many generalizations/simplifications are made. Over and over again we are told that so and so was an introvert and so and so an extrovert. This is all too simple! Individuals are mixes of introvert and extrovert qualities. Instead, an analysis of the tangled mix of traits that make up real people is what I was looking for. At one point Moses is classified as an introvert! This was just too much for me. The author swiftly classifies famous people as being either introvert or extrovert with little analysis of their specific character traits. I find this too categorical. We are told that Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, would never have written the books she wrote and become the ""bold thinker"" that she became had she not been left alone to read books in her youth. Where is the proof in that?! The author generalizes and simplifies all too often. The book is directed primarily toward Americans. I do not appreciate this slant. There is only a brief discussion of Asian American immigrants. Asian Americans of Chinese background are classified as introverts. Europeans are in a bunch grouped with Americans. I would have preferred a more in-depth, nuanced analysis of national and cultural differences.I wish the book had been more globally and more scientifically oriented. It has too many generalizations. It is basically a self-help book, a genre that does not appeal to me, so I guess it is not so bad that I nevertheless felt it to be worth reading. I would have preferred more in-depth analyses concerning how individuals are complicated mixes of introversion and extroversion. We are not one or the other, as was so often stated in reference to the people mentioned. The narration of the audiobook by Kathe Mazur started out very fast, but eventually she slows down. Her rapid speed had me chuckling at the beginning. Why? Because it is the extroverts, not us introverts that talk fast! Didn’t the producers of the audiobook realize the incongruity?! We introverts need time to stop and think and time to examine the ideas floating around in our heads. The narration is easy to follow once Mazur has slowed down. She has a soft, pleasant voice, a perfect match for introverts, the central protagonists of the book. The question is how many extroverts read this book. It is interesting to think about why this may be so."
193,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,5,"This book is very insightful and informative. I watched Susan Cain's TED talk once and I was fascinated being an introvert myself. As a kid I was shy, serious, studious with a little bit of social anxiety and although as I grew up, I outgrew my shyness and got more confident socially, there have been many situations where I questioned myself. Once when I was out on a trip with a big group of college friends, everyone was getting along so well and they seemed to be having so much fun together but I felt so lonely and left out and I was like, ''What's wrong with me''? Turns out I'm just an introvert. Then, I found this book. It describes in detail what introversion and extroversion is and what are the traits associated with both personalities. Where in most areas (or cultures), the introversion or shyness is viewed in a negative light, the writer states that it's an essential trait and how powerful it could be and it should be valued just as extroversion is. I found this book very interesting to read because she presents her ideas by using data gathered from case studies, research and her own personal experiences and from other people. She has also provided analysis of many famous personalities and how their temperaments shaped their actions and how essential their role was. Many definitions are provided for introversion-extroversion and how our genes and our environment play a role in shaping our personalities. There is no personality type better than the other but creating a balance is very important to bring out the best in both. The message in short is- value your individuality and do things the way you want and not because you have to conform to certain cultural norms. It also tells how both personalities can strike a balance between both traits. Also, both extroverts and introverts can lead a fulfilling life without changing their core values or trying to be someone they are not, the power lies in knowing who you are, what your abilities are and using them to the best.After reading this book, I feel like I can understand myself a little better now, what my motivations are and what makes me the way I am. I recommend this book to both introverts and extroverts as it can help them understand the qualities in themselves and in each other."
194,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2598642-catelyn-may,4,"I loved this book. As an introvert, I felt like someone was finally telling my side of the story, and understanding my life in general. Definitely going to loan it to some extroverted family members. "
195,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1230817-lori,5,"I'm really excited about all the works about introverts that's been coming out lately, I think mainly because of this book. I'm not sure if extroverts would have enjoyed this book as much as me, because Cain works hard to prove the merits and necessity of introverts in our society, while down-playing all the reasons why we should have an extrovert ideal. In fact, I think some extroverts would feel a bit offended at this book. But I don't care. I've lived my whole life feeling like there was something wrong with me. I need to speak up, get out there, sell myself, basically become something that I'm not. This book made me realize there's nothing wrong with me, and that I actually have strengths that my extroverted friends, relatives, etc., do not. Instead of constantly seeing myself as disadvantaged because I suck at small talk, don't know how to talk myself up in interviews, and am just a shy person, I just feel like I know myself better. I think teachers should read this book. And I'm going to stop, because this isn't so much as a book review as a blog post or something. This is a total self-help book for introverts. Thank you Cain!**I should also say that Cain uses extensive research and interviews to show the strengths of introverts, so it's actually a pretty scientific book (though made so that it's easy for the every day person like me to understand). I was really surprised at the amount of research done on the differences between introverts and extroverts, especially because the research often shows introverts in a good, positive light, unlike what most people think when they hear the word introvert.

First of all, as far as the audio format goes, they couldn’t have chosen a better narrator. Kathe Mazur’s voice fits the tone of the book perfectly–quiet and measured, yet firm. I basically just want to listen to every audiobook she’s ever narrated. Back to Quiet –I think Susan Cain did a stellar job of exploring the introverted personality type. She sites a number of studies and scientific theories to support her thesis that introversion is an undervalued trait in modern American society. Introverts have just as much to offer the world as extroverts and their unique strengths must be utilized for a society to be truly healthy.

197,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"When I was young, my grandfather, an intelligent farmer, used to call me an introvert, as I sat happily in the corner, spending my free time reading books or writing in my notebooks. I looked up at him, I believe I was around the age of eight or so, with crinkled eyebrows. He explained what it meant. But I didn't have a puzzled look on my face because I didn't understand the word, I was puzzled because he said it like he disapproved. Like it was a bad thing. My aunt, the doctor, immediately came to my defense and said, ""Janine, just tell him that you're not an introvert, you're just introspective."" That became my motto in life. I said it often, mostly because I felt those were big words and others would think I was smart. I never thought about it much later in life until I read this book. Cain talks about the virtues of being an introvert but how society has come to prize the personality traits of the extrovert. Being a pretty extreme extrovert, at first, I didn't think this book was for me. But then I thought back to when I was eight, and realized with shock and I wasn't just a person who could be both, although I was, I am, but I went from one extreme to the other. When I was a child, I was the most introverted person I know. Using the word shy to describe me didn't cut it. I would skip class altogether if I was even a minute late, to avoid the fear of having to walk into the classroom with everyone looking at me. Speeches had me thinking thoughts of jumping out of trees just to break a bone so I could get out of giving the speech. Now, I love nothing better than walking into a room full of strange people. It's just a room full of fifty new friends! And talking in front of people? I have to hold myself back in group exercises just so I don't hog the limelight. How did such a huge change occur? I'll tell you how, because of work, school, and problems socially, I was forced into it. As I began to read this book, I saw a lot of truth in what Cain was saying. Extroverts really are prized now, not just socially but in the workplace as well. At the last company I worked for, I sat in cubicles, was encouraged constantly to hold meetings and ""group think"" up ideas. How different it would have been if I was allowed even one hour a day without interruptions! What has made us so concerned with having these qualities? I am homeschooling my children and every time I come across someone who disapproves it's always because of lack of ""socialization"". My five-year-old son has no trouble talking to anyone and being friendly, I think he gets it from me. But he also loves to play by himself. He might get this from me as well! He creates his best Lego creations when left alone for hours at a time. Why is this a bad thing? As Cain points out, some of the best innovators of our time were quiet thinkers. And we might not have had some of those great inventions or works of art had these people been forced to ""socialize"" as children instead of left alone. And really, what is the big deal with needing socialization being such a big part of schooling? Why can't it be found outside of school? I recently watched a documentary about the current school systems and, as most people know, we (The United States), rank very low in all areas of education. In fact, when American children were tested in various areas against other countries of the world, we consistently ranked on the bottom in almost all areas except one. Can you guess what it is? Self-confidence. American children are said to have the highest self-confidence compared to all other countries. How do we explain this to our children? We're idiots but we have pride! Is this because we're placing such importance on making our children extroverts? Some of the case studies Cain uses to show examples of her theories kept me riveted. She also had a twenty question test in case you weren't sure where you stood. The more traits she gave as examples of introverts and extroverts, the less sure I became of which I was. Ask anyone which I was as a child, they would have said introvert, hands down. Ask anyone I know right now, and in a second they'd say extrovert. So I took her test to see where I stood. I thought I was only doubting myself, and that it would show pretty conclusively that I was an extrovert. But in fact, I was split almost exactly down the middle. I love meeting new people, and often feel energized at the end of a big party. But I also get rejuvinated from having alone time every day. Even back in college, when I was one of the most social people around, my roomates all knew that they risked certain death if they bothered me during my ""break time"". I have no problems going to movies alone, and one of my favorite things to do is go out to lunch or dinner at a nice restaurant with a good book as a dinner companion. People look at me weird, but I could care less. Whenever I go out or have a party my motto is always ""The more the merrier"". So where did I stand on this chart? The advice for public speaking for introverts wasn't going to help me. And to say I should have quit reading the book halfway through because I considered myself an extrovert would have had me missing out on some very interesting information. I really enjoyed this book. And I disagree that this book is only for introverts. I think the biggest benefit this book had for me is the eye opener to how we have been pressured to become more extroverted over the years and how we see this change everywhere, from schools, to the workplace, to advertising, to even moralistic behavior. I think all can benefit from having a greater awareness of this personality trait in everyone they know. If you're an extrovert, wouldn't it benefit you from having a better understanding to where your introverted team leader is coming from? And another realization for me, is how I know see my son, who has the tendency to play alone. I now am more aware of how I treat him, and make sure I no longer fall into that stereotypical reaction of ""Why don't you try harder to make friends?"" routine. There's nothing wrong with being an introvert, and if this book has any major theme, that's it. That being said, even though I very much enjoyed this book, I only gave it three stars for a couple of reasons. First of all, I feel like the middle of the road people such as myself were somewhat ignored. Where do we stand? How do we relate better to people and situations? Then there were the case studies. As I mentioned earlier, they were very interesting and really helped in relating to the particular example's Cain discussed. But after a while, they became tedious, and didn't hold my attention as well as the first half of the book. I still think many can benefit from reading this though. It was fun, and I look forward to discussing it with my book club.  ClassicsDefined.com"
198,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"I never really thought of myself as introverted until relatively recently, within the last year or so, when I declined an invitation to go out with a group of friends to the bar and one of them said ""Fine, be introverted then! Hope you enjoy sitting home alone with your cats!"" (She meant it in a teasing, only partially bitchy way, but I didn't take offense. I DO enjoy sitting home alone with my cats.)My semi-bitchy friend actually helped me define a big part of myself. Until then, I just thought of myself as ""the most anti-social Libra ever"", and poked fun at myself for not wanting to go out all the time, or being overwhelmed by loud, boisterous people, or needing time to just be alone - what my boyfriend calls ""cave-dwelling"". I made these things a joke because, according to society, it's not normal to want to spend so much time alone. I'm supposed to be a fun, out-going social butterfly. The thought exhausts me. So, when I read this, it was like someone opened up my head and singled out these aspects of my personality and then wrote them down. It was fascinating to read this book and learn about myself. I see things about my past in a completely new light. Like the situation above. I'd be more than happy to sit at home with a few friends and drink, but going to a bar to drink among a huge crowd just held no appeal. Or like how I approach my work. The sections of this book pertaining to corporate expectations and office structure were fascinating to me, and really allowed me to look at my job and approach to work differently. I'm a good employee and good at my job, but I don't aspire to be in the limelight. I don't MIND recognition or attention for a job well done, but it's not something I seek out. So, when I was recently offered a job with a new company, I had my choice of being in a ""client liaison"" position or a ""analysis and testing"" position, and I took the latter, even though it's a position with less recognition and lower pay. The thought of having to constantly be professionally social with strangers gives me anxiety, though, so it was a no-brainer for me. But when I discussed my decision with friends, they called me crazy to have turned down the higher paying position. As though money is the only criteria worth considering. (A point that this book makes well.)I'm going to miss the job I'm leaving though, because it did give me a kind of structured socialization. I get along great with my team, and there, I'm far more socially outgoing than I would be otherwise. I've worked with many of these people for several years, I trust and respect them, and they are people I consider real friends. Soon I'll be working 100% from home, so my social interaction will be drastically reduced. I may be introverted, but I do need that interaction. The hard part for me will be actually initiating it. I have a tendency to, uhh, forget to be social. I forget to call and text people, even though I mean to do it. But being social is just never at the forefront of my mind. I'll have to work on that. But then there's online communities, which is a completely different world. I have always been more open and (dare I say it?) chatty online than in my ""real life"" social interactions. Maybe it's the anonymity, or the fact that it's text-based, or the fact that the community I'm in here is one that is full of like-minded people with similar interests. People I can relate and talk to easily. I don't know, but I'm quite different online than off. Offline, I don't really do chit-chat, or small talk, and I'm often at a loss as to what I should say in a light social situation, despite there being 10 dozen possibilities running through my mind. I usually settle for silence, though, because by the time I've thought through a plethora of ""Nice weather"" or ""Your hair looks nice"" nothing comments, it's been an awkwardly long time, and I know it, and anything that I say at that point would just sound forced and fake, so I just... don't. That feeling that I just mentioned, about feeling forced and fake, is such a strong one for me that it sometimes overwhelms me when I really don't want it to, and it often feels to me like I come across as being cold and unfeeling when I really just don't know what to say to show how affected I really am. It was only when the book started talking about being 'sensitive' that it started to click. I've always been overly affected by emotionally charged situations. If you read some of my reviews of tear-jerker books, I mention this frequently. I remember when I was a kid, there was a show called Rescue 911 that my mom liked to watch. It was always some traumatic situation - a car wreck or an injured hiker or a woman trapped in a housefire, etc, and the show focused on the EMTs and firefighters and police called out to help. That show would always make me cry. Always. Every single episode. It didn't matter whether the people made it out OK, or if they all died, I would be in tears. I could just imagine how scary it would be and I had such respect for the kind of people who could deal with that kind of trauma every day and keep it together enough to help. It would all just overwhelm me, and I would cry. My point here, and how this relates to my last paragraph, is that my dad would often poke fun at me for getting upset over the show, and so I learned to hide that I was upset... oftentimes laughing to cover it. Laughing. As I got older into my teens, I just stopped showing that sensitivity in front of others at all, and unfortunately, that's carried over into my adult life. So now, when I feel strong emotions, it's easier for me to let them out when I'm alone, even though it makes me seem heartless to not show them when it's appropriate. Like at my grandma's funeral earlier this year, when my entire extended family was crying and talking and interacting, and I was stoically sitting in the pew, just thinking about her and how much I'll miss her. After the service, when I was alone, I completely lost my shit. I loved that woman, dammit. She was awesome.Anyway, if you're still reading, sorry for the overshare. What I'm getting at is that I loved how this book made me feel normal. It's well-researched, well-written, and engaging, and I'm incredibly glad that I read it. I think that it will... maybe not CHANGE my life, so much as improve it. I now know more about why I do certain things, and that's empowering. I can relate better to my boyfriend (an extrovert), and in my new job, and in social situations. And I can try to work on the things that I now recognize hinder me more than help me. Definitely a fascinating read. Highly recommended. "

Although I confess, I never thought that introverts would need to be explained to extroverts. I thought we were self-evident, and it was the other, noisy, dominant half of the world that was inexplicable. (They still are.) It possibly needs a companion volume -- Noisy: the hegemony of people with nothing helpful to say who still won't shut up, or something. (Cue reality TV, talk radio, and horrible crush parties with loud music, where you couldn't hear anyone even if they were interesting.) Anyway.This made a curious juxtaposition with my last-read book Fossil Horses. MacFadden, a scientist, argued like a scientist; Cain, a lawyer, argues like a lawyer. I discern the differences even as I appreciate the advocacy. Cain develops her case through illustrative anecdotes, and references to science, psychology, and history as needed. Very readable. I confess, I hadn't thought of extroversion as the American cultural ideal, even as I have witnessed plenty of the cited behaviors. My world tends to be divided practically into ""people who read"" and ""everybody else"", which cuts unevenly across the extrovert/introvert divide, with the obvious bias.I sort of want to go out and press this book upon ""everybody else"", but one sees the inherent problem with that. I hope its message can cut through the noise somehow, nonetheless.Recommended.Ta, L."

I once again learned that every path has a value, also a quiet one and a whispering voice is not less valid, just less loud. Basically already that is more than enough to recommend it.If you consider yourself an introvert and doubt your own worth in comparison with more outgoing or established people, this is for you.If you are in any way interested in the introvert - extrovert spectrum, this will give you some very good understanding. For me the Quiet Revolution is a bit over the top, but that came after the book and doesn't make it any less valuable. "

"
202,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"I feel sure Quiet will become the benchmark book on the topic of introversion. This is because it not only thoroughly explains introversion but champions it. It’s a book by an introvert for introverts, to help them understand themselves and feel proud of who they are. It’s also a book for extroverts, but especially those extroverts who are convinced that introversion is a flaw. Cain will have them wishing they were introverts. Quiet is inarguably biased in favor of introversion, but that’s the point. Up to one-half of Americans are introverted. It’s absurd that introversion is scoffed at as much as it is. The time has come for the introverted label to be a compliment rather than a criticism. This book is a leap in that direction.Cain covered many facets of introversion, from the intriguing “highly sensitive” subset (which describes about 20% of all introverts) to differences in the Eastern and Western worlds to the introverted child (specifically in the classroom, which favors extroverts). Also explored is the age-old question of nature versus nurture and brain differences between extroverts and introverts--plus more. I greatly enjoyed the Eastern versus Western section. America, and the Western world in general, has what Cain dubs an “Extrovert Ideal.” The opposite is true in the East. Whereas in the West, introversion is viewed as a weakness to be conquered, in the East, it’s considered a strength; extroversion is frowned upon, viewed as something that must be tamed. The general sentiment is that extroverts are overwhelming people, wasting others’ time with empty chatter. It’s in this section that Cain profiled Don Chen, an Asian-American student studying at Harvard business school, a very extroverted place. He’s the embodiment of introversion and must feign extroversion daily to get through his classes and general life as part of the school. Feigning extroversion is draining, and Chen needs solitude every day to recharge. This is how it is for all introverts, and Cain stressed repeatedly that it’s not a defect, just a difference. Chen has an intimate group of friends (entirely Asian-American save for one introverted white American man). He’s keenly aware of the differences between his little group and his extroverted classmates. He notes how frequently the extroverts participate in classes while he rarely does and how boisterous they are when together in the cafeteria. Though he admires some of their qualities, he mostly doesn’t understand them. In his mind, they disrespectfully waste classmates’ and professors’ time with their talk, failing to get to the point quickly. If this section sounds borderline racist, it isn’t. Rather, it recognizes that different cultures value different qualities and is a powerful example of introversion as a desirable trait. Chen’s story is one of many in this enlightening book. To support all points, Cain profiled real people, some living, some dead (such as Rosa Parks and Dale Carnegie). The (carefully indexed) research is fascinating in itself, but the real-life examples supporting her research are vital. They round out Quiet to push it beyond dry textbook. I’d read a lot about introversion before reading Quiet, and I bypassed this book for years because others said it offers nothing new on the topic. Readers who’ve read numerous books on the topic or have researched the topic extensively may feel this way. I didn’t. In each chapter, I learned--and was utterly engrossed. Introverts will find Quiet relatable and affirming. Extroverts will find Quiet demystifies introverts thoroughly and will appreciate them more. Both will find it extremely illuminating."

The narrator was excellent.Also, it was a very interesting, insightful, informative read and of course there were lots of issues raised to which I could totally relate, even though sometimes I was a bit confused about what Susan Cain was ultimately trying to prove.I wish I could have read this book as a I teenager as well as my extrovert mother! :)I am from Central-Eastern Europe, so of course not all things ""translate"" directly into how society is working in Hungary as opposed to how things are in the US, but the personal issues are there and are quite universal."
204,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose,5,"This has been probably the one review I've been most intimidated to write for the longest time, and it's not because Susan Cain's ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" isn't a strongly asserted and powerful work. I could sing its respective praises for days. The fact of the matter is - this book really hit me at the heart of my core for so many measures in my life as an introvert. I find it hard to expound just how much this book had an impact on me personally.I could tell you about many things about my person that embody me as an introvert. That I'm quiet spoken and don't speak unless I have something important to say. That small talk isn't something I'm comfortable that I'm not fond of confrontations (though many of you have read my extended written rants about various matters of controversy with very little hesitation). That I tend to spend time alone to recharge my batteries even when I'm called to do things in any scale of extroversion. That my emotional intelligence is very high and I can sympathize/emphathize with people for matters of their experience (though this also makes me highly sensitive).For most of my life, I've been told that these very natural matters of my disposition were wrong. And goodness forbid did that make my life complicated because I didn't feel like people understood who I was. I was even led to believe that I was actually shy, not introverted (many people confuse the two, there is a difference.) Yet the more I learned about the dynamic of introversion and extroversion and how they functioned, I realized that the fundamental difference between them were the derived sources of energy that one functions with in day to day living. That there's nothing wrong with being introverted versus extroverted in a society that - in mainstream notations, champions the latter.This book had me thinking for days after I finished it.I liked that Cain's narrative focuses on the positive contributions and the inherent strengths that lie in introversion because it's widely stereotyped. That stereotyping actually harms our society more than we ourselves may realize in the daily grind, not just individually. By trying to mold people into one acceptable standard, we often lose out on what unique strengths and contributions one may have from going away from such a standard. Narratives like ""Quiet"" have relevance not just in recognizing the distinct psychological functions and differences we have as individuals, but also in the relationships and contributions we have in our professions, our activities, and even wider perceptions of our society in general.I appreciated the expansion on famous figures like Rosa Parks in terms of her backstory and identity as an introvert and how that shaped her responses (I'll have to pick up ""Quiet Strength"" at some point). I also appreciated hearing Cain's own struggles with coming to terms with her introversion, and even the story of the Harvard Business student. There are so many individual stories in this narrative and Cain gives a thorough examination of the details within. It's amazing just how much work and thought went into expounding these issues and individual narratives. This narrative examines introversion not only as a social construct, but individual - delving into narratives of biological, psychological, and sociological importance. There's an examination on the level of intorversion among different cultures, how introspection is valuable to creativity versus ""groupthink"", how extroversion and introversion are not mutually exclusive (and situations that call for each). I came out of it all with not only a fresh perspective on how valuable introverts are to the fabric of society, but also a greater sense of self-worth for my own traits. And that's something to be thankful for. My hope is that with more people who pick up ""Quiet"" and realize how important our individual attributes are, that it'll provide for more opportunities to be creative and to value each other in our relationships regardless of differences, for our unique strengths regardless of how their expressed or from where they come.Overall score: 5/5 stars"
205,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,4,"There are a load of books I've marked ""to be reviewed"", and just completely ignored - it was 2013 when I read this! - so here goes, let's make the list a bit smaller.Here's the moment where I'm supposed to tell you I'm an introvert, so let's get that out of the way: obviously I am. My credentials include cheerfully working from home, getting overstimulated in quiet libraries, and keeping in touch with my closest friends almost entirely by snail mail. I have been known to feel oversocialised sitting in a darkened room, listening to people two rooms away watch a film.As far as a lot of media is concerned, I may as well be a pet hamster. ""Care for your introvert."" Try not to interrupt them. Don't go in their nest while they're sleeping. Offer them a way out when you're at a party, in case they run out of carrot sticks and want to go home. I may as well also be a complete rarity: a third of people don't get hissy when you take their carrot sticks away; come the fuck on.So, what I liked about Quiet was that it didn't make me feel like a special snowflake or someone's hamster.But also... the section on introversion in leadership and the workplace has actually boosted my confidence a lot (apart from being really interesting). I've worked for a few people, and the times it's worked best have been the times where they give me a broad, bullet-pointed list of what they want to have happened by what time, and then they go away until that time. The best boss I ever had used to say it was a good day if we never spoke to each other except when one of us brought the other coffee - and I was inclined to agree with him. Faced with common-sense-logic, which seems to say that 5000 feedback sessions and an open-plan office with communal ball-pit are what millennials are looking for, I wanted this narrative. It was useful to hear. Maybe it's less useful if you're the sort of person who's been reading this sort of thing for years. For me, it was a helpful reminder.I remember a little interesting neurological detail, but not a lot - I can get more than that keyword-searching the Scientific American website, if I want to - and a fair bit of interesting historical anecdote. I remember coming away with a renewed respect for anyone who parents, especially by themselves, as well as a sense of purpose about working for myself and by myself - which I'm happy to say I'm now doing. It turns out, a lot of the time, that people who contract you for work over the internet don't really give a shit about your sparkling and gracious personality. They just want to know you're conscientious and you know what you're talking about and you'll do things when you say you will. I vaguely credit Susan Cain with giving me the impetus to go and do what I want to do, and not to feel like I have to be constantly nice to people I don't know. Now I just think, it's okay, I have character, and then put my headphones back in."
206,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5524572-kristin-hackett-superspacechick,4,"As a self proclaimed introvert, I've been meaning to read this book for so long. My sister in law gave me a copy for Christmas so I prioritized it as a January read and I'm so glad I did. I really enjoyed the in depth look at what constitutes an introvert vs. an extrovert. Quiet even redefined the meaning of the word sensitive for me. I've never considered myself sensitive before but to pull a quote, ""highly sensitive people tend to be keen observers who look before they leap. They arrange their lives in ways that limit surprises. They’re often sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, pain, coffee... Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments—both physical and emotional—unusually deeply. They tend to notice subtleties that others miss—another person’s shift in mood, say, or a lightbulb burning a touch too brightly.""- this is 100% spot on for me. While I do agree with a lot of what Susan Cain wrote, I do think it's difficult to classify people into only one of two categories. She did stress that just because someone is an introvert, it doesn't mean that 1) they got there the same way as someone else or 2) that both people will have exactly the same traits. There are still variables to consider. Overall, I loved that Quiet is a celebrated look at introversion and the strengths that those with introverted qualities possess. There were a few anecdotes that weren't the most interesting (or relevant like the chapter on raising children), but I still found value in reading them. "

As children, introverts like to daydream, play inside and their feelings are easily hurt. ""They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. . ."" They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy and fear.""

208,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,2,"Why is it that the “ideal” person is extroverted? That we pride social skills and being outgoing? All while a deeply gifted thinker who prefers to be in his/her head is described as lacking these traits. Looking at it from an evolutionary standpoint, there is a reason why introverts exist, so why do we rate it as second best? Being a true-blue introvert, I turned to Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a world that can’t stop talking” to answer these questions (and maybe propose new ones). Susan Cain divides “Quiet” into four main sections with the first focusing on the history and description of the rise of extroverts, the differences in leadership styles of introverts and extroverts, and the myths surrounding them. This section begins “Quiet” with a slow and unmemorable beginning. Cain focuses more of an effort on real-life case studies versus actual scientific studies, bypassing any professional data or even her own opinions. The studies which are mentioned are not “earth-shattering” in depth nor do they truly correlate to her hypothesis. In fact, much of the hypothesis is lost and the flow is not seamless or clear. On one hand, this makes the reading understandable and accessible for the less scientifically-inclined reader, but to others craving more research; Cain leaves something to be desired. Some of Cain’s examples which could be perceived as “witty” (Craig Newark of Craigslist fame, Dr. Suess, and Moses from the Bible) are underdeveloped and also lose connection with the hypothesis. Cain is often abrupt and cuts herself short. Furthermore, many of the chapters begin in the same exact way (both format and creativity) which is tedious and creates a loss of interest. The second section of “Quiet” describes some of the brain and neurological aspects of introverts featuring more science than the first section. Cain’s work is a bit more compelling in this respect and certainly more interesting. However, it still isn’t clear what she is trying to prove as she mostly just describes how introverts “are”. Plus, most of the findings are self-explanatory and even obvious. Again, the reader will not be blown away. I have read MANY “brain books” (psychology/neurology, science, and biology) and generally, I am left both flabbergasted and repeating information I’ve read to anyone who will listen. This was not the case with “Quiet” as only a small dose of information felt standout. As the second portion progresses, Cain does present tests and experimentation results more confidentially (however, there is a lack of elaboration). The third section of “Quiet” is comparatively shorter, as Cain explains the conformities and values of the Asian cultures while in the fourth section, Cain offers tips and lifestyle adaptations for introverts in various areas such as work, romance, parenting, play, etc. At this point, “Quiet” appears to be more of a self-help book. The latter end of the book is overly focused on parenting and schooling of children causing me to feel alienated and distanced (having no children). Furthermore, the “Conclusion” is weak and sums up the book which actually reinforces how few points are made. Simply, “Quiet"" is not what I expected. Instead of explaining “why” introverts are the way they are; Cain described “how” they are with an absence of data I would have preferred. All in all though, it has been confirmed (which I already knew) that I am indeed an introvert."
209,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A lance is broken for the needs of introverted people Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Whether one opposes the sanguine with the phlegmatic nature, the wild daredevil the thoughtful inventor or merely the introversion the extroversion, the temperament is and remains in specific proportions decisive for a human being. The author has re-examined this fact with an unconventional approach, opening up exciting and critical viewing angles. Times are changing. In the 19th century, it was still commonplace to be modest, humble and unobtrusive. Starting from the advertising industry in the 1920s and 1930s, it continued to run to the idealistic goal of total superficiality. Ads began to play with people's fear of the negative connotations of ominous, alien observers, and the appearance and ability to attract more and more attention. The new religion of narcissism was supported by an entrepreneurial mentality that understood handshaking qualities, dazzling rhetoric, and slick eloquence as signs of business qualification.Thus, when the loudest and most risk-taking specimens of the managerial species, elite colleges that encourage elbow mentality-driven, superficial behavior, occupy key positions, one or the other financial market collapse is no longer surprising. The flowers of this development on the example of today's America could seem bizarre if the consequences were not so serious. Thus, adjectives such as shy and quiet or just hints of a sly-boy mentality are dismissed as entirely negative and peculiar. Whether in school, work or private life, who does not understand playing on the highly sophisticated keyboard of interpersonal communication, quickly falls through the typical rust. Sensitive children, even as babies, are prone to intensified reactions to external stimuli, are more empathetic and need seeming timidity as a protective mechanism against a formally overwhelming universe. At the same time, individuals naturally endowed with a more robust psychic scaffolding sound lighthearted, but also more emotionless, to their surroundings.Parents of quieter, a manageable circle of friends their naming and lonely hobbies devoted children are remembered, not only subtle, the importance of popularity and dazzling charm. However, very peculiar that silent children are put under depression or misanthropic suspicion, while too vital, joyful young people are sedated with Ritalin. If the favors of loneliness have been well into adulthood, there is a wide range of seminars that can enhance eloquence, demeanor, and be talking skills to the point of sales genius. Several relationship problems are likely based on the well measurable differences between different natures, even by MRI. While extroverts can bathe in crowds every awaken minute and shy away from loneliness, the relationship is reversed by introverts. This involves interpersonal explosives in itself when the mantra of the attractive opposites once no longer pulls, and the supposed truce of the relationship beginning is over. Additional spontaneous emotional responses provoke the fact that extroverts interpret specific aggressive behavior as interest and attention while introverts feel injured and attacked. Assessing the damage caused to the economy by incorrectly designing work processes and their surroundings is difficult or even impossible. If one adds the increased disinclination of introverts in a loud open-plan atmosphere, including the wasted potential, because gifted thinkers find no peace to work out ideas and concepts undisturbed, the overall economic damage can be immense. The cultural differences show a contrarian approach of the Asians, where a European-American behavior style is considered a stupid waste of time for listeners. Tranquility and contemplation have a different meaning, superficiality and the glorification of narcissistic principles are considered less desirable. Another, quite thoughtful approach.Eine Lanze gebrochen für die Bedürfnisse der introvertierten MenschenansammlungsvermeiderOb man dem sanguinischen das phlegmatische Naturell entgegenstellt, dem wilden Draufgänger den nachdenklichen Tüftler oder schlicht der Introvertiertheit die Extrovertiertheit, das Temperament ist und bleibt zu bestimmten Anteilen maßgebend für einen Menschen. Die Autorin hat diesen Umstand mit einer unkonventionellen Herangehensweise neu beleuchtet und damit interessante und kritische Betrachtungswinkel eröffnet.So ändern sich die Zeiten. War es im 19 Jahrhundert noch gang und gäbe, bescheiden, demütig und unaufdringlich zu sein, begann, ausgehend von der Werbeindustrie, in den 1920er und 1930er Jahren, ein bis heute andauernder Lauf auf das ideelle Ziel der totalen Oberflächlichkeit. Anzeigen begannen mit der Angst der Menschen vor negativen Assoziationen ominöser, fremder Beobachter zu spielen und das Äußere sowie die Fähigkeit zu gefallen, immer mehr ins Rampenlicht zu rücken. Unterstützung fand die neue Religion des Narzissmus von einer Unternehmermentalität, die Handschlagqualitäten, blendende Rhetorik und aalglatte Eloquenz als Zeichen betriebswirtschaftlicher Qualifikation auffasste. Wenn auf diese Weise immer die lautesten und risikofreudigsten Exemplare der Managerspezies, von zu ellbogenmentalitätsgesteuerten, oberflächlichen Verhalten animierenden Elitehochschulen, Schlüsselpositionen besetzen, verwundert der eine oder andere Finanzmarktkollaps gar nicht mehr.Die Blüten dieser Entwicklung am Beispiel des heutigen Amerikas könnten skurril anmuten, wären die daraus resultierenden Konsequenzen nicht derart gravierend. So werden Adjektive wie schüchtern und ruhig oder nur Andeutungen einer Eigenbrötlermentalität als durchwegs negativ und absonderlich abgetan. Sei es in Schule, Beruf oder Privatleben, wer nicht versteht auf der hochkomplexen Klaviatur zwischenmenschlicher Kommunikation zu spielen, fällt leicht einmal durch den sozialen Rost.Sensible Kinder neigen schon als Babys zu verstärkten Reaktionen auf äußere Reize, sind einfühlsamer und benötigen die scheinbare Furchtsamkeit als Schutzmechanismus gegen ein sie mit Eindrücken förmlich erschlagendes Universum. Gleichzeitig wirken von Natur aus mit einem robusteren psychischen Gerüst ausgestattete Individuen unbeschwerter, aber auch emotionsloser auf ihre Umgebung. Eltern ruhiger, einen überschaubaren Freundeskreis ihr Eigen nennender und sich einsamen Hobbies widmender Kinder werden, nicht nur durch die Blume, an die Wichtigkeit von Beliebtheit und blendendem Charme erinnert. Doch sehr eigentümlich, dass stille Kinder unter Depressions- oder Misanthropiegeneralverdacht gestellt werden, während allzu vitale, lebensfrohe junge Menschen mit Ritalin sediert werden.Sollte sich die Favorisierung der Einsamkeit bis ins Erwachsenenalter durchgeschlagen haben, gibt es eine breite Palette an Seminarangeboten, die Beredsamkeit, Auftreten und Plauschkompetenzen bis hin zum Verkaufsgenie steigern können. Etliche Beziehungsprobleme dürften auf den, auch per MRT gut messbaren Unterschieden zwischen verschiedenen Naturellen basieren. Während Extrovertierte jede wache Minute in Menschenmengen baden könnten und Einsamkeit scheuen, kehrt sich das Verhältnis bei Introvertierten um. Das birgt zwischenmenschlichen Sprengstoff in sich, wenn das Mantra von den sich anziehenden Gegensätzen einmal nicht mehr richtig zieht und der vermeintliche Waffenstillstand des Beziehungsbeginns vorüber ist. Zusätzliche spontane emotionale Reaktionen provoziert die Tatsache, dass Extrovertierte bestimmtes, aggressives Verhalten als Interesse und Aufmerksamkeit interpretieren, während Introvertierte sich verletzt und angegriffen fühlen.Den für die Wirtschaft entstandenen Schaden durch falsche Konzeption von Arbeitsabläufen samt deren Umgebungen einzuschätzen mutet schwer bis unmöglich an. Wenn man die verstärkte Krankheitsneigung Introvertierter in lauter Großraumbüroatmosphäre inklusive dem verschwendeten Potential, weil begnadete Denker keine Ruhe finden, um Ideen und Konzepte ungestört ausarbeiten zu können, addiert, dürfte der gesamtvolkswirtschaftliche Schaden immens sein.Die kulturellen Unterschiede zeigen eine konträre Herangehensweise der Asiaten, bei denen ein europäisch-amerikanisches Gebaren als unhöfliche Verschwendung der Zeit von Zuhörern gewertet wird. Ruhe und Kontemplation haben eine andere Bedeutung, Oberflächlichkeit und die Verherrlichung narzisstischer Prinzipien gelten als wenig erstrebenswert. Ein anderer, durchaus in Erwägung zu ziehender Ansatz."
210,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3621230-angie,5,"A must read for everyone, not just introverts. Susan Cain, former Wall Street lawyer and self-described introvert, investigates how introversion has become dangerously scorned in the current American ""Culture of Personality."" I had not fully realized how drastically our cultural values have shifted--and how much American society pushes us to conform--until reading Cain's book. To prove her point, Cain visits American bastions of extroversion promotion, including Harvard Business School, Saddleback Church, Dale Carnegie, Wall Street, and Tony Robbins conferences. She talks with pioneering psychologists and neurologists to explain the studies behind concepts like the dangers of group think, the ability to delay gratification, or the trait called sensitivity. She profiles famous and less-well known introverts to show how the studies play out in real life.Though the many of the activities I'm drawn to (and the things that cause anxiety) scream classic introvert, I have always considered myself an extrovert and frequently put myself in situations where extroverted behavior is valued. However, since quitting my job and globe-hopping for the past two years, I've been surprised (and disappointed) by how often the constant stimulation, new people, and change can drain me--and by how I often feel an overwhelming need for alone time.I found myself relating to many of the points Cain discusses and have since concluded that I'm much more of an introvert than I had thought. (I promise that this isn't just because she does a good job of highlighting all the positive things about introverts!)So for that, I am grateful to have read Quiet, though I can't quite believe it took reading a book to figure that out about myself! I am seeing my preferences in a new light and have much understanding and acceptance regarding the things that interest me (and those that cause me stress). I've been having trouble narrowing down 'what I want to do with my life' and this book has helped me more than any other, because I finally feel like I can accept that the things I really enjoy are just a part of me and can't be ignored. Though the personal application will differ, I suspect many people will come away having learned much more than they expected, if not about themselves, then about people close to them. I had always thought of extroverts and introverts as being on distinct sides of a line, when in fact it's much more of a sliding scale (or perhaps better as two scales: percentage introversion, percentage extroversion). Because we have been culturally pressured and trained to admire extroverted behavior, many of us may be dangerously ignoring our introverted characteristics. This was a game-changing book for me, and I suspect it will be eye-opening to most people who read it."

But I also enjoy giving presentations at school, tutoring peers in writing, and interacting with various people online and in real life. I'd describe myself as an introvert (and my Meyers-Briggs personality type agrees), though both introverts and extroverts would enjoy this fascinating book by Susan Cain. She provides an intriguing, in-depth perspective on introversion, its connotation in contrasting cultures, and the psychology behind it.A profusion of the nonfiction I've read has contained too much of something - too many random anecdotes, too much scientific jargon, too many unnecessary statistics or explanations. But Quiet has the perfect blend of personal anecdotes, interesting analysis, detailed explanations, and compelling statistics. Cain references various studies conducted by psychologists and discusses several aspects related to introversion, such as the extrovert ideal, how extroverts and introverts can compliment each other and work together, nature v. nature, etc. Here's one passage about sensitive people (who tend to be more introverted) that struck a chord with me:""The other thing Aron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they're highly empathic. It's as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people's emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world. They tend to have unusually strong consciences. They avoid violent movies and TV shows; they're acutely aware of the consequences of a lapse in their own behavior. In social settings they often focus on subjects like personal problems, which others consider 'too heavy'.""I guess I have an excuse for exposing so much of myself on my blog, huh? Anyway, Cain delves into other subjects that are intellectually stimulating too, such as the three things she thinks are important in identifying one's personal project. She even brings up the relationship between Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other famous historical figures.Overall, highly recommended to everyone curious about their own temperaments and how to embrace their natural personalities.

It's perhaps not a surprise that Susan Cain, the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking identifies herself as an introvert. Being quiet, introverted or shy is still seen by many as a problem or handicap to overcome so I can see her motivation for writing it.One this book's premises is that in the last 50 years or so, the Western world moved from a culture of character to a culture of personality, which according to the author has given an advantage to people that enjoyed outgoing, uninhibited personalities. We tend to admire and reward people that exhibit the most gregarious, outgoing traits of extroverts while at the same time undermined and misunderstand those that are most typically seen in more introverted individuals.
Introversion is really about having a preference for lower stimulation environments. So it's just a preference for quiet, for less noise, for less action. Whereas extroverts really crave more stimulation in order to feel at their best.
The author explains that Introversion is a spectrum, and that most of us don't fully fit into an introvert/extrovert definition. It also provides a sort of ""survival guide"" for introverts to help us learn how to better deal with the pressures of living in a world that for the most part rewards those that are extroverts.
Many people believe that introversion is about being antisocial, and that's really a misperception. Because actually it's just that introverts are differently social. So they would prefer to have a glass of wine with a close friend as opposed to going to a loud party full of strangers.
This book helped me understand myself better, identify those traits that makes many of us ""introverts"" different and learn how to use them to our advantage, both on our professional and personal lives. The book is entertaining and well written. If you are interested in learning about introverts, perhaps because you feel like one or someone closed to you does, this book might be of interest to you.After reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking my conclusion is that the world needs both extroverts and introverts and that we all have a role to play.Here's a link to the author's TED TALK which is sort a summarized version of the book:http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_t..."

And the whole idea about needing time out to recover from socialising - I always thought I was just a bit odd, haha.The criticisms that are quite rightly levelled at this book about preaching some kind of binarism between extrovert and introvert are understandable, and am I'm sure that we are all a little too complex for a poorly designed set of questions to provide any sort of sensible analysis or categorisation (would still like to see the questions though...) Most people will be surely be somewhere close to 'ambivert' even if they know themselves to be introverted at heart. For me a major part of young socialisation and growing up was learning to act like an extrovert, if nothing else just to stop people trying to 'bring me out of my shell' or constantly asking what's up as I am 'being quiet'."
215,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena,4,"I really liked this book, especially the beginning part. I so needed to read it. For years people have been telling me to come out of my shell and to be more outgoing and I realized I had definitely playing the role of pseudo-extrovert all this time! I enjoyed reading the fact that we introverts actually have power and hidden strengths. The list of famous introverts surprised me, Rosa Parks, Al Gore and Gandhi in particular. The book also shared some insight into the thinking patterns of extroverts. All in all, it was an interesting book though the end did drag on a bit."
216,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2765658-steve-walker,4,"I was able to obtain a pre-pub reader's copy of Susan Cain's new book.This is a useful book for the introvert forced to be in the public eye.By public eye I mean more than 1 or 2 people. I, as an introvert, gained a better understanding of why I am the way I am. Most introverts will find helpful tips and info on dealing with work and daily matters. Now if I could only have enough money to move away and live in seclusion. ;-)"
217,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5470914-sam,1,"This was the most painful book I have read this summer. I choked it down like bad medicine page after page. Quiet is great self affirmation for someone who considers themselves an introvert, and sees humans as either an extrovert or introvert. Cain certainly thinks she’s the poster child of an introvert, or is she? The book reads like a memoir in parts where she tells stories of her own life, then there are smatterings or small examples in specific parts of people’s lives of how greatness comes in quiet e.g. Steve Wozniak, Gandhi, Rosa Parks. Cain also fancies herself a bit of a child psychologist, on one hand it’s ok for kids to be shy or in their shell, these aren’t bad things, and very normal, but on the other hand we need to nudge and push slowly to get kids out of their quiet place. So which is it?It doesn’t bother me that Cain isn’t a psychologist or economist, but she’s talking through both sides of her mouth, the book is a pity party, she thinks the decisions in modern workplaces are influenced by highly extroverted personalities like those from the Harvard Business School. There’s no backing for this other than the fact that business students are extroverts. Additionally the economic crisis was wholly the fault of extroverts, basically extroverts with their loud voices overpowered the brilliant quiet hardworking, and smart introverts and ran the economy to the ground. I’m afraid you really aren’t brilliant if something has already happened and you didn’t do anything to stop it. In hindsight everything is 20/20, just because you are quiet and something bad is happening saying “I knew it!” doesn’t do much. The circlejerk continues when Cain bangs on about everyone who a douche as being an extrovert. Good guys are introverts, Warren Buffet because of his one speech about the dot com bubble bursting was quiet and well calculated in his words. The rest of the word are greedy businessmen. There’s some sample or thin slicing in her discussions that I find problematic, and read a bit like a tabloid. Susan Cain is clearly appealing to an audience that is already sold to introversion, and stroking those egos. I wish the book had more solutions instead of harping about how bad people are. The book blurs it’s lines through many genres, self help, psychology and a dash of group-think. I consider myself an introvert, but also an extrovert, yes I do believe brilliance happens in unaccompanied activities like running. I charge my batteries during times like this but I also don’t “suffer in silence”. I don’t believe people are fully introverted or extroverted. Reading Khaneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and Mcgonigal’s Willpower Instinct make Cain’s book look hurriedly and thoughtlessly written, there’s little appeal to science. "
218,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,3,"I expected to love, love, love this book. After all, psychology is one of my passions. Also, I am always interested in hearing from some group. And this is saying, ""We, the introverts, are speaking out.""However, the book was neither as powerful nor as interesting as I was hoping....Cain does a great job of blending together different aspects. The three main angles she uses are:1.) Famous people who were introverts. She usually starts her chapters with a story about a wonderful famous person we all know and adore - and then explaining how they were introverted. Rosa Parks, Dale Carnegie, and Eleanor Roosevelt are some of the examples she used.2.) Case studies. This is the real life introvert ""Jane Doe."" She was on this job and thought she would have to quit because she just wasn't outgoing enough. Then she learned that being an introvert was like having a secret superpower! And then she used her introversion to overcome all obstacles! Now she's rich and/or happy. Success!3.) Science - hard and soft. Cain uses both psychology and biology to try and explain the differences between extroverts and introverts. She also explains why introversion might be valuable in evolution and natural selection. She has a fascinating chapter on culture, which emphasizes that although extroversion is worshiped in the USA, many Asian countries value silence, reflection, and understanding over cheerfulness, enthusiasm, and talkativeness. ...This book is at it's best when Cain is exploring how introversion is a valuable and worthy trait or way of being. When she journeys into different places to see how introversion is treated differently there. When she explores how introversion can be a survival aid in the wild and how introverted people can be powerful in their own way.It's exciting and interesting to realize that extroversion - while venerated in America - is actually seen as crass and dumb in many Asian cultures.And it's fun and cool to see different theories of how introverted people and animals are strong in Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection. I liked seeing different species and the benefits and drawbacks they experience from being extroverted or introverted. And I enjoyed seeing how introversion could be a kick-butt evolutionary trait which is often overlooked or thought to be something that needed 'killing off.'I thought about 2/3 of the book were weak, though. For instance, I already know enough about famous figures and do not particularly want or need to read a short biography or story about them. Another thing that bugged me were her ""real life introversion stories."" Here is how an introvert struggled. Here is how he learned to embrace his true self and be happy/rich.The whole book just felt like a big pat on the back. ""Don't worry, introverts, you're okay! Everything's okay! It might seem like the world hates you, but use your strengths! You are really amazing.""And it's not even like I DISAGREE with this message, it's simply that I was expecting more than a rather thinly-veiled self-help book. P.S. I really like the page or two that Cain dedicates to exploring Moses (an alleged introvert) and Aaron (his extroverted mouthpiece). It is also interesting when she lightly touches on whether or not the Church and modern-day Protestants shun and punish introverts as not doing the Lord's work. I like when she questions whether Jesus was an introvert or extrovert (covered in one paragraph, very shallow) and questions whether the Church is pushing an incorrect message on it's followers. (""Real Christians proselytize! How can you be a REAL Christian if you are not gregarious?"") I also like when she uses the teachings and life of Gandhi to emphasize that passivity is NOT submissiveness. All these subjects were things I wished she'd explored in greater depth."
219,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light,5,"Eye-opener. Astounding. Life-changing. Inspirational. Insightful. All these adjectives and more describe my experience with this amazing book.I'm very much an introvert. I try to avoid social functions as much as possible, but I do love meeting every so often with my dear friends one-on-one. If I do end up at a party, you can bet I'm the one keeping the corner warm. I am an avid reader, a knitter, a sometimes writer, a nerd, and an engineer. My idea of a perfect evening is one spent in the comfort of my apartment, cat in lap, book in hand, coffee at my side. My idea of a perfect vacation is one where I can go to my favorite coffee shop and read. In college, my favorite classes were Differential Equations (in which I, the only female, got a perfect score on the final), Physics, and Fluids. Ever since elementary school, I dreaded a school performances, such as Christmas programs or poetry recitals. At work meetings, I am more likely to listen to everything and be note-taker than I am to present or volunteer ideas.Lately, my boss has said that I need to step things up, become more ""out there"" and confident. Inwardly, I despaired. Wasn't I working hard enough? What was holding me back? Why couldn't I just blurt things out in meetings? Why did I constantly sound nervous, even if I really wasn't? Was there any hope for me to change?And then, like a sign from heaven, I saw this book in the ""New Books"" display at Barnes and Nobles (BTW, I happen to swing by the bookstore at least once a week during lunch - sometimes to purchase, but mostly to pass the time). I remembered a friend had read this and really enjoyed it, and I figured it would help me figure out myself.""Figure myself out"" would be an understatement; it's as if this book were written specifically for me! Cain breaks down what it means to be an introvert. Turns out despite what my sister is constantly telling me, I'm not weird (alright, not too weird). I have talents and skills. I have a place. And it's not my fault I can't always speak up and make my voice heard. A lot of it is because of how our workforce, our employers, our coworkers, our society functions. Our biology, our parents, our surroundings make us the introverted beings we are. It's just that school and work and the outside world try to tell us that being quiet, that listening and ruminating over things is wrong, that we should be quick to speak and blurt whatever is on our mind.I've known I was an introvert for a while, but it was so refreshing and liberating to learn that there were others with my ""problem"". That I wasn't alone. And, most importantly, I can overcome, nay thrive, in this Extroverted world. And that is the second gift Cain gives us in this book: how to be an Introvert in an Extrovert world and not want to choke yourself at night.I feel like, after reading Quiet, I have a plan for facing my ""work problems"". I feel like I can take the challenge my boss has placed in front of me and succeed. Although a part of me still wishes I could crawl back to my desk and burrow there, I think this book has given me the tools and encouragement I need to speak up.If you are an introvert, you definitely need to read this book. Even if you aren't an introvert, this is a great book to understanding how they think and act. I'm definitely passing this along to everyone I know."
220,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Years ago, my division manager at work had everybody in the division take the Meyer Briggs personality test. Then we spent time in a workshop, to understand the implications of our personality types. One of the dimensions of the test is extroversion/introversion (E or I types). This book offers a very satisfying account of what it means to be an introvert. Generally Western cultures admire extroverts, while Asian cultures admire introverts. Both types of personalities offer value to society. Groups of people who are introverts are best with an extroverted leader, while groups of extroverts are best with an introverted leader.Many introverts find it difficult to live in a society that values extroversion more highly. As a result, many introverts pretend to be extroverts in certain social situations. But they cannot maintain this pretension indefinitely, and at some point in time they must ""recharge"" their internal batteries with quiet and solitude. The book makes a major point here: It's perfectly OK to pretend to be an extrovert for periods of time--as long as you do this while you are working at something that you truly love.The book has useful practical advice for introverts. If you are an introvert and your husband or wife is an extrovert, there is much to be said about how to maintain or improve your relationship. If you are raising a child who is an introvert, it is important to understand how to encourage the child to follow his/her innate abilities.Back in the 1940's and 1950's, Alex Osborn was plagued by the lack of creativity in his advertising agency. So, he wrote some books introducing the concept of ""brainstorming"". The idea is for people get together in groups and toss out ideas without fear of ridicule--the more ideas, the better. The problem is, in the 1960's, studies showed that brainstorming is not efficient; you can get more, good ideas if people simply think creatively in solitude. Committees simply are not as productive as the sum of individuals working alone. We are so inculcated with the idea that brainstorming is best--but this is really just a reflection of the dominance of extroversion in our society. "
221,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4811203-emily-b,3,"As an introvert and psychology graduate this was an interesting read however it was not what I was expecting. I felt like it wasn’t as accessible as it could have been. It seems very focused on introverts in or who wish to be in very high powered job roles. Which isn’t my world. I was hoping for a bit more knowledge or ‘self help’ regarding being an introvert in an average every day life, Not as an award winning introverted lecturer, or an introverted Lawyer or CEO."
222,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"It is stated at the start that this book’s purpose is to improve a reader's relationship with others. The book can thus be viewed as a book of the self-help genre. Its aim is to advise introverts on ways by which they can improve their relationships with extroverts, and vice versa. It compares behavioral traits of both introverts and extroverts, showing in what ways they are similar and how they differ. The author mentions books about and summarizes studies related to extroversion and introversion, conducted over the years and up to today. The book begins with a quick test by which readers can determine where they stand on the introvert / extrovert scale. The test takes only a few minutes and gives the reader an immediate connection with the topics to be discussed. Both my husband and I took the test. We both received the same score, indicating that we are both strong introverts. It is interesting to note that although we had the same score, we did not answer all questions in the same way. This led to a lively discussion and a fun start to the book! Twenty questions are to be answered with a yes or a no. The book demonstrates clearly that in America it is the extroverts that hold sway--in the government, in business and in most educational institutions. It is an important and valuable statement that is being made. This is often to the detriment of introverts and to society as a whole. While the author professes the importance and value of both the introvert and the extrovert way of thinking, given the suppression of introverts in society today, it is introverts she lauds most, giving example after example of their accomplishments. I didn’t need to be convinced. For me, it is OBVIOUS that society benefits from the presence of both. The book verges on becoming a manifesto for introverts. This appeals to me no more than society's pronounced favoritism of extroverts! The book accomplishes well what it has set out to do, but I am rarely enthused by books of the self-help genre. It does advise readers on how their relationships can be improved. It also explains how schools can be adapted to better suit the needs of introverts, without hampering the situation for extroverts. I do however find much of the advice given as being rather obvious. The sections I like most are those that are scientifically oriented. I like for example the parts about how the brain functions; sections about the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex and the connection to dopamine are interesting. Many studies are referred to, but how exactly each was performed is skimmed over in too brief a manner. We are told what the results have for implications, but skeptic that I am, I was not always convinced! I need more details. To add depth, opposing points of view should have been added. Intuitively, I agree with the conclusions drawn, but I would have preferred more solid proof. Too many generalizations/simplifications are made. Over and over again we are told that so and so was an introvert and so and so an extrovert. This is all too simple! Individuals are mixes of introvert and extrovert qualities. Instead, an analysis of the tangled mix of traits that make up real people is what I was looking for. At one point Moses is classified as an introvert! This was just too much for me. The author swiftly classifies famous people as being either introvert or extrovert with little analysis of their specific character traits. I find this too categorical. We are told that Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, would never have written the books she wrote and become the ""bold thinker"" that she became had she not been left alone to read books in her youth. Where is the proof in that?! The author generalizes and simplifies all too often. The book is directed primarily toward Americans. I do not appreciate this slant. There is only a brief discussion of Asian American immigrants. Asian Americans of Chinese background are classified as introverts. Europeans are in a bunch grouped with Americans. I would have preferred a more in-depth, nuanced analysis of national and cultural differences.I wish the book had been more globally and more scientifically oriented. It has too many generalizations. It is basically a self-help book, a genre that does not appeal to me, so I guess it is not so bad that I nevertheless felt it to be worth reading. I would have preferred more in-depth analyses concerning how individuals are complicated mixes of introversion and extroversion. We are not one or the other, as was so often stated in reference to the people mentioned. The narration of the audiobook by Kathe Mazur started out very fast, but eventually she slows down. Her rapid speed had me chuckling at the beginning. Why? Because it is the extroverts, not us introverts that talk fast! Didn’t the producers of the audiobook realize the incongruity?! We introverts need time to stop and think and time to examine the ideas floating around in our heads. The narration is easy to follow once Mazur has slowed down. She has a soft, pleasant voice, a perfect match for introverts, the central protagonists of the book. The question is how many extroverts read this book. It is interesting to think about why this may be so."
223,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,5,"This book is very insightful and informative. I watched Susan Cain's TED talk once and I was fascinated being an introvert myself. As a kid I was shy, serious, studious with a little bit of social anxiety and although as I grew up, I outgrew my shyness and got more confident socially, there have been many situations where I questioned myself. Once when I was out on a trip with a big group of college friends, everyone was getting along so well and they seemed to be having so much fun together but I felt so lonely and left out and I was like, ''What's wrong with me''? Turns out I'm just an introvert. Then, I found this book. It describes in detail what introversion and extroversion is and what are the traits associated with both personalities. Where in most areas (or cultures), the introversion or shyness is viewed in a negative light, the writer states that it's an essential trait and how powerful it could be and it should be valued just as extroversion is. I found this book very interesting to read because she presents her ideas by using data gathered from case studies, research and her own personal experiences and from other people. She has also provided analysis of many famous personalities and how their temperaments shaped their actions and how essential their role was. Many definitions are provided for introversion-extroversion and how our genes and our environment play a role in shaping our personalities. There is no personality type better than the other but creating a balance is very important to bring out the best in both. The message in short is- value your individuality and do things the way you want and not because you have to conform to certain cultural norms. It also tells how both personalities can strike a balance between both traits. Also, both extroverts and introverts can lead a fulfilling life without changing their core values or trying to be someone they are not, the power lies in knowing who you are, what your abilities are and using them to the best.After reading this book, I feel like I can understand myself a little better now, what my motivations are and what makes me the way I am. I recommend this book to both introverts and extroverts as it can help them understand the qualities in themselves and in each other."
224,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2598642-catelyn-may,4,"I loved this book. As an introvert, I felt like someone was finally telling my side of the story, and understanding my life in general. Definitely going to loan it to some extroverted family members. "
225,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1230817-lori,5,"I'm really excited about all the works about introverts that's been coming out lately, I think mainly because of this book. I'm not sure if extroverts would have enjoyed this book as much as me, because Cain works hard to prove the merits and necessity of introverts in our society, while down-playing all the reasons why we should have an extrovert ideal. In fact, I think some extroverts would feel a bit offended at this book. But I don't care. I've lived my whole life feeling like there was something wrong with me. I need to speak up, get out there, sell myself, basically become something that I'm not. This book made me realize there's nothing wrong with me, and that I actually have strengths that my extroverted friends, relatives, etc., do not. Instead of constantly seeing myself as disadvantaged because I suck at small talk, don't know how to talk myself up in interviews, and am just a shy person, I just feel like I know myself better. I think teachers should read this book. And I'm going to stop, because this isn't so much as a book review as a blog post or something. This is a total self-help book for introverts. Thank you Cain!**I should also say that Cain uses extensive research and interviews to show the strengths of introverts, so it's actually a pretty scientific book (though made so that it's easy for the every day person like me to understand). I was really surprised at the amount of research done on the differences between introverts and extroverts, especially because the research often shows introverts in a good, positive light, unlike what most people think when they hear the word introvert.

First of all, as far as the audio format goes, they couldn’t have chosen a better narrator. Kathe Mazur’s voice fits the tone of the book perfectly–quiet and measured, yet firm. I basically just want to listen to every audiobook she’s ever narrated. Back to Quiet –I think Susan Cain did a stellar job of exploring the introverted personality type. She sites a number of studies and scientific theories to support her thesis that introversion is an undervalued trait in modern American society. Introverts have just as much to offer the world as extroverts and their unique strengths must be utilized for a society to be truly healthy.

227,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"When I was young, my grandfather, an intelligent farmer, used to call me an introvert, as I sat happily in the corner, spending my free time reading books or writing in my notebooks. I looked up at him, I believe I was around the age of eight or so, with crinkled eyebrows. He explained what it meant. But I didn't have a puzzled look on my face because I didn't understand the word, I was puzzled because he said it like he disapproved. Like it was a bad thing. My aunt, the doctor, immediately came to my defense and said, ""Janine, just tell him that you're not an introvert, you're just introspective."" That became my motto in life. I said it often, mostly because I felt those were big words and others would think I was smart. I never thought about it much later in life until I read this book. Cain talks about the virtues of being an introvert but how society has come to prize the personality traits of the extrovert. Being a pretty extreme extrovert, at first, I didn't think this book was for me. But then I thought back to when I was eight, and realized with shock and I wasn't just a person who could be both, although I was, I am, but I went from one extreme to the other. When I was a child, I was the most introverted person I know. Using the word shy to describe me didn't cut it. I would skip class altogether if I was even a minute late, to avoid the fear of having to walk into the classroom with everyone looking at me. Speeches had me thinking thoughts of jumping out of trees just to break a bone so I could get out of giving the speech. Now, I love nothing better than walking into a room full of strange people. It's just a room full of fifty new friends! And talking in front of people? I have to hold myself back in group exercises just so I don't hog the limelight. How did such a huge change occur? I'll tell you how, because of work, school, and problems socially, I was forced into it. As I began to read this book, I saw a lot of truth in what Cain was saying. Extroverts really are prized now, not just socially but in the workplace as well. At the last company I worked for, I sat in cubicles, was encouraged constantly to hold meetings and ""group think"" up ideas. How different it would have been if I was allowed even one hour a day without interruptions! What has made us so concerned with having these qualities? I am homeschooling my children and every time I come across someone who disapproves it's always because of lack of ""socialization"". My five-year-old son has no trouble talking to anyone and being friendly, I think he gets it from me. But he also loves to play by himself. He might get this from me as well! He creates his best Lego creations when left alone for hours at a time. Why is this a bad thing? As Cain points out, some of the best innovators of our time were quiet thinkers. And we might not have had some of those great inventions or works of art had these people been forced to ""socialize"" as children instead of left alone. And really, what is the big deal with needing socialization being such a big part of schooling? Why can't it be found outside of school? I recently watched a documentary about the current school systems and, as most people know, we (The United States), rank very low in all areas of education. In fact, when American children were tested in various areas against other countries of the world, we consistently ranked on the bottom in almost all areas except one. Can you guess what it is? Self-confidence. American children are said to have the highest self-confidence compared to all other countries. How do we explain this to our children? We're idiots but we have pride! Is this because we're placing such importance on making our children extroverts? Some of the case studies Cain uses to show examples of her theories kept me riveted. She also had a twenty question test in case you weren't sure where you stood. The more traits she gave as examples of introverts and extroverts, the less sure I became of which I was. Ask anyone which I was as a child, they would have said introvert, hands down. Ask anyone I know right now, and in a second they'd say extrovert. So I took her test to see where I stood. I thought I was only doubting myself, and that it would show pretty conclusively that I was an extrovert. But in fact, I was split almost exactly down the middle. I love meeting new people, and often feel energized at the end of a big party. But I also get rejuvinated from having alone time every day. Even back in college, when I was one of the most social people around, my roomates all knew that they risked certain death if they bothered me during my ""break time"". I have no problems going to movies alone, and one of my favorite things to do is go out to lunch or dinner at a nice restaurant with a good book as a dinner companion. People look at me weird, but I could care less. Whenever I go out or have a party my motto is always ""The more the merrier"". So where did I stand on this chart? The advice for public speaking for introverts wasn't going to help me. And to say I should have quit reading the book halfway through because I considered myself an extrovert would have had me missing out on some very interesting information. I really enjoyed this book. And I disagree that this book is only for introverts. I think the biggest benefit this book had for me is the eye opener to how we have been pressured to become more extroverted over the years and how we see this change everywhere, from schools, to the workplace, to advertising, to even moralistic behavior. I think all can benefit from having a greater awareness of this personality trait in everyone they know. If you're an extrovert, wouldn't it benefit you from having a better understanding to where your introverted team leader is coming from? And another realization for me, is how I know see my son, who has the tendency to play alone. I now am more aware of how I treat him, and make sure I no longer fall into that stereotypical reaction of ""Why don't you try harder to make friends?"" routine. There's nothing wrong with being an introvert, and if this book has any major theme, that's it. That being said, even though I very much enjoyed this book, I only gave it three stars for a couple of reasons. First of all, I feel like the middle of the road people such as myself were somewhat ignored. Where do we stand? How do we relate better to people and situations? Then there were the case studies. As I mentioned earlier, they were very interesting and really helped in relating to the particular example's Cain discussed. But after a while, they became tedious, and didn't hold my attention as well as the first half of the book. I still think many can benefit from reading this though. It was fun, and I look forward to discussing it with my book club.  ClassicsDefined.com"
228,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"I never really thought of myself as introverted until relatively recently, within the last year or so, when I declined an invitation to go out with a group of friends to the bar and one of them said ""Fine, be introverted then! Hope you enjoy sitting home alone with your cats!"" (She meant it in a teasing, only partially bitchy way, but I didn't take offense. I DO enjoy sitting home alone with my cats.)My semi-bitchy friend actually helped me define a big part of myself. Until then, I just thought of myself as ""the most anti-social Libra ever"", and poked fun at myself for not wanting to go out all the time, or being overwhelmed by loud, boisterous people, or needing time to just be alone - what my boyfriend calls ""cave-dwelling"". I made these things a joke because, according to society, it's not normal to want to spend so much time alone. I'm supposed to be a fun, out-going social butterfly. The thought exhausts me. So, when I read this, it was like someone opened up my head and singled out these aspects of my personality and then wrote them down. It was fascinating to read this book and learn about myself. I see things about my past in a completely new light. Like the situation above. I'd be more than happy to sit at home with a few friends and drink, but going to a bar to drink among a huge crowd just held no appeal. Or like how I approach my work. The sections of this book pertaining to corporate expectations and office structure were fascinating to me, and really allowed me to look at my job and approach to work differently. I'm a good employee and good at my job, but I don't aspire to be in the limelight. I don't MIND recognition or attention for a job well done, but it's not something I seek out. So, when I was recently offered a job with a new company, I had my choice of being in a ""client liaison"" position or a ""analysis and testing"" position, and I took the latter, even though it's a position with less recognition and lower pay. The thought of having to constantly be professionally social with strangers gives me anxiety, though, so it was a no-brainer for me. But when I discussed my decision with friends, they called me crazy to have turned down the higher paying position. As though money is the only criteria worth considering. (A point that this book makes well.)I'm going to miss the job I'm leaving though, because it did give me a kind of structured socialization. I get along great with my team, and there, I'm far more socially outgoing than I would be otherwise. I've worked with many of these people for several years, I trust and respect them, and they are people I consider real friends. Soon I'll be working 100% from home, so my social interaction will be drastically reduced. I may be introverted, but I do need that interaction. The hard part for me will be actually initiating it. I have a tendency to, uhh, forget to be social. I forget to call and text people, even though I mean to do it. But being social is just never at the forefront of my mind. I'll have to work on that. But then there's online communities, which is a completely different world. I have always been more open and (dare I say it?) chatty online than in my ""real life"" social interactions. Maybe it's the anonymity, or the fact that it's text-based, or the fact that the community I'm in here is one that is full of like-minded people with similar interests. People I can relate and talk to easily. I don't know, but I'm quite different online than off. Offline, I don't really do chit-chat, or small talk, and I'm often at a loss as to what I should say in a light social situation, despite there being 10 dozen possibilities running through my mind. I usually settle for silence, though, because by the time I've thought through a plethora of ""Nice weather"" or ""Your hair looks nice"" nothing comments, it's been an awkwardly long time, and I know it, and anything that I say at that point would just sound forced and fake, so I just... don't. That feeling that I just mentioned, about feeling forced and fake, is such a strong one for me that it sometimes overwhelms me when I really don't want it to, and it often feels to me like I come across as being cold and unfeeling when I really just don't know what to say to show how affected I really am. It was only when the book started talking about being 'sensitive' that it started to click. I've always been overly affected by emotionally charged situations. If you read some of my reviews of tear-jerker books, I mention this frequently. I remember when I was a kid, there was a show called Rescue 911 that my mom liked to watch. It was always some traumatic situation - a car wreck or an injured hiker or a woman trapped in a housefire, etc, and the show focused on the EMTs and firefighters and police called out to help. That show would always make me cry. Always. Every single episode. It didn't matter whether the people made it out OK, or if they all died, I would be in tears. I could just imagine how scary it would be and I had such respect for the kind of people who could deal with that kind of trauma every day and keep it together enough to help. It would all just overwhelm me, and I would cry. My point here, and how this relates to my last paragraph, is that my dad would often poke fun at me for getting upset over the show, and so I learned to hide that I was upset... oftentimes laughing to cover it. Laughing. As I got older into my teens, I just stopped showing that sensitivity in front of others at all, and unfortunately, that's carried over into my adult life. So now, when I feel strong emotions, it's easier for me to let them out when I'm alone, even though it makes me seem heartless to not show them when it's appropriate. Like at my grandma's funeral earlier this year, when my entire extended family was crying and talking and interacting, and I was stoically sitting in the pew, just thinking about her and how much I'll miss her. After the service, when I was alone, I completely lost my shit. I loved that woman, dammit. She was awesome.Anyway, if you're still reading, sorry for the overshare. What I'm getting at is that I loved how this book made me feel normal. It's well-researched, well-written, and engaging, and I'm incredibly glad that I read it. I think that it will... maybe not CHANGE my life, so much as improve it. I now know more about why I do certain things, and that's empowering. I can relate better to my boyfriend (an extrovert), and in my new job, and in social situations. And I can try to work on the things that I now recognize hinder me more than help me. Definitely a fascinating read. Highly recommended. "
229,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,5,"So...Just read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, (2012) by Susan Cain, Crown Publishers.I liked this book, and why not -- an in-depth defense of people like me! Although I confess, I never thought that introverts would need to be explained to extroverts. I thought we were self-evident, and it was the other, noisy, dominant half of the world that was inexplicable. (They still are.) It possibly needs a companion volume -- Noisy: the hegemony of people with nothing helpful to say who still won't shut up, or something. (Cue reality TV, talk radio, and horrible crush parties with loud music, where you couldn't hear anyone even if they were interesting.) Anyway.This made a curious juxtaposition with my last-read book Fossil Horses. MacFadden, a scientist, argued like a scientist; Cain, a lawyer, argues like a lawyer. I discern the differences even as I appreciate the advocacy. Cain develops her case through illustrative anecdotes, and references to science, psychology, and history as needed. Very readable. I confess, I hadn't thought of extroversion as the American cultural ideal, even as I have witnessed plenty of the cited behaviors. My world tends to be divided practically into ""people who read"" and ""everybody else"", which cuts unevenly across the extrovert/introvert divide, with the obvious bias.I sort of want to go out and press this book upon ""everybody else"", but one sees the inherent problem with that. I hope its message can cut through the noise somehow, nonetheless.Recommended.Ta, L."
230,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48197248-stephan,5,"This book helped me understand myself better and made me feel better about myself in a difficult time. I once again learned that every path has a value, also a quiet one and a whispering voice is not less valid, just less loud. Basically already that is more than enough to recommend it.If you consider yourself an introvert and doubt your own worth in comparison with more outgoing or established people, this is for you.If you are in any way interested in the introvert - extrovert spectrum, this will give you some very good understanding. For me the Quiet Revolution is a bit over the top, but that came after the book and doesn't make it any less valuable. "
231,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6979065-sylvia,4,"As a true 'introvert' or as I would rather prefer to label it a true 'intermediate' ... a definite so-glad-I-read-this-book for me. And yes, please; a bit of Quiet around me would be most Welcome so that I could Hear my own Quietness & Inner Senses ;-)It explained so many things about me, myself and I - in relation to where I stand in this very loud world that surrounds me everywhere. "
232,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"I feel sure Quiet will become the benchmark book on the topic of introversion. This is because it not only thoroughly explains introversion but champions it. It’s a book by an introvert for introverts, to help them understand themselves and feel proud of who they are. It’s also a book for extroverts, but especially those extroverts who are convinced that introversion is a flaw. Cain will have them wishing they were introverts. Quiet is inarguably biased in favor of introversion, but that’s the point. Up to one-half of Americans are introverted. It’s absurd that introversion is scoffed at as much as it is. The time has come for the introverted label to be a compliment rather than a criticism. This book is a leap in that direction.Cain covered many facets of introversion, from the intriguing “highly sensitive” subset (which describes about 20% of all introverts) to differences in the Eastern and Western worlds to the introverted child (specifically in the classroom, which favors extroverts). Also explored is the age-old question of nature versus nurture and brain differences between extroverts and introverts--plus more. I greatly enjoyed the Eastern versus Western section. America, and the Western world in general, has what Cain dubs an “Extrovert Ideal.” The opposite is true in the East. Whereas in the West, introversion is viewed as a weakness to be conquered, in the East, it’s considered a strength; extroversion is frowned upon, viewed as something that must be tamed. The general sentiment is that extroverts are overwhelming people, wasting others’ time with empty chatter. It’s in this section that Cain profiled Don Chen, an Asian-American student studying at Harvard business school, a very extroverted place. He’s the embodiment of introversion and must feign extroversion daily to get through his classes and general life as part of the school. Feigning extroversion is draining, and Chen needs solitude every day to recharge. This is how it is for all introverts, and Cain stressed repeatedly that it’s not a defect, just a difference. Chen has an intimate group of friends (entirely Asian-American save for one introverted white American man). He’s keenly aware of the differences between his little group and his extroverted classmates. He notes how frequently the extroverts participate in classes while he rarely does and how boisterous they are when together in the cafeteria. Though he admires some of their qualities, he mostly doesn’t understand them. In his mind, they disrespectfully waste classmates’ and professors’ time with their talk, failing to get to the point quickly. If this section sounds borderline racist, it isn’t. Rather, it recognizes that different cultures value different qualities and is a powerful example of introversion as a desirable trait. Chen’s story is one of many in this enlightening book. To support all points, Cain profiled real people, some living, some dead (such as Rosa Parks and Dale Carnegie). The (carefully indexed) research is fascinating in itself, but the real-life examples supporting her research are vital. They round out Quiet to push it beyond dry textbook. I’d read a lot about introversion before reading Quiet, and I bypassed this book for years because others said it offers nothing new on the topic. Readers who’ve read numerous books on the topic or have researched the topic extensively may feel this way. I didn’t. In each chapter, I learned--and was utterly engrossed. Introverts will find Quiet relatable and affirming. Extroverts will find Quiet demystifies introverts thoroughly and will appreciate them more. Both will find it extremely illuminating."
233,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36434323-melindam,4,"3,6 starsWell.... as I am an introvert, I obviously need to comtemplate before writing a review, right? :)But all in all, I am glad I listened to this book. The narrator was excellent.Also, it was a very interesting, insightful, informative read and of course there were lots of issues raised to which I could totally relate, even though sometimes I was a bit confused about what Susan Cain was ultimately trying to prove.I wish I could have read this book as a I teenager as well as my extrovert mother! :)I am from Central-Eastern Europe, so of course not all things ""translate"" directly into how society is working in Hungary as opposed to how things are in the US, but the personal issues are there and are quite universal."
234,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose,5,"This has been probably the one review I've been most intimidated to write for the longest time, and it's not because Susan Cain's ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" isn't a strongly asserted and powerful work. I could sing its respective praises for days. The fact of the matter is - this book really hit me at the heart of my core for so many measures in my life as an introvert. I find it hard to expound just how much this book had an impact on me personally.I could tell you about many things about my person that embody me as an introvert. That I'm quiet spoken and don't speak unless I have something important to say. That small talk isn't something I'm comfortable that I'm not fond of confrontations (though many of you have read my extended written rants about various matters of controversy with very little hesitation). That I tend to spend time alone to recharge my batteries even when I'm called to do things in any scale of extroversion. That my emotional intelligence is very high and I can sympathize/emphathize with people for matters of their experience (though this also makes me highly sensitive).For most of my life, I've been told that these very natural matters of my disposition were wrong. And goodness forbid did that make my life complicated because I didn't feel like people understood who I was. I was even led to believe that I was actually shy, not introverted (many people confuse the two, there is a difference.) Yet the more I learned about the dynamic of introversion and extroversion and how they functioned, I realized that the fundamental difference between them were the derived sources of energy that one functions with in day to day living. That there's nothing wrong with being introverted versus extroverted in a society that - in mainstream notations, champions the latter.This book had me thinking for days after I finished it.I liked that Cain's narrative focuses on the positive contributions and the inherent strengths that lie in introversion because it's widely stereotyped. That stereotyping actually harms our society more than we ourselves may realize in the daily grind, not just individually. By trying to mold people into one acceptable standard, we often lose out on what unique strengths and contributions one may have from going away from such a standard. Narratives like ""Quiet"" have relevance not just in recognizing the distinct psychological functions and differences we have as individuals, but also in the relationships and contributions we have in our professions, our activities, and even wider perceptions of our society in general.I appreciated the expansion on famous figures like Rosa Parks in terms of her backstory and identity as an introvert and how that shaped her responses (I'll have to pick up ""Quiet Strength"" at some point). I also appreciated hearing Cain's own struggles with coming to terms with her introversion, and even the story of the Harvard Business student. There are so many individual stories in this narrative and Cain gives a thorough examination of the details within. It's amazing just how much work and thought went into expounding these issues and individual narratives. This narrative examines introversion not only as a social construct, but individual - delving into narratives of biological, psychological, and sociological importance. There's an examination on the level of intorversion among different cultures, how introspection is valuable to creativity versus ""groupthink"", how extroversion and introversion are not mutually exclusive (and situations that call for each). I came out of it all with not only a fresh perspective on how valuable introverts are to the fabric of society, but also a greater sense of self-worth for my own traits. And that's something to be thankful for. My hope is that with more people who pick up ""Quiet"" and realize how important our individual attributes are, that it'll provide for more opportunities to be creative and to value each other in our relationships regardless of differences, for our unique strengths regardless of how their expressed or from where they come.Overall score: 5/5 stars"
235,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,4,"There are a load of books I've marked ""to be reviewed"", and just completely ignored - it was 2013 when I read this! - so here goes, let's make the list a bit smaller.Here's the moment where I'm supposed to tell you I'm an introvert, so let's get that out of the way: obviously I am. My credentials include cheerfully working from home, getting overstimulated in quiet libraries, and keeping in touch with my closest friends almost entirely by snail mail. I have been known to feel oversocialised sitting in a darkened room, listening to people two rooms away watch a film.As far as a lot of media is concerned, I may as well be a pet hamster. ""Care for your introvert."" Try not to interrupt them. Don't go in their nest while they're sleeping. Offer them a way out when you're at a party, in case they run out of carrot sticks and want to go home. I may as well also be a complete rarity: a third of people don't get hissy when you take their carrot sticks away; come the fuck on.So, what I liked about Quiet was that it didn't make me feel like a special snowflake or someone's hamster.But also... the section on introversion in leadership and the workplace has actually boosted my confidence a lot (apart from being really interesting). I've worked for a few people, and the times it's worked best have been the times where they give me a broad, bullet-pointed list of what they want to have happened by what time, and then they go away until that time. The best boss I ever had used to say it was a good day if we never spoke to each other except when one of us brought the other coffee - and I was inclined to agree with him. Faced with common-sense-logic, which seems to say that 5000 feedback sessions and an open-plan office with communal ball-pit are what millennials are looking for, I wanted this narrative. It was useful to hear. Maybe it's less useful if you're the sort of person who's been reading this sort of thing for years. For me, it was a helpful reminder.I remember a little interesting neurological detail, but not a lot - I can get more than that keyword-searching the Scientific American website, if I want to - and a fair bit of interesting historical anecdote. I remember coming away with a renewed respect for anyone who parents, especially by themselves, as well as a sense of purpose about working for myself and by myself - which I'm happy to say I'm now doing. It turns out, a lot of the time, that people who contract you for work over the internet don't really give a shit about your sparkling and gracious personality. They just want to know you're conscientious and you know what you're talking about and you'll do things when you say you will. I vaguely credit Susan Cain with giving me the impetus to go and do what I want to do, and not to feel like I have to be constantly nice to people I don't know. Now I just think, it's okay, I have character, and then put my headphones back in."
236,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5524572-kristin-hackett-superspacechick,4,"As a self proclaimed introvert, I've been meaning to read this book for so long. My sister in law gave me a copy for Christmas so I prioritized it as a January read and I'm so glad I did. I really enjoyed the in depth look at what constitutes an introvert vs. an extrovert. Quiet even redefined the meaning of the word sensitive for me. I've never considered myself sensitive before but to pull a quote, ""highly sensitive people tend to be keen observers who look before they leap. They arrange their lives in ways that limit surprises. They’re often sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, pain, coffee... Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments—both physical and emotional—unusually deeply. They tend to notice subtleties that others miss—another person’s shift in mood, say, or a lightbulb burning a touch too brightly.""- this is 100% spot on for me. While I do agree with a lot of what Susan Cain wrote, I do think it's difficult to classify people into only one of two categories. She did stress that just because someone is an introvert, it doesn't mean that 1) they got there the same way as someone else or 2) that both people will have exactly the same traits. There are still variables to consider. Overall, I loved that Quiet is a celebrated look at introversion and the strengths that those with introverted qualities possess. There were a few anecdotes that weren't the most interesting (or relevant like the chapter on raising children), but I still found value in reading them. "
237,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,5,"I am an introvert and proud of it and so is the author and she believes there is strength in quietness and I think she is right. She has helped me understand myself more and I am glad of that. Introverts don't like novelty and the first day of school is usually traumatic as mine was. As children, introverts like to daydream, play inside and their feelings are easily hurt. ""They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. . ."" They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy and fear."" They "". . . tend to speak softly because that's how they prefer others to communicate with them.""Shy people hate confrontations and will avoid them at all costs and the author believes it is better so.

238,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,2,"Why is it that the “ideal” person is extroverted? That we pride social skills and being outgoing? All while a deeply gifted thinker who prefers to be in his/her head is described as lacking these traits. Looking at it from an evolutionary standpoint, there is a reason why introverts exist, so why do we rate it as second best? Being a true-blue introvert, I turned to Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a world that can’t stop talking” to answer these questions (and maybe propose new ones). Susan Cain divides “Quiet” into four main sections with the first focusing on the history and description of the rise of extroverts, the differences in leadership styles of introverts and extroverts, and the myths surrounding them. This section begins “Quiet” with a slow and unmemorable beginning. Cain focuses more of an effort on real-life case studies versus actual scientific studies, bypassing any professional data or even her own opinions. The studies which are mentioned are not “earth-shattering” in depth nor do they truly correlate to her hypothesis. In fact, much of the hypothesis is lost and the flow is not seamless or clear. On one hand, this makes the reading understandable and accessible for the less scientifically-inclined reader, but to others craving more research; Cain leaves something to be desired. Some of Cain’s examples which could be perceived as “witty” (Craig Newark of Craigslist fame, Dr. Suess, and Moses from the Bible) are underdeveloped and also lose connection with the hypothesis. Cain is often abrupt and cuts herself short. Furthermore, many of the chapters begin in the same exact way (both format and creativity) which is tedious and creates a loss of interest. The second section of “Quiet” describes some of the brain and neurological aspects of introverts featuring more science than the first section. Cain’s work is a bit more compelling in this respect and certainly more interesting. However, it still isn’t clear what she is trying to prove as she mostly just describes how introverts “are”. Plus, most of the findings are self-explanatory and even obvious. Again, the reader will not be blown away. I have read MANY “brain books” (psychology/neurology, science, and biology) and generally, I am left both flabbergasted and repeating information I’ve read to anyone who will listen. This was not the case with “Quiet” as only a small dose of information felt standout. As the second portion progresses, Cain does present tests and experimentation results more confidentially (however, there is a lack of elaboration). The third section of “Quiet” is comparatively shorter, as Cain explains the conformities and values of the Asian cultures while in the fourth section, Cain offers tips and lifestyle adaptations for introverts in various areas such as work, romance, parenting, play, etc. At this point, “Quiet” appears to be more of a self-help book. The latter end of the book is overly focused on parenting and schooling of children causing me to feel alienated and distanced (having no children). Furthermore, the “Conclusion” is weak and sums up the book which actually reinforces how few points are made. Simply, “Quiet"" is not what I expected. Instead of explaining “why” introverts are the way they are; Cain described “how” they are with an absence of data I would have preferred. All in all though, it has been confirmed (which I already knew) that I am indeed an introvert."
239,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A lance is broken for the needs of introverted people Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Whether one opposes the sanguine with the phlegmatic nature, the wild daredevil the thoughtful inventor or merely the introversion the extroversion, the temperament is and remains in specific proportions decisive for a human being. The author has re-examined this fact with an unconventional approach, opening up exciting and critical viewing angles. Times are changing. In the 19th century, it was still commonplace to be modest, humble and unobtrusive. Starting from the advertising industry in the 1920s and 1930s, it continued to run to the idealistic goal of total superficiality. Ads began to play with people's fear of the negative connotations of ominous, alien observers, and the appearance and ability to attract more and more attention. The new religion of narcissism was supported by an entrepreneurial mentality that understood handshaking qualities, dazzling rhetoric, and slick eloquence as signs of business qualification.Thus, when the loudest and most risk-taking specimens of the managerial species, elite colleges that encourage elbow mentality-driven, superficial behavior, occupy key positions, one or the other financial market collapse is no longer surprising. The flowers of this development on the example of today's America could seem bizarre if the consequences were not so serious. Thus, adjectives such as shy and quiet or just hints of a sly-boy mentality are dismissed as entirely negative and peculiar. Whether in school, work or private life, who does not understand playing on the highly sophisticated keyboard of interpersonal communication, quickly falls through the typical rust. Sensitive children, even as babies, are prone to intensified reactions to external stimuli, are more empathetic and need seeming timidity as a protective mechanism against a formally overwhelming universe. At the same time, individuals naturally endowed with a more robust psychic scaffolding sound lighthearted, but also more emotionless, to their surroundings.Parents of quieter, a manageable circle of friends their naming and lonely hobbies devoted children are remembered, not only subtle, the importance of popularity and dazzling charm. However, very peculiar that silent children are put under depression or misanthropic suspicion, while too vital, joyful young people are sedated with Ritalin. If the favors of loneliness have been well into adulthood, there is a wide range of seminars that can enhance eloquence, demeanor, and be talking skills to the point of sales genius. Several relationship problems are likely based on the well measurable differences between different natures, even by MRI. While extroverts can bathe in crowds every awaken minute and shy away from loneliness, the relationship is reversed by introverts. This involves interpersonal explosives in itself when the mantra of the attractive opposites once no longer pulls, and the supposed truce of the relationship beginning is over. Additional spontaneous emotional responses provoke the fact that extroverts interpret specific aggressive behavior as interest and attention while introverts feel injured and attacked. Assessing the damage caused to the economy by incorrectly designing work processes and their surroundings is difficult or even impossible. If one adds the increased disinclination of introverts in a loud open-plan atmosphere, including the wasted potential, because gifted thinkers find no peace to work out ideas and concepts undisturbed, the overall economic damage can be immense. The cultural differences show a contrarian approach of the Asians, where a European-American behavior style is considered a stupid waste of time for listeners. Tranquility and contemplation have a different meaning, superficiality and the glorification of narcissistic principles are considered less desirable. Another, quite thoughtful approach.Eine Lanze gebrochen für die Bedürfnisse der introvertierten MenschenansammlungsvermeiderOb man dem sanguinischen das phlegmatische Naturell entgegenstellt, dem wilden Draufgänger den nachdenklichen Tüftler oder schlicht der Introvertiertheit die Extrovertiertheit, das Temperament ist und bleibt zu bestimmten Anteilen maßgebend für einen Menschen. Die Autorin hat diesen Umstand mit einer unkonventionellen Herangehensweise neu beleuchtet und damit interessante und kritische Betrachtungswinkel eröffnet.So ändern sich die Zeiten. War es im 19 Jahrhundert noch gang und gäbe, bescheiden, demütig und unaufdringlich zu sein, begann, ausgehend von der Werbeindustrie, in den 1920er und 1930er Jahren, ein bis heute andauernder Lauf auf das ideelle Ziel der totalen Oberflächlichkeit. Anzeigen begannen mit der Angst der Menschen vor negativen Assoziationen ominöser, fremder Beobachter zu spielen und das Äußere sowie die Fähigkeit zu gefallen, immer mehr ins Rampenlicht zu rücken. Unterstützung fand die neue Religion des Narzissmus von einer Unternehmermentalität, die Handschlagqualitäten, blendende Rhetorik und aalglatte Eloquenz als Zeichen betriebswirtschaftlicher Qualifikation auffasste. Wenn auf diese Weise immer die lautesten und risikofreudigsten Exemplare der Managerspezies, von zu ellbogenmentalitätsgesteuerten, oberflächlichen Verhalten animierenden Elitehochschulen, Schlüsselpositionen besetzen, verwundert der eine oder andere Finanzmarktkollaps gar nicht mehr.Die Blüten dieser Entwicklung am Beispiel des heutigen Amerikas könnten skurril anmuten, wären die daraus resultierenden Konsequenzen nicht derart gravierend.

Eltern ruhiger, einen überschaubaren Freundeskreis ihr Eigen nennender und sich einsamen Hobbies widmender Kinder werden, nicht nur durch die Blume, an die Wichtigkeit von Beliebtheit und blendendem Charme erinnert.

Etliche Beziehungsprobleme dürften auf den, auch per MRT gut messbaren Unterschieden zwischen verschiedenen Naturellen basieren. Während Extrovertierte jede wache Minute in Menschenmengen baden könnten und Einsamkeit scheuen, kehrt sich das Verhältnis bei Introvertierten um. Das birgt zwischenmenschlichen Sprengstoff in sich, wenn das Mantra von den sich anziehenden Gegensätzen einmal nicht mehr richtig zieht und der vermeintliche Waffenstillstand des Beziehungsbeginns vorüber ist. Zusätzliche spontane emotionale Reaktionen provoziert die Tatsache, dass Extrovertierte bestimmtes, aggressives Verhalten als Interesse und Aufmerksamkeit interpretieren, während Introvertierte sich verletzt und angegriffen fühlen.Den für die Wirtschaft entstandenen Schaden durch falsche Konzeption von Arbeitsabläufen samt deren Umgebungen einzuschätzen mutet schwer bis unmöglich an.

Ruhe und Kontemplation haben eine andere Bedeutung, Oberflächlichkeit und die Verherrlichung narzisstischer Prinzipien gelten als wenig erstrebenswert. Ein anderer, durchaus in Erwägung zu ziehender Ansatz."

Susan Cain, former Wall Street lawyer and self-described introvert, investigates how introversion has become dangerously scorned in the current American ""Culture of Personality."" I had not fully realized how drastically our cultural values have shifted--and how much American society pushes us to conform--until reading Cain's book. To prove her point, Cain visits American bastions of extroversion promotion, including Harvard Business School, Saddleback Church, Dale Carnegie, Wall Street, and Tony Robbins conferences. She talks with pioneering psychologists and neurologists to explain the studies behind concepts like the dangers of group think, the ability to delay gratification, or the trait called sensitivity. She profiles famous and less-well known introverts to show how the studies play out in real life.Though the many of the activities I'm drawn to (and the things that cause anxiety) scream classic introvert, I have always considered myself an extrovert and frequently put myself in situations where extroverted behavior is valued. However, since quitting my job and globe-hopping for the past two years, I've been surprised (and disappointed) by how often the constant stimulation, new people, and change can drain me--and by how I often feel an overwhelming need for alone time.I found myself relating to many of the points Cain discusses and have since concluded that I'm much more of an introvert than I had thought. (I promise that this isn't just because she does a good job of highlighting all the positive things about introverts!)So for that, I am grateful to have read Quiet, though I can't quite believe it took reading a book to figure that out about myself! I am seeing my preferences in a new light and have much understanding and acceptance regarding the things that interest me (and those that cause me stress). I've been having trouble narrowing down 'what I want to do with my life' and this book has helped me more than any other, because I finally feel like I can accept that the things I really enjoy are just a part of me and can't be ignored. Though the personal application will differ, I suspect many people will come away having learned much more than they expected, if not about themselves, then about people close to them. I had always thought of extroverts and introverts as being on distinct sides of a line, when in fact it's much more of a sliding scale (or perhaps better as two scales: percentage introversion, percentage extroversion). Because we have been culturally pressured and trained to admire extroverted behavior, many of us may be dangerously ignoring our introverted characteristics. This was a game-changing book for me, and I suspect it will be eye-opening to most people who read it."

But I also enjoy giving presentations at school, tutoring peers in writing, and interacting with various people online and in real life. I'd describe myself as an introvert (and my Meyers-Briggs personality type agrees), though both introverts and extroverts would enjoy this fascinating book by Susan Cain. She provides an intriguing, in-depth perspective on introversion, its connotation in contrasting cultures, and the psychology behind it.A profusion of the nonfiction I've read has contained too much of something - too many random anecdotes, too much scientific jargon, too many unnecessary statistics or explanations. But Quiet has the perfect blend of personal anecdotes, interesting analysis, detailed explanations, and compelling statistics. Cain references various studies conducted by psychologists and discusses several aspects related to introversion, such as the extrovert ideal, how extroverts and introverts can compliment each other and work together, nature v. nature, etc. Here's one passage about sensitive people (who tend to be more introverted) that struck a chord with me:""The other thing Aron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they're highly empathic. It's as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people's emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world. They tend to have unusually strong consciences. They avoid violent movies and TV shows; they're acutely aware of the consequences of a lapse in their own behavior. In social settings they often focus on subjects like personal problems, which others consider 'too heavy'.""I guess I have an excuse for exposing so much of myself on my blog, huh? Anyway, Cain delves into other subjects that are intellectually stimulating too, such as the three things she thinks are important in identifying one's personal project. She even brings up the relationship between Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other famous historical figures.Overall, highly recommended to everyone curious about their own temperaments and how to embrace their natural personalities. One of the best works of nonfiction I've read.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

I was really excited to read it, because I knew this book was very popular. Also, I love nonfiction. I love the ability to learn from a book.I believe I learned from this book. It was interesting to hear why my best friend, who is one of the biggest introverts ever fits perfectly with me (I'm a huge extravert). Also, it was interesting to hear what you can do to help someone with stage fright preform at their best.However, I felt the book repeated itself. Many times I wondered what new information could possibly be discussed, and a lot of times there wasn't really any new information. It just talked about the same material in a circle from a different angle.A lot of the time I felt like this book was written so introverts could feel validated for being an introvert and that they weren't anti-social. They just need socialization in a completely different way than extroverts."

It's perhaps not a surprise that Susan Cain, the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking identifies herself as an introvert. Being quiet, introverted or shy is still seen by many as a problem or handicap to overcome so I can see her motivation for writing it.One this book's premises is that in the last 50 years or so, the Western world moved from a culture of character to a culture of personality, which according to the author has given an advantage to people that enjoyed outgoing, uninhibited personalities. We tend to admire and reward people that exhibit the most gregarious, outgoing traits of extroverts while at the same time undermined and misunderstand those that are most typically seen in more introverted individuals.
Introversion is really about having a preference for lower stimulation environments. So it's just a preference for quiet, for less noise, for less action. Whereas extroverts really crave more stimulation in order to feel at their best.
The author explains that Introversion is a spectrum, and that most of us don't fully fit into an introvert/extrovert definition. It also provides a sort of ""survival guide"" for introverts to help us learn how to better deal with the pressures of living in a world that for the most part rewards those that are extroverts.
Many people believe that introversion is about being antisocial, and that's really a misperception. Because actually it's just that introverts are differently social. So they would prefer to have a glass of wine with a close friend as opposed to going to a loud party full of strangers.
This book helped me understand myself better, identify those traits that makes many of us ""introverts"" different and learn how to use them to our advantage, both on our professional and personal lives. The book is entertaining and well written. If you are interested in learning about introverts, perhaps because you feel like one or someone closed to you does, this book might be of interest to you.After reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking my conclusion is that the world needs both extroverts and introverts and that we all have a role to play.Here's a link to the author's TED TALK which is sort a summarized version of the book:http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_t..."

And the whole idea about needing time out to recover from socialising - I always thought I was just a bit odd, haha.The criticisms that are quite rightly levelled at this book about preaching some kind of binarism between extrovert and introvert are understandable, and am I'm sure that we are all a little too complex for a poorly designed set of questions to provide any sort of sensible analysis or categorisation (would still like to see the questions though...) Most people will be surely be somewhere close to 'ambivert' even if they know themselves to be introverted at heart. For me a major part of young socialisation and growing up was learning to act like an extrovert, if nothing else just to stop people trying to 'bring me out of my shell' or constantly asking what's up as I am 'being quiet'."
245,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena,4,"I really liked this book, especially the beginning part. I so needed to read it. For years people have been telling me to come out of my shell and to be more outgoing and I realized I had definitely playing the role of pseudo-extrovert all this time! I enjoyed reading the fact that we introverts actually have power and hidden strengths. The list of famous introverts surprised me, Rosa Parks, Al Gore and Gandhi in particular. The book also shared some insight into the thinking patterns of extroverts. All in all, it was an interesting book though the end did drag on a bit."

247,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5470914-sam,1,"This was the most painful book I have read this summer. I choked it down like bad medicine page after page. Quiet is great self affirmation for someone who considers themselves an introvert, and sees humans as either an extrovert or introvert. Cain certainly thinks she’s the poster child of an introvert, or is she? The book reads like a memoir in parts where she tells stories of her own life, then there are smatterings or small examples in specific parts of people’s lives of how greatness comes in quiet e.g. Steve Wozniak, Gandhi, Rosa Parks. Cain also fancies herself a bit of a child psychologist, on one hand it’s ok for kids to be shy or in their shell, these aren’t bad things, and very normal, but on the other hand we need to nudge and push slowly to get kids out of their quiet place. So which is it?It doesn’t bother me that Cain isn’t a psychologist or economist, but she’s talking through both sides of her mouth, the book is a pity party, she thinks the decisions in modern workplaces are influenced by highly extroverted personalities like those from the Harvard Business School. There’s no backing for this other than the fact that business students are extroverts. Additionally the economic crisis was wholly the fault of extroverts, basically extroverts with their loud voices overpowered the brilliant quiet hardworking, and smart introverts and ran the economy to the ground. I’m afraid you really aren’t brilliant if something has already happened and you didn’t do anything to stop it. In hindsight everything is 20/20, just because you are quiet and something bad is happening saying “I knew it!” doesn’t do much. The circlejerk continues when Cain bangs on about everyone who a douche as being an extrovert. Good guys are introverts, Warren Buffet because of his one speech about the dot com bubble bursting was quiet and well calculated in his words. The rest of the word are greedy businessmen. There’s some sample or thin slicing in her discussions that I find problematic, and read a bit like a tabloid. Susan Cain is clearly appealing to an audience that is already sold to introversion, and stroking those egos. I wish the book had more solutions instead of harping about how bad people are. The book blurs it’s lines through many genres, self help, psychology and a dash of group-think. I consider myself an introvert, but also an extrovert, yes I do believe brilliance happens in unaccompanied activities like running. I charge my batteries during times like this but I also don’t “suffer in silence”. I don’t believe people are fully introverted or extroverted. Reading Khaneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and Mcgonigal’s Willpower Instinct make Cain’s book look hurriedly and thoughtlessly written, there’s little appeal to science. "
248,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,3,"I expected to love, love, love this book. After all, psychology is one of my passions. Also, I am always interested in hearing from some group. And this is saying, ""We, the introverts, are speaking out.""However, the book was neither as powerful nor as interesting as I was hoping....Cain does a great job of blending together different aspects. The three main angles she uses are:1.) Famous people who were introverts. She usually starts her chapters with a story about a wonderful famous person we all know and adore - and then explaining how they were introverted. Rosa Parks, Dale Carnegie, and Eleanor Roosevelt are some of the examples she used.2.) Case studies. This is the real life introvert ""Jane Doe."" She was on this job and thought she would have to quit because she just wasn't outgoing enough. Then she learned that being an introvert was like having a secret superpower! And then she used her introversion to overcome all obstacles! Now she's rich and/or happy. Success!3.) Science - hard and soft. Cain uses both psychology and biology to try and explain the differences between extroverts and introverts. She also explains why introversion might be valuable in evolution and natural selection. She has a fascinating chapter on culture, which emphasizes that although extroversion is worshiped in the USA, many Asian countries value silence, reflection, and understanding over cheerfulness, enthusiasm, and talkativeness. ...This book is at it's best when Cain is exploring how introversion is a valuable and worthy trait or way of being. When she journeys into different places to see how introversion is treated differently there. When she explores how introversion can be a survival aid in the wild and how introverted people can be powerful in their own way.It's exciting and interesting to realize that extroversion - while venerated in America - is actually seen as crass and dumb in many Asian cultures.And it's fun and cool to see different theories of how introverted people and animals are strong in Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection. I liked seeing different species and the benefits and drawbacks they experience from being extroverted or introverted. And I enjoyed seeing how introversion could be a kick-butt evolutionary trait which is often overlooked or thought to be something that needed 'killing off.'I thought about 2/3 of the book were weak, though. For instance, I already know enough about famous figures and do not particularly want or need to read a short biography or story about them. Another thing that bugged me were her ""real life introversion stories."" Here is how an introvert struggled. Here is how he learned to embrace his true self and be happy/rich.The whole book just felt like a big pat on the back. ""Don't worry, introverts, you're okay! Everything's okay! It might seem like the world hates you, but use your strengths! You are really amazing.""And it's not even like I DISAGREE with this message, it's simply that I was expecting more than a rather thinly-veiled self-help book. P.S. I really like the page or two that Cain dedicates to exploring Moses (an alleged introvert) and Aaron (his extroverted mouthpiece). It is also interesting when she lightly touches on whether or not the Church and modern-day Protestants shun and punish introverts as not doing the Lord's work. I like when she questions whether Jesus was an introvert or extrovert (covered in one paragraph, very shallow) and questions whether the Church is pushing an incorrect message on it's followers. (""Real Christians proselytize! How can you be a REAL Christian if you are not gregarious?"") I also like when she uses the teachings and life of Gandhi to emphasize that passivity is NOT submissiveness. All these subjects were things I wished she'd explored in greater depth."
249,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light,5,"Eye-opener. Astounding. Life-changing. Inspirational. Insightful. All these adjectives and more describe my experience with this amazing book.I'm very much an introvert. I try to avoid social functions as much as possible, but I do love meeting every so often with my dear friends one-on-one. If I do end up at a party, you can bet I'm the one keeping the corner warm. I am an avid reader, a knitter, a sometimes writer, a nerd, and an engineer. My idea of a perfect evening is one spent in the comfort of my apartment, cat in lap, book in hand, coffee at my side. My idea of a perfect vacation is one where I can go to my favorite coffee shop and read. In college, my favorite classes were Differential Equations (in which I, the only female, got a perfect score on the final), Physics, and Fluids. Ever since elementary school, I dreaded a school performances, such as Christmas programs or poetry recitals. At work meetings, I am more likely to listen to everything and be note-taker than I am to present or volunteer ideas.Lately, my boss has said that I need to step things up, become more ""out there"" and confident. Inwardly, I despaired. Wasn't I working hard enough? What was holding me back? Why couldn't I just blurt things out in meetings? Why did I constantly sound nervous, even if I really wasn't? Was there any hope for me to change?And then, like a sign from heaven, I saw this book in the ""New Books"" display at Barnes and Nobles (BTW, I happen to swing by the bookstore at least once a week during lunch - sometimes to purchase, but mostly to pass the time). I remembered a friend had read this and really enjoyed it, and I figured it would help me figure out myself.""Figure myself out"" would be an understatement; it's as if this book were written specifically for me! Cain breaks down what it means to be an introvert. Turns out despite what my sister is constantly telling me, I'm not weird (alright, not too weird). I have talents and skills. I have a place. And it's not my fault I can't always speak up and make my voice heard. A lot of it is because of how our workforce, our employers, our coworkers, our society functions. Our biology, our parents, our surroundings make us the introverted beings we are. It's just that school and work and the outside world try to tell us that being quiet, that listening and ruminating over things is wrong, that we should be quick to speak and blurt whatever is on our mind.I've known I was an introvert for a while, but it was so refreshing and liberating to learn that there were others with my ""problem"". That I wasn't alone. And, most importantly, I can overcome, nay thrive, in this Extroverted world. And that is the second gift Cain gives us in this book: how to be an Introvert in an Extrovert world and not want to choke yourself at night.I feel like, after reading Quiet, I have a plan for facing my ""work problems"". I feel like I can take the challenge my boss has placed in front of me and succeed. Although a part of me still wishes I could crawl back to my desk and burrow there, I think this book has given me the tools and encouragement I need to speak up.If you are an introvert, you definitely need to read this book. Even if you aren't an introvert, this is a great book to understanding how they think and act. I'm definitely passing this along to everyone I know."
250,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Years ago, my division manager at work had everybody in the division take the Meyer Briggs personality test. Then we spent time in a workshop, to understand the implications of our personality types. One of the dimensions of the test is extroversion/introversion (E or I types). This book offers a very satisfying account of what it means to be an introvert. Generally Western cultures admire extroverts, while Asian cultures admire introverts. Both types of personalities offer value to society. Groups of people who are introverts are best with an extroverted leader, while groups of extroverts are best with an introverted leader.Many introverts find it difficult to live in a society that values extroversion more highly. As a result, many introverts pretend to be extroverts in certain social situations. But they cannot maintain this pretension indefinitely, and at some point in time they must ""recharge"" their internal batteries with quiet and solitude. The book makes a major point here: It's perfectly OK to pretend to be an extrovert for periods of time--as long as you do this while you are working at something that you truly love.The book has useful practical advice for introverts. If you are an introvert and your husband or wife is an extrovert, there is much to be said about how to maintain or improve your relationship. If you are raising a child who is an introvert, it is important to understand how to encourage the child to follow his/her innate abilities.Back in the 1940's and 1950's, Alex Osborn was plagued by the lack of creativity in his advertising agency. So, he wrote some books introducing the concept of ""brainstorming"". The idea is for people get together in groups and toss out ideas without fear of ridicule--the more ideas, the better. The problem is, in the 1960's, studies showed that brainstorming is not efficient; you can get more, good ideas if people simply think creatively in solitude. Committees simply are not as productive as the sum of individuals working alone. We are so inculcated with the idea that brainstorming is best--but this is really just a reflection of the dominance of extroversion in our society. "

I felt like it wasn’t as accessible as it could have been. It seems very focused on introverts in or who wish to be in very high powered job roles. Which isn’t my world. I was hoping for a bit more knowledge or ‘self help’ regarding being an introvert in an average every day life, Not as an award winning introverted lecturer, or an introverted Lawyer or CEO."
252,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"It is stated at the start that this book’s purpose is to improve a reader's relationship with others. The book can thus be viewed as a book of the self-help genre. Its aim is to advise introverts on ways by which they can improve their relationships with extroverts, and vice versa. It compares behavioral traits of both introverts and extroverts, showing in what ways they are similar and how they differ. The author mentions books about and summarizes studies related to extroversion and introversion, conducted over the years and up to today. The book begins with a quick test by which readers can determine where they stand on the introvert / extrovert scale. The test takes only a few minutes and gives the reader an immediate connection with the topics to be discussed. Both my husband and I took the test. We both received the same score, indicating that we are both strong introverts. It is interesting to note that although we had the same score, we did not answer all questions in the same way. This led to a lively discussion and a fun start to the book! Twenty questions are to be answered with a yes or a no. The book demonstrates clearly that in America it is the extroverts that hold sway--in the government, in business and in most educational institutions. It is an important and valuable statement that is being made. This is often to the detriment of introverts and to society as a whole. While the author professes the importance and value of both the introvert and the extrovert way of thinking, given the suppression of introverts in society today, it is introverts she lauds most, giving example after example of their accomplishments. I didn’t need to be convinced. For me, it is OBVIOUS that society benefits from the presence of both. The book verges on becoming a manifesto for introverts. This appeals to me no more than society's pronounced favoritism of extroverts! The book accomplishes well what it has set out to do, but I am rarely enthused by books of the self-help genre. It does advise readers on how their relationships can be improved. It also explains how schools can be adapted to better suit the needs of introverts, without hampering the situation for extroverts. I do however find much of the advice given as being rather obvious. The sections I like most are those that are scientifically oriented. I like for example the parts about how the brain functions; sections about the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex and the connection to dopamine are interesting. Many studies are referred to, but how exactly each was performed is skimmed over in too brief a manner. We are told what the results have for implications, but skeptic that I am, I was not always convinced! I need more details. To add depth, opposing points of view should have been added. Intuitively, I agree with the conclusions drawn, but I would have preferred more solid proof. Too many generalizations/simplifications are made. Over and over again we are told that so and so was an introvert and so and so an extrovert. This is all too simple! Individuals are mixes of introvert and extrovert qualities. Instead, an analysis of the tangled mix of traits that make up real people is what I was looking for. At one point Moses is classified as an introvert! This was just too much for me. The author swiftly classifies famous people as being either introvert or extrovert with little analysis of their specific character traits. I find this too categorical. We are told that Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, would never have written the books she wrote and become the ""bold thinker"" that she became had she not been left alone to read books in her youth. Where is the proof in that?! The author generalizes and simplifies all too often. The book is directed primarily toward Americans. I do not appreciate this slant. There is only a brief discussion of Asian American immigrants. Asian Americans of Chinese background are classified as introverts. Europeans are in a bunch grouped with Americans. I would have preferred a more in-depth, nuanced analysis of national and cultural differences.I wish the book had been more globally and more scientifically oriented. It has too many generalizations. It is basically a self-help book, a genre that does not appeal to me, so I guess it is not so bad that I nevertheless felt it to be worth reading. I would have preferred more in-depth analyses concerning how individuals are complicated mixes of introversion and extroversion. We are not one or the other, as was so often stated in reference to the people mentioned. The narration of the audiobook by Kathe Mazur started out very fast, but eventually she slows down. Her rapid speed had me chuckling at the beginning. Why? Because it is the extroverts, not us introverts that talk fast! Didn’t the producers of the audiobook realize the incongruity?! We introverts need time to stop and think and time to examine the ideas floating around in our heads. The narration is easy to follow once Mazur has slowed down. She has a soft, pleasant voice, a perfect match for introverts, the central protagonists of the book. The question is how many extroverts read this book. It is interesting to think about why this may be so."
253,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,5,"This book is very insightful and informative. I watched Susan Cain's TED talk once and I was fascinated being an introvert myself. As a kid I was shy, serious, studious with a little bit of social anxiety and although as I grew up, I outgrew my shyness and got more confident socially, there have been many situations where I questioned myself. Once when I was out on a trip with a big group of college friends, everyone was getting along so well and they seemed to be having so much fun together but I felt so lonely and left out and I was like, ''What's wrong with me''? Turns out I'm just an introvert. Then, I found this book. It describes in detail what introversion and extroversion is and what are the traits associated with both personalities. Where in most areas (or cultures), the introversion or shyness is viewed in a negative light, the writer states that it's an essential trait and how powerful it could be and it should be valued just as extroversion is. I found this book very interesting to read because she presents her ideas by using data gathered from case studies, research and her own personal experiences and from other people. She has also provided analysis of many famous personalities and how their temperaments shaped their actions and how essential their role was. Many definitions are provided for introversion-extroversion and how our genes and our environment play a role in shaping our personalities. There is no personality type better than the other but creating a balance is very important to bring out the best in both. The message in short is- value your individuality and do things the way you want and not because you have to conform to certain cultural norms. It also tells how both personalities can strike a balance between both traits. Also, both extroverts and introverts can lead a fulfilling life without changing their core values or trying to be someone they are not, the power lies in knowing who you are, what your abilities are and using them to the best.After reading this book, I feel like I can understand myself a little better now, what my motivations are and what makes me the way I am. I recommend this book to both introverts and extroverts as it can help them understand the qualities in themselves and in each other."

I'm not sure if extroverts would have enjoyed this book as much as me, because Cain works hard to prove the merits and necessity of introverts in our society, while down-playing all the reasons why we should have an extrovert ideal. In fact, I think some extroverts would feel a bit offended at this book. But I don't care. I've lived my whole life feeling like there was something wrong with me. I need to speak up, get out there, sell myself, basically become something that I'm not. This book made me realize there's nothing wrong with me, and that I actually have strengths that my extroverted friends, relatives, etc., do not. Instead of constantly seeing myself as disadvantaged because I suck at small talk, don't know how to talk myself up in interviews, and am just a shy person, I just feel like I know myself better. I think teachers should read this book. And I'm going to stop, because this isn't so much as a book review as a blog post or something. This is a total self-help book for introverts. Thank you Cain!**I should also say that Cain uses extensive research and interviews to show the strengths of introverts, so it's actually a pretty scientific book (though made so that it's easy for the every day person like me to understand). I was really surprised at the amount of research done on the differences between introverts and extroverts, especially because the research often shows introverts in a good, positive light, unlike what most people think when they hear the word introvert.

First of all, as far as the audio format goes, they couldn’t have chosen a better narrator. Kathe Mazur’s voice fits the tone of the book perfectly–quiet and measured, yet firm. I basically just want to listen to every audiobook she’s ever narrated. Back to Quiet –I think Susan Cain did a stellar job of exploring the introverted personality type. She sites a number of studies and scientific theories to support her thesis that introversion is an undervalued trait in modern American society. Introverts have just as much to offer the world as extroverts and their unique strengths must be utilized for a society to be truly healthy.

257,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"When I was young, my grandfather, an intelligent farmer, used to call me an introvert, as I sat happily in the corner, spending my free time reading books or writing in my notebooks. I looked up at him, I believe I was around the age of eight or so, with crinkled eyebrows. He explained what it meant. But I didn't have a puzzled look on my face because I didn't understand the word, I was puzzled because he said it like he disapproved. Like it was a bad thing. My aunt, the doctor, immediately came to my defense and said, ""Janine, just tell him that you're not an introvert, you're just introspective."" That became my motto in life. I said it often, mostly because I felt those were big words and others would think I was smart. I never thought about it much later in life until I read this book. Cain talks about the virtues of being an introvert but how society has come to prize the personality traits of the extrovert. Being a pretty extreme extrovert, at first, I didn't think this book was for me. But then I thought back to when I was eight, and realized with shock and I wasn't just a person who could be both, although I was, I am, but I went from one extreme to the other. When I was a child, I was the most introverted person I know. Using the word shy to describe me didn't cut it. I would skip class altogether if I was even a minute late, to avoid the fear of having to walk into the classroom with everyone looking at me. Speeches had me thinking thoughts of jumping out of trees just to break a bone so I could get out of giving the speech. Now, I love nothing better than walking into a room full of strange people. It's just a room full of fifty new friends! And talking in front of people? I have to hold myself back in group exercises just so I don't hog the limelight. How did such a huge change occur? I'll tell you how, because of work, school, and problems socially, I was forced into it. As I began to read this book, I saw a lot of truth in what Cain was saying. Extroverts really are prized now, not just socially but in the workplace as well. At the last company I worked for, I sat in cubicles, was encouraged constantly to hold meetings and ""group think"" up ideas. How different it would have been if I was allowed even one hour a day without interruptions! What has made us so concerned with having these qualities? I am homeschooling my children and every time I come across someone who disapproves it's always because of lack of ""socialization"". My five-year-old son has no trouble talking to anyone and being friendly, I think he gets it from me. But he also loves to play by himself. He might get this from me as well! He creates his best Lego creations when left alone for hours at a time. Why is this a bad thing? As Cain points out, some of the best innovators of our time were quiet thinkers. And we might not have had some of those great inventions or works of art had these people been forced to ""socialize"" as children instead of left alone. And really, what is the big deal with needing socialization being such a big part of schooling? Why can't it be found outside of school? I recently watched a documentary about the current school systems and, as most people know, we (The United States), rank very low in all areas of education. In fact, when American children were tested in various areas against other countries of the world, we consistently ranked on the bottom in almost all areas except one. Can you guess what it is? Self-confidence. American children are said to have the highest self-confidence compared to all other countries. How do we explain this to our children? We're idiots but we have pride! Is this because we're placing such importance on making our children extroverts? Some of the case studies Cain uses to show examples of her theories kept me riveted. She also had a twenty question test in case you weren't sure where you stood. The more traits she gave as examples of introverts and extroverts, the less sure I became of which I was. Ask anyone which I was as a child, they would have said introvert, hands down. Ask anyone I know right now, and in a second they'd say extrovert. So I took her test to see where I stood. I thought I was only doubting myself, and that it would show pretty conclusively that I was an extrovert. But in fact, I was split almost exactly down the middle. I love meeting new people, and often feel energized at the end of a big party. But I also get rejuvinated from having alone time every day. Even back in college, when I was one of the most social people around, my roomates all knew that they risked certain death if they bothered me during my ""break time"". I have no problems going to movies alone, and one of my favorite things to do is go out to lunch or dinner at a nice restaurant with a good book as a dinner companion. People look at me weird, but I could care less. Whenever I go out or have a party my motto is always ""The more the merrier"". So where did I stand on this chart? The advice for public speaking for introverts wasn't going to help me. And to say I should have quit reading the book halfway through because I considered myself an extrovert would have had me missing out on some very interesting information. I really enjoyed this book. And I disagree that this book is only for introverts. I think the biggest benefit this book had for me is the eye opener to how we have been pressured to become more extroverted over the years and how we see this change everywhere, from schools, to the workplace, to advertising, to even moralistic behavior. I think all can benefit from having a greater awareness of this personality trait in everyone they know. If you're an extrovert, wouldn't it benefit you from having a better understanding to where your introverted team leader is coming from? And another realization for me, is how I know see my son, who has the tendency to play alone. I now am more aware of how I treat him, and make sure I no longer fall into that stereotypical reaction of ""Why don't you try harder to make friends?"" routine. There's nothing wrong with being an introvert, and if this book has any major theme, that's it. That being said, even though I very much enjoyed this book, I only gave it three stars for a couple of reasons. First of all, I feel like the middle of the road people such as myself were somewhat ignored. Where do we stand? How do we relate better to people and situations? Then there were the case studies. As I mentioned earlier, they were very interesting and really helped in relating to the particular example's Cain discussed. But after a while, they became tedious, and didn't hold my attention as well as the first half of the book. I still think many can benefit from reading this though. It was fun, and I look forward to discussing it with my book club.  ClassicsDefined.com"
258,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"I never really thought of myself as introverted until relatively recently, within the last year or so, when I declined an invitation to go out with a group of friends to the bar and one of them said ""Fine, be introverted then! Hope you enjoy sitting home alone with your cats!"" (She meant it in a teasing, only partially bitchy way, but I didn't take offense. I DO enjoy sitting home alone with my cats.)My semi-bitchy friend actually helped me define a big part of myself. Until then, I just thought of myself as ""the most anti-social Libra ever"", and poked fun at myself for not wanting to go out all the time, or being overwhelmed by loud, boisterous people, or needing time to just be alone - what my boyfriend calls ""cave-dwelling"". I made these things a joke because, according to society, it's not normal to want to spend so much time alone. I'm supposed to be a fun, out-going social butterfly. The thought exhausts me. So, when I read this, it was like someone opened up my head and singled out these aspects of my personality and then wrote them down. It was fascinating to read this book and learn about myself. I see things about my past in a completely new light. Like the situation above. I'd be more than happy to sit at home with a few friends and drink, but going to a bar to drink among a huge crowd just held no appeal. Or like how I approach my work. The sections of this book pertaining to corporate expectations and office structure were fascinating to me, and really allowed me to look at my job and approach to work differently. I'm a good employee and good at my job, but I don't aspire to be in the limelight. I don't MIND recognition or attention for a job well done, but it's not something I seek out. So, when I was recently offered a job with a new company, I had my choice of being in a ""client liaison"" position or a ""analysis and testing"" position, and I took the latter, even though it's a position with less recognition and lower pay. The thought of having to constantly be professionally social with strangers gives me anxiety, though, so it was a no-brainer for me. But when I discussed my decision with friends, they called me crazy to have turned down the higher paying position. As though money is the only criteria worth considering. (A point that this book makes well.)I'm going to miss the job I'm leaving though, because it did give me a kind of structured socialization. I get along great with my team, and there, I'm far more socially outgoing than I would be otherwise. I've worked with many of these people for several years, I trust and respect them, and they are people I consider real friends. Soon I'll be working 100% from home, so my social interaction will be drastically reduced. I may be introverted, but I do need that interaction. The hard part for me will be actually initiating it. I have a tendency to, uhh, forget to be social. I forget to call and text people, even though I mean to do it. But being social is just never at the forefront of my mind. I'll have to work on that. But then there's online communities, which is a completely different world. I have always been more open and (dare I say it?) chatty online than in my ""real life"" social interactions. Maybe it's the anonymity, or the fact that it's text-based, or the fact that the community I'm in here is one that is full of like-minded people with similar interests. People I can relate and talk to easily. I don't know, but I'm quite different online than off. Offline, I don't really do chit-chat, or small talk, and I'm often at a loss as to what I should say in a light social situation, despite there being 10 dozen possibilities running through my mind. I usually settle for silence, though, because by the time I've thought through a plethora of ""Nice weather"" or ""Your hair looks nice"" nothing comments, it's been an awkwardly long time, and I know it, and anything that I say at that point would just sound forced and fake, so I just... don't. That feeling that I just mentioned, about feeling forced and fake, is such a strong one for me that it sometimes overwhelms me when I really don't want it to, and it often feels to me like I come across as being cold and unfeeling when I really just don't know what to say to show how affected I really am. It was only when the book started talking about being 'sensitive' that it started to click. I've always been overly affected by emotionally charged situations. If you read some of my reviews of tear-jerker books, I mention this frequently. I remember when I was a kid, there was a show called Rescue 911 that my mom liked to watch. It was always some traumatic situation - a car wreck or an injured hiker or a woman trapped in a housefire, etc, and the show focused on the EMTs and firefighters and police called out to help. That show would always make me cry. Always. Every single episode. It didn't matter whether the people made it out OK, or if they all died, I would be in tears. I could just imagine how scary it would be and I had such respect for the kind of people who could deal with that kind of trauma every day and keep it together enough to help. It would all just overwhelm me, and I would cry. My point here, and how this relates to my last paragraph, is that my dad would often poke fun at me for getting upset over the show, and so I learned to hide that I was upset... oftentimes laughing to cover it. Laughing. As I got older into my teens, I just stopped showing that sensitivity in front of others at all, and unfortunately, that's carried over into my adult life. So now, when I feel strong emotions, it's easier for me to let them out when I'm alone, even though it makes me seem heartless to not show them when it's appropriate. Like at my grandma's funeral earlier this year, when my entire extended family was crying and talking and interacting, and I was stoically sitting in the pew, just thinking about her and how much I'll miss her. After the service, when I was alone, I completely lost my shit. I loved that woman, dammit. She was awesome.Anyway, if you're still reading, sorry for the overshare. What I'm getting at is that I loved how this book made me feel normal. It's well-researched, well-written, and engaging, and I'm incredibly glad that I read it. I think that it will... maybe not CHANGE my life, so much as improve it. I now know more about why I do certain things, and that's empowering. I can relate better to my boyfriend (an extrovert), and in my new job, and in social situations. And I can try to work on the things that I now recognize hinder me more than help me. Definitely a fascinating read. Highly recommended. "
259,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,5,"So...Just read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, (2012) by Susan Cain, Crown Publishers.I liked this book, and why not -- an in-depth defense of people like me! Although I confess, I never thought that introverts would need to be explained to extroverts. I thought we were self-evident, and it was the other, noisy, dominant half of the world that was inexplicable. (They still are.) It possibly needs a companion volume -- Noisy: the hegemony of people with nothing helpful to say who still won't shut up, or something. (Cue reality TV, talk radio, and horrible crush parties with loud music, where you couldn't hear anyone even if they were interesting.) Anyway.This made a curious juxtaposition with my last-read book Fossil Horses. MacFadden, a scientist, argued like a scientist; Cain, a lawyer, argues like a lawyer. I discern the differences even as I appreciate the advocacy. Cain develops her case through illustrative anecdotes, and references to science, psychology, and history as needed. Very readable. I confess, I hadn't thought of extroversion as the American cultural ideal, even as I have witnessed plenty of the cited behaviors. My world tends to be divided practically into ""people who read"" and ""everybody else"", which cuts unevenly across the extrovert/introvert divide, with the obvious bias.I sort of want to go out and press this book upon ""everybody else"", but one sees the inherent problem with that. I hope its message can cut through the noise somehow, nonetheless.Recommended.Ta, L."
260,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48197248-stephan,5,"This book helped me understand myself better and made me feel better about myself in a difficult time. I once again learned that every path has a value, also a quiet one and a whispering voice is not less valid, just less loud. Basically already that is more than enough to recommend it.If you consider yourself an introvert and doubt your own worth in comparison with more outgoing or established people, this is for you.If you are in any way interested in the introvert - extrovert spectrum, this will give you some very good understanding. For me the Quiet Revolution is a bit over the top, but that came after the book and doesn't make it any less valuable. "

And yes, please; a bit of Quiet around me would be most Welcome so that I could Hear my own Quietness & Inner Senses ;-)It explained so many things about me, myself and I - in relation to where I stand in this very loud world that surrounds me everywhere. "
262,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"I feel sure Quiet will become the benchmark book on the topic of introversion. This is because it not only thoroughly explains introversion but champions it. It’s a book by an introvert for introverts, to help them understand themselves and feel proud of who they are. It’s also a book for extroverts, but especially those extroverts who are convinced that introversion is a flaw. Cain will have them wishing they were introverts. Quiet is inarguably biased in favor of introversion, but that’s the point. Up to one-half of Americans are introverted. It’s absurd that introversion is scoffed at as much as it is. The time has come for the introverted label to be a compliment rather than a criticism. This book is a leap in that direction.Cain covered many facets of introversion, from the intriguing “highly sensitive” subset (which describes about 20% of all introverts) to differences in the Eastern and Western worlds to the introverted child (specifically in the classroom, which favors extroverts). Also explored is the age-old question of nature versus nurture and brain differences between extroverts and introverts--plus more. I greatly enjoyed the Eastern versus Western section. America, and the Western world in general, has what Cain dubs an “Extrovert Ideal.” The opposite is true in the East. Whereas in the West, introversion is viewed as a weakness to be conquered, in the East, it’s considered a strength; extroversion is frowned upon, viewed as something that must be tamed. The general sentiment is that extroverts are overwhelming people, wasting others’ time with empty chatter. It’s in this section that Cain profiled Don Chen, an Asian-American student studying at Harvard business school, a very extroverted place. He’s the embodiment of introversion and must feign extroversion daily to get through his classes and general life as part of the school. Feigning extroversion is draining, and Chen needs solitude every day to recharge. This is how it is for all introverts, and Cain stressed repeatedly that it’s not a defect, just a difference. Chen has an intimate group of friends (entirely Asian-American save for one introverted white American man). He’s keenly aware of the differences between his little group and his extroverted classmates. He notes how frequently the extroverts participate in classes while he rarely does and how boisterous they are when together in the cafeteria. Though he admires some of their qualities, he mostly doesn’t understand them. In his mind, they disrespectfully waste classmates’ and professors’ time with their talk, failing to get to the point quickly. If this section sounds borderline racist, it isn’t. Rather, it recognizes that different cultures value different qualities and is a powerful example of introversion as a desirable trait. Chen’s story is one of many in this enlightening book. To support all points, Cain profiled real people, some living, some dead (such as Rosa Parks and Dale Carnegie). The (carefully indexed) research is fascinating in itself, but the real-life examples supporting her research are vital. They round out Quiet to push it beyond dry textbook. I’d read a lot about introversion before reading Quiet, and I bypassed this book for years because others said it offers nothing new on the topic. Readers who’ve read numerous books on the topic or have researched the topic extensively may feel this way. I didn’t. In each chapter, I learned--and was utterly engrossed. Introverts will find Quiet relatable and affirming. Extroverts will find Quiet demystifies introverts thoroughly and will appreciate them more. Both will find it extremely illuminating."
263,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36434323-melindam,4,"3,6 starsWell.... as I am an introvert, I obviously need to comtemplate before writing a review, right? :)But all in all, I am glad I listened to this book. The narrator was excellent.Also, it was a very interesting, insightful, informative read and of course there were lots of issues raised to which I could totally relate, even though sometimes I was a bit confused about what Susan Cain was ultimately trying to prove.I wish I could have read this book as a I teenager as well as my extrovert mother! :)I am from Central-Eastern Europe, so of course not all things ""translate"" directly into how society is working in Hungary as opposed to how things are in the US, but the personal issues are there and are quite universal."
264,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose,5,"This has been probably the one review I've been most intimidated to write for the longest time, and it's not because Susan Cain's ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking"" isn't a strongly asserted and powerful work. I could sing its respective praises for days. The fact of the matter is - this book really hit me at the heart of my core for so many measures in my life as an introvert. I find it hard to expound just how much this book had an impact on me personally.I could tell you about many things about my person that embody me as an introvert. That I'm quiet spoken and don't speak unless I have something important to say. That small talk isn't something I'm comfortable that I'm not fond of confrontations (though many of you have read my extended written rants about various matters of controversy with very little hesitation). That I tend to spend time alone to recharge my batteries even when I'm called to do things in any scale of extroversion. That my emotional intelligence is very high and I can sympathize/emphathize with people for matters of their experience (though this also makes me highly sensitive).For most of my life, I've been told that these very natural matters of my disposition were wrong. And goodness forbid did that make my life complicated because I didn't feel like people understood who I was. I was even led to believe that I was actually shy, not introverted (many people confuse the two, there is a difference.) Yet the more I learned about the dynamic of introversion and extroversion and how they functioned, I realized that the fundamental difference between them were the derived sources of energy that one functions with in day to day living. That there's nothing wrong with being introverted versus extroverted in a society that - in mainstream notations, champions the latter.This book had me thinking for days after I finished it.I liked that Cain's narrative focuses on the positive contributions and the inherent strengths that lie in introversion because it's widely stereotyped. That stereotyping actually harms our society more than we ourselves may realize in the daily grind, not just individually. By trying to mold people into one acceptable standard, we often lose out on what unique strengths and contributions one may have from going away from such a standard. Narratives like ""Quiet"" have relevance not just in recognizing the distinct psychological functions and differences we have as individuals, but also in the relationships and contributions we have in our professions, our activities, and even wider perceptions of our society in general.I appreciated the expansion on famous figures like Rosa Parks in terms of her backstory and identity as an introvert and how that shaped her responses (I'll have to pick up ""Quiet Strength"" at some point). I also appreciated hearing Cain's own struggles with coming to terms with her introversion, and even the story of the Harvard Business student. There are so many individual stories in this narrative and Cain gives a thorough examination of the details within. It's amazing just how much work and thought went into expounding these issues and individual narratives. This narrative examines introversion not only as a social construct, but individual - delving into narratives of biological, psychological, and sociological importance. There's an examination on the level of intorversion among different cultures, how introspection is valuable to creativity versus ""groupthink"", how extroversion and introversion are not mutually exclusive (and situations that call for each). I came out of it all with not only a fresh perspective on how valuable introverts are to the fabric of society, but also a greater sense of self-worth for my own traits. And that's something to be thankful for. My hope is that with more people who pick up ""Quiet"" and realize how important our individual attributes are, that it'll provide for more opportunities to be creative and to value each other in our relationships regardless of differences, for our unique strengths regardless of how their expressed or from where they come.Overall score: 5/5 stars"
265,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,4,"There are a load of books I've marked ""to be reviewed"", and just completely ignored - it was 2013 when I read this! - so here goes, let's make the list a bit smaller.Here's the moment where I'm supposed to tell you I'm an introvert, so let's get that out of the way: obviously I am. My credentials include cheerfully working from home, getting overstimulated in quiet libraries, and keeping in touch with my closest friends almost entirely by snail mail. I have been known to feel oversocialised sitting in a darkened room, listening to people two rooms away watch a film.As far as a lot of media is concerned, I may as well be a pet hamster. ""Care for your introvert."" Try not to interrupt them. Don't go in their nest while they're sleeping. Offer them a way out when you're at a party, in case they run out of carrot sticks and want to go home. I may as well also be a complete rarity: a third of people don't get hissy when you take their carrot sticks away; come the fuck on.So, what I liked about Quiet was that it didn't make me feel like a special snowflake or someone's hamster.But also... the section on introversion in leadership and the workplace has actually boosted my confidence a lot (apart from being really interesting). I've worked for a few people, and the times it's worked best have been the times where they give me a broad, bullet-pointed list of what they want to have happened by what time, and then they go away until that time. The best boss I ever had used to say it was a good day if we never spoke to each other except when one of us brought the other coffee - and I was inclined to agree with him. Faced with common-sense-logic, which seems to say that 5000 feedback sessions and an open-plan office with communal ball-pit are what millennials are looking for, I wanted this narrative. It was useful to hear. Maybe it's less useful if you're the sort of person who's been reading this sort of thing for years. For me, it was a helpful reminder.I remember a little interesting neurological detail, but not a lot - I can get more than that keyword-searching the Scientific American website, if I want to - and a fair bit of interesting historical anecdote. I remember coming away with a renewed respect for anyone who parents, especially by themselves, as well as a sense of purpose about working for myself and by myself - which I'm happy to say I'm now doing. It turns out, a lot of the time, that people who contract you for work over the internet don't really give a shit about your sparkling and gracious personality. They just want to know you're conscientious and you know what you're talking about and you'll do things when you say you will. I vaguely credit Susan Cain with giving me the impetus to go and do what I want to do, and not to feel like I have to be constantly nice to people I don't know. Now I just think, it's okay, I have character, and then put my headphones back in."
266,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5524572-kristin-hackett-superspacechick,4,"As a self proclaimed introvert, I've been meaning to read this book for so long. My sister in law gave me a copy for Christmas so I prioritized it as a January read and I'm so glad I did. I really enjoyed the in depth look at what constitutes an introvert vs. an extrovert. Quiet even redefined the meaning of the word sensitive for me. I've never considered myself sensitive before but to pull a quote, ""highly sensitive people tend to be keen observers who look before they leap. They arrange their lives in ways that limit surprises. They’re often sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, pain, coffee... Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments—both physical and emotional—unusually deeply. They tend to notice subtleties that others miss—another person’s shift in mood, say, or a lightbulb burning a touch too brightly.""- this is 100% spot on for me. While I do agree with a lot of what Susan Cain wrote, I do think it's difficult to classify people into only one of two categories. She did stress that just because someone is an introvert, it doesn't mean that 1) they got there the same way as someone else or 2) that both people will have exactly the same traits. There are still variables to consider. Overall, I loved that Quiet is a celebrated look at introversion and the strengths that those with introverted qualities possess. There were a few anecdotes that weren't the most interesting (or relevant like the chapter on raising children), but I still found value in reading them. "
267,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,5,"I am an introvert and proud of it and so is the author and she believes there is strength in quietness and I think she is right. She has helped me understand myself more and I am glad of that. Introverts don't like novelty and the first day of school is usually traumatic as mine was. As children, introverts like to daydream, play inside and their feelings are easily hurt. ""They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. . ."" They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy and fear."" They "". . . tend to speak softly because that's how they prefer others to communicate with them.""Shy people hate confrontations and will avoid them at all costs and the author believes it is better so. ""Scores of studies have shown that venting doesn't sooth anger; it fuels it.""This is a great book for people who have always felt that their shyness makes them less worthy than the more gregarious in the world."
268,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,2,"Why is it that the “ideal” person is extroverted? That we pride social skills and being outgoing? All while a deeply gifted thinker who prefers to be in his/her head is described as lacking these traits. Looking at it from an evolutionary standpoint, there is a reason why introverts exist, so why do we rate it as second best? Being a true-blue introvert, I turned to Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a world that can’t stop talking” to answer these questions (and maybe propose new ones). Susan Cain divides “Quiet” into four main sections with the first focusing on the history and description of the rise of extroverts, the differences in leadership styles of introverts and extroverts, and the myths surrounding them. This section begins “Quiet” with a slow and unmemorable beginning. Cain focuses more of an effort on real-life case studies versus actual scientific studies, bypassing any professional data or even her own opinions. The studies which are mentioned are not “earth-shattering” in depth nor do they truly correlate to her hypothesis. In fact, much of the hypothesis is lost and the flow is not seamless or clear. On one hand, this makes the reading understandable and accessible for the less scientifically-inclined reader, but to others craving more research; Cain leaves something to be desired. Some of Cain’s examples which could be perceived as “witty” (Craig Newark of Craigslist fame, Dr. Suess, and Moses from the Bible) are underdeveloped and also lose connection with the hypothesis. Cain is often abrupt and cuts herself short. Furthermore, many of the chapters begin in the same exact way (both format and creativity) which is tedious and creates a loss of interest. The second section of “Quiet” describes some of the brain and neurological aspects of introverts featuring more science than the first section. Cain’s work is a bit more compelling in this respect and certainly more interesting. However, it still isn’t clear what she is trying to prove as she mostly just describes how introverts “are”. Plus, most of the findings are self-explanatory and even obvious. Again, the reader will not be blown away. I have read MANY “brain books” (psychology/neurology, science, and biology) and generally, I am left both flabbergasted and repeating information I’ve read to anyone who will listen. This was not the case with “Quiet” as only a small dose of information felt standout. As the second portion progresses, Cain does present tests and experimentation results more confidentially (however, there is a lack of elaboration). The third section of “Quiet” is comparatively shorter, as Cain explains the conformities and values of the Asian cultures while in the fourth section, Cain offers tips and lifestyle adaptations for introverts in various areas such as work, romance, parenting, play, etc. At this point, “Quiet” appears to be more of a self-help book. The latter end of the book is overly focused on parenting and schooling of children causing me to feel alienated and distanced (having no children). Furthermore, the “Conclusion” is weak and sums up the book which actually reinforces how few points are made. Simply, “Quiet"" is not what I expected. Instead of explaining “why” introverts are the way they are; Cain described “how” they are with an absence of data I would have preferred. All in all though, it has been confirmed (which I already knew) that I am indeed an introvert."
269,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A lance is broken for the needs of introverted people Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Whether one opposes the sanguine with the phlegmatic nature, the wild daredevil the thoughtful inventor or merely the introversion the extroversion, the temperament is and remains in specific proportions decisive for a human being. The author has re-examined this fact with an unconventional approach, opening up exciting and critical viewing angles. Times are changing. In the 19th century, it was still commonplace to be modest, humble and unobtrusive. Starting from the advertising industry in the 1920s and 1930s, it continued to run to the idealistic goal of total superficiality. Ads began to play with people's fear of the negative connotations of ominous, alien observers, and the appearance and ability to attract more and more attention. The new religion of narcissism was supported by an entrepreneurial mentality that understood handshaking qualities, dazzling rhetoric, and slick eloquence as signs of business qualification.Thus, when the loudest and most risk-taking specimens of the managerial species, elite colleges that encourage elbow mentality-driven, superficial behavior, occupy key positions, one or the other financial market collapse is no longer surprising. The flowers of this development on the example of today's America could seem bizarre if the consequences were not so serious. Thus, adjectives such as shy and quiet or just hints of a sly-boy mentality are dismissed as entirely negative and peculiar. Whether in school, work or private life, who does not understand playing on the highly sophisticated keyboard of interpersonal communication, quickly falls through the typical rust. Sensitive children, even as babies, are prone to intensified reactions to external stimuli, are more empathetic and need seeming timidity as a protective mechanism against a formally overwhelming universe. At the same time, individuals naturally endowed with a more robust psychic scaffolding sound lighthearted, but also more emotionless, to their surroundings.Parents of quieter, a manageable circle of friends their naming and lonely hobbies devoted children are remembered, not only subtle, the importance of popularity and dazzling charm. However, very peculiar that silent children are put under depression or misanthropic suspicion, while too vital, joyful young people are sedated with Ritalin. If the favors of loneliness have been well into adulthood, there is a wide range of seminars that can enhance eloquence, demeanor, and be talking skills to the point of sales genius. Several relationship problems are likely based on the well measurable differences between different natures, even by MRI. While extroverts can bathe in crowds every awaken minute and shy away from loneliness, the relationship is reversed by introverts. This involves interpersonal explosives in itself when the mantra of the attractive opposites once no longer pulls, and the supposed truce of the relationship beginning is over. Additional spontaneous emotional responses provoke the fact that extroverts interpret specific aggressive behavior as interest and attention while introverts feel injured and attacked. Assessing the damage caused to the economy by incorrectly designing work processes and their surroundings is difficult or even impossible. If one adds the increased disinclination of introverts in a loud open-plan atmosphere, including the wasted potential, because gifted thinkers find no peace to work out ideas and concepts undisturbed, the overall economic damage can be immense. The cultural differences show a contrarian approach of the Asians, where a European-American behavior style is considered a stupid waste of time for listeners. Tranquility and contemplation have a different meaning, superficiality and the glorification of narcissistic principles are considered less desirable. Another, quite thoughtful approach.Eine Lanze gebrochen für die Bedürfnisse der introvertierten MenschenansammlungsvermeiderOb man dem sanguinischen das phlegmatische Naturell entgegenstellt, dem wilden Draufgänger den nachdenklichen Tüftler oder schlicht der Introvertiertheit die Extrovertiertheit, das Temperament ist und bleibt zu bestimmten Anteilen maßgebend für einen Menschen. Die Autorin hat diesen Umstand mit einer unkonventionellen Herangehensweise neu beleuchtet und damit interessante und kritische Betrachtungswinkel eröffnet.So ändern sich die Zeiten. War es im 19 Jahrhundert noch gang und gäbe, bescheiden, demütig und unaufdringlich zu sein, begann, ausgehend von der Werbeindustrie, in den 1920er und 1930er Jahren, ein bis heute andauernder Lauf auf das ideelle Ziel der totalen Oberflächlichkeit. Anzeigen begannen mit der Angst der Menschen vor negativen Assoziationen ominöser, fremder Beobachter zu spielen und das Äußere sowie die Fähigkeit zu gefallen, immer mehr ins Rampenlicht zu rücken. Unterstützung fand die neue Religion des Narzissmus von einer Unternehmermentalität, die Handschlagqualitäten, blendende Rhetorik und aalglatte Eloquenz als Zeichen betriebswirtschaftlicher Qualifikation auffasste. Wenn auf diese Weise immer die lautesten und risikofreudigsten Exemplare der Managerspezies, von zu ellbogenmentalitätsgesteuerten, oberflächlichen Verhalten animierenden Elitehochschulen, Schlüsselpositionen besetzen, verwundert der eine oder andere Finanzmarktkollaps gar nicht mehr.Die Blüten dieser Entwicklung am Beispiel des heutigen Amerikas könnten skurril anmuten, wären die daraus resultierenden Konsequenzen nicht derart gravierend. So werden Adjektive wie schüchtern und ruhig oder nur Andeutungen einer Eigenbrötlermentalität als durchwegs negativ und absonderlich abgetan. Sei es in Schule, Beruf oder Privatleben, wer nicht versteht auf der hochkomplexen Klaviatur zwischenmenschlicher Kommunikation zu spielen, fällt leicht einmal durch den sozialen Rost.Sensible Kinder neigen schon als Babys zu verstärkten Reaktionen auf äußere Reize, sind einfühlsamer und benötigen die scheinbare Furchtsamkeit als Schutzmechanismus gegen ein sie mit Eindrücken förmlich erschlagendes Universum. Gleichzeitig wirken von Natur aus mit einem robusteren psychischen Gerüst ausgestattete Individuen unbeschwerter, aber auch emotionsloser auf ihre Umgebung. Eltern ruhiger, einen überschaubaren Freundeskreis ihr Eigen nennender und sich einsamen Hobbies widmender Kinder werden, nicht nur durch die Blume, an die Wichtigkeit von Beliebtheit und blendendem Charme erinnert. Doch sehr eigentümlich, dass stille Kinder unter Depressions- oder Misanthropiegeneralverdacht gestellt werden, während allzu vitale, lebensfrohe junge Menschen mit Ritalin sediert werden.Sollte sich die Favorisierung der Einsamkeit bis ins Erwachsenenalter durchgeschlagen haben, gibt es eine breite Palette an Seminarangeboten, die Beredsamkeit, Auftreten und Plauschkompetenzen bis hin zum Verkaufsgenie steigern können. Etliche Beziehungsprobleme dürften auf den, auch per MRT gut messbaren Unterschieden zwischen verschiedenen Naturellen basieren. Während Extrovertierte jede wache Minute in Menschenmengen baden könnten und Einsamkeit scheuen, kehrt sich das Verhältnis bei Introvertierten um. Das birgt zwischenmenschlichen Sprengstoff in sich, wenn das Mantra von den sich anziehenden Gegensätzen einmal nicht mehr richtig zieht und der vermeintliche Waffenstillstand des Beziehungsbeginns vorüber ist. Zusätzliche spontane emotionale Reaktionen provoziert die Tatsache, dass Extrovertierte bestimmtes, aggressives Verhalten als Interesse und Aufmerksamkeit interpretieren, während Introvertierte sich verletzt und angegriffen fühlen.Den für die Wirtschaft entstandenen Schaden durch falsche Konzeption von Arbeitsabläufen samt deren Umgebungen einzuschätzen mutet schwer bis unmöglich an. Wenn man die verstärkte Krankheitsneigung Introvertierter in lauter Großraumbüroatmosphäre inklusive dem verschwendeten Potential, weil begnadete Denker keine Ruhe finden, um Ideen und Konzepte ungestört ausarbeiten zu können, addiert, dürfte der gesamtvolkswirtschaftliche Schaden immens sein.Die kulturellen Unterschiede zeigen eine konträre Herangehensweise der Asiaten, bei denen ein europäisch-amerikanisches Gebaren als unhöfliche Verschwendung der Zeit von Zuhörern gewertet wird. Ruhe und Kontemplation haben eine andere Bedeutung, Oberflächlichkeit und die Verherrlichung narzisstischer Prinzipien gelten als wenig erstrebenswert. Ein anderer, durchaus in Erwägung zu ziehender Ansatz."

Susan Cain, former Wall Street lawyer and self-described introvert, investigates how introversion has become dangerously scorned in the current American ""Culture of Personality."" I had not fully realized how drastically our cultural values have shifted--and how much American society pushes us to conform--until reading Cain's book. To prove her point, Cain visits American bastions of extroversion promotion, including Harvard Business School, Saddleback Church, Dale Carnegie, Wall Street, and Tony Robbins conferences. She talks with pioneering psychologists and neurologists to explain the studies behind concepts like the dangers of group think, the ability to delay gratification, or the trait called sensitivity. She profiles famous and less-well known introverts to show how the studies play out in real life.Though the many of the activities I'm drawn to (and the things that cause anxiety) scream classic introvert, I have always considered myself an extrovert and frequently put myself in situations where extroverted behavior is valued. However, since quitting my job and globe-hopping for the past two years, I've been surprised (and disappointed) by how often the constant stimulation, new people, and change can drain me--and by how I often feel an overwhelming need for alone time.I found myself relating to many of the points Cain discusses and have since concluded that I'm much more of an introvert than I had thought. (I promise that this isn't just because she does a good job of highlighting all the positive things about introverts!)So for that, I am grateful to have read Quiet, though I can't quite believe it took reading a book to figure that out about myself! I am seeing my preferences in a new light and have much understanding and acceptance regarding the things that interest me (and those that cause me stress). I've been having trouble narrowing down 'what I want to do with my life' and this book has helped me more than any other, because I finally feel like I can accept that the things I really enjoy are just a part of me and can't be ignored. Though the personal application will differ, I suspect many people will come away having learned much more than they expected, if not about themselves, then about people close to them. I had always thought of extroverts and introverts as being on distinct sides of a line, when in fact it's much more of a sliding scale (or perhaps better as two scales: percentage introversion, percentage extroversion). Because we have been culturally pressured and trained to admire extroverted behavior, many of us may be dangerously ignoring our introverted characteristics. This was a game-changing book for me, and I suspect it will be eye-opening to most people who read it."
271,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,5,"I love reading on Friday nights, writing on Saturday afternoons, and having quiet get-togethers on Sunday. But I also enjoy giving presentations at school, tutoring peers in writing, and interacting with various people online and in real life. I'd describe myself as an introvert (and my Meyers-Briggs personality type agrees), though both introverts and extroverts would enjoy this fascinating book by Susan Cain. She provides an intriguing, in-depth perspective on introversion, its connotation in contrasting cultures, and the psychology behind it.A profusion of the nonfiction I've read has contained too much of something - too many random anecdotes, too much scientific jargon, too many unnecessary statistics or explanations. But Quiet has the perfect blend of personal anecdotes, interesting analysis, detailed explanations, and compelling statistics. Cain references various studies conducted by psychologists and discusses several aspects related to introversion, such as the extrovert ideal, how extroverts and introverts can compliment each other and work together, nature v. nature, etc. Here's one passage about sensitive people (who tend to be more introverted) that struck a chord with me:""The other thing Aron found about sensitive people is that sometimes they're highly empathic. It's as if they have thinner boundaries separating them from other people's emotions and from the tragedies and cruelties of the world. They tend to have unusually strong consciences. They avoid violent movies and TV shows; they're acutely aware of the consequences of a lapse in their own behavior. In social settings they often focus on subjects like personal problems, which others consider 'too heavy'.""I guess I have an excuse for exposing so much of myself on my blog, huh? Anyway, Cain delves into other subjects that are intellectually stimulating too, such as the three things she thinks are important in identifying one's personal project. She even brings up the relationship between Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. as well as other famous historical figures.Overall, highly recommended to everyone curious about their own temperaments and how to embrace their natural personalities. One of the best works of nonfiction I've read.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."

I was really excited to read it, because I knew this book was very popular. Also, I love nonfiction. I love the ability to learn from a book.I believe I learned from this book. It was interesting to hear why my best friend, who is one of the biggest introverts ever fits perfectly with me (I'm a huge extravert). Also, it was interesting to hear what you can do to help someone with stage fright preform at their best.However, I felt the book repeated itself. Many times I wondered what new information could possibly be discussed, and a lot of times there wasn't really any new information. It just talked about the same material in a circle from a different angle.A lot of the time I felt like this book was written so introverts could feel validated for being an introvert and that they weren't anti-social. They just need socialization in a completely different way than extroverts."

It's perhaps not a surprise that Susan Cain, the author of Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking identifies herself as an introvert. Being quiet, introverted or shy is still seen by many as a problem or handicap to overcome so I can see her motivation for writing it.One this book's premises is that in the last 50 years or so, the Western world moved from a culture of character to a culture of personality, which according to the author has given an advantage to people that enjoyed outgoing, uninhibited personalities. We tend to admire and reward people that exhibit the most gregarious, outgoing traits of extroverts while at the same time undermined and misunderstand those that are most typically seen in more introverted individuals.
Introversion is really about having a preference for lower stimulation environments. So it's just a preference for quiet, for less noise, for less action. Whereas extroverts really crave more stimulation in order to feel at their best.
The author explains that Introversion is a spectrum, and that most of us don't fully fit into an introvert/extrovert definition. It also provides a sort of ""survival guide"" for introverts to help us learn how to better deal with the pressures of living in a world that for the most part rewards those that are extroverts.
Many people believe that introversion is about being antisocial, and that's really a misperception. Because actually it's just that introverts are differently social. So they would prefer to have a glass of wine with a close friend as opposed to going to a loud party full of strangers.
This book helped me understand myself better, identify those traits that makes many of us ""introverts"" different and learn how to use them to our advantage, both on our professional and personal lives. The book is entertaining and well written. If you are interested in learning about introverts, perhaps because you feel like one or someone closed to you does, this book might be of interest to you.After reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking my conclusion is that the world needs both extroverts and introverts and that we all have a role to play.Here's a link to the author's TED TALK which is sort a summarized version of the book:http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_t..."

And the whole idea about needing time out to recover from socialising - I always thought I was just a bit odd, haha.The criticisms that are quite rightly levelled at this book about preaching some kind of binarism between extrovert and introvert are understandable, and am I'm sure that we are all a little too complex for a poorly designed set of questions to provide any sort of sensible analysis or categorisation (would still like to see the questions though...) Most people will be surely be somewhere close to 'ambivert' even if they know themselves to be introverted at heart. For me a major part of young socialisation and growing up was learning to act like an extrovert, if nothing else just to stop people trying to 'bring me out of my shell' or constantly asking what's up as I am 'being quiet'."
275,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena,4,"I really liked this book, especially the beginning part. I so needed to read it. For years people have been telling me to come out of my shell and to be more outgoing and I realized I had definitely playing the role of pseudo-extrovert all this time! I enjoyed reading the fact that we introverts actually have power and hidden strengths. The list of famous introverts surprised me, Rosa Parks, Al Gore and Gandhi in particular. The book also shared some insight into the thinking patterns of extroverts. All in all, it was an interesting book though the end did drag on a bit."

277,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5470914-sam,1,"This was the most painful book I have read this summer. I choked it down like bad medicine page after page. Quiet is great self affirmation for someone who considers themselves an introvert, and sees humans as either an extrovert or introvert. Cain certainly thinks she’s the poster child of an introvert, or is she? The book reads like a memoir in parts where she tells stories of her own life, then there are smatterings or small examples in specific parts of people’s lives of how greatness comes in quiet e.g. Steve Wozniak, Gandhi, Rosa Parks. Cain also fancies herself a bit of a child psychologist, on one hand it’s ok for kids to be shy or in their shell, these aren’t bad things, and very normal, but on the other hand we need to nudge and push slowly to get kids out of their quiet place. So which is it?It doesn’t bother me that Cain isn’t a psychologist or economist, but she’s talking through both sides of her mouth, the book is a pity party, she thinks the decisions in modern workplaces are influenced by highly extroverted personalities like those from the Harvard Business School. There’s no backing for this other than the fact that business students are extroverts. Additionally the economic crisis was wholly the fault of extroverts, basically extroverts with their loud voices overpowered the brilliant quiet hardworking, and smart introverts and ran the economy to the ground. I’m afraid you really aren’t brilliant if something has already happened and you didn’t do anything to stop it. In hindsight everything is 20/20, just because you are quiet and something bad is happening saying “I knew it!” doesn’t do much. The circlejerk continues when Cain bangs on about everyone who a douche as being an extrovert. Good guys are introverts, Warren Buffet because of his one speech about the dot com bubble bursting was quiet and well calculated in his words. The rest of the word are greedy businessmen. There’s some sample or thin slicing in her discussions that I find problematic, and read a bit like a tabloid. Susan Cain is clearly appealing to an audience that is already sold to introversion, and stroking those egos. I wish the book had more solutions instead of harping about how bad people are. The book blurs it’s lines through many genres, self help, psychology and a dash of group-think. I consider myself an introvert, but also an extrovert, yes I do believe brilliance happens in unaccompanied activities like running. I charge my batteries during times like this but I also don’t “suffer in silence”. I don’t believe people are fully introverted or extroverted. Reading Khaneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and Mcgonigal’s Willpower Instinct make Cain’s book look hurriedly and thoughtlessly written, there’s little appeal to science. "
278,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,3,"I expected to love, love, love this book. After all, psychology is one of my passions. Also, I am always interested in hearing from some group. And this is saying, ""We, the introverts, are speaking out.""However, the book was neither as powerful nor as interesting as I was hoping....Cain does a great job of blending together different aspects. The three main angles she uses are:1.) Famous people who were introverts. She usually starts her chapters with a story about a wonderful famous person we all know and adore - and then explaining how they were introverted. Rosa Parks, Dale Carnegie, and Eleanor Roosevelt are some of the examples she used.2.) Case studies. This is the real life introvert ""Jane Doe."" She was on this job and thought she would have to quit because she just wasn't outgoing enough. Then she learned that being an introvert was like having a secret superpower! And then she used her introversion to overcome all obstacles! Now she's rich and/or happy. Success!3.) Science - hard and soft. Cain uses both psychology and biology to try and explain the differences between extroverts and introverts. She also explains why introversion might be valuable in evolution and natural selection. She has a fascinating chapter on culture, which emphasizes that although extroversion is worshiped in the USA, many Asian countries value silence, reflection, and understanding over cheerfulness, enthusiasm, and talkativeness. ...This book is at it's best when Cain is exploring how introversion is a valuable and worthy trait or way of being. When she journeys into different places to see how introversion is treated differently there. When she explores how introversion can be a survival aid in the wild and how introverted people can be powerful in their own way.It's exciting and interesting to realize that extroversion - while venerated in America - is actually seen as crass and dumb in many Asian cultures.And it's fun and cool to see different theories of how introverted people and animals are strong in Darwin's theories of evolution and natural selection. I liked seeing different species and the benefits and drawbacks they experience from being extroverted or introverted. And I enjoyed seeing how introversion could be a kick-butt evolutionary trait which is often overlooked or thought to be something that needed 'killing off.'I thought about 2/3 of the book were weak, though. For instance, I already know enough about famous figures and do not particularly want or need to read a short biography or story about them. Another thing that bugged me were her ""real life introversion stories."" Here is how an introvert struggled. Here is how he learned to embrace his true self and be happy/rich.The whole book just felt like a big pat on the back. ""Don't worry, introverts, you're okay! Everything's okay! It might seem like the world hates you, but use your strengths! You are really amazing.""And it's not even like I DISAGREE with this message, it's simply that I was expecting more than a rather thinly-veiled self-help book. P.S. I really like the page or two that Cain dedicates to exploring Moses (an alleged introvert) and Aaron (his extroverted mouthpiece). It is also interesting when she lightly touches on whether or not the Church and modern-day Protestants shun and punish introverts as not doing the Lord's work. I like when she questions whether Jesus was an introvert or extrovert (covered in one paragraph, very shallow) and questions whether the Church is pushing an incorrect message on it's followers. (""Real Christians proselytize! How can you be a REAL Christian if you are not gregarious?"") I also like when she uses the teachings and life of Gandhi to emphasize that passivity is NOT submissiveness. All these subjects were things I wished she'd explored in greater depth."

All these adjectives and more describe my experience with this amazing book.I'm very much an introvert. I try to avoid social functions as much as possible, but I do love meeting every so often with my dear friends one-on-one. If I do end up at a party, you can bet I'm the one keeping the corner warm. I am an avid reader, a knitter, a sometimes writer, a nerd, and an engineer. My idea of a perfect evening is one spent in the comfort of my apartment, cat in lap, book in hand, coffee at my side. My idea of a perfect vacation is one where I can go to my favorite coffee shop and read. In college, my favorite classes were Differential Equations (in which I, the only female, got a perfect score on the final), Physics, and Fluids. Ever since elementary school, I dreaded a school performances, such as Christmas programs or poetry recitals. At work meetings, I am more likely to listen to everything and be note-taker than I am to present or volunteer ideas.Lately, my boss has said that I need to step things up, become more ""out there"" and confident. Inwardly, I despaired. Wasn't I working hard enough? What was holding me back? Why couldn't I just blurt things out in meetings? Why did I constantly sound nervous, even if I really wasn't? Was there any hope for me to change?And then, like a sign from heaven, I saw this book in the ""New Books"" display at Barnes and Nobles (BTW, I happen to swing by the bookstore at least once a week during lunch - sometimes to purchase, but mostly to pass the time). I remembered a friend had read this and really enjoyed it, and I figured it would help me figure out myself.""Figure myself out"" would be an understatement; it's as if this book were written specifically for me! Cain breaks down what it means to be an introvert. Turns out despite what my sister is constantly telling me, I'm not weird (alright, not too weird). I have talents and skills. I have a place. And it's not my fault I can't always speak up and make my voice heard. A lot of it is because of how our workforce, our employers, our coworkers, our society functions. Our biology, our parents, our surroundings make us the introverted beings we are. It's just that school and work and the outside world try to tell us that being quiet, that listening and ruminating over things is wrong, that we should be quick to speak and blurt whatever is on our mind.I've known I was an introvert for a while, but it was so refreshing and liberating to learn that there were others with my ""problem"". That I wasn't alone. And, most importantly, I can overcome, nay thrive, in this Extroverted world. And that is the second gift Cain gives us in this book: how to be an Introvert in an Extrovert world and not want to choke yourself at night.I feel like, after reading Quiet, I have a plan for facing my ""work problems"". I feel like I can take the challenge my boss has placed in front of me and succeed. Although a part of me still wishes I could crawl back to my desk and burrow there, I think this book has given me the tools and encouragement I need to speak up.If you are an introvert, you definitely need to read this book. Even if you aren't an introvert, this is a great book to understanding how they think and act. I'm definitely passing this along to everyone I know."

Then we spent time in a workshop, to understand the implications of our personality types. One of the dimensions of the test is extroversion/introversion (E or I types). This book offers a very satisfying account of what it means to be an introvert. Generally Western cultures admire extroverts, while Asian cultures admire introverts. Both types of personalities offer value to society. Groups of people who are introverts are best with an extroverted leader, while groups of extroverts are best with an introverted leader.Many introverts find it difficult to live in a society that values extroversion more highly. As a result, many introverts pretend to be extroverts in certain social situations. But they cannot maintain this pretension indefinitely, and at some point in time they must ""recharge"" their internal batteries with quiet and solitude. The book makes a major point here: It's perfectly OK to pretend to be an extrovert for periods of time--as long as you do this while you are working at something that you truly love.The book has useful practical advice for introverts. If you are an introvert and your husband or wife is an extrovert, there is much to be said about how to maintain or improve your relationship. If you are raising a child who is an introvert, it is important to understand how to encourage the child to follow his/her innate abilities.Back in the 1940's and 1950's, Alex Osborn was plagued by the lack of creativity in his advertising agency. So, he wrote some books introducing the concept of ""brainstorming"". The idea is for people get together in groups and toss out ideas without fear of ridicule--the more ideas, the better. The problem is, in the 1960's, studies showed that brainstorming is not efficient; you can get more, good ideas if people simply think creatively in solitude. Committees simply are not as productive as the sum of individuals working alone. We are so inculcated with the idea that brainstorming is best--but this is really just a reflection of the dominance of extroversion in our society. "

I felt like it wasn’t as accessible as it could have been. It seems very focused on introverts in or who wish to be in very high powered job roles. Which isn’t my world. I was hoping for a bit more knowledge or ‘self help’ regarding being an introvert in an average every day life, Not as an award winning introverted lecturer, or an introverted Lawyer or CEO."
282,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"It is stated at the start that this book’s purpose is to improve a reader's relationship with others. The book can thus be viewed as a book of the self-help genre. Its aim is to advise introverts on ways by which they can improve their relationships with extroverts, and vice versa. It compares behavioral traits of both introverts and extroverts, showing in what ways they are similar and how they differ. The author mentions books about and summarizes studies related to extroversion and introversion, conducted over the years and up to today. The book begins with a quick test by which readers can determine where they stand on the introvert / extrovert scale. The test takes only a few minutes and gives the reader an immediate connection with the topics to be discussed. Both my husband and I took the test. We both received the same score, indicating that we are both strong introverts. It is interesting to note that although we had the same score, we did not answer all questions in the same way. This led to a lively discussion and a fun start to the book! Twenty questions are to be answered with a yes or a no. The book demonstrates clearly that in America it is the extroverts that hold sway--in the government, in business and in most educational institutions. It is an important and valuable statement that is being made. This is often to the detriment of introverts and to society as a whole. While the author professes the importance and value of both the introvert and the extrovert way of thinking, given the suppression of introverts in society today, it is introverts she lauds most, giving example after example of their accomplishments. I didn’t need to be convinced. For me, it is OBVIOUS that society benefits from the presence of both. The book verges on becoming a manifesto for introverts. This appeals to me no more than society's pronounced favoritism of extroverts! The book accomplishes well what it has set out to do, but I am rarely enthused by books of the self-help genre. It does advise readers on how their relationships can be improved. It also explains how schools can be adapted to better suit the needs of introverts, without hampering the situation for extroverts. I do however find much of the advice given as being rather obvious. The sections I like most are those that are scientifically oriented. I like for example the parts about how the brain functions; sections about the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex and the connection to dopamine are interesting. Many studies are referred to, but how exactly each was performed is skimmed over in too brief a manner. We are told what the results have for implications, but skeptic that I am, I was not always convinced! I need more details. To add depth, opposing points of view should have been added. Intuitively, I agree with the conclusions drawn, but I would have preferred more solid proof. Too many generalizations/simplifications are made. Over and over again we are told that so and so was an introvert and so and so an extrovert. This is all too simple! Individuals are mixes of introvert and extrovert qualities. Instead, an analysis of the tangled mix of traits that make up real people is what I was looking for. At one point Moses is classified as an introvert! This was just too much for me. The author swiftly classifies famous people as being either introvert or extrovert with little analysis of their specific character traits. I find this too categorical. We are told that Madeleine L'Engle, author of A Wrinkle in Time, would never have written the books she wrote and become the ""bold thinker"" that she became had she not been left alone to read books in her youth. Where is the proof in that?! The author generalizes and simplifies all too often. The book is directed primarily toward Americans. I do not appreciate this slant. There is only a brief discussion of Asian American immigrants. Asian Americans of Chinese background are classified as introverts. Europeans are in a bunch grouped with Americans. I would have preferred a more in-depth, nuanced analysis of national and cultural differences.I wish the book had been more globally and more scientifically oriented. It has too many generalizations. It is basically a self-help book, a genre that does not appeal to me, so I guess it is not so bad that I nevertheless felt it to be worth reading. I would have preferred more in-depth analyses concerning how individuals are complicated mixes of introversion and extroversion. We are not one or the other, as was so often stated in reference to the people mentioned. The narration of the audiobook by Kathe Mazur started out very fast, but eventually she slows down. Her rapid speed had me chuckling at the beginning. Why? Because it is the extroverts, not us introverts that talk fast! Didn’t the producers of the audiobook realize the incongruity?! We introverts need time to stop and think and time to examine the ideas floating around in our heads. The narration is easy to follow once Mazur has slowed down. She has a soft, pleasant voice, a perfect match for introverts, the central protagonists of the book. The question is how many extroverts read this book. It is interesting to think about why this may be so."
283,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,5,"This book is very insightful and informative. I watched Susan Cain's TED talk once and I was fascinated being an introvert myself. As a kid I was shy, serious, studious with a little bit of social anxiety and although as I grew up, I outgrew my shyness and got more confident socially, there have been many situations where I questioned myself. Once when I was out on a trip with a big group of college friends, everyone was getting along so well and they seemed to be having so much fun together but I felt so lonely and left out and I was like, ''What's wrong with me''? Turns out I'm just an introvert. Then, I found this book. It describes in detail what introversion and extroversion is and what are the traits associated with both personalities. Where in most areas (or cultures), the introversion or shyness is viewed in a negative light, the writer states that it's an essential trait and how powerful it could be and it should be valued just as extroversion is. I found this book very interesting to read because she presents her ideas by using data gathered from case studies, research and her own personal experiences and from other people. She has also provided analysis of many famous personalities and how their temperaments shaped their actions and how essential their role was. Many definitions are provided for introversion-extroversion and how our genes and our environment play a role in shaping our personalities. There is no personality type better than the other but creating a balance is very important to bring out the best in both. The message in short is- value your individuality and do things the way you want and not because you have to conform to certain cultural norms. It also tells how both personalities can strike a balance between both traits. Also, both extroverts and introverts can lead a fulfilling life without changing their core values or trying to be someone they are not, the power lies in knowing who you are, what your abilities are and using them to the best.After reading this book, I feel like I can understand myself a little better now, what my motivations are and what makes me the way I am. I recommend this book to both introverts and extroverts as it can help them understand the qualities in themselves and in each other."

285,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1230817-lori,5,"I'm really excited about all the works about introverts that's been coming out lately, I think mainly because of this book. I'm not sure if extroverts would have enjoyed this book as much as me, because Cain works hard to prove the merits and necessity of introverts in our society, while down-playing all the reasons why we should have an extrovert ideal. In fact, I think some extroverts would feel a bit offended at this book. But I don't care. I've lived my whole life feeling like there was something wrong with me. I need to speak up, get out there, sell myself, basically become something that I'm not. This book made me realize there's nothing wrong with me, and that I actually have strengths that my extroverted friends, relatives, etc., do not. Instead of constantly seeing myself as disadvantaged because I suck at small talk, don't know how to talk myself up in interviews, and am just a shy person, I just feel like I know myself better. I think teachers should read this book. And I'm going to stop, because this isn't so much as a book review as a blog post or something. This is a total self-help book for introverts. Thank you Cain!**I should also say that Cain uses extensive research and interviews to show the strengths of introverts, so it's actually a pretty scientific book (though made so that it's easy for the every day person like me to understand). I was really surprised at the amount of research done on the differences between introverts and extroverts, especially because the research often shows introverts in a good, positive light, unlike what most people think when they hear the word introvert.

First of all, as far as the audio format goes, they couldn’t have chosen a better narrator. Kathe Mazur’s voice fits the tone of the book perfectly–quiet and measured, yet firm. I basically just want to listen to every audiobook she’s ever narrated. Back to Quiet –I think Susan Cain did a stellar job of exploring the introverted personality type. She sites a number of studies and scientific theories to support her thesis that introversion is an undervalued trait in modern American society. Introverts have just as much to offer the world as extroverts and their unique strengths must be utilized for a society to be truly healthy.

287,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6610433-midnightfaerie,3,"When I was young, my grandfather, an intelligent farmer, used to call me an introvert, as I sat happily in the corner, spending my free time reading books or writing in my notebooks. I looked up at him, I believe I was around the age of eight or so, with crinkled eyebrows. He explained what it meant. But I didn't have a puzzled look on my face because I didn't understand the word, I was puzzled because he said it like he disapproved. Like it was a bad thing. My aunt, the doctor, immediately came to my defense and said, ""Janine, just tell him that you're not an introvert, you're just introspective."" That became my motto in life. I said it often, mostly because I felt those were big words and others would think I was smart. I never thought about it much later in life until I read this book. Cain talks about the virtues of being an introvert but how society has come to prize the personality traits of the extrovert. Being a pretty extreme extrovert, at first, I didn't think this book was for me. But then I thought back to when I was eight, and realized with shock and I wasn't just a person who could be both, although I was, I am, but I went from one extreme to the other. When I was a child, I was the most introverted person I know. Using the word shy to describe me didn't cut it. I would skip class altogether if I was even a minute late, to avoid the fear of having to walk into the classroom with everyone looking at me. Speeches had me thinking thoughts of jumping out of trees just to break a bone so I could get out of giving the speech. Now, I love nothing better than walking into a room full of strange people. It's just a room full of fifty new friends! And talking in front of people? I have to hold myself back in group exercises just so I don't hog the limelight. How did such a huge change occur? I'll tell you how, because of work, school, and problems socially, I was forced into it. As I began to read this book, I saw a lot of truth in what Cain was saying. Extroverts really are prized now, not just socially but in the workplace as well. At the last company I worked for, I sat in cubicles, was encouraged constantly to hold meetings and ""group think"" up ideas. How different it would have been if I was allowed even one hour a day without interruptions! What has made us so concerned with having these qualities? I am homeschooling my children and every time I come across someone who disapproves it's always because of lack of ""socialization"". My five-year-old son has no trouble talking to anyone and being friendly, I think he gets it from me. But he also loves to play by himself. He might get this from me as well! He creates his best Lego creations when left alone for hours at a time. Why is this a bad thing? As Cain points out, some of the best innovators of our time were quiet thinkers. And we might not have had some of those great inventions or works of art had these people been forced to ""socialize"" as children instead of left alone. And really, what is the big deal with needing socialization being such a big part of schooling? Why can't it be found outside of school? I recently watched a documentary about the current school systems and, as most people know, we (The United States), rank very low in all areas of education. In fact, when American children were tested in various areas against other countries of the world, we consistently ranked on the bottom in almost all areas except one. Can you guess what it is? Self-confidence. American children are said to have the highest self-confidence compared to all other countries. How do we explain this to our children? We're idiots but we have pride! Is this because we're placing such importance on making our children extroverts? Some of the case studies Cain uses to show examples of her theories kept me riveted. She also had a twenty question test in case you weren't sure where you stood. The more traits she gave as examples of introverts and extroverts, the less sure I became of which I was. Ask anyone which I was as a child, they would have said introvert, hands down. Ask anyone I know right now, and in a second they'd say extrovert. So I took her test to see where I stood. I thought I was only doubting myself, and that it would show pretty conclusively that I was an extrovert. But in fact, I was split almost exactly down the middle. I love meeting new people, and often feel energized at the end of a big party. But I also get rejuvinated from having alone time every day. Even back in college, when I was one of the most social people around, my roomates all knew that they risked certain death if they bothered me during my ""break time"". I have no problems going to movies alone, and one of my favorite things to do is go out to lunch or dinner at a nice restaurant with a good book as a dinner companion. People look at me weird, but I could care less. Whenever I go out or have a party my motto is always ""The more the merrier"". So where did I stand on this chart? The advice for public speaking for introverts wasn't going to help me. And to say I should have quit reading the book halfway through because I considered myself an extrovert would have had me missing out on some very interesting information. I really enjoyed this book. And I disagree that this book is only for introverts. I think the biggest benefit this book had for me is the eye opener to how we have been pressured to become more extroverted over the years and how we see this change everywhere, from schools, to the workplace, to advertising, to even moralistic behavior. I think all can benefit from having a greater awareness of this personality trait in everyone they know. If you're an extrovert, wouldn't it benefit you from having a better understanding to where your introverted team leader is coming from? And another realization for me, is how I know see my son, who has the tendency to play alone. I now am more aware of how I treat him, and make sure I no longer fall into that stereotypical reaction of ""Why don't you try harder to make friends?"" routine. There's nothing wrong with being an introvert, and if this book has any major theme, that's it. That being said, even though I very much enjoyed this book, I only gave it three stars for a couple of reasons. First of all, I feel like the middle of the road people such as myself were somewhat ignored. Where do we stand? How do we relate better to people and situations? Then there were the case studies. As I mentioned earlier, they were very interesting and really helped in relating to the particular example's Cain discussed. But after a while, they became tedious, and didn't hold my attention as well as the first half of the book. I still think many can benefit from reading this though. It was fun, and I look forward to discussing it with my book club.  ClassicsDefined.com"
288,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,5,"I never really thought of myself as introverted until relatively recently, within the last year or so, when I declined an invitation to go out with a group of friends to the bar and one of them said ""Fine, be introverted then! Hope you enjoy sitting home alone with your cats!"" (She meant it in a teasing, only partially bitchy way, but I didn't take offense. I DO enjoy sitting home alone with my cats.)My semi-bitchy friend actually helped me define a big part of myself. Until then, I just thought of myself as ""the most anti-social Libra ever"", and poked fun at myself for not wanting to go out all the time, or being overwhelmed by loud, boisterous people, or needing time to just be alone - what my boyfriend calls ""cave-dwelling"". I made these things a joke because, according to society, it's not normal to want to spend so much time alone. I'm supposed to be a fun, out-going social butterfly. The thought exhausts me. So, when I read this, it was like someone opened up my head and singled out these aspects of my personality and then wrote them down. It was fascinating to read this book and learn about myself. I see things about my past in a completely new light. Like the situation above. I'd be more than happy to sit at home with a few friends and drink, but going to a bar to drink among a huge crowd just held no appeal. Or like how I approach my work. The sections of this book pertaining to corporate expectations and office structure were fascinating to me, and really allowed me to look at my job and approach to work differently. I'm a good employee and good at my job, but I don't aspire to be in the limelight. I don't MIND recognition or attention for a job well done, but it's not something I seek out. So, when I was recently offered a job with a new company, I had my choice of being in a ""client liaison"" position or a ""analysis and testing"" position, and I took the latter, even though it's a position with less recognition and lower pay. The thought of having to constantly be professionally social with strangers gives me anxiety, though, so it was a no-brainer for me. But when I discussed my decision with friends, they called me crazy to have turned down the higher paying position. As though money is the only criteria worth considering. (A point that this book makes well.)I'm going to miss the job I'm leaving though, because it did give me a kind of structured socialization. I get along great with my team, and there, I'm far more socially outgoing than I would be otherwise. I've worked with many of these people for several years, I trust and respect them, and they are people I consider real friends. Soon I'll be working 100% from home, so my social interaction will be drastically reduced. I may be introverted, but I do need that interaction. The hard part for me will be actually initiating it. I have a tendency to, uhh, forget to be social. I forget to call and text people, even though I mean to do it. But being social is just never at the forefront of my mind. I'll have to work on that. But then there's online communities, which is a completely different world. I have always been more open and (dare I say it?) chatty online than in my ""real life"" social interactions. Maybe it's the anonymity, or the fact that it's text-based, or the fact that the community I'm in here is one that is full of like-minded people with similar interests. People I can relate and talk to easily. I don't know, but I'm quite different online than off. Offline, I don't really do chit-chat, or small talk, and I'm often at a loss as to what I should say in a light social situation, despite there being 10 dozen possibilities running through my mind. I usually settle for silence, though, because by the time I've thought through a plethora of ""Nice weather"" or ""Your hair looks nice"" nothing comments, it's been an awkwardly long time, and I know it, and anything that I say at that point would just sound forced and fake, so I just... don't. That feeling that I just mentioned, about feeling forced and fake, is such a strong one for me that it sometimes overwhelms me when I really don't want it to, and it often feels to me like I come across as being cold and unfeeling when I really just don't know what to say to show how affected I really am. It was only when the book started talking about being 'sensitive' that it started to click. I've always been overly affected by emotionally charged situations. If you read some of my reviews of tear-jerker books, I mention this frequently. I remember when I was a kid, there was a show called Rescue 911 that my mom liked to watch. It was always some traumatic situation - a car wreck or an injured hiker or a woman trapped in a housefire, etc, and the show focused on the EMTs and firefighters and police called out to help. That show would always make me cry. Always. Every single episode. It didn't matter whether the people made it out OK, or if they all died, I would be in tears. I could just imagine how scary it would be and I had such respect for the kind of people who could deal with that kind of trauma every day and keep it together enough to help. It would all just overwhelm me, and I would cry. My point here, and how this relates to my last paragraph, is that my dad would often poke fun at me for getting upset over the show, and so I learned to hide that I was upset... oftentimes laughing to cover it. Laughing. As I got older into my teens, I just stopped showing that sensitivity in front of others at all, and unfortunately, that's carried over into my adult life. So now, when I feel strong emotions, it's easier for me to let them out when I'm alone, even though it makes me seem heartless to not show them when it's appropriate. Like at my grandma's funeral earlier this year, when my entire extended family was crying and talking and interacting, and I was stoically sitting in the pew, just thinking about her and how much I'll miss her. After the service, when I was alone, I completely lost my shit. I loved that woman, dammit. She was awesome.Anyway, if you're still reading, sorry for the overshare. What I'm getting at is that I loved how this book made me feel normal. It's well-researched, well-written, and engaging, and I'm incredibly glad that I read it. I think that it will... maybe not CHANGE my life, so much as improve it. I now know more about why I do certain things, and that's empowering. I can relate better to my boyfriend (an extrovert), and in my new job, and in social situations. And I can try to work on the things that I now recognize hinder me more than help me. Definitely a fascinating read. Highly recommended. "
289,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,5,"So...Just read Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, (2012) by Susan Cain, Crown Publishers.I liked this book, and why not -- an in-depth defense of people like me! Although I confess, I never thought that introverts would need to be explained to extroverts. I thought we were self-evident, and it was the other, noisy, dominant half of the world that was inexplicable. (They still are.) It possibly needs a companion volume -- Noisy: the hegemony of people with nothing helpful to say who still won't shut up, or something. (Cue reality TV, talk radio, and horrible crush parties with loud music, where you couldn't hear anyone even if they were interesting.) Anyway.This made a curious juxtaposition with my last-read book Fossil Horses. MacFadden, a scientist, argued like a scientist; Cain, a lawyer, argues like a lawyer. I discern the differences even as I appreciate the advocacy. Cain develops her case through illustrative anecdotes, and references to science, psychology, and history as needed. Very readable. I confess, I hadn't thought of extroversion as the American cultural ideal, even as I have witnessed plenty of the cited behaviors. My world tends to be divided practically into ""people who read"" and ""everybody else"", which cuts unevenly across the extrovert/introvert divide, with the obvious bias.I sort of want to go out and press this book upon ""everybody else"", but one sees the inherent problem with that. I hope its message can cut through the noise somehow, nonetheless.Recommended.Ta, L."

Basically already that is more than enough to recommend it.If you consider yourself an introvert and doubt your own worth in comparison with more outgoing or established people, this is for you.If you are in any way interested in the introvert - extrovert spectrum, this will give you some very good understanding.

"
292,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,5,"I feel sure Quiet will become the benchmark book on the topic of introversion. This is because it not only thoroughly explains introversion but champions it. It’s a book by an introvert for introverts, to help them understand themselves and feel proud of who they are. It’s also a book for extroverts, but especially those extroverts who are convinced that introversion is a flaw. Cain will have them wishing they were introverts. Quiet is inarguably biased in favor of introversion, but that’s the point. Up to one-half of Americans are introverted. It’s absurd that introversion is scoffed at as much as it is. The time has come for the introverted label to be a compliment rather than a criticism. This book is a leap in that direction.Cain covered many facets of introversion, from the intriguing “highly sensitive” subset (which describes about 20% of all introverts) to differences in the Eastern and Western worlds to the introverted child (specifically in the classroom, which favors extroverts). Also explored is the age-old question of nature versus nurture and brain differences between extroverts and introverts--plus more. I greatly enjoyed the Eastern versus Western section. America, and the Western world in general, has what Cain dubs an “Extrovert Ideal.” The opposite is true in the East. Whereas in the West, introversion is viewed as a weakness to be conquered, in the East, it’s considered a strength; extroversion is frowned upon, viewed as something that must be tamed. The general sentiment is that extroverts are overwhelming people, wasting others’ time with empty chatter. It’s in this section that Cain profiled Don Chen, an Asian-American student studying at Harvard business school, a very extroverted place. He’s the embodiment of introversion and must feign extroversion daily to get through his classes and general life as part of the school. Feigning extroversion is draining, and Chen needs solitude every day to recharge. This is how it is for all introverts, and Cain stressed repeatedly that it’s not a defect, just a difference. Chen has an intimate group of friends (entirely Asian-American save for one introverted white American man). He’s keenly aware of the differences between his little group and his extroverted classmates. He notes how frequently the extroverts participate in classes while he rarely does and how boisterous they are when together in the cafeteria. Though he admires some of their qualities, he mostly doesn’t understand them. In his mind, they disrespectfully waste classmates’ and professors’ time with their talk, failing to get to the point quickly. If this section sounds borderline racist, it isn’t. Rather, it recognizes that different cultures value different qualities and is a powerful example of introversion as a desirable trait. Chen’s story is one of many in this enlightening book. To support all points, Cain profiled real people, some living, some dead (such as Rosa Parks and Dale Carnegie). The (carefully indexed) research is fascinating in itself, but the real-life examples supporting her research are vital. They round out Quiet to push it beyond dry textbook. I’d read a lot about introversion before reading Quiet, and I bypassed this book for years because others said it offers nothing new on the topic. Readers who’ve read numerous books on the topic or have researched the topic extensively may feel this way. I didn’t. In each chapter, I learned--and was utterly engrossed. Introverts will find Quiet relatable and affirming. Extroverts will find Quiet demystifies introverts thoroughly and will appreciate them more. Both will find it extremely illuminating."

I could sing its respective praises for days. The fact of the matter is - this book really hit me at the heart of my core for so many measures in my life as an introvert. I find it hard to expound just how much this book had an impact on me personally.I could tell you about many things about my person that embody me as an introvert. That I'm quiet spoken and don't speak unless I have something important to say. That small talk isn't something I'm comfortable that I'm not fond of confrontations (though many of you have read my extended written rants about various matters of controversy with very little hesitation). That I tend to spend time alone to recharge my batteries even when I'm called to do things in any scale of extroversion. That my emotional intelligence is very high and I can sympathize/emphathize with people for matters of their experience (though this also makes me highly sensitive).For most of my life, I've been told that these very natural matters of my disposition were wrong. And goodness forbid did that make my life complicated because I didn't feel like people understood who I was. I was even led to believe that I was actually shy, not introverted (many people confuse the two, there is a difference.) Yet the more I learned about the dynamic of introversion and extroversion and how they functioned, I realized that the fundamental difference between them were the derived sources of energy that one functions with in day to day living. That there's nothing wrong with being introverted versus extroverted in a society that - in mainstream notations, champions the latter.This book had me thinking for days after I finished it.I liked that Cain's narrative focuses on the positive contributions and the inherent strengths that lie in introversion because it's widely stereotyped. That stereotyping actually harms our society more than we ourselves may realize in the daily grind, not just individually. By trying to mold people into one acceptable standard, we often lose out on what unique strengths and contributions one may have from going away from such a standard. Narratives like ""Quiet"" have relevance not just in recognizing the distinct psychological functions and differences we have as individuals, but also in the relationships and contributions we have in our professions, our activities, and even wider perceptions of our society in general.I appreciated the expansion on famous figures like Rosa Parks in terms of her backstory and identity as an introvert and how that shaped her responses (I'll have to pick up ""Quiet Strength"" at some point). I also appreciated hearing Cain's own struggles with coming to terms with her introversion, and even the story of the Harvard Business student. There are so many individual stories in this narrative and Cain gives a thorough examination of the details within. It's amazing just how much work and thought went into expounding these issues and individual narratives. This narrative examines introversion not only as a social construct, but individual - delving into narratives of biological, psychological, and sociological importance. There's an examination on the level of intorversion among different cultures, how introspection is valuable to creativity versus ""groupthink"", how extroversion and introversion are not mutually exclusive (and situations that call for each). I came out of it all with not only a fresh perspective on how valuable introverts are to the fabric of society, but also a greater sense of self-worth for my own traits. And that's something to be thankful for. My hope is that with more people who pick up ""Quiet"" and realize how important our individual attributes are, that it'll provide for more opportunities to be creative and to value each other in our relationships regardless of differences, for our unique strengths regardless of how their expressed or from where they come.Overall score: 5/5 stars"

My credentials include cheerfully working from home, getting overstimulated in quiet libraries, and keeping in touch with my closest friends almost entirely by snail mail. I have been known to feel oversocialised sitting in a darkened room, listening to people two rooms away watch a film.As far as a lot of media is concerned, I may as well be a pet hamster. ""Care for your introvert."" Try not to interrupt them. Don't go in their nest while they're sleeping. Offer them a way out when you're at a party, in case they run out of carrot sticks and want to go home. I may as well also be a complete rarity: a third of people don't get hissy when you take their carrot sticks away; come the fuck on.So, what I liked about Quiet was that it didn't make me feel like a special snowflake or someone's hamster.But also... the section on introversion in leadership and the workplace has actually boosted my confidence a lot (apart from being really interesting). I've worked for a few people, and the times it's worked best have been the times where they give me a broad, bullet-pointed list of what they want to have happened by what time, and then they go away until that time. The best boss I ever had used to say it was a good day if we never spoke to each other except when one of us brought the other coffee - and I was inclined to agree with him. Faced with common-sense-logic, which seems to say that 5000 feedback sessions and an open-plan office with communal ball-pit are what millennials are looking for, I wanted this narrative. It was useful to hear. Maybe it's less useful if you're the sort of person who's been reading this sort of thing for years. For me, it was a helpful reminder.I remember a little interesting neurological detail, but not a lot - I can get more than that keyword-searching the Scientific American website, if I want to - and a fair bit of interesting historical anecdote. I remember coming away with a renewed respect for anyone who parents, especially by themselves, as well as a sense of purpose about working for myself and by myself - which I'm happy to say I'm now doing. It turns out, a lot of the time, that people who contract you for work over the internet don't really give a shit about your sparkling and gracious personality. They just want to know you're conscientious and you know what you're talking about and you'll do things when you say you will. I vaguely credit Susan Cain with giving me the impetus to go and do what I want to do, and not to feel like I have to be constantly nice to people I don't know. Now I just think, it's okay, I have character, and then put my headphones back in."
296,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5524572-kristin-hackett-superspacechick,4,"As a self proclaimed introvert, I've been meaning to read this book for so long. My sister in law gave me a copy for Christmas so I prioritized it as a January read and I'm so glad I did. I really enjoyed the in depth look at what constitutes an introvert vs. an extrovert. Quiet even redefined the meaning of the word sensitive for me. I've never considered myself sensitive before but to pull a quote, ""highly sensitive people tend to be keen observers who look before they leap. They arrange their lives in ways that limit surprises. They’re often sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, pain, coffee... Highly sensitive people also process information about their environments—both physical and emotional—unusually deeply. They tend to notice subtleties that others miss—another person’s shift in mood, say, or a lightbulb burning a touch too brightly.""- this is 100% spot on for me. While I do agree with a lot of what Susan Cain wrote, I do think it's difficult to classify people into only one of two categories. She did stress that just because someone is an introvert, it doesn't mean that 1) they got there the same way as someone else or 2) that both people will have exactly the same traits. There are still variables to consider. Overall, I loved that Quiet is a celebrated look at introversion and the strengths that those with introverted qualities possess. There were a few anecdotes that weren't the most interesting (or relevant like the chapter on raising children), but I still found value in reading them. "
297,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,5,"I am an introvert and proud of it and so is the author and she believes there is strength in quietness and I think she is right. She has helped me understand myself more and I am glad of that. Introverts don't like novelty and the first day of school is usually traumatic as mine was. As children, introverts like to daydream, play inside and their feelings are easily hurt. ""They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive. . ."" They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy and fear."" They "". . . tend to speak softly because that's how they prefer others to communicate with them.""Shy people hate confrontations and will avoid them at all costs and the author believes it is better so. ""Scores of studies have shown that venting doesn't sooth anger; it fuels it.""This is a great book for people who have always felt that their shyness makes them less worthy than the more gregarious in the world."
298,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,2,"Why is it that the “ideal” person is extroverted? That we pride social skills and being outgoing? All while a deeply gifted thinker who prefers to be in his/her head is described as lacking these traits. Looking at it from an evolutionary standpoint, there is a reason why introverts exist, so why do we rate it as second best? Being a true-blue introvert, I turned to Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a world that can’t stop talking” to answer these questions (and maybe propose new ones). Susan Cain divides “Quiet” into four main sections with the first focusing on the history and description of the rise of extroverts, the differences in leadership styles of introverts and extroverts, and the myths surrounding them. This section begins “Quiet” with a slow and unmemorable beginning. Cain focuses more of an effort on real-life case studies versus actual scientific studies, bypassing any professional data or even her own opinions. The studies which are mentioned are not “earth-shattering” in depth nor do they truly correlate to her hypothesis. In fact, much of the hypothesis is lost and the flow is not seamless or clear. On one hand, this makes the reading understandable and accessible for the less scientifically-inclined reader, but to others craving more research; Cain leaves something to be desired. Some of Cain’s examples which could be perceived as “witty” (Craig Newark of Craigslist fame, Dr. Suess, and Moses from the Bible) are underdeveloped and also lose connection with the hypothesis. Cain is often abrupt and cuts herself short. Furthermore, many of the chapters begin in the same exact way (both format and creativity) which is tedious and creates a loss of interest. The second section of “Quiet” describes some of the brain and neurological aspects of introverts featuring more science than the first section. Cain’s work is a bit more compelling in this respect and certainly more interesting. However, it still isn’t clear what she is trying to prove as she mostly just describes how introverts “are”. Plus, most of the findings are self-explanatory and even obvious. Again, the reader will not be blown away. I have read MANY “brain books” (psychology/neurology, science, and biology) and generally, I am left both flabbergasted and repeating information I’ve read to anyone who will listen. This was not the case with “Quiet” as only a small dose of information felt standout. As the second portion progresses, Cain does present tests and experimentation results more confidentially (however, there is a lack of elaboration). The third section of “Quiet” is comparatively shorter, as Cain explains the conformities and values of the Asian cultures while in the fourth section, Cain offers tips and lifestyle adaptations for introverts in various areas such as work, romance, parenting, play, etc. At this point, “Quiet” appears to be more of a self-help book. The latter end of the book is overly focused on parenting and schooling of children causing me to feel alienated and distanced (having no children). Furthermore, the “Conclusion” is weak and sums up the book which actually reinforces how few points are made. Simply, “Quiet"" is not what I expected. Instead of explaining “why” introverts are the way they are; Cain described “how” they are with an absence of data I would have preferred. All in all though, it has been confirmed (which I already knew) that I am indeed an introvert."
299,0307352145,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"A lance is broken for the needs of introverted people Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Whether one opposes the sanguine with the phlegmatic nature, the wild daredevil the thoughtful inventor or merely the introversion the extroversion, the temperament is and remains in specific proportions decisive for a human being. The author has re-examined this fact with an unconventional approach, opening up exciting and critical viewing angles. Times are changing. In the 19th century, it was still commonplace to be modest, humble and unobtrusive. Starting from the advertising industry in the 1920s and 1930s, it continued to run to the idealistic goal of total superficiality. Ads began to play with people's fear of the negative connotations of ominous, alien observers, and the appearance and ability to attract more and more attention. The new religion of narcissism was supported by an entrepreneurial mentality that understood handshaking qualities, dazzling rhetoric, and slick eloquence as signs of business qualification.Thus, when the loudest and most risk-taking specimens of the managerial species, elite colleges that encourage elbow mentality-driven, superficial behavior, occupy key positions, one or the other financial market collapse is no longer surprising. The flowers of this development on the example of today's America could seem bizarre if the consequences were not so serious. Thus, adjectives such as shy and quiet or just hints of a sly-boy mentality are dismissed as entirely negative and peculiar. Whether in school, work or private life, who does not understand playing on the highly sophisticated keyboard of interpersonal communication, quickly falls through the typical rust. Sensitive children, even as babies, are prone to intensified reactions to external stimuli, are more empathetic and need seeming timidity as a protective mechanism against a formally overwhelming universe. At the same time, individuals naturally endowed with a more robust psychic scaffolding sound lighthearted, but also more emotionless, to their surroundings.Parents of quieter, a manageable circle of friends their naming and lonely hobbies devoted children are remembered, not only subtle, the importance of popularity and dazzling charm. However, very peculiar that silent children are put under depression or misanthropic suspicion, while too vital, joyful young people are sedated with Ritalin. If the favors of loneliness have been well into adulthood, there is a wide range of seminars that can enhance eloquence, demeanor, and be talking skills to the point of sales genius. Several relationship problems are likely based on the well measurable differences between different natures, even by MRI. While extroverts can bathe in crowds every awaken minute and shy away from loneliness, the relationship is reversed by introverts. This involves interpersonal explosives in itself when the mantra of the attractive opposites once no longer pulls, and the supposed truce of the relationship beginning is over. Additional spontaneous emotional responses provoke the fact that extroverts interpret specific aggressive behavior as interest and attention while introverts feel injured and attacked. Assessing the damage caused to the economy by incorrectly designing work processes and their surroundings is difficult or even impossible. If one adds the increased disinclination of introverts in a loud open-plan atmosphere, including the wasted potential, because gifted thinkers find no peace to work out ideas and concepts undisturbed, the overall economic damage can be immense. The cultural differences show a contrarian approach of the Asians, where a European-American behavior style is considered a stupid waste of time for listeners. Tranquility and contemplation have a different meaning, superficiality and the glorification of narcissistic principles are considered less desirable. Another, quite thoughtful approach.Eine Lanze gebrochen für die Bedürfnisse der introvertierten MenschenansammlungsvermeiderOb man dem sanguinischen das phlegmatische Naturell entgegenstellt, dem wilden Draufgänger den nachdenklichen Tüftler oder schlicht der Introvertiertheit die Extrovertiertheit, das Temperament ist und bleibt zu bestimmten Anteilen maßgebend für einen Menschen. Die Autorin hat diesen Umstand mit einer unkonventionellen Herangehensweise neu beleuchtet und damit interessante und kritische Betrachtungswinkel eröffnet.So ändern sich die Zeiten. War es im 19 Jahrhundert noch gang und gäbe, bescheiden, demütig und unaufdringlich zu sein, begann, ausgehend von der Werbeindustrie, in den 1920er und 1930er Jahren, ein bis heute andauernder Lauf auf das ideelle Ziel der totalen Oberflächlichkeit. Anzeigen begannen mit der Angst der Menschen vor negativen Assoziationen ominöser, fremder Beobachter zu spielen und das Äußere sowie die Fähigkeit zu gefallen, immer mehr ins Rampenlicht zu rücken. Unterstützung fand die neue Religion des Narzissmus von einer Unternehmermentalität, die Handschlagqualitäten, blendende Rhetorik und aalglatte Eloquenz als Zeichen betriebswirtschaftlicher Qualifikation auffasste. Wenn auf diese Weise immer die lautesten und risikofreudigsten Exemplare der Managerspezies, von zu ellbogenmentalitätsgesteuerten, oberflächlichen Verhalten animierenden Elitehochschulen, Schlüsselpositionen besetzen, verwundert der eine oder andere Finanzmarktkollaps gar nicht mehr.Die Blüten dieser Entwicklung am Beispiel des heutigen Amerikas könnten skurril anmuten, wären die daraus resultierenden Konsequenzen nicht derart gravierend. So werden Adjektive wie schüchtern und ruhig oder nur Andeutungen einer Eigenbrötlermentalität als durchwegs negativ und absonderlich abgetan. Sei es in Schule, Beruf oder Privatleben, wer nicht versteht auf der hochkomplexen Klaviatur zwischenmenschlicher Kommunikation zu spielen, fällt leicht einmal durch den sozialen Rost.Sensible Kinder neigen schon als Babys zu verstärkten Reaktionen auf äußere Reize, sind einfühlsamer und benötigen die scheinbare Furchtsamkeit als Schutzmechanismus gegen ein sie mit Eindrücken förmlich erschlagendes Universum. Gleichzeitig wirken von Natur aus mit einem robusteren psychischen Gerüst ausgestattete Individuen unbeschwerter, aber auch emotionsloser auf ihre Umgebung. Eltern ruhiger, einen überschaubaren Freundeskreis ihr Eigen nennender und sich einsamen Hobbies widmender Kinder werden, nicht nur durch die Blume, an die Wichtigkeit von Beliebtheit und blendendem Charme erinnert. Doch sehr eigentümlich, dass stille Kinder unter Depressions- oder Misanthropiegeneralverdacht gestellt werden, während allzu vitale, lebensfrohe junge Menschen mit Ritalin sediert werden.Sollte sich die Favorisierung der Einsamkeit bis ins Erwachsenenalter durchgeschlagen haben, gibt es eine breite Palette an Seminarangeboten, die Beredsamkeit, Auftreten und Plauschkompetenzen bis hin zum Verkaufsgenie steigern können. Etliche Beziehungsprobleme dürften auf den, auch per MRT gut messbaren Unterschieden zwischen verschiedenen Naturellen basieren. Während Extrovertierte jede wache Minute in Menschenmengen baden könnten und Einsamkeit scheuen, kehrt sich das Verhältnis bei Introvertierten um. Das birgt zwischenmenschlichen Sprengstoff in sich, wenn das Mantra von den sich anziehenden Gegensätzen einmal nicht mehr richtig zieht und der vermeintliche Waffenstillstand des Beziehungsbeginns vorüber ist. Zusätzliche spontane emotionale Reaktionen provoziert die Tatsache, dass Extrovertierte bestimmtes, aggressives Verhalten als Interesse und Aufmerksamkeit interpretieren, während Introvertierte sich verletzt und angegriffen fühlen.Den für die Wirtschaft entstandenen Schaden durch falsche Konzeption von Arbeitsabläufen samt deren Umgebungen einzuschätzen mutet schwer bis unmöglich an. Wenn man die verstärkte Krankheitsneigung Introvertierter in lauter Großraumbüroatmosphäre inklusive dem verschwendeten Potential, weil begnadete Denker keine Ruhe finden, um Ideen und Konzepte ungestört ausarbeiten zu können, addiert, dürfte der gesamtvolkswirtschaftliche Schaden immens sein.Die kulturellen Unterschiede zeigen eine konträre Herangehensweise der Asiaten, bei denen ein europäisch-amerikanisches Gebaren als unhöfliche Verschwendung der Zeit von Zuhörern gewertet wird. Ruhe und Kontemplation haben eine andere Bedeutung, Oberflächlichkeit und die Verherrlichung narzisstischer Prinzipien gelten als wenig erstrebenswert. Ein anderer, durchaus in Erwägung zu ziehender Ansatz."
