0,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,4,"Finished. Very long review. Apologies. Skip to paragraph 3 ** for a horror story. The book was hard to rate. Some of it is as bad as a 1-star: excreble writing when he's giving far too much detail about the irrelevant (to the book) discoveries of the 18thC scientist Henry Cavendish whom he confidently diagnoses as Aspergers. 3 stars for most of it where the research is general too narrowly focused on too few people but quite in depth for them and 5 stars for giving away such appalling things as the typo in DSM III.People forget that DSM is a for-profit company. It made $10M on DSM III. It had 25 committees of people searching for evidence of at least 25 different symptoms of autism. They were well paid as professionals. They consulted all kinds of people from teachers to those therapists qualified by attendance at a day's seminar in some hotel ballroom. In other words, everyone involved had a pecuniary interest in diagnosing autism in as broad a way as possible. ** But to the terrible typo. For those who might be autistic or have aspergers or might not but definitely seemed to have something, there was always PDD-NOS. The intention was that children being diagnosed would have a certain number of symptoms from list A, from list B and list C. However, instead of 'and' the word 'or' was substituted. The author reckons that 75% of all children diagnosed with PDD-NOS didn't in fact have anything.Hans Asperger said, a long time ago and his words have been nearly forgotten, trampled on and now totally ignored, not to pathologise eccentricities! Just because someone is weird doesn't make them mental! Forget that, they're all on the spectrum now.I was going to write a long and well-argued (hopefully) review of the book and of own my own opinion that Aspergers and Autism are not related at all. But I'll keep that for another time and stick to reviewing the book (view spoiler)[in as much as I ever stick to the point (hide spoiler)]. I do think that a lot of children so diagnosed don't have autism at all and grow out of it (or according to many therapists are 'cured') in much the same way that 90% or more of the kiddies put on Ritalin turned out to be normal adults. The incidence of ADHD in America in children is higher than anywhere else in the world. But the figures for adults are more or less the same in all the countries of the West.By all evidence that I've seen and read, Aspergers is most often just a personality type, that is unless you want to diagnose almost the entirety of Silicon Valley and perhaps computer people in general with having it. Would we even be so advanced in electronics without these people? In any case, quite a few of the 'symptoms' of Aspergers are common to Prosopagnosia or face-blindness (I have it so I know) which is only just being recognised and most people with it just think they are bad at remembering people, but there is more to it than that.If a child has hobbies he is really into, he's encouraged and parents' say things like, 'the way he's always taking apart things, you could see he's going to be an engineer'. If a child would rather just play with one good friend, then that friend gets invited over more for tea and parents' say he's a bit of a loner. If the child is really good at maths, parents praise him. But once he has a diagnosis of autism, suddenly he's not got a hobby he's mad keen on, no that's perseveration, his kind of sociability is now inability to communicate, his ability with maths is an unhealthy autistic obsession. And so it goes... It's a self-fulfilling diagnosis.So overall, it's quite a good book on the history of the diagnosis of Austism and relatively recently, Aspergers. But it isn't really about Neurotribes at all. A final thought. If we stopped thinking of neurotypical people as normal but thought of them as the most common personality type, or the most usual, then those who were different would not be abnormal, but unusual, rare or even, as say A+ is in the world of blood groups, just uncommon. There would still be those who were definitely abnormal, Autism wouldn't go away, but people who are different wouldn't be labelled and if there were enough of them in each group, might get special ed. As in - a group of nerdy loners that don't like playing games in the playground, could be taught together in their favourite academic subjects and everyone would be a winner. Teachers, children and society. In any case it's better than making them depressed and feeling bad about not fitting in by labelling them abnormal.Notes on reading the book(view spoiler)[ Even though the author was intent on including own evidence to support that, there were enough signs when hUpdate It's getting better. I'm on to Vienna and Asperger. The problem I have with the book is I think Aspergers is a) misdiagnosed most of the time and b) it isn't related to Autism at all and all I'm reading is the conventional viewpoint and absolute disdain for unconventional therapies which I more or less share. The author writes well but it does seem to be confirmation bias all the way through. He has an agenda and includes only that which fits into it.An interesting point. Firstly that Sweden removed the mercury preservative from it's vaccines back in 1987 and Japan banned the MMR altogether. Their rate of autism is on a par with other countries using the same diagnostic criteria, it hasn't dropped. The vaccine thing was proved to be a hoax and Wakefield a charlatan. He was actually employed to prove that the vaccine caused damage and had produced his own vaccine to sell in place of the 'damaging' one, but still the myths linger on. Is it because autism is generally diagnosed at age 2, past the age of vaccines, and the parents must have someone or something to blame?______________This started off well and then meandered into a very long biography of the very famous and quite asocial 18thC scientist Henry Cavendish The detail with which the author went into some of Cavendish's experiments was not only irrelevant but boring, which is worse in a book. I understand that Silberman was trying to prove historically that Cavendish had Asperger's Syndrome, but all it proved to me was the author's confirmation bias. Everything that could point that way was to be included and anything that didn't dismissed. An example: Cavendish was supposed to not like women at all, not want to deal with maids even, let alone get married. But then the author mentions as an aside he was very friendly with Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire. I was happier when he got back to modern times and living people.  (hide spoiler)]"
1,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,5,"First of all, I thought that this book really needed a timeline in addition to its thorough notes and index, so I spent an afternoon going through the book making one myself. Command or Shift click here to read it in a new tab. (Commenting permission is open on it if you find any mistakes.)Quick story from when I worked at Google: James Watson, the co-discoverer of DNA, was speaking at a Google event. He talked about a wide variety of topics on genetics, and I remember he lumped in autism and Aspergers with some other genetic disorders.At the Q&A period after his talk, several developers took the microphone, identified themselves as having Aspergers, and gave him an earful about how they were glad that they had Aspergers because it made them better developers, gave them a unique perspective on life, and that they really didn’t appreciate him looking for a cure thank you very much.My reactions were 1. C’mon guys, this is the co-discoverer of DNA. Show some respect. 2. Wow, I guess the stereotype is true.Eight years later, my views on autism are somewhat more nuanced. And in the meantime Dr. Watson has had to auction off his Nobel prize to supplement lost income after some very unfortunate comments about the people of Africa.Neurotribes is a very important book, albeit a thick one. Don’t let the 500 pages plus notes and index scare you. It is extremely readable, and I finished it in less than a week. I don’t know if it will become the “it” book of popular science this fall, but it certainly deserves to.That there are so many controversies swirling around autism, diagnosing it, what causes it, whether we should focus on what causes it, etc., and that there is a bunch of stigma in general around autism, is why this book is so needed.And it is very even handed, almost frustratingly so. I saw one reviewer who was very upset that Jenny McCarthy was mentioned without being immediately condemned. And she wanted Jim Carrey condemned too for good measure.Look lady, I understand your frustration with anti-vaxxers, but I’m not wading through a 500-page polemic on any topic. And I’m willing to bet that if Mr. Silberman went after the supplement cure guys similarly, you would have been offended in a different way. (Like I said, controversies abound.)Instead, Mr. Silberman patiently moves through the history of autism, starting in Vienna (Asperger), moving to Baltimore (Kanner), then Southern California (Rimland and Lovaas), then over to England (Lorna Wing). The pieces start to fit together. You start to get something more valuable than the satisfaction of having the other side condemned: historical context.So if someone tells you that there is an epidemic of autism, you can point them to this book or Mr. Silberman’s TED talk. Or you can just net it out for them like this: To help kids get services they needed, diagnostic criteria was widened. At the same time standardized diagnostic tools became available for the first time. As these changes filtered through the psychiatric community, the number of diagnoses increased. As far as can be determined, the number of autistic people — kids and adults — has remained fairly constant.And if someone tells you that vaccines cause autism, point them to this book or TED talk too. Optionally box their ears. That part is up to you.Actually, I reluctantly take back the ear boxing because with the benefit of historical context, and after seeing just how twisted and jacked up the history of autism is, it’s easy to sympathize with parents in the absence of any leadership or even coherent guidance from the medical establishment. Who can blame them for trying to take matters in to their own hands? (I was prescribed Vioxx after Merck knew about the risks, so I’m no pal of Big Pharma either.)Unfortunately, rigorous adherence to statistical tests and being a concerned parent dealing with an n of 1 are pretty much mutually exclusive. Combine that with the Baby Boomer’s reflexive distrust of authority, and things like the anti-vax movement and autism clusters seem almost inevitable. (Though it’s clear from this book that the roots of the anti-vax movement go back almost two decades before Wakefield’s notorious paper.)Mr. Silberman wisely shows this effect in action with a highly educated Bay Area couple that go through several stages on their journey in raising their autistic son with various stops including being against vaccines, megadoses of multivitamins, ABA therapy, and even considering intravenous chelation. I get it now. Walk a mile in their shoes before you judge, or Jenny McCarthy’s, dangerous though she may be.It’s much harder to be sympathetic to the medical establishment, especially the Freudians, whose insights always sound like the worst writer in an a short story workshop. But it’s the Behaviorists who win the One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest prize hands down. Dante’s pope-feet burning-thingie is awaiting you, Dr. Lovaas.It turns out that groups of parents are much more effective at advocacy than medicine. And that’s where the story ticks upward towards hope. Groups are formed. Laws are passed. Services are provided.Again, with the benefit of historical context, I know that eventually a major schism forms with one group focusing on advocacy and another focusing on a cure. The latter is important to understand to be sure, but let’s leave that to the scientists.The parts of the book about advocacy are really interesting to me because I know how hard it is to get accommodations, even in a supposedly good school system. It gets even more interesting when autistic people find each other through newsletters then the Internet and start advocating for themselves and the concept of neurodiversity, which brings us to the Google developers who so confidently questioned a famous scientist.Maybe the neurotypicals are really the problem here, taking the autistic world’s scientific breakthroughs and life-changing applications for granted.Let's face it. We live in a world where a scientific team lands a space probe on a comet going through space at 55kmph, and most of the news coverage is about the damn shirt the lead scientist wore. And just this week a kid brings a pencil box full of wires and electronics into his school in hopes of starting an engineering club, obliviously shows it to a teacher, and winds up handcuffed by five police officers “for his protection.” It’s like the X-men, but with superpowers that we can only guess at.Highest recommendation, especially for parents. It’s estimated that there are roughly as many autistic people as Jews. And don’t get hung up on high- or low-functioning. You don’t know what’s going on inside.Mr. Silberman is a wonderful writer, and his prose goes down easy, but Gibbon is even better and to date I haven’t been able to get anyone to read Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.While I appreciated all the background, I would love to have an abridged version to share with less motivated readers. I mean this book is so thorough that I was expecting a chapter just on fans of Gary Neumann. “Here in my car. I feel safest of all. I can lock all my doors. It’s the only way to live. In cars…”"
2,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8706020-beth-cato,5,"I received this book through the LibraryThing Early Reviewers Program, and I'm very glad I did. As the mother of an autistic child, the subject matter of autism is very personal for me. NeuroTribes was educational and affirming. I was genuinely astonished at how enjoyable the book was, long-winded though it is at times (my early reviewer copy is just under 500 pages). Silberman writes about subjects that are horrible, but they are necessary matters to address: Hans Asperger's insights made within the context of Nazi-controlled Austria, the institutionalization of children (often labeled imbeciles and/or schizoid), and the abusive nature of many ""therapies"" in the past fifty years, up to the present day. There's also the vital topic of the vaccines-cause-autism debacle, which he saves for near the end. However, the book is not all grim and dire. There's wonderful brightness through the middle of the book as he addresses the importance of science fiction, fandom, and the internet within the autistic community. There is even a section on the movie Rain Man and how that changed public perception. The end of the book is extremely positive as it shows how autistics are now empowered, and that many of them are fully capable of finding their own place in the world. I love Silberman's approach to this. Honestly, I cheered aloud. I have really been appalled by the stance of Autism Speaks and the emphasis on finding a source or cure for autism, rather than on how to serve the kids AND adults who need help now. The overall message of the book is that there is no autism epidemic. Autism has always existed. That different manner of thought has been essential to our survival as a species. Only now, it is diagnosed in a very specific way, and autistics are not hidden from society. If you have any interest in the history of autism research, I really, really recommend this. It's a challenging read at times, but it's also full of hope and potential. I look at my son and I see that hope and potential, too."
3,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a fascinating book about autism. The first part of the book focuses on the history of research into the syndrome. It describes how early researchers tried to formulate the causes of autism, including the pitifully sidetracked idea that cold parents are responsible for the syndrome. The book gives brief biographies of a few historical figures, including Henry Cavendish, Steve Jobs, Nikola Tesla and Mozart who are suspected of being autistic. Just try Googling ""famous autistic people in history"" and you will find an amazing list of inspiring historical figures who were probably autistic.Our consciousness of autism was heightened immeasurably by the movie ""Rain Man"", starring Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. After this movie was shown, people everywhere became aware of autism. However, the movie portrays a man who is at one end of the autistic spectrum, who could not possibly live independently. But the autism spectrum encompasses a broad range of capabilities, and high-end functioning autistic people are able to get along just fine.In some cases, being autistic can assist one professionally. I think first and foremost about Professor Temple Grandin, who realized that her autism helped her to understand animal behavior. She was better able to design and engineer equipment for handling animals because of her unique insights. She has written several books (such as Thinking in Pictures, Expanded Edition and Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior) and was celebrated in the terrific movie made about her.The latter part of the book is about the controversies between those who think of autism as a disability, and those who think of autism as simply a different way of thinking and living. This is where the book becomes most interesting. The book also discusses why autism seems to be diagnosed more frequently now than in the past; this is largely due to the enlarging scope of its definition in the psychiatric literature.I didn't read this book; I listened to the audiobook, as read by William Hughes. His narration is wonderful, and I definitely recommend it to those who enjoy listening to audiobooks."
4,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86598133-amora,4,"This book is a breath of fresh air. As someone on the autism spectrum, it is nice to hear from someone that isn’t on the autism spectrum make the argument that I’m not an accident and that people with autism have been around for centuries. I’ve been to a conference where the author spoke and I’m glad I got this book years after hearing it. I hope many parents read this to get rid of the stigma surrounding autism!"
5,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie,5,"NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and How to Think Smarter About People Who Think Differently by Steve Silberman provides a comprehensive (and very moving) history of autism from its original diagnostic criteria by Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger to parent-run organizations up to today's self-advocacy groups, in which people with autism are speaking for themselves and advocating for a focus on services not cures.At first, I was overwhelmed by the amount of detail Silberman gives. It seemed as though what could be summed up in a couple of paragraph was explored for pages. As I got deeper into the book, however, I came to appreciate Silberman's approach which provides not only a generalized overview of the topic but depth as well. The stories of the labeling mothers as ""refrigerator mothers,"" the narrowness and lack of scientific validity of the diagnostic process as well as the sometimes amazing efforts on the part of clinicians such as Asperger as well as family's to appreciate the child's (and as time went on, the adult's) strengths as well as difficulties became much more satisfying than a mere outline of the history would have been.By the time Silberman's book approaches its end, the focus has shifted from autism as a childhood tragedy to a more comprehensive view of autism as a spectrum condition that is not only about children but adults as well. The neurodiversity movement calls for society to change, not only to ""fix"" the autistic person (although certainly to help address needs) but also to appreciate the person's strength's and perspectives and the skills that a different perspective can bring to the table of society.Silberman's book moved me to anger and to tears and (occasionally) to laughter. The conclusion of the book, with its call for respect and accommodation to a variety of ways of processing the world, left me wanting to cheer.I thank Steve Silberman for his beautiful work and (in the interest of full disclosure) LibraryThing for giving me this book as a part of its Early Reviewers' program. My opinions are my own.I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in autism, the disability rights' movement, or simply in the potential of all people to contribute to community and how everyone benefits from a policy of inclusion. In fact, I would recommend this book especially to people who have not given much thought to the subject. The implications of a shift in society's attitude would impact all of us positively. It could change the world we live in for the better."
6,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899836-snotchocheez,4,"I'd never penalize a well-written book just because it wasn't something I expected to read but once you get past the techno-babble-y faux-portmanteau worded title NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and The Future of Neurodiversity you kinda expect more than just a comprehensive history of autism. But that's essentially what this is. I knew from the get-go, when Steve Silberman (a tech journalist by trade) divulged his motive for writing the book (when two of his interviewees for a tech article both expressed the same concern about being interviewed at home: ""I hope you don't mind that I have an autistic child at home"") that this was going to be Silberman's exploration into a subject he was heretofore not at all versed in. For a lay observer, Silberman meticulously researched the topic (almost to the point of exhaustion). If you have an interest in autism, but know little about the topic, this book is probably for you. If you're a parent, though, and are already familiar with all the schools of thought (many of which being terribly faulty and have stalled or set back autism treatment for decades) then this book might prove to be.information overkill."
7,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7447086-ann-marie-lit-wit-wine-dine,2,"www.litwitwineanddine.comThanks to Penguin House/Avery via NetGalley for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I admit that I was excited, really excited, when I heard about this book. After reading all 544 pages, I found myself more than a little let down. I was expecting to read about new research, treatment/therapy options, and ways for families to support one another and the autistic person they help care for. The book was largely about the history of autism and ASD morphing into the clinical diagnosis and diagnostic criteria we know today. The history was just dry. Lots of people (clinicians, parents, advocates, etc.) discussed, sometimes too many at one time. Though the Nazi experimentations and eugenics histories were appropriately horrifying, I'd read about them before. I was really hoping for new news. Though there were some histories of persons and families that I could connect to, I didn't feel as though I had really learned anything after reading this book. Yes, many people in the past (and present, I'm sure) have been misdiagnosed and overlooked which (at least perhaps partially) accounts for more recent diagnostic spikes. Yes, people with ASD are making and have made amazing contributions in our society. Especially in the areas of technology and the arts. Yes, we should focus more time, money, and energy on identifying services helpful to individuals and families and making them accessible to all. Again, this is just not new news. My rating: 2 stars"
8,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7356150-aaron-hook,3,"As a history of autism and its diagnosis, treatment, and social acceptance, this is a solid book. Could have used some more editing (the author often provides way too much detail on various players' bios and historical background. For example there's a good 30 pages devoted to a summary of the Nazi occupation of Austria, which was only tangentially related to the topic).The blurbs on the jacket about it being ""groundbreaking"" and ""radically alter[ing] the societal conversation"" are hyperbolic at best. This is a straightforward history without much critical insight or new thoughts added to the mix. One of the reasons I originally picked this up was because the jacket mentioned it explores the concept of neurodiversity w/r/t to autism. But that ""exploration"" only crops up in the last 30 pages and is again just a superficial summary of what various other authors and organizations have already put forward."
9,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"'NeuroTribes' is a well-written, deeply-researched book of history which describes the centuries of effort that has gone into developing a psychological outline of autism (still incomplete). The author, Steve Silberman, includes short biographies of likely autistic-spectrum scientists as well. In telling the story of discovery about autism and about people with autism, he also shows us readers how psychological research is generally done and that it is in its infancy. He gives valid arguments and examples for psychological research and treatment today to be made an inclusive ongoing collaboration of professionals and laymen. The middle sections of the book, which are a devastating history of the craziness to find a cure for autism (none available to date) more than amply satisfy me as to the validity of Silberman's argument for a research collaboration between professionals and non-professionals.I feel completely justified in saying people should use common sense AND try to figure out if a diagnosis matches actual facts AND read all of the studies which have been done with ALL of the established mainstream scientific method protocols and observations. If there is nothing but vague testimonials of success or only a single scientific study without any mainstream follow-ups that have replicated the initial results several times again over a period of years, walk away and keep looking.Sadly, many people incorrectly believe inoculations against childhood diseases cause autism despite many many many mainstream scientific studies debunking the single study which supposedly proved inoculations were causing autism. But people want to believe they can avoid autism in their kids if they avoid inoculations. Another sad example of the desperation and the urgent desire to find a cure, plus just plain rage against the universe, was the earlier diagnosis by a single professional of the idea 'refrigerator moms' caused autism, thus implying a cure was affection and love. Well, to me, this wild grasping at something or someone to blame shows the pain and despair of parents and investigators. It also shows the inability of everyone to face up to two obvious conclusions about autism today: 1. we can't currently cure it. 2. it is horrible. However, centuries of experimentation is showing that a variety of limited teaching techniques, time, experience, money, perseverance, patience and dutiful lifelong encouragement can improve the lives of people who are along the autism spectrum.On the other hand, the history of autism research also shows professional investigators studying psychological issues can cause devastation and destruction if they are careless or are forcing facts to match their feelings or if the investigator is a crackpot or charlatan. A college degree does not mean a person knows how to do research or that they are moral - it means simply they know enough to pass exams.The story of autism is a mixed bag of outcomes.The bad news is there is no cure. The good news is individuals with neurodiverse brain structures can be educated with uninterrupted maintenance of a low-emotional temperature in the room, genuine caring, teaching to the strengths of the individual, and listening to people in the autistic spectrum who have succeeded in becoming independent and successful in their chosen careers. A lot of patience, perseverance, money and access to a variety of other resources work. The issues not mentioned in the book are about the labor-intensive devotion one must endure and maintain for all of one's life if you choose to be always available for helping. It is a bit like being a mom of a toddler in some ways for the rest of your life, although the person you are helping may be an adult with many adult understandings. The author tells briefly without going into detail of families who do this supportive labor with a smile and love, strained though I am guessing it is. I know I do not possess this fortitude or strength myself. I recommend the book especially to anyone living with or around someone who we now are calling the neurodiverse universe, and also even if, gentle reader, you are simply curious particularly about autism or know someone with a differently wired brain issue. I am close to someone who is in the neurodiverse universe, and frankly, if given other options, I'd avoid being real closely involved with someone who is neurodiverse. Friendship and occasionally being there to help is awesome noble, but otherwise...omg, the lack of respite or rest! The lack of a cure! The complete abnormality of daily life! This is something which requires a lot of resources and time and commitment and sacrifice. No kidding.From my own experience, we all mix up the issues surrounding autism. After reading this book, I'd separate out:Causes, which at this point look to be a combination of inherited genes and environment, especially pollution, and even sometimes accidental injuries to the brain.Cures, which at this point, there are none.Modifying and improving the abilities and talents of the neurodiverse, mostly through special education techniques and acceptance; and palliative care at minimum if nothing else.Providing resources to the family supporting the neurodiverse.In the real world, gentle reader, we are failing to have any consistency whatsoever, in dealing with the neurodiverse. It is strictly hit and miss, off and on, a program here for awhile, a resource there for a time. So far, the book shows it is from parent organizations only where any consistency or progress is being made at organizing information and developing successful educational programs for autistic kids.The book makes it clear that inventive people who are somewhere in the high-functioning end of the autistic spectrum or have Asperger's or have whatever neurodiverse mental wiring which seems similar to autism symptoms (insert psychological label here - people are still arguing) are very likely the reason we live in the technological first-world paradise (mostly available to rich people and us less rich, at least those parts of technology which dribble down to us). This is definitely the half of the glass which is positive! However, it seems to me this is a childhood disability which requires intensive parenting and educational resources to even begin alleviating - and to be brutally honest, as a society we don't have those resources. The folks who are neurodiverse and who have been lucky to get access to both resources AND strong-minded, healthy parents (because, by the way, discoveries about autism and education/social integration methodologies have been driven by involved PARENTS, not the so-called psychiatric experts) are the ones who are written about in books such as this. In the real world, neuronormal people can barely keep their own lives moving forward because of minimal resources.: (There is a HUGE notes section for further reading, as well as an index."
10,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32877325-jake,2,"As someone interested in autism, its theories and its future, after reading some reviews of this book, I was hoping this would be a good, comprehensive introduction to the details of the subject. Instead, it was a long-winded, yet surface level history that could have been much deeper had the author not tried to shoehorn traditional narratives into a nontraditional story.The books started out great, talking about various historical figures that would likely have been diagnosed with autism today. In these wonderfully-written chapters, the author makes no grand conclusions, but provides the facts in a compelling narrative that points in a direction ... aka good writing.After that, the book gets clumsier and more questionable. The discussions of Hans Asperger are nice, but border on annointing Asperger as a saint that completely predicted all forms of autism. A positive depiction of Asperger is certainly justified, but this section was saccharine in its sweetness towards the subject.The worst offense, however, was the long-winded and clumsy attempt at creating an antagonist out of Leo Kanner. The book portrays Kanner as a swindler, a Doctor that had no business being a serious player in child psychology, and someone who knowingly, maybe even maliciously, ignored Hans Asperger's writings on the ""normal"" side of the autistic spectrum to promote his own career. Of course, the reader comes with the benefit of hindsight, which makes the demonization very unfair.The book also starts diagnosing people as on the autistic spectrum with little or no knowledge of their actual behaviors, treating autism seemingly as a personality trait indistinguishable from nerdiness. When talking about the birth of comic books and amateur radio operators, the book spontaneously diagnoses the entire readership of a trade magazine as autistic, dubbing them ""Asperger's Army."" After that, it was hard to take any assertions the book made seriously, and it left me wishing I had just read some medical literature."
11,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1254221-kerry-kenney,5,"This heartbreaking book came highly recommended. As an autistic adult with an autistic son I was sickened by the book, the therapies, the history. I thought of my own childhood and how grateful I am that I was born verbal and in an intact family that raised me, accepting me where I was and allowing me to do the best that I can. As a member of the autism community reading this book is like getting punched in the face over and over again, until you get to the last chapter about neurodiversity, where there is some hope. Again, I'm not sorry I read this book but it made me physically sick. We've followed the voices of adults on the autism spectrum to guide the way we raised our son and used principles of Cognitive Therapy to help him gain the skills to cope with day to day challenges of the way he processes information. I encourage anyone that read this book to read the internet writings of Karla Fisher or the books on understanding autism by Bill Nason. If you are simply curious about autism, the chapter on autism in the book ""Far from the tree"" is the best summarization of autism that I ever read. It's an excellent book and that is an excellent stand alone chapter."
12,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27693008-abigail-duran,3,"I read this book a couple of months ago, but only got around to reviewing it now. As a parent of multiple kids with autism I had been very eager to get hold of copy, especially as from the reviews I had read it seemed the author must have read my mind before he set out to read the book. The premise that autism has always been with us, that vaccines do not cause autism, there is no epidemic and that the rise in the number of diagnoses is a direct result of changes in diagnostic criteria, is one I already held. I read the book very quickly and after the first few chapters I was enthralled and was recommending the book to all I knew. However, by the time I got to the end of the book my opinion had changed. I still like the book, I still recommend the book, but with a caveat. I am the mother of four kids with autism. They range in severity from 'mild/level 1' (ie formerly Asperger's Syndrome) to 'severe, level 3'. I felt that the book started by giving an idea of range of autism from severe to mild and that severe cases were often mislabeled as ID and that mild cases were overlooked entirely. I also began to dislike the undertones in the book that suggested autism=great because look how useful high functioning/mildly autistic/Asperger's types can be! As the book went on I felt the author's focus left the ID and autistic or purely severely autistic kids and adults behind. The focus was on how people with high functioning autism can thrive and lead successful industries and so forth. That's a useful story to tell, but I felt it was interesting that the author began by seemingly bringing autism out of the shadows of history only to hide the lowest functioning members behind the shadows of the high functioning members of the community. They simply disappeared from his narrative. What happens to ID autistic adults in the modern world? Where do they live? Where does the low functioning teenager live? What happens to the 'mild' adults who regress or so forth? By the time the book ended I felt it put a nice glossy sheen over the lives of people with autism. This obscured the real struggles faced by people all the spectrum and by those who care for them and want the best for them. I was saddened by the underlying narrative that the of people with autism are worthwhile because of what they contribute rather than simply stating that people with autism are worthwhile because they are people, regardless of how useful they are to the rest of us."

14,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4186719-bea,4,"If you have any interest in autism or the history of psychiatry, this book is for you. I've taught toddlers and preschoolers for over 20 years and have had students with autism in my classes; some were diagnosed while in my class while others were diagnosed later. I remember my team and I fighting to get one particular boy diagnosed and provided with services who was clearly Asperger's while another was later diagnosed and we went, ""Oh, that explains a lot."" The information has changed a lot over the years and it's hard to keep up with the current thinking.This book provides a detailed, thorough look at the history of autism, its permutations as well as the permutations of the definition of autism. Put me firmly in the camp, where the author also seems to be, that there isn't an epidemic of autism. What's changed is the definition and diagnosis for autism, from a strict, highly limited and rigid definition to a broader, more accommodating definition. As well, there's the fascinating, and to me highly likely, hypothesis that autism, especially certain forms of it, are just part of the normal continuum and one that veers to genius level at times. Maybe instead of 'fixing' autistics, and oh, there are some heartbreaking stories, we need to be focused on how to adjust the world to include them. Many inventors and some geniuses were autistic and Silberman, along with doctors and experts before him, posit that without those autistic gifts, the inventors and geniuses wouldn't have been capable of their achievements.""NeuroTribes"" is full of fascinating information, history, and theories. I read it on my Kindle and highlighted so much of the book, I may not be able to find what I'm looking for. At times, the history dragged on, there could have been less detail, but overall I was impressed with Silberman's thoroughness and I learned so much. I'll definitely recommend this to my co-workers and the administration where I teach. The author did get judgmental at times, especially in regard to Dr. Kanner, whom he really disliked. Still, the detail is exhaustive and I can imagine, after all the research Silberman did and the people he talked to, that it would have been difficult not to have an opinion.Silberman didn't forget to talk to the people most directly affected by autism - the autistics and their families. We see how they are not so different in some respects - they fall in love, hold down jobs, are creative, etc. It wasn't too long ago that the medical establishment claimed none of that was possible for people diagnosed with autism. Heck, it was believed that only children were autistic, not adults. In recent years, adult autistics have begun to reclaim the autism movement, advocating for less time and money spent on 'cures' for 'fixing' them and for more spent on services helping them to cope and to function in our society as well as helping society to cope and to include people of diverse neurology.I'd have liked more time spent on the whole concept of neurodiversity and how other neurological and cognitive conditions such as ADHD and dyslexia tie in. The whole concept of neurodiversity fascinates me and I will need to hunt up more information about it. I teach an age group that is pliable and open to being molded and helped. What can I do as teacher do to help and just as importantly, what should I not do?""NeuroTribes"" is not a quick or light read but it's well worth the effort. As I said, I learned a lot and I have a lot to think about. It's a good introduction to what autism is and is not and to changing our thinking about what is normal and what is different. "
15,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book provides a thorough account of the troubled history of the psychiatric understanding of Autism Spectrum Disorder (this includes Asperger's syndrome). Unfortunately, most of this history in hindsight was incredibly blind to what now seems apparent as to the nature of the condition. Consequently, this long book spends most of its historical account describing what is now understood to be incorrect and spurious theories and treatments. The reader who makes it all the way through the book to the end will have a feel for the current understanding of autism. But I fear some readers will read about their own pet theory and read no further.The first response that comes to my mind after completing this book is that the field of psychiatry owes multiple generations of families an apology for promoting bogus explanations for the causes and possible treatments of autism. For many years they were no better than quacks in their explanations. They blamed the victim by using terms such as “refrigerator moms” to provide a pseudo-scientific Freudian like psychoanalysis explanation of how autism was caused by lack of parental love. The history of autism has a unfortunate tragic thread. Autism was observed and described by two different psychiatrists in the 1940’s, Hans Asperger in Vienna and Leo Kanner in Baltimore. Based on our current understanding of the autism spectrum the description proposed by Asperger was the more accurate of the two. Asperger described it as a continuum of characteristics that included “social awkwardness, precocious abilities, and fascination with rules, laws, and schedules.” He understood many of these cases as causes for celebration for their ability to focus on esoteric issues that in many cases can be considered as genius. According to his understanding, the occurrence of autism was biological in origin and has been present throughout history in a portion of the population.Kanner’s proposed definition of autism, in contrast to Asperger’s observations, was narrow and rare. He defined it as affecting only young children (anyone older was schizophrenic or psychotic), and though it was biological in origin it was activated by cold and withholding parents. With this definition he made the syndrome a source of shame and stigma.The unfortunate accident of history placed Asperger on the wrong side during WWII. His work was thus ignored, and his research papers destroyed in a bombing raid. Kanner who was located in the United States became the recognized expert in the field. Consequently it has taken sixty years to recover from his incorrect description of autism. This change in the definition of autism explains the reason for the apparent “epidemic” of autism in recent years. It is no longer a diagnosis of a sickness to be denied and avoided, but instead is now understood to be a naturally occurring condition that requires special training and assistance to learn to cope with it.There is now a much more optimistic understanding of the future prospects for those with autism.“Our therapeutic goal must be to teach the person how to bear their difficulties. Not to eliminate them for him, but to train the person to cope with special challenges with special strategies; to make the person aware not that they are ill, but that they are responsible for their lives.” ― Steve Silberman, NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity"
16,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia,4,My husband and I read this book together. We have a grandson who is autistic and we wanted to learn about the condition.The book gives many examples of those who are autistic and functioning. There is also a lot on the history of autism and the autism movements those with autism have started.My main lesson from this book was learning that the families of autists should not pray for a cure as much as they should find and encourage the strengths of the child. My grandson is 4 years old and whether he will become functioning is still not known. My prayer is that he functions well some day.4 stars
17,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4557869-sylvia,3,"As a parent of a child who is on the spectrum and has many challenges, I try to devour any book or information that comes my way about ASD. Anything new or old that will help me in assisting my child to develop and grow. So, when I stumbled upon NeuroTribes, I was very excited to say the least. I appreciate the fact that this author took the utmost time and care to thoroughly research and put forth a book that is quite informative. It broke my heart and I was sick to my stomach upon reading about the atrocities that occurred during the Holocaust to those with special needs/disabilities, regardless of their ethnicity. I couldn't believe that even German families would offer up their children to the Nazi's without question, all because they were different and not capable of being part of Hitler's vision...ugh, I'm sickened by it. Also, the fact, that the prominent scientist of that time and in that region silently allowed it to happen and were willing participants in the experimentation and extermination i.e. basically signing off on the death warrants by transferring them to another facility, of hundreds of thousands, many of those just children on the spectrum, knowing full well what was to become of their fate. This author dared to mention it and I'm glad he did.All in all, it was good read. However, I did find it too wordy and extremely long, not as smooth and fluid in collating a narrative that was readable and relatable. I guess it's difficult when you are dealing with history and facts to try to find some emotion. But as a parent of a child with Autism, that is what I look for i.e. being able to find that connection. I did with some stories but only up until a point. The one thing I have to say on books about Autism is they rarely touch on those like my son. Those on the moderate to severe range who have many learning difficulties and intellectual disabilities, or have severe speech delay. My son would have been killed during WWII and that's the truth. Instead, the belief that all are Rain Man and are going to change the world through new scientific research and technical innovation, is something we are all forever and desperately trying to shed light on. It is called a spectrum for a reason and to please be aware and mindful of that. Thank you to the author for writing this book as well as shedding light on Autism. If anything, it will bring forth understanding and change."
18,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4243191-faith-justice,5,"As a parent who raised an autistic daughter through much of the later history Silverman describes, I loved this book. The early history of diagnosis and treatment was fascinating. Each time he delved into the background or quoted a leading expert from the field, I felt like I was saying hello to an old friend. Like many desperate parents, I met these people at conferences, read their books, tried some of their techniques, and took hope from the smallest ""improvements"" in my child's behavior. The earliest history of abuse, neglect, and institutionalization of autistics broke my heart. I was aware, but Silverman brought it home with his graphic descriptions and in depth anecdotes of real people. Having grown up clumsy, socially awkward, and a SF fan, I can only shudder and be grateful my gifts outweighed my deficits in that awful time. My favorite part of the book was the last three chapters where the author delved into the more recent activities of autistic adults as they took (and are still taking) control of the tools available to them to build their own communities and advocate for more services, supports, and tolerance. I came to the conclusion early that my daughter would thrive in a more accepting environment that built on her strengths, rather than focusing on ""fixing"" her. Autistics all along the spectrum have unique gifts to contribute to society...if we only let them. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a relative or friend on the spectrum or is interested in the disability rights movement. Frankly, anyone interested in building a more inclusive society would benefit from the insights in this book. Thank you, Mr. Silberman, for taking on the monumental task of documenting the legacy of autism and executing it with thoroughness and sensitivity. I'm looking forward to a world that values neurodiversity. Note: I received an advanced reading copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
19,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"Neurotribes is a groundbreaking book that for the first time gathers all the historical development of the discovery, theories, “treatment” and finally, an acceptance of autism as a neurological difference that is not a condition to be treated, but a state of being to be accepted and supported.The history of autism ties in with the sordid history of mental illness in general: people institutionalized, bullied, mistreated. Dr. Asperger discovered in the thirties in Vienna that autistic children with remarkable abilities flourished when given individualized education in a way that engaged them. Yet his research was lost in the chaos and cruelty of Nazism and war that exterminated mentally ill people. The biggest lasting damage done to autistic children and parents was the “refrigerator mother” theory, that blamed autism on the parents who were cold or overly involved. This resulted in the social isolation of parents with autistic children, as their friends shunned them for doing this to their children - especially if they would not give their children up into an institution that would “rescue” the child from them. Autistic children were considered imbeciles and were given no education, and removed from their home, often ended up catatonic, never learning to speak or taking care of themselves.Autism was also considered a childhood disease. This was changed by the appearance of Temple Grandin, who was the first adult who admitted to be autistic and gave an insight into autistic thinking, and a path to a fulfilled adulthood, when given an education and opportunity. She also drew attention to her special abilities: she can simulate and test her machinery in her head, which none of her collegues can do.Thankfully attitudes are changing, although there is a long way to go. We now recognize that autism is a spectrum, and that every autistic person is different. It is also becoming common knowledge that many of the brightest scientists, engineers, and computer programmers are, and were, on the spectrum somewhere, and their different way of thinking might have pushed humanity along. Furthermore, our society is becoming more reliant on these skills as computer technology, and a way of abstract thinking that comes with it, is taking an increasing role in our lives.Thanks to the Disabilities Act, autistic children are no longer denied education. Parents have support groups and are discovering not just the challenges, but the unique opportunities autism presents. Autists are standing up for their rights and are raising awareness of their needs to be able to function in society. There is a long way to go still. As a parent of a kid on the spectrum, I sincerely hope that our society learns to embrace neurodiversity, and recognize that certain individuals with social problems are not rude or lack empathy, they just don’t know how to navigate this world. We can help them. In return, they can help us in ways we are unable to see."
20,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,5,"I wanted to read ‘Neurotribes’ as I didn’t really understand what autism was. It seems to be mentioned quite frequently in the media, yet never really defined. Silberman’s book explains why this is: the exact nature of autism is poorly understood, which is why the concept of a spectrum was adopted. The concluding chapter summarises this in the same eloquent style that characterises the rest of the book:Most researchers now believe that autism is not a single unified entity but a cluster of underlying conditions. These conditions produce a distinctive constellation of behaviour and needs that manifest in different ways at various stages of an individual’s development. Adequately addressing these needs requires a lifetime of support from parents, educators, and the community, as Asperger predicted back in 1938. He was equally prescient in insisting that the traits of autism are ‘not at all rare’.As far as I could tell, it isn’t understood what makes a human brain autistic or not, so the condition is known entirely through its symptoms. Although genetic markers have been found, I very much doubt autism could show up in a brain scan. Apparently research has tended to treat it as a disease needing a cure, rather than as a different way of being that requires support. By recounting the history of autism as a concept, Silberman demonstrates how people on the autistic spectrum have repeatedly been caught up in wider social panics, especially in early childhood. This is linked with the wider problem that Western society has with mental illness. In fact, I would be very interested to read a cross-cultural comparison of attitudes to the autistic spectrum, in the vein of Crazy Like Us: The Globalization of the American Psyche.Silberman tells the story of autism clearly and with great compassion. The early chapters of the book are horrifying, in particular the account of how Nazis systematically murdered children in medical institutions. Even after the worst brutalities of institutionalism ended, recent history is full of the tragedy of anti-vaccination hysteria. Yet overall the book is uplifting, as it demonstrates how understanding and sympathy for differences in perceptions of the world can be fostered. I found it fascinating."

Using stories of historical figures, modern-day families, medical and psychological specialists, activists and autistic individuals, the book conveys the ""history"" of autism. What do we know? Is there really an epidemic? What works? Why is searching for a cure perhaps not the best strategy? Above all, though, it keeps the well-being of autistic children and adults at the center and in doing so raises tough questions and hard critique of how our society treats those who don't fit social norms. Thanks, NetGalley, for an advance copy in exchange for an honest review. "
22,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5995202-isil-arican,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and recommend everyone who is interested in the history of medicine, cognitive science and autism.A couple of years ago I had the chance to hear Silberman in a conference, he was a great speaker and the excerpts he read from this book intrigued me to read it. It turns out that the book was even better than his talk.Neurotribes goes into the depths of autistic spectrum disorder, takes the reader to first to the life of well known historical figures, all the way back to 1600s ( Lord Cavendish, Lord Kelvin, Dirac and many more) to describe some ASD traits they had. Then tells the story of the first clinicians and how they discovered and defined this condition, moves to the sad story of Asperger and his connection with Nazis, how Eugenics movement defined how disabilities like these treated. After telling many horror stories, just like the fled scientists from Europe in the brink of WWII, he also travels to the US to describe the autism work sprouting there.He goes into a great detail of how the diagnosis and the medical arena evolved around the moving perceptions and new information. Along the historical flow, he also provides glimpses of lives of some well-known people with ASD /Aspergers in the timeline. He brilliantly incorporates the birth of the geek culture into the rising numbers of people in the spectrum and the technology that helps them to live productive and fulfilling lives. The book contains a great detail on how the movie ""rainman"" was made and how big of a difference it made in society's perception and acceptance of the people with ASD.Silberman is a very articulate writer, his storytelling is flawless. He provides enough details to provide a lot of information but keeps the story moving at an interesting pace at the same time. The book contains very detailed and thorough research on peoples biographies, medical and psychological documents. research and current day events.Overall, this was one of the best books I read."

24,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," Once in a while, I work with children who are on the Autism Spectrum at my job but I hadn't put much time in looking at the issue. This book explains the history of autism and its growth in the numbers of people diagnosed with it. The modern understanding of it started in a dark time when in Nazi Germany those deemed ""useless eaters"" were being euthanized (murdered) by the Third Reich. Asperger the man who gives his name to a type of autism studied the disease. He tried to steer clear of this policy but it put him in a difficult position because he was required to report anyone who should be euthanized as a doctor. He began the studies of a constellation of symptoms that would later make the autism category. The book covers later study involving many factors but this disease is enigmatic and treatment has been difficult. Many high functioning people with the condition have savant-like abilities. The author argues that they are more a specialized type that should be recognized for their gifts as well as their challenges. She debunks the vaccine myth and tries to educate people that Asperger's spectrum is not the end of a person and argues for acceptance and reducing stigma and myth surrounding the condition. While it may be very hard for people to adjust with this condition it is not an unmixed curse. Many can do well and thrive with this condition."

It is, by far, the most respectful written by a non-autistic author. While I wouldn't say it centers autistic experience, exactly, it does honor that experience. That, in itself, is a rarity.I love this book. At times, it was painful to read. But Silberman writes in a way that made me feel as though he were somehow supporting me through it. He documents dehumanizing practices without ever reinforcing that dehumanization or making any apology for it. That's not an easy thing to do. Also not easy to remember the humanity of those who abuse their children (or their patients)(with cattle prods). Steve has more compassion for such people than I have! But I can appreciate his objectivity. Those profiled in this book are presented, first and foremost, as people, not saints, or demons, or narrative props. Mastered by my better self, I suppose I'd do the same.Thank God for quality journalism. Lord knows we'll be needing it..."
26,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/950284-jennifer-hughes,5,"Perhaps this is not so much of a book review as a life review as a result of this book's powerful affect on me. You decide.I went to a school concert recently. As the teenagers leisurely tromped onstage, I idly scanned the crowd. My eyes stopped instinctively at one young man—then a second. Who knows, maybe everyone else in the audience was doing the same thing: something about these boys just caught the eye for some reason. Perhaps it's because it's such a strong part of our human nature to notice, categorize, and analyze why someone else is different.These young men who caught my attention looked ill at ease in their own skin. They weren’t chatting with their neighbors like most of the other kids. Without knowing anything of importance about them I could tell they were socially awkward. Geeks. Nerds. I could even armchair psychoanalyze these kids as being on the autism spectrum. How could I tell? How can any of us sense, even from a distance, that someone is just “not quite right”—in other words, not like us?I’ve seen this same analyzing stare from strangers for many years as they watch my kid, who is also on the autism spectrum. I know it well. In a way, it bothers me—“Just let him be who he is without your personal judgments on what kind of a person he is or what kind of a parent I must be.” And yet I find myself at times, like at the school concert, doing the same thing. Are we instinctively programmed to value human symmetry? Are our personal worlds not right until we homogenize everyone around us? It seems true. And yet there’s something so “ugly American” about the thought. Many of us would probably reject the idea on its surface—but then go right on staring.Before I could write a review of NeuroTribes by Steve Silberman, I’ve had to digest it for the last month. I’ve had to reconsider everything I’ve thought about autism and do some soul-searching as I’ve examined our family history “on the spectrum.” This is a long book, a comprehensive history of autism and the development of the field of psychology in the 20th century, and although I think it's fascinating reading, I don't think it’s one that a casual reader would want to read in its entirety. The author makes the compelling case that we are not suffering from a recent autism epidemic but rather that the increase in numbers is a result of the diagnostic criteria for autism being broadened to give children legal claim on special services. It makes a lot of sense to me, especially since my kid is one who was able to receive some special services at school once we had that doctor's note with a diagnosis.Regardless of the ""numbers,"" after reading NeuroTribes, I’m viewing autism in a whole new light, as a wide spectrum of traits as unique as individuals instead of a disorder that needs to be cured. Looking back, I regret the years of wasted effort focusing on fixing my child’s weaknesses instead of building him up through his strengths. It seems we are in a vicious circle with these kids that aren't quite like us: we pathologize their personality--we define it as autism and then try to cure it. So here's the thing. Autism is primarily related to difficulty in social interactions, so what if this is not a disease but just a different kind of communication style that we neurotypicals don’t get?This video mentioned in the book, ""In My Language,"" created by an autistic woman to explain her language and communication, was startlingly revelatory for me. It completely turns the conversation about autism on its head as we consider that these individuals are different but not less than us. I truly think it is worth everyone's time to see a new perspective by watching the short video.I know I've been jumping around a bit, but here’s a scenario that may help personalize what I'm saying. Imagine that you are hosting a guest from another country. Perhaps this is a remote area where they aren’t connected with the outside world and haven’t been exposed to various alternative social customs. What would you do if the guest acted or communicated in ways that seemed unusual or weren’t quite socially appropriate for your culture? Teach him how to do it your way? Respect his ways of communicating that might be different from yours but still have value? Scorn and punish him for acting according to his native culture? Try to fix him in all the ways he's “wrong”?It’s helped me reframe autism by thinking of it this way. Perhaps we spend so much time trying to fix people or cure autism instead of helping them live their best lives within their circumstances. It sounds logical at first to try to find a cure--but anymore, I don't think that's asking the right questions. Instead of throwing money at research, perhaps money would be better spent in financial aid to parents and individuals who need therapies for developing life skills that will help them survive in what must be a frightening and alien world of neurotypicals.Going forward I want to be more appreciative of the way that autistic individuals work so hard to do what comes naturally to me. Instead of being the objects of pity or just The Stare, they should be the receipients of our admiration for being strong and smart and brave. As I—and I hope all of us—change our mentality, the ones who will truly benefit are ourselves as we become the best in humanity to encompass those we can’t understand.Because of space limitations here, I'm posting this review on my blog Jennifer Said, along with the book excerpts that were most relevant and meaningful to me. You may find it enlightening to even just scan through them. "
27,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,2,"""Parenthood"" the TV show shed more light on ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder which includes Asperger) than this very long book did. If your interested in ASD, I would recommend that show instead. Max, the Asperger character on the show, demonstrates more about life on the Spectrum than this book does. I remember the scene where Max is running for class president and his sister tells him why he is so special, along the lines that he is totally focused, sees the world differently and never needs to get along just in order to get along. Also, Max and his interaction with Hank (played by Ray Ramono), the photographer, and how the photographer knows how to interact instinctively with Max because Hank obviously is on the spectrum too.As for this book, the author gives the history of the Disorder and our understanding by putting the events into the context of the time, but doesn't really relate them to our current understanding. For example, he brings up someone named Jenny McCarthy early in the book, somebody like most Americans I had never heard about before she started linking Autism with vaccines. I for one, think that Dante should put into his Eighth circle of hell (Fraud) people like Jenny McCarthy (and by extension Jim Carrey) because that's were they belong for the misery they bring to the world for the fraud they are perpetrating upon us. The author does reject the anti-vaccine idiots in the later part of the book, but I don't think he mentioned Jenny McCarthy (may she greet other vaccine deniers in the eighth circle of hell) by name in the later part of the book.The author spends a lot of time on the pseudo-scientific Freudian like psychoanalysis that led to things such as ""refrigerator moms"" causing Autism (always blame the victim, or if you can't blame them, blame the mother). I really enjoyed the book, ""Shrinks: The Untold Story of Psychiatry"". There's a lot of overlap between these two books. Except ""Shrinks"" would relate what was historically being done wrong to what was finally being done right. This book doesn't do that.The author also had a long section on how Engineers, Sci-Fi enthusiast, nerds in general are almost always people on the spectrum and how fortunate they are to be on the spectrum (as for me, I don't believe those kind of people are almost always on the spectrum, but I could be convinced with data but none was provided). The book does point out that neuro-typicals can be considered a Disorder just as easily. After all, who wants to always want to be conforming for the sake of conforming, valuing social interaction over ones own company, or never being able to understand the details that make up the whole. All in contrast to the neuro-diverse who don't fully understand the rules of the game for conforming, get their strength while being alone, and are able to understand the details and logically pull apart the pieces that make up the whole, but there is a price to be paid to be a nerd on the spectrum especially when you are young, and for the young conformity is everything and to think different(ly) makes you not fit in and later on that emotionally oriented thinking process that you possess limits you to understanding emotions only by clues you see in the physical world not from the internal states of others or yourself.I thought ""Shrink"" covered how psychiatry corrected itself better than this book covered how the science of autism corrected itself. There is a lot of overlap between the two in the sense that both books show how American Psychiatry (and Psychology) got off the rails with psychoanalysis (Freudian thought) and ended up correcting themselves by changing the paradigms they were using. When a science such as psychology doesn't relate their paradigms to the real world, the science ends up becoming a pseudo-science. That's what happened with the science of Autism (and psycho-analysis). The problem with this book is it dealt mostly with the false paradigms and didn't dwell enough on how the science has corrected itself. Watch ""Parenthood"" instead."

Probably a bit redudant for people who already have any level of understanding about the history of this diagnosis, I really appreciated all the information in this book - even if it did feel a bit long at times.In fact, I would really have loved to rate this book even more highly but for two major issue. This book lacks any scientific data (see end notes for update) and it is lacking in everything but the most rudimentary of structures (still an issue). The book dragged on extra long in the middle mostly because I had little to no idea what exactly the author was trying to get at. OK, I was able ot parse out a lot of the positive message he finally stated at the very end of the book, but it did not come particularly easy and it ended up making the book feel rather unbalanced. I feel like he did cover other people's opinions that disagreed with him (although this was probably still in a rather biased way), but it was all sort of strung along in long (metaphorical) run on sentence, rather then presented in a coherent way to help people reach their own conclusions.And despite the fact that most of my recreational nonfiction reading leans heavily in the direction of anecdotal I really felt like at least a few studies or charts should have been referenced at some point in the book. Surely they are out there. Even if the author then chose to speculate about the experiences that have likely fallen outside the purview s of official autism stats, it would have been nice if this book didn't all appear to be based purely on the author's own personal experiences.I look forward to diving into some more books that cover this subject, especially any I can find written by autistics themselves. I do think this book has helped me understand better then I did, but it could have been so much better.-Update: As pointed out in the comment below one plus to the physical addition is that it does have endnotes. So, as I suspected all along, Silberman did not pull all of this from thin air. That said, I would have appreciated some of that material being included in the audiobook (often attached as a PDF these days) and it still felt more like foot notes rather then something that helped bring the book to a conclusion. Ah well, such is life."

From popular culture to the children of the author’s contacts in Silicon Valley, he keeps hearing about autism. He sets out to discover why.His quest takes in the history of our understanding of autism, the reasons for the increase in the diagnosis and the changing experiences and treatment of autistic people.Neurotribes is written with the pace of a thriller, and vividly brings to life academic rivalries, tabloid panics and science fiction fandom. Interspersed are the stories of the people the author has encountered along the way – autistic people, their families and carers, clinicians and writers, and even movie stars. Parts of the book are very dark, including the accounts of institutionalisation of people dismissed as ‘feeble-minded’ and the horrors of Nazism. It is a timely reminder that Hitler was not an aberration but a man who exploited ideas which were widely articulated in Europe and the US at the time.A running theme through the book is the tension between those who think that autistic people need to be ‘cured’ and those who think that society benefits from the strengths of autistic people and should accommodate their particular needs. The book ends on a positive note as it discusses the self-advocacy movement and profiles autistic people who have found their own ways to live fulfilling lives.I found Neurotribes a fascinating and moving read.*I received a copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley."

Silberman does an amazing job of giving an in depth history of a medical condition that we only have just learned about within the last 70 years. His chapters run the gamut. From institutionalizations to special schools, from Asperger's initial findings, to Kanners complete appropriation of Asperger's ideas. He talks about the different treatments of Autism from electroshock therapy, to major antipsychotics, to biomedical interventions. He spends a lot of time on the words used to describe the diagnosis. He spends a lot of time on helping you get to know the individuals who helped shape the idea and diagnosis of autism. It is almost overwhelming, and sometimes it's hard to keep the players straight. I thoroughly enjoyed the end of the book, in which he talks about where autism is headed. It's headed in a new direction. The direction is not steered by parents of autistic children, as in the past, but by autistic individuals themselves. And this is exciting. We wouldn't be the enlightened, cultured civilization if not for the advancements that autistic people have given us. I feel like this book is a gift, to help us better understand our own human race, and the people who help shape our lives, in some unexpected ways. A great read if you are interested in the history of autism and human rights. "
31,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,5,"This is extremely good nonfiction. Although other reviewers have noted that it is a very long book, packed full of details, I found it to be extremely engaging, with only a few very short dull parts (it is hard to make changes to DSM criteria riveting, but actually Silberman did better than you could ever imagine). Silberman's writing voice is upbeat and entertaining, and a dense topic is made readable with lots of wonderful and colorful personal details and anecdotes. I don't know if this would be such a page-turner to someone with less personal interest in autism spectrum issues, but I found it absolutely compelling. In addition to being extremely well written, Silberman is consistently pro-autistic and his message of neurodiversity is powerful and very needed. It would be wrong to call it ""ground breaking"" - as some have - because he is just digesting and conveying ideas that have been out there for decades, but it is also impossible to underestimate the importance of getting those ideas out to a bigger audience. For that, it comes back to how wonderfully well written this book is, and Silberman deserves real credit. This is definitely one of my favorite nonfiction reads of 2015 and maybe for the past couple years. "
32,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,4,"The last two chapters of the book, which are about the movement for neurodiversity, are exemplary. The rest of the book is about the history of the psychologists who ""discovered"" autism in the early twentieth century, and the methods that parents and doctors thought would cure autistic people -- electroshock, corporal punishment, severe dietary restrictions (which is still trendy among ""leaky gut"" proponents). It was horrifying. Indeed, let others praise not-so ancient times, I am glad I was born in these.My one criticism is that the narrative isn't linear. In the span of a few pages, Silberman discussed events in one decade, backtracked to a previous decade, and returned to the initial decade. I didn't read very much during my time in Rome, but I finished during the flight home."
33,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/626748-leonard,2,"This is a book that cannot decide if it is a polemic or a report about the complex world of Autism and other neurologies. When a polemic, it is snarky and poorly reasoned, taking potshots at psychoanalysis and casting aspersions on researchers motivations without much to back them up. When it is reporting, it is informative and though provoking and has much to recommend it. I came away feeling that there was an axe being ground here, but was not clear what the axe was really. This could have been a much better book and so I was greatly disappointed."

Read this book."
35,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14219722-edoardo-albert,4,"As the father of two autistic boys, I've read more than my fair share of the burgeoning field of autistic books so it's a pleasure to find a new departure in reading on the subject. Up until now, most books on autism have fallen into one of three categories:1. the inspiring parental story of recovering a child from the depths of autistic disengagement via some new and unlikely therapy often involving animals and/or shamans;2. the inspiring autistic autobiography, telling how an autistic person overcame discrimination and misunderstanding to achieve personal autonomy and a good life;3. the how-to guide for parents with autistic children.Now Steve Silberman has added a third category: the history of autism as a medically recognised condition, from the physicians who first spotted it and struggled, more or less successfully, to describe, through the various therapies tried to cure/treat/ameliorate/accommodate it, to the split between different autistic 'camps' and schools, to about where we are now: a condition that has gone from almost nothing to almost everyday within two generations. As a history, it's generally excellent, although a little marred by Silberman's tendency to paint people as 'good guys' (Hans Asperger - the Austrian physician who first recognised the condition and pioneered a notably gentle and appreciative treatment) and 'bad guys' (Leo Kanner - Austrian-American psychiatrist who popularised a restrictive view of autism in America whom Silberger basically accuses of stealing Asperger's work). The reality seems greyer and harder to define, particularly in light of recent evidence that Asperger fell into the morally grey areas of a doctor working under the Nazi regime: he seems to have sent at least two of his children to the Spiegelgrund clinic knowing that they would likely be euthanised there, while managing to protect most of the children under his care. The history of autism thus becomes entwined with the history of the century and the changing nature of medical theorising: from restrictive diagnoses that sought to exclude those who were borderline to diagnoses that now tend to bring far more children within a diagnostic framework. What is clear, is that autism is a spectrum, with many of its traits being potentially highly useful. I do sometimes wonder, as a parent, whether the insight that drove the MMR anxiety that linked the vaccine to the increase in levels of autism might have other sources. It's quite common for parents of autistic children to think they are developing normally and then, at an early age but usually somewhere between one and three, for there to be a sudden falling off in the child's development: the first of many subsequent meltdowns. I remember that with the eldest of my two autistic sons. In his case, the decline coincided with his starting at school. Now autism is a developmental disorder and I wonder if one possible factor in its increase is the earlier and earlier ages at which we are putting children into school. For any child, and particularly for boys, the sudden move from the predictable and stable environment of home, dealing mainly with parents and siblings, into the far less predictable environment of school where volatile peers are the main source of interaction might cause a social-system overload leading to a massive withdrawal from social and linguistic learning as the child tries desperately to accommodate and cope with the sudden huge increase in stimuli, both physical and sensory. If there's any truth in this idea, then countries where children begin school later should have lower rates of autism. It would be interesting to see if this bears out. In the meantime, read Silberman's book if you want to know how autism, as a medically recognised condition with a wide and often competing range of therapies, arrived at its present stage. For all our difficulties today, it's still a huge improvement over the days of 'refrigerator mothers' when much of the medical profession basically blamed the parents for the child's condition or some of the frankly horrible 'cures' devised by the Behaviourist. It also serves as a useful reminder that the real expert is one who understands that he still has much to learn about a subject."
36,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"This is definitely more a book about the history of autism than it is a book about autism itself, so if you're looking for the nitty gritty of what it means to be on the spectrum or how the brain works, it's probably better to look elsewhere. NeuroTribes seems to have mainly been written in response to all the hubbub in recent years by the contingent claiming that there is an autism epidemic and that it is being caused by vaccinations. Silberman looks back at how long autism has existed (probably pretty much as long as people have existed), including looking back at a number of historical figures that were most likely autistic, like Henry Cavendish and Paul Dirac. Then he goes into all the details of how it's been diagnosed over the course of the last couple hundred years and why the fact that more and more people are being diagnosed with it now than ever before doesn't mean that more people are actually autistic than ever before; it's just that recent corrections in diagnostic guidelines have made it easier for people to receive ""on the spectrum"" diagnoses, and therefore more people are now able to gain access to the support and services they need. Silberman goes through all of this in a very balanced way, and without demonizing anyone, recognizing that the data can seem misleading, and that parents on both sides just want what's best for their kids. But I love that he does bend the focus more towards working on gaining support and services for people with autism and their families than working towards finding a cure for autism. His opinion, and I think what a lot of his research shows, is that people on the autism spectrum have made and continue to make a lot of really important contributions, especially in the fields of science and technology, but in lots of other areas as well, not in spite of the ways their minds work, but because of it, and that we're all just working on different operating systems. I like that description a lot.Anyway, this is a really good look through how our view of autism has changed throughout history, as well as how it's been diagnosed and treated. And definitely well worth a read if you're looking for a fairly balanced account of how and why the whole vaccinations-might-cause-autism debate began."

Any accomplished educator is well aware that no two students are alike. Devising curriculum and instruction to meet the needs of a classroom full of independent thinkers and learners is a challenge to say the least. I was one who lived for that challenge and, in retirement, still teach two classes a semester at a community college. I am most alive in the classroom and thrive on the challenges of diversity. During my last five years in public high school education, I taught in an inclusion classroom with an exceptional special education teacher who taught me more in those few years than any other educator over the course of my career!Steve Silberman's book is a revelation! It validates so much of what I have come to believe as an educator. His work is well-researched and well-written for anyone to access. The history of neurodiversity is filled with tragedy, but is overwhelmingly full of the ""aha!"" moments that make life so interesting. This book is for everyone who is alive on our world today! We share space with others who are as diverse as we are and with whom we need to learn to create the future. In reading this book, we recognize ourselves, significant others, friends, relatives, colleagues, and fascinating strangers. In negotiating our way through life, we have to embrace diversity around us in all of its may facets, including the diversity in the working of the minds around us.My real hope is that this and other books like it will lead to the revolution in education so may of us have been seeking which will provide comprehensive change to meet the needs of every individual mind entering a school or classroom. Individual Education Plans for EVERY student should not be a dream of the few, but a reality that can not happen soon enough.

38,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5531911-brandy,5,"I enjoyed the book very much for what it is, a non-fiction book primarily focused on the history of autism. Most professionals (therapists, teachers, psychiatrists, etc.) could probably benefit from it. Autistics themselves may enjoy the book for the extensive level of detail Mr. Silberman goes into. Or if you enjoy history of disability rights, psychology books, or non-fiction in general it's worth reading. I finished it rather quickly since it's engrossing and moves smoothly. Some of it may be familiar territory to people with an extensive knowledge of psychiatry history (such as the bit about refrigerator mothers) but much of it is new and fresh information not previously included in any books. I'd consider it an essential reading on neurodiversity as well. My only caveat is I wouldn't really recommend it as an introduction to autism, since it's heavy on history and short on practical advice. So, if you're a parent of a newly diagnosed offspring, I'd direct you towards The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism first. Or if you are an adult newly diagnosed, ""Been There. Done That. Try This!: An Aspie's Guide to Life on Earth"" by Tony Attwood is a more practical starting point."

If I had known what I was getting into, I probably wouldn't have read it, at 542 pages. Still, I enjoyed this as a philosophy of science, as the descriptions of varying perceptions of autistics, as they currently like being called, over the course of the almost 100 years that they have been described. These varying descriptions and their implications are themselves fascinating. Kanner was the dominant early voice in the US.Kanner: ""Overambitious parents like the Tripletts had “stuffed” the impressionable minds of their children with useless information to cast themselves in a culturally favorable light and bolster their own egos"" (p. 190). He ""turned the detailed notes that parents had provided to him—which were so helpful in developing a clear picture of their children’s development—into a weapon, citing them as a “telling illustration of parental obsessiveness.”"" (p. 190)Asperger preceded Kanner, but his view of autistic children was more benign. It was also lost during WW2 and rediscovered later.Asperger: “Not everything that steps out of the line, and is thus ‘abnormal,’ must necessarily be ‘inferior.’” ""This boy’s difficulties—which particularly affect his relationships with himself and other people—are the price that he has to pay for his special gifts” (p. 128).It matters how we see these children (and adults), right? Are they low functioning, severely affected, or profoundly impaired or a “high-octane boy,” as one parent argued? Are the parents the cause of problems, as Kanner and Theodore and Ruth Lidz argued, or are they their children's supports? Some more quotes:Rudolf Ekstein: ""Tommy’s precocious interest in science was likely the result of “early childhood intensive sexual traumata” caused by seduction by his mother or a nursemaid"" (p. 211). Bernard Rimland: “Brightness gone awry” (p. 272)Ivar Lovaas (who believed you should punish self-injury): ""Once you had taken it upon yourself to physically strike a child, you were morally responsible for his fate. “No one punishes who isn’t prepared to devote a major part of his life to that child. Nobody punishes a child who doesn’t also love that child,” he told a reporter. “Once you lay your hand on a child it morally obligates you to work with that child. You see, that is one of the reasons that people stay away from punishment—they don’t want to commit themselves. After you hit a kid you can’t just get up and leave him; you are hooked to that kid.”"" (pp. 312-313)George Rekers and Ivar Lovaas: ""It’s easier to change a child’s behavior than it is to destigmatize that behavior in society—whether it’s limp wrists or flapping hands."" (p. 323)Barry Morrow:  “What Bill taught me... is that not only do people like Bill need society, society needs people like Bill.” (p. 363)Judith Gould: “We were not surprised when people started saying it was an epidemic. Obviously, by broadening the spectrum, you’re going to get higher numbers."" (p. 421)Temple Grandin: ""A “handicap” rather than a mental illness, invoking the humanizing language of disability over the stigmatizing lexicon of psychiatry"" (p. 426). Oliver Sacks: Their autism, “while it may be seen as a medical condition, and pathologized as a syndrome, must also be seen as a whole mode of being, a deeply different mode or identity, one that needs to be conscious (and proud) of itself.” (p. 430)Walter Spitzer: ""Autism as “a terminal illness . . . a dead soul in a live body.”"" (p. 431)Jim Sinclair: “Being autistic does not mean being inhuman. But it means that what is normal for other people is not normal for me, and what is normal for me is not normal for other people.”[I'm like] “an extraterrestrial stranded without an orientation manual” (p. 437)Laura Tyroncik: “Neurotypical syndrome is a neurobiological disorder characterized by preoccupation with social concerns, delusions of superiority, and obsession with conformity... There is no known cure.” (p. 441)Jim Sinclair: “Saying ‘person with autism’ suggests that autism is something bad—so bad that it isn’t even consistent with being a person...We talk about left-handed people, not ‘people with left-handedness,’ and about athletic or musical people, not about ‘people with athleticism’ or ‘people with musicality’ . . . It is only when someone has decided that the characteristic being referred to is negative that suddenly people want to separate it from the person.” (p. 441)Susan Moreno: ""Her life had been enriched in ways that she could never have predicted by coping with the challenges of raising Beth."" (p. 444)Ivar Lovaas: ""a normal child trapped within the “autistic shell,” waiting to be rescued.Dan Grover: “The goal is to alleviate those with Asperger’s from this pressure that they need to conform,” Grover said in the press release. “What is best is to learn how to use your uniqueness to your advantage and find your place in the world.” (p. 455)Ari Ne'eman: ""Not “symptoms” of his autism, but problems built into the ways that society treats people who don’t meet the standard expectations of “normal.”"" (p. 458)Carol Greenberg: “When I look at my son,” she says, “I think, ‘He’s not broken. He’s just neurologically outnumbered, like me.’” (p. 467).Do we understand autism? We have, at least, some interesting and useful understandings – and some that are not."
43,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"In pop psychology, nothing appears as self-evident as the statement that ""autism is a spectrum."" Silberman's book explains how recent this insight is, how controversial it remains, and how bumpy the road has been. The diagnostic history of the concept of autism (and related diagnoses) makes for an interesting story that deals with human tragedy, political struggle, and scientific discovery. Silberman has written an engaging book that gives readers a better understanding of the convoluted history of the condition and the importance of the social struggles of ""neurodiverse"" people.Since autistic people often (but not always) have a difficulty communicating and representing themselves in society, it is important that books that deal with the issue respect the source material - i.e. the patients and their families, with their very real human emotions and passions. In this regard, the book does a pretty good job. The copious anecdotes and tales of the daily life of autistic people remind us of the individuality and humanity of autistic people, including even the most uncommunicative (or differently communicative) individuals. That said, Silberman understandably focuses more on the parents and their struggles, on the one hand, and the doctors and their ambitions, on the other hand, rather than the inscrutable inner life of autistic people. The story focuses mostly on the dual stories of Leo Kenner and Hans Asperger, the two independent co-discovers of diagnostic autism. Their different interpretations and visions of the nature of the disorder (or, less disparagingly, the personality type) have shaped treatment options, medical practices, social attitudes, and social policies that have impacted the lives of autistic people. This story is absolutely fascinating. It contains insights about the often convoluted shape of the history of science, the importance of constructing a coherent and humane social narrative, the dangers of false beliefs, the social value of psychological difference (""neurodiversity""), and the importance of hearing multiple viewpoints in highlighting different aspects of the same phenomenon.The book is quite long. Sometimes I wish that it had pruned its narrative. The big picture often gets lost in trivia. There are way too many chapters narrating issues that are only tangentially related to autism, such as the biographies of several scientists, the history of science fiction fandom, the personal habits of individuals, etc... In a way, such an obsessive focus on trivia might be appropriate to the subject matter, but the end result is a book that is a 100 pages too long. Thankfully, this is just about the only negative thing I can say about the book, aside from the aforementioned fact that the book - mostly out of necessity - speaks mostly in the language of parents and doctors, rather than the autistic people themselves. This carries the danger of misrepresenting them. Overall, I really enjoyed the book. Human beings live in a complex world. Our capacity to understand difference and diversity, even in our own communities, is limited. We have trouble coping with psychological and behavioural traits that do not fit into our established models. Coming to grips with autism - and other forms of neurodiversity, such as ADHD, psychopathy, manic depressive disorder, narcissism, schizophrenia, etc. - will be crucial in helping people with those conditions. It will also allow society to take full advantage of the unique skills that diverse people bring to society. Recognizing difference in our society is the first step; treating people with kindness is another. And the final step is putting diversity in the service of science, technology, business, and politics. "

In the enthralling NEUROTRIBES, journalist Steve Silberman takes readers on a sweeping journey through the history of autism, the hidden presence of autistic people in our society, and the dubious research methods used by psychologists searching for answers.In language that is elegant, engaging, and accessible, Silberman takes a humanizing look at the many people who shaped the conversation about autism before it was a formal diagnosis. We learn about the unconventional scientist Henry Cavendish, whose eccentricities belied a brilliant mind that altered scientific discourse. We also delve into the parallel lives and careers of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger (whom Asperger’s Syndrome is named after) and their complex lives and legacies. Silberman also depicts several disturbing elements of child abuse occurring within institutions for autistic children. Many of these passages are not for the faint of heart or for sensitive readers, but they are crucial in understanding the history of how autism was treated in our society. He also explores Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s destructive “study” alleging the MMR vaccine was linked to autism, which several reputable studies have since disproven. Wakefield’s faulty data gave rise to a movement of parents searching for a cure to autism—rather than pushing society to understand and make accommodations for their children.Through his in-depth research and accessible writing, Silberman communicates a powerful message: If we adjust our world to accommodate and make space for autistic people, they can change our world for the better. NEUROTRIBES is an informative, compelling, enlightening, and moving book you should read regardless of whether or not autism affects you, your family, or someone you know. And after reading it, you will likely learn that autism has indeed impacted your life in ways you never imagined."

48,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7325648-dan,5,"I have worked with autistic children for some years now but knew little of the history of the disorder. That has all changed now that I've read this excellent book. It's not entirely clear exactly what this book is about from the title but essentially it's a history of autism. It covers some people who were likely autistic long before the disorder was diagnosed, how Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner 'discovered' autism (independently), how Lorna Wing made diagnosis clearer than ever, how Rain Main ended up being made, the MMR scandal and much more besides. It feels quite a long book but when you consider just how much information it crams in it seems quite concise!There are several reasons this book works as well as it does. Silberman writes very neutrally, rarely giving an opinion on theories. There are plenty of uncomfortable sections of the book, from Kanner leading a surge of blaming parents' for autism to the attempt to cure autism with electric shock therapy. Silberman leaves the reader to decide the rights and wrongs by stating the evidence and quoting contemporaries. The author does a good job with his description of the autistic people included in the research. If you are very familiar with autism, like I am, he doesn't spend long periods time explaining many of the common traits of autism but he gives enough so that no matter how little you know of the disorder you can understand it. I also liked how much of the book focused on the autistic people themselves, something much of the research covered somehow failed to do. The book also helped me to refined my thoughts on autism and it's place in the world. For some readers I imagine it could completely changes their views on it. The book shows us how much value autistic people have added to our society and that they are not simply ""retarded"" as they were once considered. The idea that the human race wouldn't have evolved to where it is today without autistic people is a remarkable but plausible one. This is surely the best history of autism that exists. A challenging read at times, not least because of its length, but also due to views and actions that are incomprehensible today. But ultimately it's an inspiring one which celebrates autism for the remarkable way of thinking that it is."

It condemns the frankly barbaric methods used in early psychiatry, and never once forgets that at the core of all this talk about treatments and cures and diseases and plagues, are very real people with very real lives; who have real hopes and needs. Above all however, it highlights the deeply problematic attitudes ingrained in (western) society towards neurodivergent people, and puts those in a the broader historical context of psychiatry. The fact that it ends on a chapter dedicated to neurodiversity and self-advocacy is fantastic and wraps the whole thing up very neatly. "
50,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This is a bit of a slog to read, because it spends a lot of time lingering on details that you may or may not feel are relevant. It goes into the lives of the people who ‘discovered’ autism and described it clinically, much more than it goes into the lives of actual autistic people, and there’s one chapter I found rather troubling which follows the family of an autistic child. It focuses on their anguish and confusion, and their increasingly desperate attempts to “treat” their son with whatever unpleasant, pseudo-scientific methods they could find. By the end, I was desperate to hear that someone had actually ever asked the child what effect it had on him. (As far as I can tell, nobody did.) Those particular parents weren’t extreme, but nonetheless, I got very tired of their desperation to have a “normal” child.It also does some retrospective diagnosing of a couple of scientists and thinkers from days before there was such a diagnosis. I’m always a bit iffy on that: there do seem to be good grounds to make those judgements, but… most of the people I know now don’t know much about what goes on in my head and why I react the way I do. I don’t want them diagnosing me once I’m dead. Still, at least it does provide autistic models and heroes for people now.I’m also a little leery of the ubiquity of being on the spectrum in Silberman’s view. Lots of fandom, lots of engineers, maybe even most in the picture he’s painting — it’s a stereotype of fandom and of STEM that I haven’t necessarily found to be true. And fandom hasn’t been so very welcoming of actual neurodiverse people, either. If it’s ever been the perfect home for them, it isn’t now.All in all, though, I did find the book interesting, and the perspective on neurodiversity as something to be accommodated and used productively is one that’s definitely timely. Despite my criticisms, I found it an interesting book — and it definitely treats autism as a spectrum, touching all kinds of people. This definitely isn’t the attitudes of Autism Speaks: instead, Silberman urges understanding, accommodation and respect.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
51,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27045365-katy,4,"This is a book that needed to be written. As someone on the spectrum, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the ""autism as a disease"" rhetoric and focus on finding a cure instead of finding solutions to integrate autistic people into society. I happened to study psychology in undergraduate, a field I did not end up pursuing because I felt so alienated from it because of the way autism was talked about by my professors and peers. Nobody would believe me if I voiced my opinion on the potential harms of ""erasing"" autistic behavior, and why should they? Due to a lifetime of internalized ableism, I have grown to hate autistic aspects of myself, like my social awkwardness. Any attempts to prove that my autism was an acceptable part of who I am would just prove futile.This is the book that every psychology student, every social worker, and frankly everyone should read. It covers not only the history of autism but the beginnings of the neurodiversity movement and its momentum. It sheds light on the hoaxes and misinformation that people still believe today. This is the most comprehensive yet also humanizing work by a neurotypical writer on autism out there, and I'm glad it exists.That being said, the book does suffer from a lack of focus at points. I could've done without the digressions into the life stories of all the researchers who studied autism save Hans Asperger. There is too much focus on the history of how the autism diagnosis came to be, where the more meaty story comes from the neurodiversity movement (especially in defiance of false psychology), which is sadly only relegated as more of an afterthought even though I think it's the point Silberman was building up to starting with Hans Asperger. Despite the fact that many sections meander off-topic and therefore make it difficult to slog through, I still think this book is required reading because it offers such a holistic view on the fascinating history of how ""autism"" came to be and how it fits into the world. "
52,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29044542-jo-salas,5,"Essential reading for anyone involved with or concerned about autism--Silberman does a brilliant job of reframing this huge topic by telling the little-known story of how autism was discovered more or less simultaneously in the US, by Leo Kanner, and in Germany--Nazi Germany--by Hans Asperger. Kanner pathologized the condition and concluded it was very rare: Asperger thought it was a fascinating, often enriching, and common human condition. Tragically, his work was obscured by the era he lived in. In his writing he foregrounded a few very high-functioning kids in order to save many others from Hitler, who was murdering people considered disabled. It meant that for decades the few researchers and doctors who were aware of Asperger's work thought it related only to one end of the spectrum. Although Kanner's contribution was important as well, his very different analysis has led, directly and indirectly, to much of the panic and misinformation that shadows autism today. Thousands of lives could have been far happier if Asperger's rather than Kanner's interpretation had been the basis for further research and treatment. It is heartbreaking to read of the inadvertent cruelty inflicted by well-meaning but ill-informed people. There's much more to this story, of course: many other heroes (including autistic children and adults) and a few shocking villains. I hope the book changes the picture and allows us to embrace all ""neurotribes,"" and to emphasize lifelong resources and support, rather than a ""cure."" "

Because I decided I didn't have time and it was long and I had school work and a million other books to read. I'm an idiot. Seriously, I am. I should have just sacrificed the other books and gone for this one. Oh well. I read it now and that's what counts.I've always had an interest in autism and Asperger's, along with many other odd interests. Don't ask me about the others or we'd spend the whole review on them rather than this wonderful book. I did a lot of research on it once to accurately write a character I wanted to explore, but nothing really came of it. Now, I definitely want this book on my shelf when I have an actual office in the distant future. It's a handy book to tell people that autism has been around as long as humans have been and even as long as humans began recording history.This book was incredibly amazing to listen to because it takes you from early conceptions and case studies of actual historical people and modern day parents living with autistic children. Dotted throughout the real life stories, the conception of autism and how it was treated throughout history also was laid out and explained. I think that right now, as the book shows it, we're in a very good spot for autism. Right now, they're practically being hailed in popular TV shows with portrayals that speak to non-autistic (also called NTs in the autism community, which I loved) people. It can only keep going up."
54,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56704-ashley,0,"I wanted to love this book but I found it oddly incomplete for a 400+ page book. Ultimately, it may be that the subtitle over-promsied. This book is an excellent introduction to the history of autism and the diagnostic debates but it spend only one chapter on the future. Even the chapters on self-advocacy and patient rights came at the end and felt more focused on past victories than on how to work to create a more inclusive society going forward.""Neurotribes"" provides a cultural history of autism in western Europe and the United States from about 1700 to the present. I found the exclusive focus on white, western families disappointing. Although Silberman acknowledges that a diagnosis of autism is very different for poor families or families (especially boys) of color, he does not include these stories in the book or explicitly suggest that these families have a place in a neurodiverse world. These critiques aside, I am sure this is a book I will use in my teaching on autism, the vaccine ""controversy,"" and ableism. Silberman's text is deeply human and rich with individual stories, emotion, and compassion. I found that his account of dry, medical in-fighting managed to retain some of the passion its participants surely felt in the 1930s to the present. What it lacked in hard science it more than made up for in its cultural work. "
55,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502519-julie,4,"This book gave an historical perspective that released me from guilt and anxiety as a parent of a child on the spectrum. I understand now, that in 1999, when we got the diagnosis, that the 'experts' knew almost as little as we did. We did therapies, meds, IEPs, homeschooled, started a social group, changed diets, and held together as best we could. We did the best with what we knew, and I can see now that we did amazingly well considering the machines we were up against. I do feel like this book portrays too rosy of a picture. There is a profound loneliness. Maybe not all of our kids have a special talent. As a parent with tendencies of my own, that makes it hard to network and socialize in a way that brings opportunities to my child. There is a lot of emphasis on what can your child ""do"" to make them valuable, and this is a dangerous view. It can be frustrating when society thinks that if you are on the spectrum, you must have some supernatural talent for numbers, engineering, memorization, etc. There's also a mostly unaddressed issue of the parents or communities who don't go out of their way to be accommodating. What will happen when we aren't there to advocate? When one is unable to live independently, how will this generation manage? Ultimately, this is a positive, empowering book, and that's a good thing."
56,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1102217-jamie,4,"At close to 500 pages, this history of autism was exhaustive and at times exhausting. I had to put it down several times because the specificity of the stories but I'm grateful for the work and for having the experience. I don't have the details about Asperger and Kanner now (because my memory is not strong) but I've retained a sense for the ways these doctors were relentless in noticing their overlooked patients. I'm left with so much gratitude for those who have come before us, so many parents who were loving activists for their children, so many children whose lives were forgotten and misunderstood. My son with autism has incredible resources (not enough, of course, but what we have is pretty great) that are helping him live his best life and maximize his strengths so that he can get along in the world of people. I'm taken with the notion and reality of neurodiversity. Autism is not a monolith and it is not new. I love that Silberman ends with how much work there is to do regarding autism and people of color, epilepsy for people with autism who are considered intellectually disabled, and, for those who are not (like my son), mental health treatment. The statistic that people like my son are nine times more likely to commit suicide than neurotypical people hits too close to home. "

I don't know why I expected it to be about neurobiology or neurochemistry ... I guess that piece of word ""neuro"" in the title threw me off. Mr. Silberman has a degree in English, so he's a very good writer... but he's not at all a scientist of any sort. What a disappointment. He really is a wonderful writer and if I were interested in history, I'd love this book. I'll keep an eye out for future books of his if he writes about something more interesting. This book is a history of ASD, told entirely from a non-scientific perspective. It contains many mildly interesting stories of researchers and people with autism over the years. It touches superficially on the contributions to science, literature, and technology that a few famous people with autism have made to mainstream society. It really is probably a good book if you haven't read anything like it before. But you could probably just read his famous Wired article and get the gist. If you're super interested in the lives of famous people with autism, I'd suggest simply picking one and reading one of their biographies."

As someone currently investigating their own possible autism, this was truly an essential read. Rarely does work on autism focus so much on who autistic people are, and all that they have accomplished, rather tending to focus on limits of autism solely. One thing that stood out so much to me was the enormous scientific contribution to society made by autistic people, weighed against the sheer volume of bad science that has led to complete misunderstandings of the diagnosis and a focus on cures rather than provisions. Neurotribes spans the history of autism, through Asperger's and Kanner's work with autistic people, through to online support networks created by autistic people, gleefully mentioning the wonderful work of Oliver Sacks, Lorna Wing, and the representation of autistic people in the media, thanks to the film Rain Man and the works of Temple Grandin.I wholeheartedly recommend this, especially if you work with or know autistic people."
59,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15602974-chelsea-norton,5,"This is an incredibly well-researched book and one that I would highly recommend to all parents and teachers of autistic children. Inspiring at times and heartbreaking at others, this book chronicles the long journey of autism from obscurity to discovery to awareness and the evolution of its diagnostic criteria along the way. From the darkest periods of widespread institutionalization and horrific experiments to shining examples of brilliant autistic minds, loving families and positive steps forward in policy and advocacy, this book really covers it all.If your child has just been diagnosed, you’ll likely find that the internet is inundated with a whole lot of doom-and-gloom narratives perpetuated by self-pitying autism warrior parents and organizations like Autism Speaks. What a relief it is when you dig deeper and discover the vibrant, inclusive, autistic-led neurodiversity movement that celebrates your child’s neurology instead of dehumanizing it. Definitely read this book."
60,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3856605-rebecca-mcphedran,4,"I received this book as an advanced readers copy from NetGalley.A smart, accessible, comprehensive history of autism. Silberman does an amazing job of giving an in depth history of a medical condition that we only have just learned about within the last 70 years. His chapters run the gamut. From institutionalizations to special schools, from Asperger's initial findings, to Kanners complete appropriation of Asperger's ideas. He talks about the different treatments of Autism from electroshock therapy, to major antipsychotics, to biomedical interventions. He spends a lot of time on the words used to describe the diagnosis. He spends a lot of time on helping you get to know the individuals who helped shape the idea and diagnosis of autism. It is almost overwhelming, and sometimes it's hard to keep the players straight. I thoroughly enjoyed the end of the book, in which he talks about where autism is headed. It's headed in a new direction. The direction is not steered by parents of autistic children, as in the past, but by autistic individuals themselves. And this is exciting. We wouldn't be the enlightened, cultured civilization if not for the advancements that autistic people have given us. I feel like this book is a gift, to help us better understand our own human race, and the people who help shape our lives, in some unexpected ways. A great read if you are interested in the history of autism and human rights. "
61,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,5,"This is extremely good nonfiction. Although other reviewers have noted that it is a very long book, packed full of details, I found it to be extremely engaging, with only a few very short dull parts (it is hard to make changes to DSM criteria riveting, but actually Silberman did better than you could ever imagine). Silberman's writing voice is upbeat and entertaining, and a dense topic is made readable with lots of wonderful and colorful personal details and anecdotes. I don't know if this would be such a page-turner to someone with less personal interest in autism spectrum issues, but I found it absolutely compelling. In addition to being extremely well written, Silberman is consistently pro-autistic and his message of neurodiversity is powerful and very needed. It would be wrong to call it ""ground breaking"" - as some have - because he is just digesting and conveying ideas that have been out there for decades, but it is also impossible to underestimate the importance of getting those ideas out to a bigger audience. For that, it comes back to how wonderfully well written this book is, and Silberman deserves real credit. This is definitely one of my favorite nonfiction reads of 2015 and maybe for the past couple years. "
62,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,4,"The last two chapters of the book, which are about the movement for neurodiversity, are exemplary. The rest of the book is about the history of the psychologists who ""discovered"" autism in the early twentieth century, and the methods that parents and doctors thought would cure autistic people -- electroshock, corporal punishment, severe dietary restrictions (which is still trendy among ""leaky gut"" proponents). It was horrifying. Indeed, let others praise not-so ancient times, I am glad I was born in these.My one criticism is that the narrative isn't linear. In the span of a few pages, Silberman discussed events in one decade, backtracked to a previous decade, and returned to the initial decade. I didn't read very much during my time in Rome, but I finished during the flight home."
63,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/626748-leonard,2,"This is a book that cannot decide if it is a polemic or a report about the complex world of Autism and other neurologies. When a polemic, it is snarky and poorly reasoned, taking potshots at psychoanalysis and casting aspersions on researchers motivations without much to back them up. When it is reporting, it is informative and though provoking and has much to recommend it. I came away feeling that there was an axe being ground here, but was not clear what the axe was really. This could have been a much better book and so I was greatly disappointed."

Read this book."
65,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14219722-edoardo-albert,4,"As the father of two autistic boys, I've read more than my fair share of the burgeoning field of autistic books so it's a pleasure to find a new departure in reading on the subject. Up until now, most books on autism have fallen into one of three categories:1. the inspiring parental story of recovering a child from the depths of autistic disengagement via some new and unlikely therapy often involving animals and/or shamans;2. the inspiring autistic autobiography, telling how an autistic person overcame discrimination and misunderstanding to achieve personal autonomy and a good life;3. the how-to guide for parents with autistic children.Now Steve Silberman has added a third category: the history of autism as a medically recognised condition, from the physicians who first spotted it and struggled, more or less successfully, to describe, through the various therapies tried to cure/treat/ameliorate/accommodate it, to the split between different autistic 'camps' and schools, to about where we are now: a condition that has gone from almost nothing to almost everyday within two generations. As a history, it's generally excellent, although a little marred by Silberman's tendency to paint people as 'good guys' (Hans Asperger - the Austrian physician who first recognised the condition and pioneered a notably gentle and appreciative treatment) and 'bad guys' (Leo Kanner - Austrian-American psychiatrist who popularised a restrictive view of autism in America whom Silberger basically accuses of stealing Asperger's work). The reality seems greyer and harder to define, particularly in light of recent evidence that Asperger fell into the morally grey areas of a doctor working under the Nazi regime: he seems to have sent at least two of his children to the Spiegelgrund clinic knowing that they would likely be euthanised there, while managing to protect most of the children under his care. The history of autism thus becomes entwined with the history of the century and the changing nature of medical theorising: from restrictive diagnoses that sought to exclude those who were borderline to diagnoses that now tend to bring far more children within a diagnostic framework. What is clear, is that autism is a spectrum, with many of its traits being potentially highly useful. I do sometimes wonder, as a parent, whether the insight that drove the MMR anxiety that linked the vaccine to the increase in levels of autism might have other sources. It's quite common for parents of autistic children to think they are developing normally and then, at an early age but usually somewhere between one and three, for there to be a sudden falling off in the child's development: the first of many subsequent meltdowns. I remember that with the eldest of my two autistic sons. In his case, the decline coincided with his starting at school. Now autism is a developmental disorder and I wonder if one possible factor in its increase is the earlier and earlier ages at which we are putting children into school. For any child, and particularly for boys, the sudden move from the predictable and stable environment of home, dealing mainly with parents and siblings, into the far less predictable environment of school where volatile peers are the main source of interaction might cause a social-system overload leading to a massive withdrawal from social and linguistic learning as the child tries desperately to accommodate and cope with the sudden huge increase in stimuli, both physical and sensory. If there's any truth in this idea, then countries where children begin school later should have lower rates of autism. It would be interesting to see if this bears out. In the meantime, read Silberman's book if you want to know how autism, as a medically recognised condition with a wide and often competing range of therapies, arrived at its present stage. For all our difficulties today, it's still a huge improvement over the days of 'refrigerator mothers' when much of the medical profession basically blamed the parents for the child's condition or some of the frankly horrible 'cures' devised by the Behaviourist. It also serves as a useful reminder that the real expert is one who understands that he still has much to learn about a subject."
66,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"This is definitely more a book about the history of autism than it is a book about autism itself, so if you're looking for the nitty gritty of what it means to be on the spectrum or how the brain works, it's probably better to look elsewhere. NeuroTribes seems to have mainly been written in response to all the hubbub in recent years by the contingent claiming that there is an autism epidemic and that it is being caused by vaccinations. Silberman looks back at how long autism has existed (probably pretty much as long as people have existed), including looking back at a number of historical figures that were most likely autistic, like Henry Cavendish and Paul Dirac. Then he goes into all the details of how it's been diagnosed over the course of the last couple hundred years and why the fact that more and more people are being diagnosed with it now than ever before doesn't mean that more people are actually autistic than ever before; it's just that recent corrections in diagnostic guidelines have made it easier for people to receive ""on the spectrum"" diagnoses, and therefore more people are now able to gain access to the support and services they need. Silberman goes through all of this in a very balanced way, and without demonizing anyone, recognizing that the data can seem misleading, and that parents on both sides just want what's best for their kids. But I love that he does bend the focus more towards working on gaining support and services for people with autism and their families than working towards finding a cure for autism. His opinion, and I think what a lot of his research shows, is that people on the autism spectrum have made and continue to make a lot of really important contributions, especially in the fields of science and technology, but in lots of other areas as well, not in spite of the ways their minds work, but because of it, and that we're all just working on different operating systems. I like that description a lot.Anyway, this is a really good look through how our view of autism has changed throughout history, as well as how it's been diagnosed and treated. And definitely well worth a read if you're looking for a fairly balanced account of how and why the whole vaccinations-might-cause-autism debate began."

Any accomplished educator is well aware that no two students are alike. Devising curriculum and instruction to meet the needs of a classroom full of independent thinkers and learners is a challenge to say the least. I was one who lived for that challenge and, in retirement, still teach two classes a semester at a community college. I am most alive in the classroom and thrive on the challenges of diversity. During my last five years in public high school education, I taught in an inclusion classroom with an exceptional special education teacher who taught me more in those few years than any other educator over the course of my career!Steve Silberman's book is a revelation! It validates so much of what I have come to believe as an educator. His work is well-researched and well-written for anyone to access. The history of neurodiversity is filled with tragedy, but is overwhelmingly full of the ""aha!"" moments that make life so interesting. This book is for everyone who is alive on our world today! We share space with others who are as diverse as we are and with whom we need to learn to create the future. In reading this book, we recognize ourselves, significant others, friends, relatives, colleagues, and fascinating strangers. In negotiating our way through life, we have to embrace diversity around us in all of its may facets, including the diversity in the working of the minds around us.My real hope is that this and other books like it will lead to the revolution in education so may of us have been seeking which will provide comprehensive change to meet the needs of every individual mind entering a school or classroom. Individual Education Plans for EVERY student should not be a dream of the few, but a reality that can not happen soon enough.

68,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5531911-brandy,5,"I enjoyed the book very much for what it is, a non-fiction book primarily focused on the history of autism. Most professionals (therapists, teachers, psychiatrists, etc.) could probably benefit from it. Autistics themselves may enjoy the book for the extensive level of detail Mr. Silberman goes into. Or if you enjoy history of disability rights, psychology books, or non-fiction in general it's worth reading. I finished it rather quickly since it's engrossing and moves smoothly. Some of it may be familiar territory to people with an extensive knowledge of psychiatry history (such as the bit about refrigerator mothers) but much of it is new and fresh information not previously included in any books. I'd consider it an essential reading on neurodiversity as well. My only caveat is I wouldn't really recommend it as an introduction to autism, since it's heavy on history and short on practical advice. So, if you're a parent of a newly diagnosed offspring, I'd direct you towards The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism first. Or if you are an adult newly diagnosed, ""Been There. Done That. Try This!: An Aspie's Guide to Life on Earth"" by Tony Attwood is a more practical starting point."

If I had known what I was getting into, I probably wouldn't have read it, at 542 pages. Still, I enjoyed this as a philosophy of science, as the descriptions of varying perceptions of autistics, as they currently like being called, over the course of the almost 100 years that they have been described. These varying descriptions and their implications are themselves fascinating. Kanner was the dominant early voice in the US.Kanner: ""Overambitious parents like the Tripletts had “stuffed” the impressionable minds of their children with useless information to cast themselves in a culturally favorable light and bolster their own egos"" (p. 190). He ""turned the detailed notes that parents had provided to him—which were so helpful in developing a clear picture of their children’s development—into a weapon, citing them as a “telling illustration of parental obsessiveness.”"" (p. 190)Asperger preceded Kanner, but his view of autistic children was more benign. It was also lost during WW2 and rediscovered later.Asperger: “Not everything that steps out of the line, and is thus ‘abnormal,’ must necessarily be ‘inferior.’” ""This boy’s difficulties—which particularly affect his relationships with himself and other people—are the price that he has to pay for his special gifts” (p. 128).It matters how we see these children (and adults), right? Are they low functioning, severely affected, or profoundly impaired or a “high-octane boy,” as one parent argued? Are the parents the cause of problems, as Kanner and Theodore and Ruth Lidz argued, or are they their children's supports? Some more quotes:Rudolf Ekstein: ""Tommy’s precocious interest in science was likely the result of “early childhood intensive sexual traumata” caused by seduction by his mother or a nursemaid"" (p. 211). Bernard Rimland: “Brightness gone awry” (p. 272)Ivar Lovaas (who believed you should punish self-injury): ""Once you had taken it upon yourself to physically strike a child, you were morally responsible for his fate. “No one punishes who isn’t prepared to devote a major part of his life to that child. Nobody punishes a child who doesn’t also love that child,” he told a reporter. “Once you lay your hand on a child it morally obligates you to work with that child. You see, that is one of the reasons that people stay away from punishment—they don’t want to commit themselves. After you hit a kid you can’t just get up and leave him; you are hooked to that kid.”"" (pp. 312-313)George Rekers and Ivar Lovaas: ""It’s easier to change a child’s behavior than it is to destigmatize that behavior in society—whether it’s limp wrists or flapping hands."" (p. 323)Barry Morrow:  “What Bill taught me... is that not only do people like Bill need society, society needs people like Bill.” (p. 363)Judith Gould: “We were not surprised when people started saying it was an epidemic. Obviously, by broadening the spectrum, you’re going to get higher numbers."" (p. 421)Temple Grandin: ""A “handicap” rather than a mental illness, invoking the humanizing language of disability over the stigmatizing lexicon of psychiatry"" (p. 426). Oliver Sacks: Their autism, “while it may be seen as a medical condition, and pathologized as a syndrome, must also be seen as a whole mode of being, a deeply different mode or identity, one that needs to be conscious (and proud) of itself.” (p. 430)Walter Spitzer: ""Autism as “a terminal illness . . . a dead soul in a live body.”"" (p. 431)Jim Sinclair: “Being autistic does not mean being inhuman. But it means that what is normal for other people is not normal for me, and what is normal for me is not normal for other people.”[I'm like] “an extraterrestrial stranded without an orientation manual” (p. 437)Laura Tyroncik: “Neurotypical syndrome is a neurobiological disorder characterized by preoccupation with social concerns, delusions of superiority, and obsession with conformity... There is no known cure.” (p. 441)Jim Sinclair: “Saying ‘person with autism’ suggests that autism is something bad—so bad that it isn’t even consistent with being a person...We talk about left-handed people, not ‘people with left-handedness,’ and about athletic or musical people, not about ‘people with athleticism’ or ‘people with musicality’ . . . It is only when someone has decided that the characteristic being referred to is negative that suddenly people want to separate it from the person.” (p. 441)Susan Moreno: ""Her life had been enriched in ways that she could never have predicted by coping with the challenges of raising Beth."" (p. 444)Ivar Lovaas: ""a normal child trapped within the “autistic shell,” waiting to be rescued.Dan Grover: “The goal is to alleviate those with Asperger’s from this pressure that they need to conform,” Grover said in the press release. “What is best is to learn how to use your uniqueness to your advantage and find your place in the world.” (p. 455)Ari Ne'eman: ""Not “symptoms” of his autism, but problems built into the ways that society treats people who don’t meet the standard expectations of “normal.”"" (p. 458)Carol Greenberg: “When I look at my son,” she says, “I think, ‘He’s not broken. He’s just neurologically outnumbered, like me.’” (p. 467).Do we understand autism? We have, at least, some interesting and useful understandings – and some that are not."

Silberman's book explains how recent this insight is, how controversial it remains, and how bumpy the road has been. The diagnostic history of the concept of autism (and related diagnoses) makes for an interesting story that deals with human tragedy, political struggle, and scientific discovery. Silberman has written an engaging book that gives readers a better understanding of the convoluted history of the condition and the importance of the social struggles of ""neurodiverse"" people.Since autistic people often (but not always) have a difficulty communicating and representing themselves in society, it is important that books that deal with the issue respect the source material - i.e. the patients and their families, with their very real human emotions and passions. In this regard, the book does a pretty good job. The copious anecdotes and tales of the daily life of autistic people remind us of the individuality and humanity of autistic people, including even the most uncommunicative (or differently communicative) individuals. That said, Silberman understandably focuses more on the parents and their struggles, on the one hand, and the doctors and their ambitions, on the other hand, rather than the inscrutable inner life of autistic people. The story focuses mostly on the dual stories of Leo Kenner and Hans Asperger, the two independent co-discovers of diagnostic autism. Their different interpretations and visions of the nature of the disorder (or, less disparagingly, the personality type) have shaped treatment options, medical practices, social attitudes, and social policies that have impacted the lives of autistic people. This story is absolutely fascinating. It contains insights about the often convoluted shape of the history of science, the importance of constructing a coherent and humane social narrative, the dangers of false beliefs, the social value of psychological difference (""neurodiversity""), and the importance of hearing multiple viewpoints in highlighting different aspects of the same phenomenon.The book is quite long. Sometimes I wish that it had pruned its narrative. The big picture often gets lost in trivia. There are way too many chapters narrating issues that are only tangentially related to autism, such as the biographies of several scientists, the history of science fiction fandom, the personal habits of individuals, etc... In a way, such an obsessive focus on trivia might be appropriate to the subject matter, but the end result is a book that is a 100 pages too long. Thankfully, this is just about the only negative thing I can say about the book, aside from the aforementioned fact that the book - mostly out of necessity - speaks mostly in the language of parents and doctors, rather than the autistic people themselves. This carries the danger of misrepresenting them. Overall, I really enjoyed the book. Human beings live in a complex world. Our capacity to understand difference and diversity, even in our own communities, is limited. We have trouble coping with psychological and behavioural traits that do not fit into our established models. Coming to grips with autism - and other forms of neurodiversity, such as ADHD, psychopathy, manic depressive disorder, narcissism, schizophrenia, etc. - will be crucial in helping people with those conditions. It will also allow society to take full advantage of the unique skills that diverse people bring to society. Recognizing difference in our society is the first step; treating people with kindness is another. And the final step is putting diversity in the service of science, technology, business, and politics. "
74,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7400591-writer-s-relief,5,"Autism is a disorder that, while prevalent in our society, we still know little about. In the enthralling NEUROTRIBES, journalist Steve Silberman takes readers on a sweeping journey through the history of autism, the hidden presence of autistic people in our society, and the dubious research methods used by psychologists searching for answers.In language that is elegant, engaging, and accessible, Silberman takes a humanizing look at the many people who shaped the conversation about autism before it was a formal diagnosis. We learn about the unconventional scientist Henry Cavendish, whose eccentricities belied a brilliant mind that altered scientific discourse. We also delve into the parallel lives and careers of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger (whom Asperger’s Syndrome is named after) and their complex lives and legacies. Silberman also depicts several disturbing elements of child abuse occurring within institutions for autistic children. Many of these passages are not for the faint of heart or for sensitive readers, but they are crucial in understanding the history of how autism was treated in our society. He also explores Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s destructive “study” alleging the MMR vaccine was linked to autism, which several reputable studies have since disproven. Wakefield’s faulty data gave rise to a movement of parents searching for a cure to autism—rather than pushing society to understand and make accommodations for their children.Through his in-depth research and accessible writing, Silberman communicates a powerful message: If we adjust our world to accommodate and make space for autistic people, they can change our world for the better. NEUROTRIBES is an informative, compelling, enlightening, and moving book you should read regardless of whether or not autism affects you, your family, or someone you know. And after reading it, you will likely learn that autism has indeed impacted your life in ways you never imagined."

It took me such a long time because it is so information heavy that I could only read a couple pages in a day because I wouldn’t want to overload on information. It was shocking to see how disabled people have been treated throughout history. And to learn more about autism as it is such a wide spectrum. “If you meet one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism.” Though I definitely would’ve wanted to learn more about autism in that sense, where this book focused instead more on the history. It became super confusing to follow the timeline, especially jumping between years and countries. Though I don’t regret reading it I’ll probably only retain like 10% of the information xD"
78,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7325648-dan,5,"I have worked with autistic children for some years now but knew little of the history of the disorder. That has all changed now that I've read this excellent book. It's not entirely clear exactly what this book is about from the title but essentially it's a history of autism. It covers some people who were likely autistic long before the disorder was diagnosed, how Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner 'discovered' autism (independently), how Lorna Wing made diagnosis clearer than ever, how Rain Main ended up being made, the MMR scandal and much more besides. It feels quite a long book but when you consider just how much information it crams in it seems quite concise!There are several reasons this book works as well as it does. Silberman writes very neutrally, rarely giving an opinion on theories. There are plenty of uncomfortable sections of the book, from Kanner leading a surge of blaming parents' for autism to the attempt to cure autism with electric shock therapy. Silberman leaves the reader to decide the rights and wrongs by stating the evidence and quoting contemporaries. The author does a good job with his description of the autistic people included in the research. If you are very familiar with autism, like I am, he doesn't spend long periods time explaining many of the common traits of autism but he gives enough so that no matter how little you know of the disorder you can understand it. I also liked how much of the book focused on the autistic people themselves, something much of the research covered somehow failed to do. The book also helped me to refined my thoughts on autism and it's place in the world. For some readers I imagine it could completely changes their views on it. The book shows us how much value autistic people have added to our society and that they are not simply ""retarded"" as they were once considered. The idea that the human race wouldn't have evolved to where it is today without autistic people is a remarkable but plausible one. This is surely the best history of autism that exists. A challenging read at times, not least because of its length, but also due to views and actions that are incomprehensible today. But ultimately it's an inspiring one which celebrates autism for the remarkable way of thinking that it is."
79,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53177731-anouk,5,"Not only does this book give an incredibly detailed overview of the various medical and social concepts of autism over the last century, but it manages to do so in a way that is, for once, respectful of autistic and other neurodivergent people. It condemns the frankly barbaric methods used in early psychiatry, and never once forgets that at the core of all this talk about treatments and cures and diseases and plagues, are very real people with very real lives; who have real hopes and needs. Above all however, it highlights the deeply problematic attitudes ingrained in (western) society towards neurodivergent people, and puts those in a the broader historical context of psychiatry. The fact that it ends on a chapter dedicated to neurodiversity and self-advocacy is fantastic and wraps the whole thing up very neatly. "
80,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This is a bit of a slog to read, because it spends a lot of time lingering on details that you may or may not feel are relevant. It goes into the lives of the people who ‘discovered’ autism and described it clinically, much more than it goes into the lives of actual autistic people, and there’s one chapter I found rather troubling which follows the family of an autistic child. It focuses on their anguish and confusion, and their increasingly desperate attempts to “treat” their son with whatever unpleasant, pseudo-scientific methods they could find. By the end, I was desperate to hear that someone had actually ever asked the child what effect it had on him. (As far as I can tell, nobody did.) Those particular parents weren’t extreme, but nonetheless, I got very tired of their desperation to have a “normal” child.It also does some retrospective diagnosing of a couple of scientists and thinkers from days before there was such a diagnosis. I’m always a bit iffy on that: there do seem to be good grounds to make those judgements, but… most of the people I know now don’t know much about what goes on in my head and why I react the way I do. I don’t want them diagnosing me once I’m dead. Still, at least it does provide autistic models and heroes for people now.I’m also a little leery of the ubiquity of being on the spectrum in Silberman’s view. Lots of fandom, lots of engineers, maybe even most in the picture he’s painting — it’s a stereotype of fandom and of STEM that I haven’t necessarily found to be true. And fandom hasn’t been so very welcoming of actual neurodiverse people, either. If it’s ever been the perfect home for them, it isn’t now.All in all, though, I did find the book interesting, and the perspective on neurodiversity as something to be accommodated and used productively is one that’s definitely timely. Despite my criticisms, I found it an interesting book — and it definitely treats autism as a spectrum, touching all kinds of people. This definitely isn’t the attitudes of Autism Speaks: instead, Silberman urges understanding, accommodation and respect.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
81,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27045365-katy,4,"This is a book that needed to be written. As someone on the spectrum, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the ""autism as a disease"" rhetoric and focus on finding a cure instead of finding solutions to integrate autistic people into society. I happened to study psychology in undergraduate, a field I did not end up pursuing because I felt so alienated from it because of the way autism was talked about by my professors and peers. Nobody would believe me if I voiced my opinion on the potential harms of ""erasing"" autistic behavior, and why should they? Due to a lifetime of internalized ableism, I have grown to hate autistic aspects of myself, like my social awkwardness. Any attempts to prove that my autism was an acceptable part of who I am would just prove futile.This is the book that every psychology student, every social worker, and frankly everyone should read. It covers not only the history of autism but the beginnings of the neurodiversity movement and its momentum. It sheds light on the hoaxes and misinformation that people still believe today. This is the most comprehensive yet also humanizing work by a neurotypical writer on autism out there, and I'm glad it exists.That being said, the book does suffer from a lack of focus at points. I could've done without the digressions into the life stories of all the researchers who studied autism save Hans Asperger. There is too much focus on the history of how the autism diagnosis came to be, where the more meaty story comes from the neurodiversity movement (especially in defiance of false psychology), which is sadly only relegated as more of an afterthought even though I think it's the point Silberman was building up to starting with Hans Asperger. Despite the fact that many sections meander off-topic and therefore make it difficult to slog through, I still think this book is required reading because it offers such a holistic view on the fascinating history of how ""autism"" came to be and how it fits into the world. "
82,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29044542-jo-salas,5,"Essential reading for anyone involved with or concerned about autism--Silberman does a brilliant job of reframing this huge topic by telling the little-known story of how autism was discovered more or less simultaneously in the US, by Leo Kanner, and in Germany--Nazi Germany--by Hans Asperger. Kanner pathologized the condition and concluded it was very rare: Asperger thought it was a fascinating, often enriching, and common human condition. Tragically, his work was obscured by the era he lived in. In his writing he foregrounded a few very high-functioning kids in order to save many others from Hitler, who was murdering people considered disabled. It meant that for decades the few researchers and doctors who were aware of Asperger's work thought it related only to one end of the spectrum. Although Kanner's contribution was important as well, his very different analysis has led, directly and indirectly, to much of the panic and misinformation that shadows autism today. Thousands of lives could have been far happier if Asperger's rather than Kanner's interpretation had been the basis for further research and treatment. It is heartbreaking to read of the inadvertent cruelty inflicted by well-meaning but ill-informed people. There's much more to this story, of course: many other heroes (including autistic children and adults) and a few shocking villains. I hope the book changes the picture and allows us to embrace all ""neurotribes,"" and to emphasize lifelong resources and support, rather than a ""cure."" "

Because I decided I didn't have time and it was long and I had school work and a million other books to read. I'm an idiot. Seriously, I am. I should have just sacrificed the other books and gone for this one. Oh well. I read it now and that's what counts.I've always had an interest in autism and Asperger's, along with many other odd interests. Don't ask me about the others or we'd spend the whole review on them rather than this wonderful book. I did a lot of research on it once to accurately write a character I wanted to explore, but nothing really came of it. Now, I definitely want this book on my shelf when I have an actual office in the distant future. It's a handy book to tell people that autism has been around as long as humans have been and even as long as humans began recording history.This book was incredibly amazing to listen to because it takes you from early conceptions and case studies of actual historical people and modern day parents living with autistic children. Dotted throughout the real life stories, the conception of autism and how it was treated throughout history also was laid out and explained. I think that right now, as the book shows it, we're in a very good spot for autism. Right now, they're practically being hailed in popular TV shows with portrayals that speak to non-autistic (also called NTs in the autism community, which I loved) people. It can only keep going up."

This book is an excellent introduction to the history of autism and the diagnostic debates but it spend only one chapter on the future. Even the chapters on self-advocacy and patient rights came at the end and felt more focused on past victories than on how to work to create a more inclusive society going forward.""Neurotribes"" provides a cultural history of autism in western Europe and the United States from about 1700 to the present. I found the exclusive focus on white, western families disappointing. Although Silberman acknowledges that a diagnosis of autism is very different for poor families or families (especially boys) of color, he does not include these stories in the book or explicitly suggest that these families have a place in a neurodiverse world. These critiques aside, I am sure this is a book I will use in my teaching on autism, the vaccine ""controversy,"" and ableism. Silberman's text is deeply human and rich with individual stories, emotion, and compassion. I found that his account of dry, medical in-fighting managed to retain some of the passion its participants surely felt in the 1930s to the present. What it lacked in hard science it more than made up for in its cultural work. "
85,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502519-julie,4,"This book gave an historical perspective that released me from guilt and anxiety as a parent of a child on the spectrum. I understand now, that in 1999, when we got the diagnosis, that the 'experts' knew almost as little as we did. We did therapies, meds, IEPs, homeschooled, started a social group, changed diets, and held together as best we could. We did the best with what we knew, and I can see now that we did amazingly well considering the machines we were up against. I do feel like this book portrays too rosy of a picture. There is a profound loneliness. Maybe not all of our kids have a special talent. As a parent with tendencies of my own, that makes it hard to network and socialize in a way that brings opportunities to my child. There is a lot of emphasis on what can your child ""do"" to make them valuable, and this is a dangerous view. It can be frustrating when society thinks that if you are on the spectrum, you must have some supernatural talent for numbers, engineering, memorization, etc. There's also a mostly unaddressed issue of the parents or communities who don't go out of their way to be accommodating. What will happen when we aren't there to advocate? When one is unable to live independently, how will this generation manage?

I don't have the details about Asperger and Kanner now (because my memory is not strong) but I've retained a sense for the ways these doctors were relentless in noticing their overlooked patients. I'm left with so much gratitude for those who have come before us, so many parents who were loving activists for their children, so many children whose lives were forgotten and misunderstood. My son with autism has incredible resources (not enough, of course, but what we have is pretty great) that are helping him live his best life and maximize his strengths so that he can get along in the world of people. I'm taken with the notion and reality of neurodiversity. Autism is not a monolith and it is not new. I love that Silberman ends with how much work there is to do regarding autism and people of color, epilepsy for people with autism who are considered intellectually disabled, and, for those who are not (like my son), mental health treatment. The statistic that people like my son are nine times more likely to commit suicide than neurotypical people hits too close to home. "

I don't know why I expected it to be about neurobiology or neurochemistry ... I guess that piece of word ""neuro"" in the title threw me off. Mr. Silberman has a degree in English, so he's a very good writer... but he's not at all a scientist of any sort. What a disappointment. He really is a wonderful writer and if I were interested in history, I'd love this book. I'll keep an eye out for future books of his if he writes about something more interesting. This book is a history of ASD, told entirely from a non-scientific perspective. It contains many mildly interesting stories of researchers and people with autism over the years. It touches superficially on the contributions to science, literature, and technology that a few famous people with autism have made to mainstream society. It really is probably a good book if you haven't read anything like it before. But you could probably just read his famous Wired article and get the gist.

As someone currently investigating their own possible autism, this was truly an essential read. Rarely does work on autism focus so much on who autistic people are, and all that they have accomplished, rather tending to focus on limits of autism solely. One thing that stood out so much to me was the enormous scientific contribution to society made by autistic people, weighed against the sheer volume of bad science that has led to complete misunderstandings of the diagnosis and a focus on cures rather than provisions. Neurotribes spans the history of autism, through Asperger's and Kanner's work with autistic people, through to online support networks created by autistic people, gleefully mentioning the wonderful work of Oliver Sacks, Lorna Wing, and the representation of autistic people in the media, thanks to the film Rain Man and the works of Temple Grandin.I wholeheartedly recommend this, especially if you work with or know autistic people."

From the darkest periods of widespread institutionalization and horrific experiments to shining examples of brilliant autistic minds, loving families and positive steps forward in policy and advocacy, this book really covers it all.If your child has just been diagnosed, you’ll likely find that the internet is inundated with a whole lot of doom-and-gloom narratives perpetuated by self-pitying autism warrior parents and organizations like Autism Speaks. What a relief it is when you dig deeper and discover the vibrant, inclusive, autistic-led neurodiversity movement that celebrates your child’s neurology instead of dehumanizing it.

Silberman does an amazing job of giving an in depth history of a medical condition that we only have just learned about within the last 70 years. His chapters run the gamut. From institutionalizations to special schools, from Asperger's initial findings, to Kanners complete appropriation of Asperger's ideas. He talks about the different treatments of Autism from electroshock therapy, to major antipsychotics, to biomedical interventions. He spends a lot of time on the words used to describe the diagnosis. He spends a lot of time on helping you get to know the individuals who helped shape the idea and diagnosis of autism. It is almost overwhelming, and sometimes it's hard to keep the players straight. I thoroughly enjoyed the end of the book, in which he talks about where autism is headed. It's headed in a new direction. The direction is not steered by parents of autistic children, as in the past, but by autistic individuals themselves. And this is exciting. We wouldn't be the enlightened, cultured civilization if not for the advancements that autistic people have given us. I feel like this book is a gift, to help us better understand our own human race, and the people who help shape our lives, in some unexpected ways. A great read if you are interested in the history of autism and human rights. "

Although other reviewers have noted that it is a very long book, packed full of details, I found it to be extremely engaging, with only a few very short dull parts (it is hard to make changes to DSM criteria riveting, but actually Silberman did better than you could ever imagine). Silberman's writing voice is upbeat and entertaining, and a dense topic is made readable with lots of wonderful and colorful personal details and anecdotes. I don't know if this would be such a page-turner to someone with less personal interest in autism spectrum issues, but I found it absolutely compelling. In addition to being extremely well written, Silberman is consistently pro-autistic and his message of neurodiversity is powerful and very needed. It would be wrong to call it ""ground breaking"" - as some have - because he is just digesting and conveying ideas that have been out there for decades, but it is also impossible to underestimate the importance of getting those ideas out to a bigger audience. For that, it comes back to how wonderfully well written this book is, and Silberman deserves real credit. This is definitely one of my favorite nonfiction reads of 2015 and maybe for the past couple years. "

The rest of the book is about the history of the psychologists who ""discovered"" autism in the early twentieth century, and the methods that parents and doctors thought would cure autistic people -- electroshock, corporal punishment, severe dietary restrictions (which is still trendy among ""leaky gut"" proponents). It was horrifying. Indeed, let others praise not-so ancient times, I am glad I was born in these.My one criticism is that the narrative isn't linear. In the span of a few pages, Silberman discussed events in one decade, backtracked to a previous decade, and returned to the initial decade.

Up until now, most books on autism have fallen into one of three categories:1. the inspiring parental story of recovering a child from the depths of autistic disengagement via some new and unlikely therapy often involving animals and/or shamans;2. the inspiring autistic autobiography, telling how an autistic person overcame discrimination and misunderstanding to achieve personal autonomy and a good life;3. the how-to guide for parents with autistic children.Now Steve Silberman has added a third category: the history of autism as a medically recognised condition, from the physicians who first spotted it and struggled, more or less successfully, to describe, through the various therapies tried to cure/treat/ameliorate/accommodate it, to the split between different autistic 'camps' and schools, to about where we are now: a condition that has gone from almost nothing to almost everyday within two generations. As a history, it's generally excellent, although a little marred by Silberman's tendency to paint people as 'good guys' (Hans Asperger - the Austrian physician who first recognised the condition and pioneered a notably gentle and appreciative treatment) and 'bad guys' (Leo Kanner - Austrian-American psychiatrist who popularised a restrictive view of autism in America whom Silberger basically accuses of stealing Asperger's work). The reality seems greyer and harder to define, particularly in light of recent evidence that Asperger fell into the morally grey areas of a doctor working under the Nazi regime: he seems to have sent at least two of his children to the Spiegelgrund clinic knowing that they would likely be euthanised there, while managing to protect most of the children under his care. The history of autism thus becomes entwined with the history of the century and the changing nature of medical theorising: from restrictive diagnoses that sought to exclude those who were borderline to diagnoses that now tend to bring far more children within a diagnostic framework. What is clear, is that autism is a spectrum, with many of its traits being potentially highly useful. I do sometimes wonder, as a parent, whether the insight that drove the MMR anxiety that linked the vaccine to the increase in levels of autism might have other sources. It's quite common for parents of autistic children to think they are developing normally and then, at an early age but usually somewhere between one and three, for there to be a sudden falling off in the child's development: the first of many subsequent meltdowns. I remember that with the eldest of my two autistic sons. In his case, the decline coincided with his starting at school. Now autism is a developmental disorder and I wonder if one possible factor in its increase is the earlier and earlier ages at which we are putting children into school. For any child, and particularly for boys, the sudden move from the predictable and stable environment of home, dealing mainly with parents and siblings, into the far less predictable environment of school where volatile peers are the main source of interaction might cause a social-system overload leading to a massive withdrawal from social and linguistic learning as the child tries desperately to accommodate and cope with the sudden huge increase in stimuli, both physical and sensory. If there's any truth in this idea, then countries where children begin school later should have lower rates of autism. It would be interesting to see if this bears out. In the meantime, read Silberman's book if you want to know how autism, as a medically recognised condition with a wide and often competing range of therapies, arrived at its present stage. For all our difficulties today, it's still a huge improvement over the days of 'refrigerator mothers' when much of the medical profession basically blamed the parents for the child's condition or some of the frankly horrible 'cures' devised by the Behaviourist. It also serves as a useful reminder that the real expert is one who understands that he still has much to learn about a subject."
96,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"This is definitely more a book about the history of autism than it is a book about autism itself, so if you're looking for the nitty gritty of what it means to be on the spectrum or how the brain works, it's probably better to look elsewhere. NeuroTribes seems to have mainly been written in response to all the hubbub in recent years by the contingent claiming that there is an autism epidemic and that it is being caused by vaccinations. Silberman looks back at how long autism has existed (probably pretty much as long as people have existed), including looking back at a number of historical figures that were most likely autistic, like Henry Cavendish and Paul Dirac. Then he goes into all the details of how it's been diagnosed over the course of the last couple hundred years and why the fact that more and more people are being diagnosed with it now than ever before doesn't mean that more people are actually autistic than ever before; it's just that recent corrections in diagnostic guidelines have made it easier for people to receive ""on the spectrum"" diagnoses, and therefore more people are now able to gain access to the support and services they need. Silberman goes through all of this in a very balanced way, and without demonizing anyone, recognizing that the data can seem misleading, and that parents on both sides just want what's best for their kids. But I love that he does bend the focus more towards working on gaining support and services for people with autism and their families than working towards finding a cure for autism. His opinion, and I think what a lot of his research shows, is that people on the autism spectrum have made and continue to make a lot of really important contributions, especially in the fields of science and technology, but in lots of other areas as well, not in spite of the ways their minds work, but because of it, and that we're all just working on different operating systems. I like that description a lot.Anyway, this is a really good look through how our view of autism has changed throughout history, as well as how it's been diagnosed and treated. And definitely well worth a read if you're looking for a fairly balanced account of how and why the whole vaccinations-might-cause-autism debate began."

Any accomplished educator is well aware that no two students are alike. Devising curriculum and instruction to meet the needs of a classroom full of independent thinkers and learners is a challenge to say the least. I was one who lived for that challenge and, in retirement, still teach two classes a semester at a community college. I am most alive in the classroom and thrive on the challenges of diversity. During my last five years in public high school education, I taught in an inclusion classroom with an exceptional special education teacher who taught me more in those few years than any other educator over the course of my career!Steve Silberman's book is a revelation! It validates so much of what I have come to believe as an educator. His work is well-researched and well-written for anyone to access. The history of neurodiversity is filled with tragedy, but is overwhelmingly full of the ""aha!"" moments that make life so interesting. This book is for everyone who is alive on our world today! We share space with others who are as diverse as we are and with whom we need to learn to create the future. In reading this book, we recognize ourselves, significant others, friends, relatives, colleagues, and fascinating strangers. In negotiating our way through life, we have to embrace diversity around us in all of its may facets, including the diversity in the working of the minds around us.My real hope is that this and other books like it will lead to the revolution in education so may of us have been seeking which will provide comprehensive change to meet the needs of every individual mind entering a school or classroom. Individual Education Plans for EVERY student should not be a dream of the few, but a reality that can not happen soon enough. Certainly all of the very diverse people populating this book and our world make this inevitable!"
98,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5531911-brandy,5,"I enjoyed the book very much for what it is, a non-fiction book primarily focused on the history of autism. Most professionals (therapists, teachers, psychiatrists, etc.) could probably benefit from it. Autistics themselves may enjoy the book for the extensive level of detail Mr. Silberman goes into. Or if you enjoy history of disability rights, psychology books, or non-fiction in general it's worth reading. I finished it rather quickly since it's engrossing and moves smoothly. Some of it may be familiar territory to people with an extensive knowledge of psychiatry history (such as the bit about refrigerator mothers) but much of it is new and fresh information not previously included in any books. I'd consider it an essential reading on neurodiversity as well. My only caveat is I wouldn't really recommend it as an introduction to autism, since it's heavy on history and short on practical advice. So, if you're a parent of a newly diagnosed offspring, I'd direct you towards The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism first. Or if you are an adult newly diagnosed, ""Been There. Done That. Try This!: An Aspie's Guide to Life on Earth"" by Tony Attwood is a more practical starting point."

Much more readable than you would think for a book on this subject and a must read for anyone with an interest in it."

This is a great book for parents or family members who have a child/person on the spectrum, in their lives. Silberman starts with historical anecdotes which paves the way for the modern advocacy groups that provide help and guidance. I went in blind without much background. This is a remarkable book that humanizes the struggles of guardians, social workers, family units, and celebrates the victories the communities experiences at large. "

102,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"Although it was not clear to me in the title or even in the earliest chapters, Neurotribes is a history of the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. If I had known what I was getting into, I probably wouldn't have read it, at 542 pages. Still, I enjoyed this as a philosophy of science, as the descriptions of varying perceptions of autistics, as they currently like being called, over the course of the almost 100 years that they have been described. These varying descriptions and their implications are themselves fascinating. Kanner was the dominant early voice in the US.Kanner: ""Overambitious parents like the Tripletts had “stuffed” the impressionable minds of their children with useless information to cast themselves in a culturally favorable light and bolster their own egos"" (p. 190). He ""turned the detailed notes that parents had provided to him—which were so helpful in developing a clear picture of their children’s development—into a weapon, citing them as a “telling illustration of parental obsessiveness.”"" (p. 190)Asperger preceded Kanner, but his view of autistic children was more benign. It was also lost during WW2 and rediscovered later.Asperger: “Not everything that steps out of the line, and is thus ‘abnormal,’ must necessarily be ‘inferior.’” ""This boy’s difficulties—which particularly affect his relationships with himself and other people—are the price that he has to pay for his special gifts” (p. 128).It matters how we see these children (and adults), right? Are they low functioning, severely affected, or profoundly impaired or a “high-octane boy,” as one parent argued? Are the parents the cause of problems, as Kanner and Theodore and Ruth Lidz argued, or are they their children's supports? Some more quotes:Rudolf Ekstein: ""Tommy’s precocious interest in science was likely the result of “early childhood intensive sexual traumata” caused by seduction by his mother or a nursemaid"" (p. 211). Bernard Rimland: “Brightness gone awry” (p. 272)Ivar Lovaas (who believed you should punish self-injury): ""Once you had taken it upon yourself to physically strike a child, you were morally responsible for his fate. “No one punishes who isn’t prepared to devote a major part of his life to that child. Nobody punishes a child who doesn’t also love that child,” he told a reporter. “Once you lay your hand on a child it morally obligates you to work with that child. You see, that is one of the reasons that people stay away from punishment—they don’t want to commit themselves. After you hit a kid you can’t just get up and leave him; you are hooked to that kid.”"" (pp. 312-313)George Rekers and Ivar Lovaas: ""It’s easier to change a child’s behavior than it is to destigmatize that behavior in society—whether it’s limp wrists or flapping hands."" (p. 323)Barry Morrow:  “What Bill taught me... is that not only do people like Bill need society, society needs people like Bill.” (p. 363)Judith Gould: “We were not surprised when people started saying it was an epidemic. Obviously, by broadening the spectrum, you’re going to get higher numbers."" (p. 421)Temple Grandin: ""A “handicap” rather than a mental illness, invoking the humanizing language of disability over the stigmatizing lexicon of psychiatry"" (p. 426). Oliver Sacks: Their autism, “while it may be seen as a medical condition, and pathologized as a syndrome, must also be seen as a whole mode of being, a deeply different mode or identity, one that needs to be conscious (and proud) of itself.” (p. 430)Walter Spitzer: ""Autism as “a terminal illness . . . a dead soul in a live body.”"" (p. 431)Jim Sinclair: “Being autistic does not mean being inhuman. But it means that what is normal for other people is not normal for me, and what is normal for me is not normal for other people.”[I'm like] “an extraterrestrial stranded without an orientation manual” (p. 437)Laura Tyroncik: “Neurotypical syndrome is a neurobiological disorder characterized by preoccupation with social concerns, delusions of superiority, and obsession with conformity... There is no known cure.” (p. 441)Jim Sinclair: “Saying ‘person with autism’ suggests that autism is something bad—so bad that it isn’t even consistent with being a person...We talk about left-handed people, not ‘people with left-handedness,’ and about athletic or musical people, not about ‘people with athleticism’ or ‘people with musicality’ . . . It is only when someone has decided that the characteristic being referred to is negative that suddenly people want to separate it from the person.” (p. 441)Susan Moreno: ""Her life had been enriched in ways that she could never have predicted by coping with the challenges of raising Beth."" (p. 444)Ivar Lovaas: ""a normal child trapped within the “autistic shell,” waiting to be rescued.Dan Grover: “The goal is to alleviate those with Asperger’s from this pressure that they need to conform,” Grover said in the press release. “What is best is to learn how to use your uniqueness to your advantage and find your place in the world.” (p. 455)Ari Ne'eman: ""Not “symptoms” of his autism, but problems built into the ways that society treats people who don’t meet the standard expectations of “normal.”"" (p. 458)Carol Greenberg: “When I look at my son,” she says, “I think, ‘He’s not broken. He’s just neurologically outnumbered, like me.’” (p. 467).Do we understand autism? We have, at least, some interesting and useful understandings – and some that are not."
103,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"In pop psychology, nothing appears as self-evident as the statement that ""autism is a spectrum."" Silberman's book explains how recent this insight is, how controversial it remains, and how bumpy the road has been. The diagnostic history of the concept of autism (and related diagnoses) makes for an interesting story that deals with human tragedy, political struggle, and scientific discovery. Silberman has written an engaging book that gives readers a better understanding of the convoluted history of the condition and the importance of the social struggles of ""neurodiverse"" people.Since autistic people often (but not always) have a difficulty communicating and representing themselves in society, it is important that books that deal with the issue respect the source material - i.e. the patients and their families, with their very real human emotions and passions. In this regard, the book does a pretty good job. The copious anecdotes and tales of the daily life of autistic people remind us of the individuality and humanity of autistic people, including even the most uncommunicative (or differently communicative) individuals. That said, Silberman understandably focuses more on the parents and their struggles, on the one hand, and the doctors and their ambitions, on the other hand, rather than the inscrutable inner life of autistic people. The story focuses mostly on the dual stories of Leo Kenner and Hans Asperger, the two independent co-discovers of diagnostic autism. Their different interpretations and visions of the nature of the disorder (or, less disparagingly, the personality type) have shaped treatment options, medical practices, social attitudes, and social policies that have impacted the lives of autistic people. This story is absolutely fascinating. It contains insights about the often convoluted shape of the history of science, the importance of constructing a coherent and humane social narrative, the dangers of false beliefs, the social value of psychological difference (""neurodiversity""), and the importance of hearing multiple viewpoints in highlighting different aspects of the same phenomenon.The book is quite long. Sometimes I wish that it had pruned its narrative. The big picture often gets lost in trivia. There are way too many chapters narrating issues that are only tangentially related to autism, such as the biographies of several scientists, the history of science fiction fandom, the personal habits of individuals, etc... In a way, such an obsessive focus on trivia might be appropriate to the subject matter, but the end result is a book that is a 100 pages too long. Thankfully, this is just about the only negative thing I can say about the book, aside from the aforementioned fact that the book - mostly out of necessity - speaks mostly in the language of parents and doctors, rather than the autistic people themselves. This carries the danger of misrepresenting them. Overall, I really enjoyed the book. Human beings live in a complex world. Our capacity to understand difference and diversity, even in our own communities, is limited. We have trouble coping with psychological and behavioural traits that do not fit into our established models. Coming to grips with autism - and other forms of neurodiversity, such as ADHD, psychopathy, manic depressive disorder, narcissism, schizophrenia, etc. - will be crucial in helping people with those conditions. It will also allow society to take full advantage of the unique skills that diverse people bring to society. Recognizing difference in our society is the first step; treating people with kindness is another. And the final step is putting diversity in the service of science, technology, business, and politics. "
104,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7400591-writer-s-relief,5,"Autism is a disorder that, while prevalent in our society, we still know little about. In the enthralling NEUROTRIBES, journalist Steve Silberman takes readers on a sweeping journey through the history of autism, the hidden presence of autistic people in our society, and the dubious research methods used by psychologists searching for answers.In language that is elegant, engaging, and accessible, Silberman takes a humanizing look at the many people who shaped the conversation about autism before it was a formal diagnosis. We learn about the unconventional scientist Henry Cavendish, whose eccentricities belied a brilliant mind that altered scientific discourse. We also delve into the parallel lives and careers of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger (whom Asperger’s Syndrome is named after) and their complex lives and legacies. Silberman also depicts several disturbing elements of child abuse occurring within institutions for autistic children. Many of these passages are not for the faint of heart or for sensitive readers, but they are crucial in understanding the history of how autism was treated in our society. He also explores Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s destructive “study” alleging the MMR vaccine was linked to autism, which several reputable studies have since disproven. Wakefield’s faulty data gave rise to a movement of parents searching for a cure to autism—rather than pushing society to understand and make accommodations for their children.Through his in-depth research and accessible writing, Silberman communicates a powerful message: If we adjust our world to accommodate and make space for autistic people, they can change our world for the better. NEUROTRIBES is an informative, compelling, enlightening, and moving book you should read regardless of whether or not autism affects you, your family, or someone you know. And after reading it, you will likely learn that autism has indeed impacted your life in ways you never imagined."

It took me such a long time because it is so information heavy that I could only read a couple pages in a day because I wouldn’t want to overload on information. It was shocking to see how disabled people have been treated throughout history. And to learn more about autism as it is such a wide spectrum. “If you meet one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism.” Though I definitely would’ve wanted to learn more about autism in that sense, where this book focused instead more on the history. It became super confusing to follow the timeline, especially jumping between years and countries. Though I don’t regret reading it I’ll probably only retain like 10% of the information xD"
108,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7325648-dan,5,"I have worked with autistic children for some years now but knew little of the history of the disorder. That has all changed now that I've read this excellent book. It's not entirely clear exactly what this book is about from the title but essentially it's a history of autism. It covers some people who were likely autistic long before the disorder was diagnosed, how Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner 'discovered' autism (independently), how Lorna Wing made diagnosis clearer than ever, how Rain Main ended up being made, the MMR scandal and much more besides. It feels quite a long book but when you consider just how much information it crams in it seems quite concise!There are several reasons this book works as well as it does. Silberman writes very neutrally, rarely giving an opinion on theories. There are plenty of uncomfortable sections of the book, from Kanner leading a surge of blaming parents' for autism to the attempt to cure autism with electric shock therapy. Silberman leaves the reader to decide the rights and wrongs by stating the evidence and quoting contemporaries. The author does a good job with his description of the autistic people included in the research. If you are very familiar with autism, like I am, he doesn't spend long periods time explaining many of the common traits of autism but he gives enough so that no matter how little you know of the disorder you can understand it. I also liked how much of the book focused on the autistic people themselves, something much of the research covered somehow failed to do. The book also helped me to refined my thoughts on autism and it's place in the world. For some readers I imagine it could completely changes their views on it. The book shows us how much value autistic people have added to our society and that they are not simply ""retarded"" as they were once considered. The idea that the human race wouldn't have evolved to where it is today without autistic people is a remarkable but plausible one. This is surely the best history of autism that exists. A challenging read at times, not least because of its length, but also due to views and actions that are incomprehensible today. But ultimately it's an inspiring one which celebrates autism for the remarkable way of thinking that it is."
109,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53177731-anouk,5,"Not only does this book give an incredibly detailed overview of the various medical and social concepts of autism over the last century, but it manages to do so in a way that is, for once, respectful of autistic and other neurodivergent people. It condemns the frankly barbaric methods used in early psychiatry, and never once forgets that at the core of all this talk about treatments and cures and diseases and plagues, are very real people with very real lives; who have real hopes and needs. Above all however, it highlights the deeply problematic attitudes ingrained in (western) society towards neurodivergent people, and puts those in a the broader historical context of psychiatry. The fact that it ends on a chapter dedicated to neurodiversity and self-advocacy is fantastic and wraps the whole thing up very neatly. "
110,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This is a bit of a slog to read, because it spends a lot of time lingering on details that you may or may not feel are relevant. It goes into the lives of the people who ‘discovered’ autism and described it clinically, much more than it goes into the lives of actual autistic people, and there’s one chapter I found rather troubling which follows the family of an autistic child. It focuses on their anguish and confusion, and their increasingly desperate attempts to “treat” their son with whatever unpleasant, pseudo-scientific methods they could find. By the end, I was desperate to hear that someone had actually ever asked the child what effect it had on him. (As far as I can tell, nobody did.) Those particular parents weren’t extreme, but nonetheless, I got very tired of their desperation to have a “normal” child.It also does some retrospective diagnosing of a couple of scientists and thinkers from days before there was such a diagnosis. I’m always a bit iffy on that: there do seem to be good grounds to make those judgements, but… most of the people I know now don’t know much about what goes on in my head and why I react the way I do. I don’t want them diagnosing me once I’m dead. Still, at least it does provide autistic models and heroes for people now.I’m also a little leery of the ubiquity of being on the spectrum in Silberman’s view. Lots of fandom, lots of engineers, maybe even most in the picture he’s painting — it’s a stereotype of fandom and of STEM that I haven’t necessarily found to be true. And fandom hasn’t been so very welcoming of actual neurodiverse people, either. If it’s ever been the perfect home for them, it isn’t now.All in all, though, I did find the book interesting, and the perspective on neurodiversity as something to be accommodated and used productively is one that’s definitely timely. Despite my criticisms, I found it an interesting book — and it definitely treats autism as a spectrum, touching all kinds of people. This definitely isn’t the attitudes of Autism Speaks: instead, Silberman urges understanding, accommodation and respect.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
111,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27045365-katy,4,"This is a book that needed to be written. As someone on the spectrum, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the ""autism as a disease"" rhetoric and focus on finding a cure instead of finding solutions to integrate autistic people into society. I happened to study psychology in undergraduate, a field I did not end up pursuing because I felt so alienated from it because of the way autism was talked about by my professors and peers. Nobody would believe me if I voiced my opinion on the potential harms of ""erasing"" autistic behavior, and why should they? Due to a lifetime of internalized ableism, I have grown to hate autistic aspects of myself, like my social awkwardness. Any attempts to prove that my autism was an acceptable part of who I am would just prove futile.This is the book that every psychology student, every social worker, and frankly everyone should read. It covers not only the history of autism but the beginnings of the neurodiversity movement and its momentum. It sheds light on the hoaxes and misinformation that people still believe today. This is the most comprehensive yet also humanizing work by a neurotypical writer on autism out there, and I'm glad it exists.That being said, the book does suffer from a lack of focus at points. I could've done without the digressions into the life stories of all the researchers who studied autism save Hans Asperger. There is too much focus on the history of how the autism diagnosis came to be, where the more meaty story comes from the neurodiversity movement (especially in defiance of false psychology), which is sadly only relegated as more of an afterthought even though I think it's the point Silberman was building up to starting with Hans Asperger. Despite the fact that many sections meander off-topic and therefore make it difficult to slog through, I still think this book is required reading because it offers such a holistic view on the fascinating history of how ""autism"" came to be and how it fits into the world. "
112,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29044542-jo-salas,5,"Essential reading for anyone involved with or concerned about autism--Silberman does a brilliant job of reframing this huge topic by telling the little-known story of how autism was discovered more or less simultaneously in the US, by Leo Kanner, and in Germany--Nazi Germany--by Hans Asperger. Kanner pathologized the condition and concluded it was very rare: Asperger thought it was a fascinating, often enriching, and common human condition. Tragically, his work was obscured by the era he lived in. In his writing he foregrounded a few very high-functioning kids in order to save many others from Hitler, who was murdering people considered disabled. It meant that for decades the few researchers and doctors who were aware of Asperger's work thought it related only to one end of the spectrum. Although Kanner's contribution was important as well, his very different analysis has led, directly and indirectly, to much of the panic and misinformation that shadows autism today. Thousands of lives could have been far happier if Asperger's rather than Kanner's interpretation had been the basis for further research and treatment. It is heartbreaking to read of the inadvertent cruelty inflicted by well-meaning but ill-informed people. There's much more to this story, of course: many other heroes (including autistic children and adults) and a few shocking villains. I hope the book changes the picture and allows us to embrace all ""neurotribes,"" and to emphasize lifelong resources and support, rather than a ""cure."" "

I should have just sacrificed the other books and gone for this one. Oh well. I read it now and that's what counts.I've always had an interest in autism and Asperger's, along with many other odd interests. Don't ask me about the others or we'd spend the whole review on them rather than this wonderful book. I did a lot of research on it once to accurately write a character I wanted to explore, but nothing really came of it. Now, I definitely want this book on my shelf when I have an actual office in the distant future. It's a handy book to tell people that autism has been around as long as humans have been and even as long as humans began recording history.This book was incredibly amazing to listen to because it takes you from early conceptions and case studies of actual historical people and modern day parents living with autistic children. Dotted throughout the real life stories, the conception of autism and how it was treated throughout history also was laid out and explained. I think that right now, as the book shows it, we're in a very good spot for autism. Right now, they're practically being hailed in popular TV shows with portrayals that speak to non-autistic (also called NTs in the autism community, which I loved) people. It can only keep going up."
114,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56704-ashley,0,"I wanted to love this book but I found it oddly incomplete for a 400+ page book. Ultimately, it may be that the subtitle over-promsied. This book is an excellent introduction to the history of autism and the diagnostic debates but it spend only one chapter on the future. Even the chapters on self-advocacy and patient rights came at the end and felt more focused on past victories than on how to work to create a more inclusive society going forward.""Neurotribes"" provides a cultural history of autism in western Europe and the United States from about 1700 to the present. I found the exclusive focus on white, western families disappointing. Although Silberman acknowledges that a diagnosis of autism is very different for poor families or families (especially boys) of color, he does not include these stories in the book or explicitly suggest that these families have a place in a neurodiverse world. These critiques aside, I am sure this is a book I will use in my teaching on autism, the vaccine ""controversy,"" and ableism. Silberman's text is deeply human and rich with individual stories, emotion, and compassion. I found that his account of dry, medical in-fighting managed to retain some of the passion its participants surely felt in the 1930s to the present. What it lacked in hard science it more than made up for in its cultural work. "
115,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502519-julie,4,"This book gave an historical perspective that released me from guilt and anxiety as a parent of a child on the spectrum. I understand now, that in 1999, when we got the diagnosis, that the 'experts' knew almost as little as we did. We did therapies, meds, IEPs, homeschooled, started a social group, changed diets, and held together as best we could. We did the best with what we knew, and I can see now that we did amazingly well considering the machines we were up against. I do feel like this book portrays too rosy of a picture. There is a profound loneliness. Maybe not all of our kids have a special talent. As a parent with tendencies of my own, that makes it hard to network and socialize in a way that brings opportunities to my child. There is a lot of emphasis on what can your child ""do"" to make them valuable, and this is a dangerous view. It can be frustrating when society thinks that if you are on the spectrum, you must have some supernatural talent for numbers, engineering, memorization, etc. There's also a mostly unaddressed issue of the parents or communities who don't go out of their way to be accommodating. What will happen when we aren't there to advocate? When one is unable to live independently, how will this generation manage? Ultimately, this is a positive, empowering book, and that's a good thing."

I had to put it down several times because the specificity of the stories but I'm grateful for the work and for having the experience. I don't have the details about Asperger and Kanner now (because my memory is not strong) but I've retained a sense for the ways these doctors were relentless in noticing their overlooked patients. I'm left with so much gratitude for those who have come before us, so many parents who were loving activists for their children, so many children whose lives were forgotten and misunderstood. My son with autism has incredible resources (not enough, of course, but what we have is pretty great) that are helping him live his best life and maximize his strengths so that he can get along in the world of people. I'm taken with the notion and reality of neurodiversity. Autism is not a monolith and it is not new. I love that Silberman ends with how much work there is to do regarding autism and people of color, epilepsy for people with autism who are considered intellectually disabled, and, for those who are not (like my son), mental health treatment. The statistic that people like my son are nine times more likely to commit suicide than neurotypical people hits too close to home. "

I don't know why I expected it to be about neurobiology or neurochemistry ... I guess that piece of word ""neuro"" in the title threw me off. Mr. Silberman has a degree in English, so he's a very good writer... but he's not at all a scientist of any sort. What a disappointment. He really is a wonderful writer and if I were interested in history, I'd love this book. I'll keep an eye out for future books of his if he writes about something more interesting. This book is a history of ASD, told entirely from a non-scientific perspective. It contains many mildly interesting stories of researchers and people with autism over the years. It touches superficially on the contributions to science, literature, and technology that a few famous people with autism have made to mainstream society. It really is probably a good book if you haven't read anything like it before. But you could probably just read his famous Wired article and get the gist. If you're super interested in the lives of famous people with autism, I'd suggest simply picking one and reading one of their biographies."

As someone currently investigating their own possible autism, this was truly an essential read. Rarely does work on autism focus so much on who autistic people are, and all that they have accomplished, rather tending to focus on limits of autism solely. One thing that stood out so much to me was the enormous scientific contribution to society made by autistic people, weighed against the sheer volume of bad science that has led to complete misunderstandings of the diagnosis and a focus on cures rather than provisions. Neurotribes spans the history of autism, through Asperger's and Kanner's work with autistic people, through to online support networks created by autistic people, gleefully mentioning the wonderful work of Oliver Sacks, Lorna Wing, and the representation of autistic people in the media, thanks to the film Rain Man and the works of Temple Grandin.I wholeheartedly recommend this, especially if you work with or know autistic people."

Inspiring at times and heartbreaking at others, this book chronicles the long journey of autism from obscurity to discovery to awareness and the evolution of its diagnostic criteria along the way. From the darkest periods of widespread institutionalization and horrific experiments to shining examples of brilliant autistic minds, loving families and positive steps forward in policy and advocacy, this book really covers it all.If your child has just been diagnosed, you’ll likely find that the internet is inundated with a whole lot of doom-and-gloom narratives perpetuated by self-pitying autism warrior parents and organizations like Autism Speaks. What a relief it is when you dig deeper and discover the vibrant, inclusive, autistic-led neurodiversity movement that celebrates your child’s neurology instead of dehumanizing it. Definitely read this book."
120,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3856605-rebecca-mcphedran,4,"I received this book as an advanced readers copy from NetGalley.A smart, accessible, comprehensive history of autism. Silberman does an amazing job of giving an in depth history of a medical condition that we only have just learned about within the last 70 years. His chapters run the gamut. From institutionalizations to special schools, from Asperger's initial findings, to Kanners complete appropriation of Asperger's ideas. He talks about the different treatments of Autism from electroshock therapy, to major antipsychotics, to biomedical interventions. He spends a lot of time on the words used to describe the diagnosis. He spends a lot of time on helping you get to know the individuals who helped shape the idea and diagnosis of autism. It is almost overwhelming, and sometimes it's hard to keep the players straight. I thoroughly enjoyed the end of the book, in which he talks about where autism is headed. It's headed in a new direction. The direction is not steered by parents of autistic children, as in the past, but by autistic individuals themselves. And this is exciting. We wouldn't be the enlightened, cultured civilization if not for the advancements that autistic people have given us. I feel like this book is a gift, to help us better understand our own human race, and the people who help shape our lives, in some unexpected ways. A great read if you are interested in the history of autism and human rights. "
121,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,5,"This is extremely good nonfiction. Although other reviewers have noted that it is a very long book, packed full of details, I found it to be extremely engaging, with only a few very short dull parts (it is hard to make changes to DSM criteria riveting, but actually Silberman did better than you could ever imagine). Silberman's writing voice is upbeat and entertaining, and a dense topic is made readable with lots of wonderful and colorful personal details and anecdotes. I don't know if this would be such a page-turner to someone with less personal interest in autism spectrum issues, but I found it absolutely compelling. In addition to being extremely well written, Silberman is consistently pro-autistic and his message of neurodiversity is powerful and very needed. It would be wrong to call it ""ground breaking"" - as some have - because he is just digesting and conveying ideas that have been out there for decades, but it is also impossible to underestimate the importance of getting those ideas out to a bigger audience. For that, it comes back to how wonderfully well written this book is, and Silberman deserves real credit. This is definitely one of my favorite nonfiction reads of 2015 and maybe for the past couple years. "
122,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,4,"The last two chapters of the book, which are about the movement for neurodiversity, are exemplary. The rest of the book is about the history of the psychologists who ""discovered"" autism in the early twentieth century, and the methods that parents and doctors thought would cure autistic people -- electroshock, corporal punishment, severe dietary restrictions (which is still trendy among ""leaky gut"" proponents). It was horrifying. Indeed, let others praise not-so ancient times, I am glad I was born in these.My one criticism is that the narrative isn't linear. In the span of a few pages, Silberman discussed events in one decade, backtracked to a previous decade, and returned to the initial decade. I didn't read very much during my time in Rome, but I finished during the flight home."
123,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/626748-leonard,2,"This is a book that cannot decide if it is a polemic or a report about the complex world of Autism and other neurologies. When a polemic, it is snarky and poorly reasoned, taking potshots at psychoanalysis and casting aspersions on researchers motivations without much to back them up. When it is reporting, it is informative and though provoking and has much to recommend it. I came away feeling that there was an axe being ground here, but was not clear what the axe was really. This could have been a much better book and so I was greatly disappointed."

Read this book."
125,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14219722-edoardo-albert,4,"As the father of two autistic boys, I've read more than my fair share of the burgeoning field of autistic books so it's a pleasure to find a new departure in reading on the subject. Up until now, most books on autism have fallen into one of three categories:1. the inspiring parental story of recovering a child from the depths of autistic disengagement via some new and unlikely therapy often involving animals and/or shamans;2. the inspiring autistic autobiography, telling how an autistic person overcame discrimination and misunderstanding to achieve personal autonomy and a good life;3. the how-to guide for parents with autistic children.Now Steve Silberman has added a third category: the history of autism as a medically recognised condition, from the physicians who first spotted it and struggled, more or less successfully, to describe, through the various therapies tried to cure/treat/ameliorate/accommodate it, to the split between different autistic 'camps' and schools, to about where we are now: a condition that has gone from almost nothing to almost everyday within two generations. As a history, it's generally excellent, although a little marred by Silberman's tendency to paint people as 'good guys' (Hans Asperger - the Austrian physician who first recognised the condition and pioneered a notably gentle and appreciative treatment) and 'bad guys' (Leo Kanner - Austrian-American psychiatrist who popularised a restrictive view of autism in America whom Silberger basically accuses of stealing Asperger's work). The reality seems greyer and harder to define, particularly in light of recent evidence that Asperger fell into the morally grey areas of a doctor working under the Nazi regime: he seems to have sent at least two of his children to the Spiegelgrund clinic knowing that they would likely be euthanised there, while managing to protect most of the children under his care. The history of autism thus becomes entwined with the history of the century and the changing nature of medical theorising: from restrictive diagnoses that sought to exclude those who were borderline to diagnoses that now tend to bring far more children within a diagnostic framework. What is clear, is that autism is a spectrum, with many of its traits being potentially highly useful. I do sometimes wonder, as a parent, whether the insight that drove the MMR anxiety that linked the vaccine to the increase in levels of autism might have other sources. It's quite common for parents of autistic children to think they are developing normally and then, at an early age but usually somewhere between one and three, for there to be a sudden falling off in the child's development: the first of many subsequent meltdowns. I remember that with the eldest of my two autistic sons. In his case, the decline coincided with his starting at school. Now autism is a developmental disorder and I wonder if one possible factor in its increase is the earlier and earlier ages at which we are putting children into school. For any child, and particularly for boys, the sudden move from the predictable and stable environment of home, dealing mainly with parents and siblings, into the far less predictable environment of school where volatile peers are the main source of interaction might cause a social-system overload leading to a massive withdrawal from social and linguistic learning as the child tries desperately to accommodate and cope with the sudden huge increase in stimuli, both physical and sensory. If there's any truth in this idea, then countries where children begin school later should have lower rates of autism. It would be interesting to see if this bears out. In the meantime, read Silberman's book if you want to know how autism, as a medically recognised condition with a wide and often competing range of therapies, arrived at its present stage. For all our difficulties today, it's still a huge improvement over the days of 'refrigerator mothers' when much of the medical profession basically blamed the parents for the child's condition or some of the frankly horrible 'cures' devised by the Behaviourist. It also serves as a useful reminder that the real expert is one who understands that he still has much to learn about a subject."
126,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"This is definitely more a book about the history of autism than it is a book about autism itself, so if you're looking for the nitty gritty of what it means to be on the spectrum or how the brain works, it's probably better to look elsewhere. NeuroTribes seems to have mainly been written in response to all the hubbub in recent years by the contingent claiming that there is an autism epidemic and that it is being caused by vaccinations. Silberman looks back at how long autism has existed (probably pretty much as long as people have existed), including looking back at a number of historical figures that were most likely autistic, like Henry Cavendish and Paul Dirac. Then he goes into all the details of how it's been diagnosed over the course of the last couple hundred years and why the fact that more and more people are being diagnosed with it now than ever before doesn't mean that more people are actually autistic than ever before; it's just that recent corrections in diagnostic guidelines have made it easier for people to receive ""on the spectrum"" diagnoses, and therefore more people are now able to gain access to the support and services they need. Silberman goes through all of this in a very balanced way, and without demonizing anyone, recognizing that the data can seem misleading, and that parents on both sides just want what's best for their kids. But I love that he does bend the focus more towards working on gaining support and services for people with autism and their families than working towards finding a cure for autism. His opinion, and I think what a lot of his research shows, is that people on the autism spectrum have made and continue to make a lot of really important contributions, especially in the fields of science and technology, but in lots of other areas as well, not in spite of the ways their minds work, but because of it, and that we're all just working on different operating systems. I like that description a lot.Anyway, this is a really good look through how our view of autism has changed throughout history, as well as how it's been diagnosed and treated. And definitely well worth a read if you're looking for a fairly balanced account of how and why the whole vaccinations-might-cause-autism debate began."
127,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7874958-joleigh,5,"Teaching high school for over thirty years made me more than aware of neurodiversity. Any accomplished educator is well aware that no two students are alike. Devising curriculum and instruction to meet the needs of a classroom full of independent thinkers and learners is a challenge to say the least. I was one who lived for that challenge and, in retirement, still teach two classes a semester at a community college. I am most alive in the classroom and thrive on the challenges of diversity. During my last five years in public high school education, I taught in an inclusion classroom with an exceptional special education teacher who taught me more in those few years than any other educator over the course of my career!Steve Silberman's book is a revelation! It validates so much of what I have come to believe as an educator. His work is well-researched and well-written for anyone to access. The history of neurodiversity is filled with tragedy, but is overwhelmingly full of the ""aha!"" moments that make life so interesting. This book is for everyone who is alive on our world today! We share space with others who are as diverse as we are and with whom we need to learn to create the future. In reading this book, we recognize ourselves, significant others, friends, relatives, colleagues, and fascinating strangers. In negotiating our way through life, we have to embrace diversity around us in all of its may facets, including the diversity in the working of the minds around us.My real hope is that this and other books like it will lead to the revolution in education so may of us have been seeking which will provide comprehensive change to meet the needs of every individual mind entering a school or classroom. Individual Education Plans for EVERY student should not be a dream of the few, but a reality that can not happen soon enough. Certainly all of the very diverse people populating this book and our world make this inevitable!"
128,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5531911-brandy,5,"I enjoyed the book very much for what it is, a non-fiction book primarily focused on the history of autism. Most professionals (therapists, teachers, psychiatrists, etc.) could probably benefit from it. Autistics themselves may enjoy the book for the extensive level of detail Mr. Silberman goes into. Or if you enjoy history of disability rights, psychology books, or non-fiction in general it's worth reading. I finished it rather quickly since it's engrossing and moves smoothly. Some of it may be familiar territory to people with an extensive knowledge of psychiatry history (such as the bit about refrigerator mothers) but much of it is new and fresh information not previously included in any books. I'd consider it an essential reading on neurodiversity as well. My only caveat is I wouldn't really recommend it as an introduction to autism, since it's heavy on history and short on practical advice. So, if you're a parent of a newly diagnosed offspring, I'd direct you towards The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism first. Or if you are an adult newly diagnosed, ""Been There. Done That. Try This!: An Aspie's Guide to Life on Earth"" by Tony Attwood is a more practical starting point."

If I had known what I was getting into, I probably wouldn't have read it, at 542 pages. Still, I enjoyed this as a philosophy of science, as the descriptions of varying perceptions of autistics, as they currently like being called, over the course of the almost 100 years that they have been described. These varying descriptions and their implications are themselves fascinating. Kanner was the dominant early voice in the US.Kanner: ""Overambitious parents like the Tripletts had “stuffed” the impressionable minds of their children with useless information to cast themselves in a culturally favorable light and bolster their own egos"" (p. 190). He ""turned the detailed notes that parents had provided to him—which were so helpful in developing a clear picture of their children’s development—into a weapon, citing them as a “telling illustration of parental obsessiveness.”"" (p. 190)Asperger preceded Kanner, but his view of autistic children was more benign. It was also lost during WW2 and rediscovered later.Asperger: “Not everything that steps out of the line, and is thus ‘abnormal,’ must necessarily be ‘inferior.’” ""This boy’s difficulties—which particularly affect his relationships with himself and other people—are the price that he has to pay for his special gifts” (p. 128).It matters how we see these children (and adults), right? Are they low functioning, severely affected, or profoundly impaired or a “high-octane boy,” as one parent argued? Are the parents the cause of problems, as Kanner and Theodore and Ruth Lidz argued, or are they their children's supports? Some more quotes:Rudolf Ekstein: ""Tommy’s precocious interest in science was likely the result of “early childhood intensive sexual traumata” caused by seduction by his mother or a nursemaid"" (p. 211). Bernard Rimland: “Brightness gone awry” (p. 272)Ivar Lovaas (who believed you should punish self-injury): ""Once you had taken it upon yourself to physically strike a child, you were morally responsible for his fate. “No one punishes who isn’t prepared to devote a major part of his life to that child. Nobody punishes a child who doesn’t also love that child,” he told a reporter. “Once you lay your hand on a child it morally obligates you to work with that child. You see, that is one of the reasons that people stay away from punishment—they don’t want to commit themselves. After you hit a kid you can’t just get up and leave him; you are hooked to that kid.”"" (pp. 312-313)George Rekers and Ivar Lovaas: ""It’s easier to change a child’s behavior than it is to destigmatize that behavior in society—whether it’s limp wrists or flapping hands."" (p. 323)Barry Morrow:  “What Bill taught me... is that not only do people like Bill need society, society needs people like Bill.” (p. 363)Judith Gould: “We were not surprised when people started saying it was an epidemic. Obviously, by broadening the spectrum, you’re going to get higher numbers."" (p. 421)Temple Grandin: ""A “handicap” rather than a mental illness, invoking the humanizing language of disability over the stigmatizing lexicon of psychiatry"" (p. 426). Oliver Sacks: Their autism, “while it may be seen as a medical condition, and pathologized as a syndrome, must also be seen as a whole mode of being, a deeply different mode or identity, one that needs to be conscious (and proud) of itself.” (p. 430)Walter Spitzer: ""Autism as “a terminal illness . . . a dead soul in a live body.”"" (p. 431)Jim Sinclair: “Being autistic does not mean being inhuman. But it means that what is normal for other people is not normal for me, and what is normal for me is not normal for other people.”[I'm like] “an extraterrestrial stranded without an orientation manual” (p. 437)Laura Tyroncik: “Neurotypical syndrome is a neurobiological disorder characterized by preoccupation with social concerns, delusions of superiority, and obsession with conformity... There is no known cure.” (p. 441)Jim Sinclair: “Saying ‘person with autism’ suggests that autism is something bad—so bad that it isn’t even consistent with being a person...We talk about left-handed people, not ‘people with left-handedness,’ and about athletic or musical people, not about ‘people with athleticism’ or ‘people with musicality’ . . . It is only when someone has decided that the characteristic being referred to is negative that suddenly people want to separate it from the person.” (p. 441)Susan Moreno: ""Her life had been enriched in ways that she could never have predicted by coping with the challenges of raising Beth."" (p. 444)Ivar Lovaas: ""a normal child trapped within the “autistic shell,” waiting to be rescued.Dan Grover: “The goal is to alleviate those with Asperger’s from this pressure that they need to conform,” Grover said in the press release. “What is best is to learn how to use your uniqueness to your advantage and find your place in the world.” (p. 455)Ari Ne'eman: ""Not “symptoms” of his autism, but problems built into the ways that society treats people who don’t meet the standard expectations of “normal.”"" (p. 458)Carol Greenberg: “When I look at my son,” she says, “I think, ‘He’s not broken. He’s just neurologically outnumbered, like me.’” (p. 467).Do we understand autism? We have, at least, some interesting and useful understandings – and some that are not."
133,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"In pop psychology, nothing appears as self-evident as the statement that ""autism is a spectrum."" Silberman's book explains how recent this insight is, how controversial it remains, and how bumpy the road has been. The diagnostic history of the concept of autism (and related diagnoses) makes for an interesting story that deals with human tragedy, political struggle, and scientific discovery. Silberman has written an engaging book that gives readers a better understanding of the convoluted history of the condition and the importance of the social struggles of ""neurodiverse"" people.Since autistic people often (but not always) have a difficulty communicating and representing themselves in society, it is important that books that deal with the issue respect the source material - i.e. the patients and their families, with their very real human emotions and passions. In this regard, the book does a pretty good job. The copious anecdotes and tales of the daily life of autistic people remind us of the individuality and humanity of autistic people, including even the most uncommunicative (or differently communicative) individuals. That said, Silberman understandably focuses more on the parents and their struggles, on the one hand, and the doctors and their ambitions, on the other hand, rather than the inscrutable inner life of autistic people. The story focuses mostly on the dual stories of Leo Kenner and Hans Asperger, the two independent co-discovers of diagnostic autism. Their different interpretations and visions of the nature of the disorder (or, less disparagingly, the personality type) have shaped treatment options, medical practices, social attitudes, and social policies that have impacted the lives of autistic people. This story is absolutely fascinating. It contains insights about the often convoluted shape of the history of science, the importance of constructing a coherent and humane social narrative, the dangers of false beliefs, the social value of psychological difference (""neurodiversity""), and the importance of hearing multiple viewpoints in highlighting different aspects of the same phenomenon.The book is quite long. Sometimes I wish that it had pruned its narrative. The big picture often gets lost in trivia. There are way too many chapters narrating issues that are only tangentially related to autism, such as the biographies of several scientists, the history of science fiction fandom, the personal habits of individuals, etc... In a way, such an obsessive focus on trivia might be appropriate to the subject matter, but the end result is a book that is a 100 pages too long. Thankfully, this is just about the only negative thing I can say about the book, aside from the aforementioned fact that the book - mostly out of necessity - speaks mostly in the language of parents and doctors, rather than the autistic people themselves. This carries the danger of misrepresenting them. Overall, I really enjoyed the book. Human beings live in a complex world. Our capacity to understand difference and diversity, even in our own communities, is limited. We have trouble coping with psychological and behavioural traits that do not fit into our established models. Coming to grips with autism - and other forms of neurodiversity, such as ADHD, psychopathy, manic depressive disorder, narcissism, schizophrenia, etc. - will be crucial in helping people with those conditions. It will also allow society to take full advantage of the unique skills that diverse people bring to society. Recognizing difference in our society is the first step; treating people with kindness is another. And the final step is putting diversity in the service of science, technology, business, and politics. "
134,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7400591-writer-s-relief,5,"Autism is a disorder that, while prevalent in our society, we still know little about. In the enthralling NEUROTRIBES, journalist Steve Silberman takes readers on a sweeping journey through the history of autism, the hidden presence of autistic people in our society, and the dubious research methods used by psychologists searching for answers.In language that is elegant, engaging, and accessible, Silberman takes a humanizing look at the many people who shaped the conversation about autism before it was a formal diagnosis. We learn about the unconventional scientist Henry Cavendish, whose eccentricities belied a brilliant mind that altered scientific discourse. We also delve into the parallel lives and careers of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger (whom Asperger’s Syndrome is named after) and their complex lives and legacies. Silberman also depicts several disturbing elements of child abuse occurring within institutions for autistic children. Many of these passages are not for the faint of heart or for sensitive readers, but they are crucial in understanding the history of how autism was treated in our society. He also explores Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s destructive “study” alleging the MMR vaccine was linked to autism, which several reputable studies have since disproven. Wakefield’s faulty data gave rise to a movement of parents searching for a cure to autism—rather than pushing society to understand and make accommodations for their children.Through his in-depth research and accessible writing, Silberman communicates a powerful message: If we adjust our world to accommodate and make space for autistic people, they can change our world for the better. NEUROTRIBES is an informative, compelling, enlightening, and moving book you should read regardless of whether or not autism affects you, your family, or someone you know. And after reading it, you will likely learn that autism has indeed impacted your life in ways you never imagined."

137,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91500740-bloem,3,"I’ve finally finished this book. It took me such a long time because it is so information heavy that I could only read a couple pages in a day because I wouldn’t want to overload on information. It was shocking to see how disabled people have been treated throughout history. And to learn more about autism as it is such a wide spectrum. “If you meet one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism.” Though I definitely would’ve wanted to learn more about autism in that sense, where this book focused instead more on the history. It became super confusing to follow the timeline, especially jumping between years and countries. Though I don’t regret reading it I’ll probably only retain like 10% of the information xD"
138,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7325648-dan,5,"I have worked with autistic children for some years now but knew little of the history of the disorder. That has all changed now that I've read this excellent book. It's not entirely clear exactly what this book is about from the title but essentially it's a history of autism. It covers some people who were likely autistic long before the disorder was diagnosed, how Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner 'discovered' autism (independently), how Lorna Wing made diagnosis clearer than ever, how Rain Main ended up being made, the MMR scandal and much more besides. It feels quite a long book but when you consider just how much information it crams in it seems quite concise!There are several reasons this book works as well as it does. Silberman writes very neutrally, rarely giving an opinion on theories. There are plenty of uncomfortable sections of the book, from Kanner leading a surge of blaming parents' for autism to the attempt to cure autism with electric shock therapy. Silberman leaves the reader to decide the rights and wrongs by stating the evidence and quoting contemporaries. The author does a good job with his description of the autistic people included in the research. If you are very familiar with autism, like I am, he doesn't spend long periods time explaining many of the common traits of autism but he gives enough so that no matter how little you know of the disorder you can understand it. I also liked how much of the book focused on the autistic people themselves, something much of the research covered somehow failed to do. The book also helped me to refined my thoughts on autism and it's place in the world. For some readers I imagine it could completely changes their views on it. The book shows us how much value autistic people have added to our society and that they are not simply ""retarded"" as they were once considered. The idea that the human race wouldn't have evolved to where it is today without autistic people is a remarkable but plausible one. This is surely the best history of autism that exists. A challenging read at times, not least because of its length, but also due to views and actions that are incomprehensible today. But ultimately it's an inspiring one which celebrates autism for the remarkable way of thinking that it is."
139,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53177731-anouk,5,"Not only does this book give an incredibly detailed overview of the various medical and social concepts of autism over the last century, but it manages to do so in a way that is, for once, respectful of autistic and other neurodivergent people. It condemns the frankly barbaric methods used in early psychiatry, and never once forgets that at the core of all this talk about treatments and cures and diseases and plagues, are very real people with very real lives; who have real hopes and needs. Above all however, it highlights the deeply problematic attitudes ingrained in (western) society towards neurodivergent people, and puts those in a the broader historical context of psychiatry. The fact that it ends on a chapter dedicated to neurodiversity and self-advocacy is fantastic and wraps the whole thing up very neatly. "
140,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This is a bit of a slog to read, because it spends a lot of time lingering on details that you may or may not feel are relevant. It goes into the lives of the people who ‘discovered’ autism and described it clinically, much more than it goes into the lives of actual autistic people, and there’s one chapter I found rather troubling which follows the family of an autistic child. It focuses on their anguish and confusion, and their increasingly desperate attempts to “treat” their son with whatever unpleasant, pseudo-scientific methods they could find. By the end, I was desperate to hear that someone had actually ever asked the child what effect it had on him. (As far as I can tell, nobody did.) Those particular parents weren’t extreme, but nonetheless, I got very tired of their desperation to have a “normal” child.It also does some retrospective diagnosing of a couple of scientists and thinkers from days before there was such a diagnosis. I’m always a bit iffy on that: there do seem to be good grounds to make those judgements, but… most of the people I know now don’t know much about what goes on in my head and why I react the way I do. I don’t want them diagnosing me once I’m dead. Still, at least it does provide autistic models and heroes for people now.I’m also a little leery of the ubiquity of being on the spectrum in Silberman’s view. Lots of fandom, lots of engineers, maybe even most in the picture he’s painting — it’s a stereotype of fandom and of STEM that I haven’t necessarily found to be true. And fandom hasn’t been so very welcoming of actual neurodiverse people, either. If it’s ever been the perfect home for them, it isn’t now.All in all, though, I did find the book interesting, and the perspective on neurodiversity as something to be accommodated and used productively is one that’s definitely timely. Despite my criticisms, I found it an interesting book — and it definitely treats autism as a spectrum, touching all kinds of people. This definitely isn’t the attitudes of Autism Speaks: instead, Silberman urges understanding, accommodation and respect.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
141,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27045365-katy,4,"This is a book that needed to be written. As someone on the spectrum, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the ""autism as a disease"" rhetoric and focus on finding a cure instead of finding solutions to integrate autistic people into society. I happened to study psychology in undergraduate, a field I did not end up pursuing because I felt so alienated from it because of the way autism was talked about by my professors and peers. Nobody would believe me if I voiced my opinion on the potential harms of ""erasing"" autistic behavior, and why should they? Due to a lifetime of internalized ableism, I have grown to hate autistic aspects of myself, like my social awkwardness. Any attempts to prove that my autism was an acceptable part of who I am would just prove futile.This is the book that every psychology student, every social worker, and frankly everyone should read. It covers not only the history of autism but the beginnings of the neurodiversity movement and its momentum. It sheds light on the hoaxes and misinformation that people still believe today. This is the most comprehensive yet also humanizing work by a neurotypical writer on autism out there, and I'm glad it exists.That being said, the book does suffer from a lack of focus at points. I could've done without the digressions into the life stories of all the researchers who studied autism save Hans Asperger. There is too much focus on the history of how the autism diagnosis came to be, where the more meaty story comes from the neurodiversity movement (especially in defiance of false psychology), which is sadly only relegated as more of an afterthought even though I think it's the point Silberman was building up to starting with Hans Asperger. Despite the fact that many sections meander off-topic and therefore make it difficult to slog through, I still think this book is required reading because it offers such a holistic view on the fascinating history of how ""autism"" came to be and how it fits into the world. "
142,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29044542-jo-salas,5,"Essential reading for anyone involved with or concerned about autism--Silberman does a brilliant job of reframing this huge topic by telling the little-known story of how autism was discovered more or less simultaneously in the US, by Leo Kanner, and in Germany--Nazi Germany--by Hans Asperger. Kanner pathologized the condition and concluded it was very rare: Asperger thought it was a fascinating, often enriching, and common human condition. Tragically, his work was obscured by the era he lived in. In his writing he foregrounded a few very high-functioning kids in order to save many others from Hitler, who was murdering people considered disabled. It meant that for decades the few researchers and doctors who were aware of Asperger's work thought it related only to one end of the spectrum. Although Kanner's contribution was important as well, his very different analysis has led, directly and indirectly, to much of the panic and misinformation that shadows autism today. Thousands of lives could have been far happier if Asperger's rather than Kanner's interpretation had been the basis for further research and treatment. It is heartbreaking to read of the inadvertent cruelty inflicted by well-meaning but ill-informed people. There's much more to this story, of course: many other heroes (including autistic children and adults) and a few shocking villains. I hope the book changes the picture and allows us to embrace all ""neurotribes,"" and to emphasize lifelong resources and support, rather than a ""cure."" "

Because I decided I didn't have time and it was long and I had school work and a million other books to read. I'm an idiot. Seriously, I am. I should have just sacrificed the other books and gone for this one. Oh well. I read it now and that's what counts.I've always had an interest in autism and Asperger's, along with many other odd interests. Don't ask me about the others or we'd spend the whole review on them rather than this wonderful book. I did a lot of research on it once to accurately write a character I wanted to explore, but nothing really came of it. Now, I definitely want this book on my shelf when I have an actual office in the distant future. It's a handy book to tell people that autism has been around as long as humans have been and even as long as humans began recording history.This book was incredibly amazing to listen to because it takes you from early conceptions and case studies of actual historical people and modern day parents living with autistic children. Dotted throughout the real life stories, the conception of autism and how it was treated throughout history also was laid out and explained. I think that right now, as the book shows it, we're in a very good spot for autism. Right now, they're practically being hailed in popular TV shows with portrayals that speak to non-autistic (also called NTs in the autism community, which I loved) people. It can only keep going up."
144,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56704-ashley,0,"I wanted to love this book but I found it oddly incomplete for a 400+ page book. Ultimately, it may be that the subtitle over-promsied. This book is an excellent introduction to the history of autism and the diagnostic debates but it spend only one chapter on the future. Even the chapters on self-advocacy and patient rights came at the end and felt more focused on past victories than on how to work to create a more inclusive society going forward.""Neurotribes"" provides a cultural history of autism in western Europe and the United States from about 1700 to the present. I found the exclusive focus on white, western families disappointing. Although Silberman acknowledges that a diagnosis of autism is very different for poor families or families (especially boys) of color, he does not include these stories in the book or explicitly suggest that these families have a place in a neurodiverse world. These critiques aside, I am sure this is a book I will use in my teaching on autism, the vaccine ""controversy,"" and ableism. Silberman's text is deeply human and rich with individual stories, emotion, and compassion. I found that his account of dry, medical in-fighting managed to retain some of the passion its participants surely felt in the 1930s to the present. What it lacked in hard science it more than made up for in its cultural work. "
145,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502519-julie,4,"This book gave an historical perspective that released me from guilt and anxiety as a parent of a child on the spectrum. I understand now, that in 1999, when we got the diagnosis, that the 'experts' knew almost as little as we did. We did therapies, meds, IEPs, homeschooled, started a social group, changed diets, and held together as best we could. We did the best with what we knew, and I can see now that we did amazingly well considering the machines we were up against. I do feel like this book portrays too rosy of a picture. There is a profound loneliness. Maybe not all of our kids have a special talent. As a parent with tendencies of my own, that makes it hard to network and socialize in a way that brings opportunities to my child. There is a lot of emphasis on what can your child ""do"" to make them valuable, and this is a dangerous view. It can be frustrating when society thinks that if you are on the spectrum, you must have some supernatural talent for numbers, engineering, memorization, etc. There's also a mostly unaddressed issue of the parents or communities who don't go out of their way to be accommodating. What will happen when we aren't there to advocate? When one is unable to live independently, how will this generation manage? Ultimately, this is a positive, empowering book, and that's a good thing."
146,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1102217-jamie,4,"At close to 500 pages, this history of autism was exhaustive and at times exhausting. I had to put it down several times because the specificity of the stories but I'm grateful for the work and for having the experience. I don't have the details about Asperger and Kanner now (because my memory is not strong) but I've retained a sense for the ways these doctors were relentless in noticing their overlooked patients. I'm left with so much gratitude for those who have come before us, so many parents who were loving activists for their children, so many children whose lives were forgotten and misunderstood. My son with autism has incredible resources (not enough, of course, but what we have is pretty great) that are helping him live his best life and maximize his strengths so that he can get along in the world of people. I'm taken with the notion and reality of neurodiversity. Autism is not a monolith and it is not new. I love that Silberman ends with how much work there is to do regarding autism and people of color, epilepsy for people with autism who are considered intellectually disabled, and, for those who are not (like my son), mental health treatment. The statistic that people like my son are nine times more likely to commit suicide than neurotypical people hits too close to home. "

I don't know why I expected it to be about neurobiology or neurochemistry ... I guess that piece of word ""neuro"" in the title threw me off. Mr. Silberman has a degree in English, so he's a very good writer... but he's not at all a scientist of any sort. What a disappointment. He really is a wonderful writer and if I were interested in history, I'd love this book. I'll keep an eye out for future books of his if he writes about something more interesting. This book is a history of ASD, told entirely from a non-scientific perspective. It contains many mildly interesting stories of researchers and people with autism over the years. It touches superficially on the contributions to science, literature, and technology that a few famous people with autism have made to mainstream society. It really is probably a good book if you haven't read anything like it before. But you could probably just read his famous Wired article and get the gist. If you're super interested in the lives of famous people with autism, I'd suggest simply picking one and reading one of their biographies."

As someone currently investigating their own possible autism, this was truly an essential read. Rarely does work on autism focus so much on who autistic people are, and all that they have accomplished, rather tending to focus on limits of autism solely. One thing that stood out so much to me was the enormous scientific contribution to society made by autistic people, weighed against the sheer volume of bad science that has led to complete misunderstandings of the diagnosis and a focus on cures rather than provisions. Neurotribes spans the history of autism, through Asperger's and Kanner's work with autistic people, through to online support networks created by autistic people, gleefully mentioning the wonderful work of Oliver Sacks, Lorna Wing, and the representation of autistic people in the media, thanks to the film Rain Man and the works of Temple Grandin.I wholeheartedly recommend this, especially if you work with or know autistic people."

Inspiring at times and heartbreaking at others, this book chronicles the long journey of autism from obscurity to discovery to awareness and the evolution of its diagnostic criteria along the way. From the darkest periods of widespread institutionalization and horrific experiments to shining examples of brilliant autistic minds, loving families and positive steps forward in policy and advocacy, this book really covers it all.If your child has just been diagnosed, you’ll likely find that the internet is inundated with a whole lot of doom-and-gloom narratives perpetuated by self-pitying autism warrior parents and organizations like Autism Speaks. What a relief it is when you dig deeper and discover the vibrant, inclusive, autistic-led neurodiversity movement that celebrates your child’s neurology instead of dehumanizing it. Definitely read this book."
150,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3856605-rebecca-mcphedran,4,"I received this book as an advanced readers copy from NetGalley.A smart, accessible, comprehensive history of autism. Silberman does an amazing job of giving an in depth history of a medical condition that we only have just learned about within the last 70 years. His chapters run the gamut. From institutionalizations to special schools, from Asperger's initial findings, to Kanners complete appropriation of Asperger's ideas. He talks about the different treatments of Autism from electroshock therapy, to major antipsychotics, to biomedical interventions. He spends a lot of time on the words used to describe the diagnosis. He spends a lot of time on helping you get to know the individuals who helped shape the idea and diagnosis of autism. It is almost overwhelming, and sometimes it's hard to keep the players straight. I thoroughly enjoyed the end of the book, in which he talks about where autism is headed. It's headed in a new direction. The direction is not steered by parents of autistic children, as in the past, but by autistic individuals themselves. And this is exciting. We wouldn't be the enlightened, cultured civilization if not for the advancements that autistic people have given us. I feel like this book is a gift, to help us better understand our own human race, and the people who help shape our lives, in some unexpected ways. A great read if you are interested in the history of autism and human rights. "
151,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,5,"This is extremely good nonfiction. Although other reviewers have noted that it is a very long book, packed full of details, I found it to be extremely engaging, with only a few very short dull parts (it is hard to make changes to DSM criteria riveting, but actually Silberman did better than you could ever imagine). Silberman's writing voice is upbeat and entertaining, and a dense topic is made readable with lots of wonderful and colorful personal details and anecdotes. I don't know if this would be such a page-turner to someone with less personal interest in autism spectrum issues, but I found it absolutely compelling. In addition to being extremely well written, Silberman is consistently pro-autistic and his message of neurodiversity is powerful and very needed. It would be wrong to call it ""ground breaking"" - as some have - because he is just digesting and conveying ideas that have been out there for decades, but it is also impossible to underestimate the importance of getting those ideas out to a bigger audience. For that, it comes back to how wonderfully well written this book is, and Silberman deserves real credit. This is definitely one of my favorite nonfiction reads of 2015 and maybe for the past couple years. "
152,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,4,"The last two chapters of the book, which are about the movement for neurodiversity, are exemplary. The rest of the book is about the history of the psychologists who ""discovered"" autism in the early twentieth century, and the methods that parents and doctors thought would cure autistic people -- electroshock, corporal punishment, severe dietary restrictions (which is still trendy among ""leaky gut"" proponents). It was horrifying. Indeed, let others praise not-so ancient times, I am glad I was born in these.My one criticism is that the narrative isn't linear. In the span of a few pages, Silberman discussed events in one decade, backtracked to a previous decade, and returned to the initial decade. I didn't read very much during my time in Rome, but I finished during the flight home."

When a polemic, it is snarky and poorly reasoned, taking potshots at psychoanalysis and casting aspersions on researchers motivations without much to back them up. When it is reporting, it is informative and though provoking and has much to recommend it. I came away feeling that there was an axe being ground here, but was not clear what the axe was really. This could have been a much better book and so I was greatly disappointed."

Read this book."
155,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14219722-edoardo-albert,4,"As the father of two autistic boys, I've read more than my fair share of the burgeoning field of autistic books so it's a pleasure to find a new departure in reading on the subject. Up until now, most books on autism have fallen into one of three categories:1. the inspiring parental story of recovering a child from the depths of autistic disengagement via some new and unlikely therapy often involving animals and/or shamans;2. the inspiring autistic autobiography, telling how an autistic person overcame discrimination and misunderstanding to achieve personal autonomy and a good life;3. the how-to guide for parents with autistic children.Now Steve Silberman has added a third category: the history of autism as a medically recognised condition, from the physicians who first spotted it and struggled, more or less successfully, to describe, through the various therapies tried to cure/treat/ameliorate/accommodate it, to the split between different autistic 'camps' and schools, to about where we are now: a condition that has gone from almost nothing to almost everyday within two generations. As a history, it's generally excellent, although a little marred by Silberman's tendency to paint people as 'good guys' (Hans Asperger - the Austrian physician who first recognised the condition and pioneered a notably gentle and appreciative treatment) and 'bad guys' (Leo Kanner - Austrian-American psychiatrist who popularised a restrictive view of autism in America whom Silberger basically accuses of stealing Asperger's work). The reality seems greyer and harder to define, particularly in light of recent evidence that Asperger fell into the morally grey areas of a doctor working under the Nazi regime: he seems to have sent at least two of his children to the Spiegelgrund clinic knowing that they would likely be euthanised there, while managing to protect most of the children under his care. The history of autism thus becomes entwined with the history of the century and the changing nature of medical theorising: from restrictive diagnoses that sought to exclude those who were borderline to diagnoses that now tend to bring far more children within a diagnostic framework. What is clear, is that autism is a spectrum, with many of its traits being potentially highly useful. I do sometimes wonder, as a parent, whether the insight that drove the MMR anxiety that linked the vaccine to the increase in levels of autism might have other sources. It's quite common for parents of autistic children to think they are developing normally and then, at an early age but usually somewhere between one and three, for there to be a sudden falling off in the child's development: the first of many subsequent meltdowns. I remember that with the eldest of my two autistic sons. In his case, the decline coincided with his starting at school. Now autism is a developmental disorder and I wonder if one possible factor in its increase is the earlier and earlier ages at which we are putting children into school. For any child, and particularly for boys, the sudden move from the predictable and stable environment of home, dealing mainly with parents and siblings, into the far less predictable environment of school where volatile peers are the main source of interaction might cause a social-system overload leading to a massive withdrawal from social and linguistic learning as the child tries desperately to accommodate and cope with the sudden huge increase in stimuli, both physical and sensory. If there's any truth in this idea, then countries where children begin school later should have lower rates of autism. It would be interesting to see if this bears out. In the meantime, read Silberman's book if you want to know how autism, as a medically recognised condition with a wide and often competing range of therapies, arrived at its present stage. For all our difficulties today, it's still a huge improvement over the days of 'refrigerator mothers' when much of the medical profession basically blamed the parents for the child's condition or some of the frankly horrible 'cures' devised by the Behaviourist. It also serves as a useful reminder that the real expert is one who understands that he still has much to learn about a subject."
156,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"This is definitely more a book about the history of autism than it is a book about autism itself, so if you're looking for the nitty gritty of what it means to be on the spectrum or how the brain works, it's probably better to look elsewhere. NeuroTribes seems to have mainly been written in response to all the hubbub in recent years by the contingent claiming that there is an autism epidemic and that it is being caused by vaccinations. Silberman looks back at how long autism has existed (probably pretty much as long as people have existed), including looking back at a number of historical figures that were most likely autistic, like Henry Cavendish and Paul Dirac. Then he goes into all the details of how it's been diagnosed over the course of the last couple hundred years and why the fact that more and more people are being diagnosed with it now than ever before doesn't mean that more people are actually autistic than ever before; it's just that recent corrections in diagnostic guidelines have made it easier for people to receive ""on the spectrum"" diagnoses, and therefore more people are now able to gain access to the support and services they need. Silberman goes through all of this in a very balanced way, and without demonizing anyone, recognizing that the data can seem misleading, and that parents on both sides just want what's best for their kids. But I love that he does bend the focus more towards working on gaining support and services for people with autism and their families than working towards finding a cure for autism. His opinion, and I think what a lot of his research shows, is that people on the autism spectrum have made and continue to make a lot of really important contributions, especially in the fields of science and technology, but in lots of other areas as well, not in spite of the ways their minds work, but because of it, and that we're all just working on different operating systems. I like that description a lot.Anyway, this is a really good look through how our view of autism has changed throughout history, as well as how it's been diagnosed and treated. And definitely well worth a read if you're looking for a fairly balanced account of how and why the whole vaccinations-might-cause-autism debate began."

Any accomplished educator is well aware that no two students are alike. Devising curriculum and instruction to meet the needs of a classroom full of independent thinkers and learners is a challenge to say the least. I was one who lived for that challenge and, in retirement, still teach two classes a semester at a community college. I am most alive in the classroom and thrive on the challenges of diversity. During my last five years in public high school education, I taught in an inclusion classroom with an exceptional special education teacher who taught me more in those few years than any other educator over the course of my career!Steve Silberman's book is a revelation! It validates so much of what I have come to believe as an educator. His work is well-researched and well-written for anyone to access. The history of neurodiversity is filled with tragedy, but is overwhelmingly full of the ""aha!"" moments that make life so interesting. This book is for everyone who is alive on our world today! We share space with others who are as diverse as we are and with whom we need to learn to create the future. In reading this book, we recognize ourselves, significant others, friends, relatives, colleagues, and fascinating strangers. In negotiating our way through life, we have to embrace diversity around us in all of its may facets, including the diversity in the working of the minds around us.My real hope is that this and other books like it will lead to the revolution in education so may of us have been seeking which will provide comprehensive change to meet the needs of every individual mind entering a school or classroom. Individual Education Plans for EVERY student should not be a dream of the few, but a reality that can not happen soon enough.

158,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5531911-brandy,5,"I enjoyed the book very much for what it is, a non-fiction book primarily focused on the history of autism. Most professionals (therapists, teachers, psychiatrists, etc.) could probably benefit from it. Autistics themselves may enjoy the book for the extensive level of detail Mr. Silberman goes into. Or if you enjoy history of disability rights, psychology books, or non-fiction in general it's worth reading. I finished it rather quickly since it's engrossing and moves smoothly. Some of it may be familiar territory to people with an extensive knowledge of psychiatry history (such as the bit about refrigerator mothers) but much of it is new and fresh information not previously included in any books. I'd consider it an essential reading on neurodiversity as well. My only caveat is I wouldn't really recommend it as an introduction to autism, since it's heavy on history and short on practical advice. So, if you're a parent of a newly diagnosed offspring, I'd direct you towards The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism first. Or if you are an adult newly diagnosed, ""Been There. Done That. Try This!: An Aspie's Guide to Life on Earth"" by Tony Attwood is a more practical starting point."

If I had known what I was getting into, I probably wouldn't have read it, at 542 pages. Still, I enjoyed this as a philosophy of science, as the descriptions of varying perceptions of autistics, as they currently like being called, over the course of the almost 100 years that they have been described. These varying descriptions and their implications are themselves fascinating. Kanner was the dominant early voice in the US.Kanner: ""Overambitious parents like the Tripletts had “stuffed” the impressionable minds of their children with useless information to cast themselves in a culturally favorable light and bolster their own egos"" (p. 190). He ""turned the detailed notes that parents had provided to him—which were so helpful in developing a clear picture of their children’s development—into a weapon, citing them as a “telling illustration of parental obsessiveness.”"" (p. 190)Asperger preceded Kanner, but his view of autistic children was more benign. It was also lost during WW2 and rediscovered later.Asperger: “Not everything that steps out of the line, and is thus ‘abnormal,’ must necessarily be ‘inferior.’” ""This boy’s difficulties—which particularly affect his relationships with himself and other people—are the price that he has to pay for his special gifts” (p. 128).It matters how we see these children (and adults), right? Are they low functioning, severely affected, or profoundly impaired or a “high-octane boy,” as one parent argued? Are the parents the cause of problems, as Kanner and Theodore and Ruth Lidz argued, or are they their children's supports? Some more quotes:Rudolf Ekstein: ""Tommy’s precocious interest in science was likely the result of “early childhood intensive sexual traumata” caused by seduction by his mother or a nursemaid"" (p. 211). Bernard Rimland: “Brightness gone awry” (p. 272)Ivar Lovaas (who believed you should punish self-injury): ""Once you had taken it upon yourself to physically strike a child, you were morally responsible for his fate. “No one punishes who isn’t prepared to devote a major part of his life to that child. Nobody punishes a child who doesn’t also love that child,” he told a reporter. “Once you lay your hand on a child it morally obligates you to work with that child. You see, that is one of the reasons that people stay away from punishment—they don’t want to commit themselves. After you hit a kid you can’t just get up and leave him; you are hooked to that kid.”"" (pp. 312-313)George Rekers and Ivar Lovaas: ""It’s easier to change a child’s behavior than it is to destigmatize that behavior in society—whether it’s limp wrists or flapping hands."" (p. 323)Barry Morrow:  “What Bill taught me... is that not only do people like Bill need society, society needs people like Bill.” (p. 363)Judith Gould: “We were not surprised when people started saying it was an epidemic. Obviously, by broadening the spectrum, you’re going to get higher numbers."" (p. 421)Temple Grandin: ""A “handicap” rather than a mental illness, invoking the humanizing language of disability over the stigmatizing lexicon of psychiatry"" (p. 426). Oliver Sacks: Their autism, “while it may be seen as a medical condition, and pathologized as a syndrome, must also be seen as a whole mode of being, a deeply different mode or identity, one that needs to be conscious (and proud) of itself.” (p. 430)Walter Spitzer: ""Autism as “a terminal illness . . . a dead soul in a live body.”"" (p. 431)Jim Sinclair: “Being autistic does not mean being inhuman. But it means that what is normal for other people is not normal for me, and what is normal for me is not normal for other people.”[I'm like] “an extraterrestrial stranded without an orientation manual” (p. 437)Laura Tyroncik: “Neurotypical syndrome is a neurobiological disorder characterized by preoccupation with social concerns, delusions of superiority, and obsession with conformity... There is no known cure.” (p. 441)Jim Sinclair: “Saying ‘person with autism’ suggests that autism is something bad—so bad that it isn’t even consistent with being a person...We talk about left-handed people, not ‘people with left-handedness,’ and about athletic or musical people, not about ‘people with athleticism’ or ‘people with musicality’ . . . It is only when someone has decided that the characteristic being referred to is negative that suddenly people want to separate it from the person.” (p. 441)Susan Moreno: ""Her life had been enriched in ways that she could never have predicted by coping with the challenges of raising Beth."" (p. 444)Ivar Lovaas: ""a normal child trapped within the “autistic shell,” waiting to be rescued.Dan Grover: “The goal is to alleviate those with Asperger’s from this pressure that they need to conform,” Grover said in the press release. “What is best is to learn how to use your uniqueness to your advantage and find your place in the world.” (p. 455)Ari Ne'eman: ""Not “symptoms” of his autism, but problems built into the ways that society treats people who don’t meet the standard expectations of “normal.”"" (p. 458)Carol Greenberg: “When I look at my son,” she says, “I think, ‘He’s not broken. He’s just neurologically outnumbered, like me.’” (p. 467).Do we understand autism? We have, at least, some interesting and useful understandings – and some that are not."
163,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"In pop psychology, nothing appears as self-evident as the statement that ""autism is a spectrum."" Silberman's book explains how recent this insight is, how controversial it remains, and how bumpy the road has been. The diagnostic history of the concept of autism (and related diagnoses) makes for an interesting story that deals with human tragedy, political struggle, and scientific discovery. Silberman has written an engaging book that gives readers a better understanding of the convoluted history of the condition and the importance of the social struggles of ""neurodiverse"" people.Since autistic people often (but not always) have a difficulty communicating and representing themselves in society, it is important that books that deal with the issue respect the source material - i.e. the patients and their families, with their very real human emotions and passions. In this regard, the book does a pretty good job. The copious anecdotes and tales of the daily life of autistic people remind us of the individuality and humanity of autistic people, including even the most uncommunicative (or differently communicative) individuals. That said, Silberman understandably focuses more on the parents and their struggles, on the one hand, and the doctors and their ambitions, on the other hand, rather than the inscrutable inner life of autistic people. The story focuses mostly on the dual stories of Leo Kenner and Hans Asperger, the two independent co-discovers of diagnostic autism. Their different interpretations and visions of the nature of the disorder (or, less disparagingly, the personality type) have shaped treatment options, medical practices, social attitudes, and social policies that have impacted the lives of autistic people. This story is absolutely fascinating. It contains insights about the often convoluted shape of the history of science, the importance of constructing a coherent and humane social narrative, the dangers of false beliefs, the social value of psychological difference (""neurodiversity""), and the importance of hearing multiple viewpoints in highlighting different aspects of the same phenomenon.The book is quite long. Sometimes I wish that it had pruned its narrative. The big picture often gets lost in trivia. There are way too many chapters narrating issues that are only tangentially related to autism, such as the biographies of several scientists, the history of science fiction fandom, the personal habits of individuals, etc... In a way, such an obsessive focus on trivia might be appropriate to the subject matter, but the end result is a book that is a 100 pages too long. Thankfully, this is just about the only negative thing I can say about the book, aside from the aforementioned fact that the book - mostly out of necessity - speaks mostly in the language of parents and doctors, rather than the autistic people themselves. This carries the danger of misrepresenting them. Overall, I really enjoyed the book. Human beings live in a complex world. Our capacity to understand difference and diversity, even in our own communities, is limited. We have trouble coping with psychological and behavioural traits that do not fit into our established models. Coming to grips with autism - and other forms of neurodiversity, such as ADHD, psychopathy, manic depressive disorder, narcissism, schizophrenia, etc. - will be crucial in helping people with those conditions. It will also allow society to take full advantage of the unique skills that diverse people bring to society. Recognizing difference in our society is the first step; treating people with kindness is another. And the final step is putting diversity in the service of science, technology, business, and politics. "

In the enthralling NEUROTRIBES, journalist Steve Silberman takes readers on a sweeping journey through the history of autism, the hidden presence of autistic people in our society, and the dubious research methods used by psychologists searching for answers.In language that is elegant, engaging, and accessible, Silberman takes a humanizing look at the many people who shaped the conversation about autism before it was a formal diagnosis. We learn about the unconventional scientist Henry Cavendish, whose eccentricities belied a brilliant mind that altered scientific discourse. We also delve into the parallel lives and careers of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger (whom Asperger’s Syndrome is named after) and their complex lives and legacies. Silberman also depicts several disturbing elements of child abuse occurring within institutions for autistic children. Many of these passages are not for the faint of heart or for sensitive readers, but they are crucial in understanding the history of how autism was treated in our society. He also explores Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s destructive “study” alleging the MMR vaccine was linked to autism, which several reputable studies have since disproven. Wakefield’s faulty data gave rise to a movement of parents searching for a cure to autism—rather than pushing society to understand and make accommodations for their children.Through his in-depth research and accessible writing, Silberman communicates a powerful message: If we adjust our world to accommodate and make space for autistic people, they can change our world for the better. NEUROTRIBES is an informative, compelling, enlightening, and moving book you should read regardless of whether or not autism affects you, your family, or someone you know. And after reading it, you will likely learn that autism has indeed impacted your life in ways you never imagined."

It took me such a long time because it is so information heavy that I could only read a couple pages in a day because I wouldn’t want to overload on information. It was shocking to see how disabled people have been treated throughout history. And to learn more about autism as it is such a wide spectrum. “If you meet one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism.” Though I definitely would’ve wanted to learn more about autism in that sense, where this book focused instead more on the history. It became super confusing to follow the timeline, especially jumping between years and countries. Though I don’t regret reading it I’ll probably only retain like 10% of the information xD"
168,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7325648-dan,5,"I have worked with autistic children for some years now but knew little of the history of the disorder. That has all changed now that I've read this excellent book. It's not entirely clear exactly what this book is about from the title but essentially it's a history of autism. It covers some people who were likely autistic long before the disorder was diagnosed, how Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner 'discovered' autism (independently), how Lorna Wing made diagnosis clearer than ever, how Rain Main ended up being made, the MMR scandal and much more besides. It feels quite a long book but when you consider just how much information it crams in it seems quite concise!There are several reasons this book works as well as it does. Silberman writes very neutrally, rarely giving an opinion on theories. There are plenty of uncomfortable sections of the book, from Kanner leading a surge of blaming parents' for autism to the attempt to cure autism with electric shock therapy. Silberman leaves the reader to decide the rights and wrongs by stating the evidence and quoting contemporaries. The author does a good job with his description of the autistic people included in the research. If you are very familiar with autism, like I am, he doesn't spend long periods time explaining many of the common traits of autism but he gives enough so that no matter how little you know of the disorder you can understand it. I also liked how much of the book focused on the autistic people themselves, something much of the research covered somehow failed to do. The book also helped me to refined my thoughts on autism and it's place in the world. For some readers I imagine it could completely changes their views on it. The book shows us how much value autistic people have added to our society and that they are not simply ""retarded"" as they were once considered. The idea that the human race wouldn't have evolved to where it is today without autistic people is a remarkable but plausible one. This is surely the best history of autism that exists. A challenging read at times, not least because of its length, but also due to views and actions that are incomprehensible today. But ultimately it's an inspiring one which celebrates autism for the remarkable way of thinking that it is."

It condemns the frankly barbaric methods used in early psychiatry, and never once forgets that at the core of all this talk about treatments and cures and diseases and plagues, are very real people with very real lives; who have real hopes and needs. Above all however, it highlights the deeply problematic attitudes ingrained in (western) society towards neurodivergent people, and puts those in a the broader historical context of psychiatry. The fact that it ends on a chapter dedicated to neurodiversity and self-advocacy is fantastic and wraps the whole thing up very neatly. "
170,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This is a bit of a slog to read, because it spends a lot of time lingering on details that you may or may not feel are relevant. It goes into the lives of the people who ‘discovered’ autism and described it clinically, much more than it goes into the lives of actual autistic people, and there’s one chapter I found rather troubling which follows the family of an autistic child. It focuses on their anguish and confusion, and their increasingly desperate attempts to “treat” their son with whatever unpleasant, pseudo-scientific methods they could find. By the end, I was desperate to hear that someone had actually ever asked the child what effect it had on him. (As far as I can tell, nobody did.) Those particular parents weren’t extreme, but nonetheless, I got very tired of their desperation to have a “normal” child.It also does some retrospective diagnosing of a couple of scientists and thinkers from days before there was such a diagnosis. I’m always a bit iffy on that: there do seem to be good grounds to make those judgements, but… most of the people I know now don’t know much about what goes on in my head and why I react the way I do. I don’t want them diagnosing me once I’m dead. Still, at least it does provide autistic models and heroes for people now.I’m also a little leery of the ubiquity of being on the spectrum in Silberman’s view. Lots of fandom, lots of engineers, maybe even most in the picture he’s painting — it’s a stereotype of fandom and of STEM that I haven’t necessarily found to be true. And fandom hasn’t been so very welcoming of actual neurodiverse people, either. If it’s ever been the perfect home for them, it isn’t now.All in all, though, I did find the book interesting, and the perspective on neurodiversity as something to be accommodated and used productively is one that’s definitely timely. Despite my criticisms, I found it an interesting book — and it definitely treats autism as a spectrum, touching all kinds of people. This definitely isn’t the attitudes of Autism Speaks: instead, Silberman urges understanding, accommodation and respect.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
171,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27045365-katy,4,"This is a book that needed to be written. As someone on the spectrum, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the ""autism as a disease"" rhetoric and focus on finding a cure instead of finding solutions to integrate autistic people into society. I happened to study psychology in undergraduate, a field I did not end up pursuing because I felt so alienated from it because of the way autism was talked about by my professors and peers. Nobody would believe me if I voiced my opinion on the potential harms of ""erasing"" autistic behavior, and why should they? Due to a lifetime of internalized ableism, I have grown to hate autistic aspects of myself, like my social awkwardness. Any attempts to prove that my autism was an acceptable part of who I am would just prove futile.This is the book that every psychology student, every social worker, and frankly everyone should read. It covers not only the history of autism but the beginnings of the neurodiversity movement and its momentum. It sheds light on the hoaxes and misinformation that people still believe today. This is the most comprehensive yet also humanizing work by a neurotypical writer on autism out there, and I'm glad it exists.That being said, the book does suffer from a lack of focus at points. I could've done without the digressions into the life stories of all the researchers who studied autism save Hans Asperger. There is too much focus on the history of how the autism diagnosis came to be, where the more meaty story comes from the neurodiversity movement (especially in defiance of false psychology), which is sadly only relegated as more of an afterthought even though I think it's the point Silberman was building up to starting with Hans Asperger. Despite the fact that many sections meander off-topic and therefore make it difficult to slog through, I still think this book is required reading because it offers such a holistic view on the fascinating history of how ""autism"" came to be and how it fits into the world. "
172,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29044542-jo-salas,5,"Essential reading for anyone involved with or concerned about autism--Silberman does a brilliant job of reframing this huge topic by telling the little-known story of how autism was discovered more or less simultaneously in the US, by Leo Kanner, and in Germany--Nazi Germany--by Hans Asperger. Kanner pathologized the condition and concluded it was very rare: Asperger thought it was a fascinating, often enriching, and common human condition. Tragically, his work was obscured by the era he lived in. In his writing he foregrounded a few very high-functioning kids in order to save many others from Hitler, who was murdering people considered disabled. It meant that for decades the few researchers and doctors who were aware of Asperger's work thought it related only to one end of the spectrum. Although Kanner's contribution was important as well, his very different analysis has led, directly and indirectly, to much of the panic and misinformation that shadows autism today. Thousands of lives could have been far happier if Asperger's rather than Kanner's interpretation had been the basis for further research and treatment. It is heartbreaking to read of the inadvertent cruelty inflicted by well-meaning but ill-informed people. There's much more to this story, of course: many other heroes (including autistic children and adults) and a few shocking villains. I hope the book changes the picture and allows us to embrace all ""neurotribes,"" and to emphasize lifelong resources and support, rather than a ""cure."" "

I did a lot of research on it once to accurately write a character I wanted to explore, but nothing really came of it. Now, I definitely want this book on my shelf when I have an actual office in the distant future. It's a handy book to tell people that autism has been around as long as humans have been and even as long as humans began recording history.This book was incredibly amazing to listen to because it takes you from early conceptions and case studies of actual historical people and modern day parents living with autistic children. Dotted throughout the real life stories, the conception of autism and how it was treated throughout history also was laid out and explained. I think that right now, as the book shows it, we're in a very good spot for autism. Right now, they're practically being hailed in popular TV shows with portrayals that speak to non-autistic (also called NTs in the autism community, which I loved) people. It can only keep going up."

This book is an excellent introduction to the history of autism and the diagnostic debates but it spend only one chapter on the future. Even the chapters on self-advocacy and patient rights came at the end and felt more focused on past victories than on how to work to create a more inclusive society going forward.""Neurotribes"" provides a cultural history of autism in western Europe and the United States from about 1700 to the present. I found the exclusive focus on white, western families disappointing. Although Silberman acknowledges that a diagnosis of autism is very different for poor families or families (especially boys) of color, he does not include these stories in the book or explicitly suggest that these families have a place in a neurodiverse world. These critiques aside, I am sure this is a book I will use in my teaching on autism, the vaccine ""controversy,"" and ableism. Silberman's text is deeply human and rich with individual stories, emotion, and compassion. I found that his account of dry, medical in-fighting managed to retain some of the passion its participants surely felt in the 1930s to the present. What it lacked in hard science it more than made up for in its cultural work. "

I understand now, that in 1999, when we got the diagnosis, that the 'experts' knew almost as little as we did. We did therapies, meds, IEPs, homeschooled, started a social group, changed diets, and held together as best we could. We did the best with what we knew, and I can see now that we did amazingly well considering the machines we were up against. I do feel like this book portrays too rosy of a picture. There is a profound loneliness. Maybe not all of our kids have a special talent. As a parent with tendencies of my own, that makes it hard to network and socialize in a way that brings opportunities to my child. There is a lot of emphasis on what can your child ""do"" to make them valuable, and this is a dangerous view. It can be frustrating when society thinks that if you are on the spectrum, you must have some supernatural talent for numbers, engineering, memorization, etc. There's also a mostly unaddressed issue of the parents or communities who don't go out of their way to be accommodating. What will happen when we aren't there to advocate? When one is unable to live independently, how will this generation manage?

I don't have the details about Asperger and Kanner now (because my memory is not strong) but I've retained a sense for the ways these doctors were relentless in noticing their overlooked patients. I'm left with so much gratitude for those who have come before us, so many parents who were loving activists for their children, so many children whose lives were forgotten and misunderstood. My son with autism has incredible resources (not enough, of course, but what we have is pretty great) that are helping him live his best life and maximize his strengths so that he can get along in the world of people. I'm taken with the notion and reality of neurodiversity. Autism is not a monolith and it is not new. I love that Silberman ends with how much work there is to do regarding autism and people of color, epilepsy for people with autism who are considered intellectually disabled, and, for those who are not (like my son), mental health treatment.

Mr. Silberman has a degree in English, so he's a very good writer... but he's not at all a scientist of any sort. What a disappointment. He really is a wonderful writer and if I were interested in history, I'd love this book. I'll keep an eye out for future books of his if he writes about something more interesting. This book is a history of ASD, told entirely from a non-scientific perspective. It contains many mildly interesting stories of researchers and people with autism over the years. It touches superficially on the contributions to science, literature, and technology that a few famous people with autism have made to mainstream society. It really is probably a good book if you haven't read anything like it before. But you could probably just read his famous Wired article and get the gist.

As someone currently investigating their own possible autism, this was truly an essential read. Rarely does work on autism focus so much on who autistic people are, and all that they have accomplished, rather tending to focus on limits of autism solely. One thing that stood out so much to me was the enormous scientific contribution to society made by autistic people, weighed against the sheer volume of bad science that has led to complete misunderstandings of the diagnosis and a focus on cures rather than provisions. Neurotribes spans the history of autism, through Asperger's and Kanner's work with autistic people, through to online support networks created by autistic people, gleefully mentioning the wonderful work of Oliver Sacks, Lorna Wing, and the representation of autistic people in the media, thanks to the film Rain Man and the works of Temple Grandin.I wholeheartedly recommend this, especially if you work with or know autistic people."

From institutionalizations to special schools, from Asperger's initial findings, to Kanners complete appropriation of Asperger's ideas. He talks about the different treatments of Autism from electroshock therapy, to major antipsychotics, to biomedical interventions. He spends a lot of time on the words used to describe the diagnosis. He spends a lot of time on helping you get to know the individuals who helped shape the idea and diagnosis of autism. It is almost overwhelming, and sometimes it's hard to keep the players straight. I thoroughly enjoyed the end of the book, in which he talks about where autism is headed. It's headed in a new direction. The direction is not steered by parents of autistic children, as in the past, but by autistic individuals themselves. And this is exciting. We wouldn't be the enlightened, cultured civilization if not for the advancements that autistic people have given us. I feel like this book is a gift, to help us better understand our own human race, and the people who help shape our lives, in some unexpected ways. A great read if you are interested in the history of autism and human rights. "
181,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,5,"This is extremely good nonfiction. Although other reviewers have noted that it is a very long book, packed full of details, I found it to be extremely engaging, with only a few very short dull parts (it is hard to make changes to DSM criteria riveting, but actually Silberman did better than you could ever imagine). Silberman's writing voice is upbeat and entertaining, and a dense topic is made readable with lots of wonderful and colorful personal details and anecdotes. I don't know if this would be such a page-turner to someone with less personal interest in autism spectrum issues, but I found it absolutely compelling. In addition to being extremely well written, Silberman is consistently pro-autistic and his message of neurodiversity is powerful and very needed. It would be wrong to call it ""ground breaking"" - as some have - because he is just digesting and conveying ideas that have been out there for decades, but it is also impossible to underestimate the importance of getting those ideas out to a bigger audience. For that, it comes back to how wonderfully well written this book is, and Silberman deserves real credit. This is definitely one of my favorite nonfiction reads of 2015 and maybe for the past couple years. "
182,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,4,"The last two chapters of the book, which are about the movement for neurodiversity, are exemplary. The rest of the book is about the history of the psychologists who ""discovered"" autism in the early twentieth century, and the methods that parents and doctors thought would cure autistic people -- electroshock, corporal punishment, severe dietary restrictions (which is still trendy among ""leaky gut"" proponents). It was horrifying. Indeed, let others praise not-so ancient times, I am glad I was born in these.My one criticism is that the narrative isn't linear. In the span of a few pages, Silberman discussed events in one decade, backtracked to a previous decade, and returned to the initial decade. I didn't read very much during my time in Rome, but I finished during the flight home."

When a polemic, it is snarky and poorly reasoned, taking potshots at psychoanalysis and casting aspersions on researchers motivations without much to back them up. When it is reporting, it is informative and though provoking and has much to recommend it. I came away feeling that there was an axe being ground here, but was not clear what the axe was really. This could have been a much better book and so I was greatly disappointed."

Read this book."
185,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14219722-edoardo-albert,4,"As the father of two autistic boys, I've read more than my fair share of the burgeoning field of autistic books so it's a pleasure to find a new departure in reading on the subject. Up until now, most books on autism have fallen into one of three categories:1. the inspiring parental story of recovering a child from the depths of autistic disengagement via some new and unlikely therapy often involving animals and/or shamans;2. the inspiring autistic autobiography, telling how an autistic person overcame discrimination and misunderstanding to achieve personal autonomy and a good life;3. the how-to guide for parents with autistic children.Now Steve Silberman has added a third category: the history of autism as a medically recognised condition, from the physicians who first spotted it and struggled, more or less successfully, to describe, through the various therapies tried to cure/treat/ameliorate/accommodate it, to the split between different autistic 'camps' and schools, to about where we are now: a condition that has gone from almost nothing to almost everyday within two generations. As a history, it's generally excellent, although a little marred by Silberman's tendency to paint people as 'good guys' (Hans Asperger - the Austrian physician who first recognised the condition and pioneered a notably gentle and appreciative treatment) and 'bad guys' (Leo Kanner - Austrian-American psychiatrist who popularised a restrictive view of autism in America whom Silberger basically accuses of stealing Asperger's work). The reality seems greyer and harder to define, particularly in light of recent evidence that Asperger fell into the morally grey areas of a doctor working under the Nazi regime: he seems to have sent at least two of his children to the Spiegelgrund clinic knowing that they would likely be euthanised there, while managing to protect most of the children under his care. The history of autism thus becomes entwined with the history of the century and the changing nature of medical theorising: from restrictive diagnoses that sought to exclude those who were borderline to diagnoses that now tend to bring far more children within a diagnostic framework. What is clear, is that autism is a spectrum, with many of its traits being potentially highly useful. I do sometimes wonder, as a parent, whether the insight that drove the MMR anxiety that linked the vaccine to the increase in levels of autism might have other sources. It's quite common for parents of autistic children to think they are developing normally and then, at an early age but usually somewhere between one and three, for there to be a sudden falling off in the child's development: the first of many subsequent meltdowns. I remember that with the eldest of my two autistic sons. In his case, the decline coincided with his starting at school. Now autism is a developmental disorder and I wonder if one possible factor in its increase is the earlier and earlier ages at which we are putting children into school. For any child, and particularly for boys, the sudden move from the predictable and stable environment of home, dealing mainly with parents and siblings, into the far less predictable environment of school where volatile peers are the main source of interaction might cause a social-system overload leading to a massive withdrawal from social and linguistic learning as the child tries desperately to accommodate and cope with the sudden huge increase in stimuli, both physical and sensory. If there's any truth in this idea, then countries where children begin school later should have lower rates of autism. It would be interesting to see if this bears out. In the meantime, read Silberman's book if you want to know how autism, as a medically recognised condition with a wide and often competing range of therapies, arrived at its present stage. For all our difficulties today, it's still a huge improvement over the days of 'refrigerator mothers' when much of the medical profession basically blamed the parents for the child's condition or some of the frankly horrible 'cures' devised by the Behaviourist. It also serves as a useful reminder that the real expert is one who understands that he still has much to learn about a subject."
186,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"This is definitely more a book about the history of autism than it is a book about autism itself, so if you're looking for the nitty gritty of what it means to be on the spectrum or how the brain works, it's probably better to look elsewhere. NeuroTribes seems to have mainly been written in response to all the hubbub in recent years by the contingent claiming that there is an autism epidemic and that it is being caused by vaccinations. Silberman looks back at how long autism has existed (probably pretty much as long as people have existed), including looking back at a number of historical figures that were most likely autistic, like Henry Cavendish and Paul Dirac. Then he goes into all the details of how it's been diagnosed over the course of the last couple hundred years and why the fact that more and more people are being diagnosed with it now than ever before doesn't mean that more people are actually autistic than ever before; it's just that recent corrections in diagnostic guidelines have made it easier for people to receive ""on the spectrum"" diagnoses, and therefore more people are now able to gain access to the support and services they need. Silberman goes through all of this in a very balanced way, and without demonizing anyone, recognizing that the data can seem misleading, and that parents on both sides just want what's best for their kids. But I love that he does bend the focus more towards working on gaining support and services for people with autism and their families than working towards finding a cure for autism. His opinion, and I think what a lot of his research shows, is that people on the autism spectrum have made and continue to make a lot of really important contributions, especially in the fields of science and technology, but in lots of other areas as well, not in spite of the ways their minds work, but because of it, and that we're all just working on different operating systems. I like that description a lot.Anyway, this is a really good look through how our view of autism has changed throughout history, as well as how it's been diagnosed and treated. And definitely well worth a read if you're looking for a fairly balanced account of how and why the whole vaccinations-might-cause-autism debate began."

Any accomplished educator is well aware that no two students are alike. Devising curriculum and instruction to meet the needs of a classroom full of independent thinkers and learners is a challenge to say the least. I was one who lived for that challenge and, in retirement, still teach two classes a semester at a community college. I am most alive in the classroom and thrive on the challenges of diversity. During my last five years in public high school education, I taught in an inclusion classroom with an exceptional special education teacher who taught me more in those few years than any other educator over the course of my career!Steve Silberman's book is a revelation! It validates so much of what I have come to believe as an educator. His work is well-researched and well-written for anyone to access. The history of neurodiversity is filled with tragedy, but is overwhelmingly full of the ""aha!"" moments that make life so interesting. This book is for everyone who is alive on our world today! We share space with others who are as diverse as we are and with whom we need to learn to create the future. In reading this book, we recognize ourselves, significant others, friends, relatives, colleagues, and fascinating strangers. In negotiating our way through life, we have to embrace diversity around us in all of its may facets, including the diversity in the working of the minds around us.My real hope is that this and other books like it will lead to the revolution in education so may of us have been seeking which will provide comprehensive change to meet the needs of every individual mind entering a school or classroom. Individual Education Plans for EVERY student should not be a dream of the few, but a reality that can not happen soon enough. Certainly all of the very diverse people populating this book and our world make this inevitable!"
188,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5531911-brandy,5,"I enjoyed the book very much for what it is, a non-fiction book primarily focused on the history of autism. Most professionals (therapists, teachers, psychiatrists, etc.) could probably benefit from it. Autistics themselves may enjoy the book for the extensive level of detail Mr. Silberman goes into. Or if you enjoy history of disability rights, psychology books, or non-fiction in general it's worth reading. I finished it rather quickly since it's engrossing and moves smoothly. Some of it may be familiar territory to people with an extensive knowledge of psychiatry history (such as the bit about refrigerator mothers) but much of it is new and fresh information not previously included in any books. I'd consider it an essential reading on neurodiversity as well. My only caveat is I wouldn't really recommend it as an introduction to autism, since it's heavy on history and short on practical advice. So, if you're a parent of a newly diagnosed offspring, I'd direct you towards The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism first. Or if you are an adult newly diagnosed, ""Been There. Done That. Try This!: An Aspie's Guide to Life on Earth"" by Tony Attwood is a more practical starting point."

192,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"Although it was not clear to me in the title or even in the earliest chapters, Neurotribes is a history of the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. If I had known what I was getting into, I probably wouldn't have read it, at 542 pages. Still, I enjoyed this as a philosophy of science, as the descriptions of varying perceptions of autistics, as they currently like being called, over the course of the almost 100 years that they have been described. These varying descriptions and their implications are themselves fascinating. Kanner was the dominant early voice in the US.Kanner: ""Overambitious parents like the Tripletts had “stuffed” the impressionable minds of their children with useless information to cast themselves in a culturally favorable light and bolster their own egos"" (p. 190). He ""turned the detailed notes that parents had provided to him—which were so helpful in developing a clear picture of their children’s development—into a weapon, citing them as a “telling illustration of parental obsessiveness.”"" (p. 190)Asperger preceded Kanner, but his view of autistic children was more benign. It was also lost during WW2 and rediscovered later.Asperger: “Not everything that steps out of the line, and is thus ‘abnormal,’ must necessarily be ‘inferior.’” ""This boy’s difficulties—which particularly affect his relationships with himself and other people—are the price that he has to pay for his special gifts” (p. 128).It matters how we see these children (and adults), right? Are they low functioning, severely affected, or profoundly impaired or a “high-octane boy,” as one parent argued? Are the parents the cause of problems, as Kanner and Theodore and Ruth Lidz argued, or are they their children's supports? Some more quotes:Rudolf Ekstein: ""Tommy’s precocious interest in science was likely the result of “early childhood intensive sexual traumata” caused by seduction by his mother or a nursemaid"" (p. 211). Bernard Rimland: “Brightness gone awry” (p. 272)Ivar Lovaas (who believed you should punish self-injury): ""Once you had taken it upon yourself to physically strike a child, you were morally responsible for his fate. “No one punishes who isn’t prepared to devote a major part of his life to that child. Nobody punishes a child who doesn’t also love that child,” he told a reporter. “Once you lay your hand on a child it morally obligates you to work with that child. You see, that is one of the reasons that people stay away from punishment—they don’t want to commit themselves. After you hit a kid you can’t just get up and leave him; you are hooked to that kid.”"" (pp. 312-313)George Rekers and Ivar Lovaas: ""It’s easier to change a child’s behavior than it is to destigmatize that behavior in society—whether it’s limp wrists or flapping hands."" (p. 323)Barry Morrow:  “What Bill taught me... is that not only do people like Bill need society, society needs people like Bill.” (p. 363)Judith Gould: “We were not surprised when people started saying it was an epidemic. Obviously, by broadening the spectrum, you’re going to get higher numbers."" (p. 421)Temple Grandin: ""A “handicap” rather than a mental illness, invoking the humanizing language of disability over the stigmatizing lexicon of psychiatry"" (p. 426). Oliver Sacks: Their autism, “while it may be seen as a medical condition, and pathologized as a syndrome, must also be seen as a whole mode of being, a deeply different mode or identity, one that needs to be conscious (and proud) of itself.” (p. 430)Walter Spitzer: ""Autism as “a terminal illness . . . a dead soul in a live body.”"" (p. 431)Jim Sinclair: “Being autistic does not mean being inhuman. But it means that what is normal for other people is not normal for me, and what is normal for me is not normal for other people.”[I'm like] “an extraterrestrial stranded without an orientation manual” (p. 437)Laura Tyroncik: “Neurotypical syndrome is a neurobiological disorder characterized by preoccupation with social concerns, delusions of superiority, and obsession with conformity... There is no known cure.” (p. 441)Jim Sinclair: “Saying ‘person with autism’ suggests that autism is something bad—so bad that it isn’t even consistent with being a person...We talk about left-handed people, not ‘people with left-handedness,’ and about athletic or musical people, not about ‘people with athleticism’ or ‘people with musicality’ . . . It is only when someone has decided that the characteristic being referred to is negative that suddenly people want to separate it from the person.” (p. 441)Susan Moreno: ""Her life had been enriched in ways that she could never have predicted by coping with the challenges of raising Beth."" (p. 444)Ivar Lovaas: ""a normal child trapped within the “autistic shell,” waiting to be rescued.Dan Grover: “The goal is to alleviate those with Asperger’s from this pressure that they need to conform,” Grover said in the press release. “What is best is to learn how to use your uniqueness to your advantage and find your place in the world.” (p. 455)Ari Ne'eman: ""Not “symptoms” of his autism, but problems built into the ways that society treats people who don’t meet the standard expectations of “normal.”"" (p. 458)Carol Greenberg: “When I look at my son,” she says, “I think, ‘He’s not broken. He’s just neurologically outnumbered, like me.’” (p. 467).Do we understand autism? We have, at least, some interesting and useful understandings – and some that are not."
193,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"In pop psychology, nothing appears as self-evident as the statement that ""autism is a spectrum."" Silberman's book explains how recent this insight is, how controversial it remains, and how bumpy the road has been. The diagnostic history of the concept of autism (and related diagnoses) makes for an interesting story that deals with human tragedy, political struggle, and scientific discovery. Silberman has written an engaging book that gives readers a better understanding of the convoluted history of the condition and the importance of the social struggles of ""neurodiverse"" people.Since autistic people often (but not always) have a difficulty communicating and representing themselves in society, it is important that books that deal with the issue respect the source material - i.e. the patients and their families, with their very real human emotions and passions. In this regard, the book does a pretty good job. The copious anecdotes and tales of the daily life of autistic people remind us of the individuality and humanity of autistic people, including even the most uncommunicative (or differently communicative) individuals. That said, Silberman understandably focuses more on the parents and their struggles, on the one hand, and the doctors and their ambitions, on the other hand, rather than the inscrutable inner life of autistic people. The story focuses mostly on the dual stories of Leo Kenner and Hans Asperger, the two independent co-discovers of diagnostic autism. Their different interpretations and visions of the nature of the disorder (or, less disparagingly, the personality type) have shaped treatment options, medical practices, social attitudes, and social policies that have impacted the lives of autistic people. This story is absolutely fascinating. It contains insights about the often convoluted shape of the history of science, the importance of constructing a coherent and humane social narrative, the dangers of false beliefs, the social value of psychological difference (""neurodiversity""), and the importance of hearing multiple viewpoints in highlighting different aspects of the same phenomenon.The book is quite long. Sometimes I wish that it had pruned its narrative. The big picture often gets lost in trivia. There are way too many chapters narrating issues that are only tangentially related to autism, such as the biographies of several scientists, the history of science fiction fandom, the personal habits of individuals, etc... In a way, such an obsessive focus on trivia might be appropriate to the subject matter, but the end result is a book that is a 100 pages too long. Thankfully, this is just about the only negative thing I can say about the book, aside from the aforementioned fact that the book - mostly out of necessity - speaks mostly in the language of parents and doctors, rather than the autistic people themselves. This carries the danger of misrepresenting them. Overall, I really enjoyed the book. Human beings live in a complex world. Our capacity to understand difference and diversity, even in our own communities, is limited. We have trouble coping with psychological and behavioural traits that do not fit into our established models. Coming to grips with autism - and other forms of neurodiversity, such as ADHD, psychopathy, manic depressive disorder, narcissism, schizophrenia, etc. - will be crucial in helping people with those conditions. It will also allow society to take full advantage of the unique skills that diverse people bring to society. Recognizing difference in our society is the first step; treating people with kindness is another. And the final step is putting diversity in the service of science, technology, business, and politics. "
194,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7400591-writer-s-relief,5,"Autism is a disorder that, while prevalent in our society, we still know little about. In the enthralling NEUROTRIBES, journalist Steve Silberman takes readers on a sweeping journey through the history of autism, the hidden presence of autistic people in our society, and the dubious research methods used by psychologists searching for answers.In language that is elegant, engaging, and accessible, Silberman takes a humanizing look at the many people who shaped the conversation about autism before it was a formal diagnosis. We learn about the unconventional scientist Henry Cavendish, whose eccentricities belied a brilliant mind that altered scientific discourse. We also delve into the parallel lives and careers of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger (whom Asperger’s Syndrome is named after) and their complex lives and legacies. Silberman also depicts several disturbing elements of child abuse occurring within institutions for autistic children. Many of these passages are not for the faint of heart or for sensitive readers, but they are crucial in understanding the history of how autism was treated in our society. He also explores Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s destructive “study” alleging the MMR vaccine was linked to autism, which several reputable studies have since disproven. Wakefield’s faulty data gave rise to a movement of parents searching for a cure to autism—rather than pushing society to understand and make accommodations for their children.Through his in-depth research and accessible writing, Silberman communicates a powerful message: If we adjust our world to accommodate and make space for autistic people, they can change our world for the better. NEUROTRIBES is an informative, compelling, enlightening, and moving book you should read regardless of whether or not autism affects you, your family, or someone you know. And after reading it, you will likely learn that autism has indeed impacted your life in ways you never imagined."

198,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7325648-dan,5,"I have worked with autistic children for some years now but knew little of the history of the disorder. That has all changed now that I've read this excellent book. It's not entirely clear exactly what this book is about from the title but essentially it's a history of autism. It covers some people who were likely autistic long before the disorder was diagnosed, how Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner 'discovered' autism (independently), how Lorna Wing made diagnosis clearer than ever, how Rain Main ended up being made, the MMR scandal and much more besides. It feels quite a long book but when you consider just how much information it crams in it seems quite concise!There are several reasons this book works as well as it does. Silberman writes very neutrally, rarely giving an opinion on theories. There are plenty of uncomfortable sections of the book, from Kanner leading a surge of blaming parents' for autism to the attempt to cure autism with electric shock therapy. Silberman leaves the reader to decide the rights and wrongs by stating the evidence and quoting contemporaries. The author does a good job with his description of the autistic people included in the research. If you are very familiar with autism, like I am, he doesn't spend long periods time explaining many of the common traits of autism but he gives enough so that no matter how little you know of the disorder you can understand it. I also liked how much of the book focused on the autistic people themselves, something much of the research covered somehow failed to do. The book also helped me to refined my thoughts on autism and it's place in the world. For some readers I imagine it could completely changes their views on it. The book shows us how much value autistic people have added to our society and that they are not simply ""retarded"" as they were once considered. The idea that the human race wouldn't have evolved to where it is today without autistic people is a remarkable but plausible one. This is surely the best history of autism that exists. A challenging read at times, not least because of its length, but also due to views and actions that are incomprehensible today. But ultimately it's an inspiring one which celebrates autism for the remarkable way of thinking that it is."

It condemns the frankly barbaric methods used in early psychiatry, and never once forgets that at the core of all this talk about treatments and cures and diseases and plagues, are very real people with very real lives; who have real hopes and needs. Above all however, it highlights the deeply problematic attitudes ingrained in (western) society towards neurodivergent people, and puts those in a the broader historical context of psychiatry. The fact that it ends on a chapter dedicated to neurodiversity and self-advocacy is fantastic and wraps the whole thing up very neatly. "
200,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This is a bit of a slog to read, because it spends a lot of time lingering on details that you may or may not feel are relevant. It goes into the lives of the people who ‘discovered’ autism and described it clinically, much more than it goes into the lives of actual autistic people, and there’s one chapter I found rather troubling which follows the family of an autistic child. It focuses on their anguish and confusion, and their increasingly desperate attempts to “treat” their son with whatever unpleasant, pseudo-scientific methods they could find. By the end, I was desperate to hear that someone had actually ever asked the child what effect it had on him. (As far as I can tell, nobody did.) Those particular parents weren’t extreme, but nonetheless, I got very tired of their desperation to have a “normal” child.It also does some retrospective diagnosing of a couple of scientists and thinkers from days before there was such a diagnosis. I’m always a bit iffy on that: there do seem to be good grounds to make those judgements, but… most of the people I know now don’t know much about what goes on in my head and why I react the way I do. I don’t want them diagnosing me once I’m dead. Still, at least it does provide autistic models and heroes for people now.I’m also a little leery of the ubiquity of being on the spectrum in Silberman’s view. Lots of fandom, lots of engineers, maybe even most in the picture he’s painting — it’s a stereotype of fandom and of STEM that I haven’t necessarily found to be true. And fandom hasn’t been so very welcoming of actual neurodiverse people, either. If it’s ever been the perfect home for them, it isn’t now.All in all, though, I did find the book interesting, and the perspective on neurodiversity as something to be accommodated and used productively is one that’s definitely timely. Despite my criticisms, I found it an interesting book — and it definitely treats autism as a spectrum, touching all kinds of people. This definitely isn’t the attitudes of Autism Speaks: instead, Silberman urges understanding, accommodation and respect.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."

As someone on the spectrum, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the ""autism as a disease"" rhetoric and focus on finding a cure instead of finding solutions to integrate autistic people into society. I happened to study psychology in undergraduate, a field I did not end up pursuing because I felt so alienated from it because of the way autism was talked about by my professors and peers. Nobody would believe me if I voiced my opinion on the potential harms of ""erasing"" autistic behavior, and why should they? Due to a lifetime of internalized ableism, I have grown to hate autistic aspects of myself, like my social awkwardness. Any attempts to prove that my autism was an acceptable part of who I am would just prove futile.This is the book that every psychology student, every social worker, and frankly everyone should read. It covers not only the history of autism but the beginnings of the neurodiversity movement and its momentum. It sheds light on the hoaxes and misinformation that people still believe today. This is the most comprehensive yet also humanizing work by a neurotypical writer on autism out there, and I'm glad it exists.That being said, the book does suffer from a lack of focus at points. I could've done without the digressions into the life stories of all the researchers who studied autism save Hans Asperger. There is too much focus on the history of how the autism diagnosis came to be, where the more meaty story comes from the neurodiversity movement (especially in defiance of false psychology), which is sadly only relegated as more of an afterthought even though I think it's the point Silberman was building up to starting with Hans Asperger. Despite the fact that many sections meander off-topic and therefore make it difficult to slog through, I still think this book is required reading because it offers such a holistic view on the fascinating history of how ""autism"" came to be and how it fits into the world. "
202,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29044542-jo-salas,5,"Essential reading for anyone involved with or concerned about autism--Silberman does a brilliant job of reframing this huge topic by telling the little-known story of how autism was discovered more or less simultaneously in the US, by Leo Kanner, and in Germany--Nazi Germany--by Hans Asperger. Kanner pathologized the condition and concluded it was very rare: Asperger thought it was a fascinating, often enriching, and common human condition. Tragically, his work was obscured by the era he lived in. In his writing he foregrounded a few very high-functioning kids in order to save many others from Hitler, who was murdering people considered disabled. It meant that for decades the few researchers and doctors who were aware of Asperger's work thought it related only to one end of the spectrum. Although Kanner's contribution was important as well, his very different analysis has led, directly and indirectly, to much of the panic and misinformation that shadows autism today. Thousands of lives could have been far happier if Asperger's rather than Kanner's interpretation had been the basis for further research and treatment. It is heartbreaking to read of the inadvertent cruelty inflicted by well-meaning but ill-informed people. There's much more to this story, of course: many other heroes (including autistic children and adults) and a few shocking villains. I hope the book changes the picture and allows us to embrace all ""neurotribes,"" and to emphasize lifelong resources and support, rather than a ""cure."" "

Because I decided I didn't have time and it was long and I had school work and a million other books to read. I'm an idiot. Seriously, I am. I should have just sacrificed the other books and gone for this one. Oh well. I read it now and that's what counts.I've always had an interest in autism and Asperger's, along with many other odd interests. Don't ask me about the others or we'd spend the whole review on them rather than this wonderful book. I did a lot of research on it once to accurately write a character I wanted to explore, but nothing really came of it. Now, I definitely want this book on my shelf when I have an actual office in the distant future. It's a handy book to tell people that autism has been around as long as humans have been and even as long as humans began recording history.This book was incredibly amazing to listen to because it takes you from early conceptions and case studies of actual historical people and modern day parents living with autistic children. Dotted throughout the real life stories, the conception of autism and how it was treated throughout history also was laid out and explained. I think that right now, as the book shows it, we're in a very good spot for autism. Right now, they're practically being hailed in popular TV shows with portrayals that speak to non-autistic (also called NTs in the autism community, which I loved) people. It can only keep going up."

This book is an excellent introduction to the history of autism and the diagnostic debates but it spend only one chapter on the future. Even the chapters on self-advocacy and patient rights came at the end and felt more focused on past victories than on how to work to create a more inclusive society going forward.""Neurotribes"" provides a cultural history of autism in western Europe and the United States from about 1700 to the present. I found the exclusive focus on white, western families disappointing. Although Silberman acknowledges that a diagnosis of autism is very different for poor families or families (especially boys) of color, he does not include these stories in the book or explicitly suggest that these families have a place in a neurodiverse world. These critiques aside, I am sure this is a book I will use in my teaching on autism, the vaccine ""controversy,"" and ableism. Silberman's text is deeply human and rich with individual stories, emotion, and compassion. I found that his account of dry, medical in-fighting managed to retain some of the passion its participants surely felt in the 1930s to the present. What it lacked in hard science it more than made up for in its cultural work. "
205,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502519-julie,4,"This book gave an historical perspective that released me from guilt and anxiety as a parent of a child on the spectrum. I understand now, that in 1999, when we got the diagnosis, that the 'experts' knew almost as little as we did. We did therapies, meds, IEPs, homeschooled, started a social group, changed diets, and held together as best we could. We did the best with what we knew, and I can see now that we did amazingly well considering the machines we were up against. I do feel like this book portrays too rosy of a picture. There is a profound loneliness. Maybe not all of our kids have a special talent. As a parent with tendencies of my own, that makes it hard to network and socialize in a way that brings opportunities to my child. There is a lot of emphasis on what can your child ""do"" to make them valuable, and this is a dangerous view. It can be frustrating when society thinks that if you are on the spectrum, you must have some supernatural talent for numbers, engineering, memorization, etc. There's also a mostly unaddressed issue of the parents or communities who don't go out of their way to be accommodating. What will happen when we aren't there to advocate? When one is unable to live independently, how will this generation manage? Ultimately, this is a positive, empowering book, and that's a good thing."

I had to put it down several times because the specificity of the stories but I'm grateful for the work and for having the experience. I don't have the details about Asperger and Kanner now (because my memory is not strong) but I've retained a sense for the ways these doctors were relentless in noticing their overlooked patients. I'm left with so much gratitude for those who have come before us, so many parents who were loving activists for their children, so many children whose lives were forgotten and misunderstood. My son with autism has incredible resources (not enough, of course, but what we have is pretty great) that are helping him live his best life and maximize his strengths so that he can get along in the world of people. I'm taken with the notion and reality of neurodiversity. Autism is not a monolith and it is not new. I love that Silberman ends with how much work there is to do regarding autism and people of color, epilepsy for people with autism who are considered intellectually disabled, and, for those who are not (like my son), mental health treatment. The statistic that people like my son are nine times more likely to commit suicide than neurotypical people hits too close to home. "

I don't know why I expected it to be about neurobiology or neurochemistry ... I guess that piece of word ""neuro"" in the title threw me off. Mr. Silberman has a degree in English, so he's a very good writer... but he's not at all a scientist of any sort. What a disappointment. He really is a wonderful writer and if I were interested in history, I'd love this book. I'll keep an eye out for future books of his if he writes about something more interesting. This book is a history of ASD, told entirely from a non-scientific perspective. It contains many mildly interesting stories of researchers and people with autism over the years. It touches superficially on the contributions to science, literature, and technology that a few famous people with autism have made to mainstream society. It really is probably a good book if you haven't read anything like it before. But you could probably just read his famous Wired article and get the gist. If you're super interested in the lives of famous people with autism, I'd suggest simply picking one and reading one of their biographies."

As someone currently investigating their own possible autism, this was truly an essential read. Rarely does work on autism focus so much on who autistic people are, and all that they have accomplished, rather tending to focus on limits of autism solely. One thing that stood out so much to me was the enormous scientific contribution to society made by autistic people, weighed against the sheer volume of bad science that has led to complete misunderstandings of the diagnosis and a focus on cures rather than provisions. Neurotribes spans the history of autism, through Asperger's and Kanner's work with autistic people, through to online support networks created by autistic people, gleefully mentioning the wonderful work of Oliver Sacks, Lorna Wing, and the representation of autistic people in the media, thanks to the film Rain Man and the works of Temple Grandin.I wholeheartedly recommend this, especially if you work with or know autistic people."

Inspiring at times and heartbreaking at others, this book chronicles the long journey of autism from obscurity to discovery to awareness and the evolution of its diagnostic criteria along the way. From the darkest periods of widespread institutionalization and horrific experiments to shining examples of brilliant autistic minds, loving families and positive steps forward in policy and advocacy, this book really covers it all.If your child has just been diagnosed, you’ll likely find that the internet is inundated with a whole lot of doom-and-gloom narratives perpetuated by self-pitying autism warrior parents and organizations like Autism Speaks. What a relief it is when you dig deeper and discover the vibrant, inclusive, autistic-led neurodiversity movement that celebrates your child’s neurology instead of dehumanizing it. Definitely read this book."
210,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3856605-rebecca-mcphedran,4,"I received this book as an advanced readers copy from NetGalley.A smart, accessible, comprehensive history of autism. Silberman does an amazing job of giving an in depth history of a medical condition that we only have just learned about within the last 70 years. His chapters run the gamut. From institutionalizations to special schools, from Asperger's initial findings, to Kanners complete appropriation of Asperger's ideas. He talks about the different treatments of Autism from electroshock therapy, to major antipsychotics, to biomedical interventions. He spends a lot of time on the words used to describe the diagnosis. He spends a lot of time on helping you get to know the individuals who helped shape the idea and diagnosis of autism. It is almost overwhelming, and sometimes it's hard to keep the players straight. I thoroughly enjoyed the end of the book, in which he talks about where autism is headed. It's headed in a new direction. The direction is not steered by parents of autistic children, as in the past, but by autistic individuals themselves. And this is exciting. We wouldn't be the enlightened, cultured civilization if not for the advancements that autistic people have given us. I feel like this book is a gift, to help us better understand our own human race, and the people who help shape our lives, in some unexpected ways. A great read if you are interested in the history of autism and human rights. "
211,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,5,"This is extremely good nonfiction. Although other reviewers have noted that it is a very long book, packed full of details, I found it to be extremely engaging, with only a few very short dull parts (it is hard to make changes to DSM criteria riveting, but actually Silberman did better than you could ever imagine). Silberman's writing voice is upbeat and entertaining, and a dense topic is made readable with lots of wonderful and colorful personal details and anecdotes. I don't know if this would be such a page-turner to someone with less personal interest in autism spectrum issues, but I found it absolutely compelling. In addition to being extremely well written, Silberman is consistently pro-autistic and his message of neurodiversity is powerful and very needed. It would be wrong to call it ""ground breaking"" - as some have - because he is just digesting and conveying ideas that have been out there for decades, but it is also impossible to underestimate the importance of getting those ideas out to a bigger audience. For that, it comes back to how wonderfully well written this book is, and Silberman deserves real credit. This is definitely one of my favorite nonfiction reads of 2015 and maybe for the past couple years. "
212,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,4,"The last two chapters of the book, which are about the movement for neurodiversity, are exemplary. The rest of the book is about the history of the psychologists who ""discovered"" autism in the early twentieth century, and the methods that parents and doctors thought would cure autistic people -- electroshock, corporal punishment, severe dietary restrictions (which is still trendy among ""leaky gut"" proponents). It was horrifying. Indeed, let others praise not-so ancient times, I am glad I was born in these.My one criticism is that the narrative isn't linear. In the span of a few pages, Silberman discussed events in one decade, backtracked to a previous decade, and returned to the initial decade. I didn't read very much during my time in Rome, but I finished during the flight home."

When a polemic, it is snarky and poorly reasoned, taking potshots at psychoanalysis and casting aspersions on researchers motivations without much to back them up. When it is reporting, it is informative and though provoking and has much to recommend it. I came away feeling that there was an axe being ground here, but was not clear what the axe was really. This could have been a much better book and so I was greatly disappointed."

Read this book."
215,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14219722-edoardo-albert,4,"As the father of two autistic boys, I've read more than my fair share of the burgeoning field of autistic books so it's a pleasure to find a new departure in reading on the subject. Up until now, most books on autism have fallen into one of three categories:1. the inspiring parental story of recovering a child from the depths of autistic disengagement via some new and unlikely therapy often involving animals and/or shamans;2. the inspiring autistic autobiography, telling how an autistic person overcame discrimination and misunderstanding to achieve personal autonomy and a good life;3. the how-to guide for parents with autistic children.Now Steve Silberman has added a third category: the history of autism as a medically recognised condition, from the physicians who first spotted it and struggled, more or less successfully, to describe, through the various therapies tried to cure/treat/ameliorate/accommodate it, to the split between different autistic 'camps' and schools, to about where we are now: a condition that has gone from almost nothing to almost everyday within two generations. As a history, it's generally excellent, although a little marred by Silberman's tendency to paint people as 'good guys' (Hans Asperger - the Austrian physician who first recognised the condition and pioneered a notably gentle and appreciative treatment) and 'bad guys' (Leo Kanner - Austrian-American psychiatrist who popularised a restrictive view of autism in America whom Silberger basically accuses of stealing Asperger's work). The reality seems greyer and harder to define, particularly in light of recent evidence that Asperger fell into the morally grey areas of a doctor working under the Nazi regime: he seems to have sent at least two of his children to the Spiegelgrund clinic knowing that they would likely be euthanised there, while managing to protect most of the children under his care. The history of autism thus becomes entwined with the history of the century and the changing nature of medical theorising: from restrictive diagnoses that sought to exclude those who were borderline to diagnoses that now tend to bring far more children within a diagnostic framework. What is clear, is that autism is a spectrum, with many of its traits being potentially highly useful. I do sometimes wonder, as a parent, whether the insight that drove the MMR anxiety that linked the vaccine to the increase in levels of autism might have other sources. It's quite common for parents of autistic children to think they are developing normally and then, at an early age but usually somewhere between one and three, for there to be a sudden falling off in the child's development: the first of many subsequent meltdowns. I remember that with the eldest of my two autistic sons. In his case, the decline coincided with his starting at school. Now autism is a developmental disorder and I wonder if one possible factor in its increase is the earlier and earlier ages at which we are putting children into school. For any child, and particularly for boys, the sudden move from the predictable and stable environment of home, dealing mainly with parents and siblings, into the far less predictable environment of school where volatile peers are the main source of interaction might cause a social-system overload leading to a massive withdrawal from social and linguistic learning as the child tries desperately to accommodate and cope with the sudden huge increase in stimuli, both physical and sensory. If there's any truth in this idea, then countries where children begin school later should have lower rates of autism. It would be interesting to see if this bears out. In the meantime, read Silberman's book if you want to know how autism, as a medically recognised condition with a wide and often competing range of therapies, arrived at its present stage. For all our difficulties today, it's still a huge improvement over the days of 'refrigerator mothers' when much of the medical profession basically blamed the parents for the child's condition or some of the frankly horrible 'cures' devised by the Behaviourist. It also serves as a useful reminder that the real expert is one who understands that he still has much to learn about a subject."
216,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"This is definitely more a book about the history of autism than it is a book about autism itself, so if you're looking for the nitty gritty of what it means to be on the spectrum or how the brain works, it's probably better to look elsewhere. NeuroTribes seems to have mainly been written in response to all the hubbub in recent years by the contingent claiming that there is an autism epidemic and that it is being caused by vaccinations. Silberman looks back at how long autism has existed (probably pretty much as long as people have existed), including looking back at a number of historical figures that were most likely autistic, like Henry Cavendish and Paul Dirac. Then he goes into all the details of how it's been diagnosed over the course of the last couple hundred years and why the fact that more and more people are being diagnosed with it now than ever before doesn't mean that more people are actually autistic than ever before; it's just that recent corrections in diagnostic guidelines have made it easier for people to receive ""on the spectrum"" diagnoses, and therefore more people are now able to gain access to the support and services they need. Silberman goes through all of this in a very balanced way, and without demonizing anyone, recognizing that the data can seem misleading, and that parents on both sides just want what's best for their kids. But I love that he does bend the focus more towards working on gaining support and services for people with autism and their families than working towards finding a cure for autism. His opinion, and I think what a lot of his research shows, is that people on the autism spectrum have made and continue to make a lot of really important contributions, especially in the fields of science and technology, but in lots of other areas as well, not in spite of the ways their minds work, but because of it, and that we're all just working on different operating systems. I like that description a lot.Anyway, this is a really good look through how our view of autism has changed throughout history, as well as how it's been diagnosed and treated. And definitely well worth a read if you're looking for a fairly balanced account of how and why the whole vaccinations-might-cause-autism debate began."
217,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7874958-joleigh,5,"Teaching high school for over thirty years made me more than aware of neurodiversity. Any accomplished educator is well aware that no two students are alike. Devising curriculum and instruction to meet the needs of a classroom full of independent thinkers and learners is a challenge to say the least. I was one who lived for that challenge and, in retirement, still teach two classes a semester at a community college. I am most alive in the classroom and thrive on the challenges of diversity. During my last five years in public high school education, I taught in an inclusion classroom with an exceptional special education teacher who taught me more in those few years than any other educator over the course of my career!Steve Silberman's book is a revelation! It validates so much of what I have come to believe as an educator. His work is well-researched and well-written for anyone to access. The history of neurodiversity is filled with tragedy, but is overwhelmingly full of the ""aha!"" moments that make life so interesting. This book is for everyone who is alive on our world today! We share space with others who are as diverse as we are and with whom we need to learn to create the future. In reading this book, we recognize ourselves, significant others, friends, relatives, colleagues, and fascinating strangers. In negotiating our way through life, we have to embrace diversity around us in all of its may facets, including the diversity in the working of the minds around us.My real hope is that this and other books like it will lead to the revolution in education so may of us have been seeking which will provide comprehensive change to meet the needs of every individual mind entering a school or classroom. Individual Education Plans for EVERY student should not be a dream of the few, but a reality that can not happen soon enough.

218,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5531911-brandy,5,"I enjoyed the book very much for what it is, a non-fiction book primarily focused on the history of autism. Most professionals (therapists, teachers, psychiatrists, etc.) could probably benefit from it. Autistics themselves may enjoy the book for the extensive level of detail Mr. Silberman goes into. Or if you enjoy history of disability rights, psychology books, or non-fiction in general it's worth reading. I finished it rather quickly since it's engrossing and moves smoothly. Some of it may be familiar territory to people with an extensive knowledge of psychiatry history (such as the bit about refrigerator mothers) but much of it is new and fresh information not previously included in any books. I'd consider it an essential reading on neurodiversity as well. My only caveat is I wouldn't really recommend it as an introduction to autism, since it's heavy on history and short on practical advice. So, if you're a parent of a newly diagnosed offspring, I'd direct you towards The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism first. Or if you are an adult newly diagnosed, ""Been There. Done That. Try This!: An Aspie's Guide to Life on Earth"" by Tony Attwood is a more practical starting point."

If I had known what I was getting into, I probably wouldn't have read it, at 542 pages. Still, I enjoyed this as a philosophy of science, as the descriptions of varying perceptions of autistics, as they currently like being called, over the course of the almost 100 years that they have been described. These varying descriptions and their implications are themselves fascinating. Kanner was the dominant early voice in the US.Kanner: ""Overambitious parents like the Tripletts had “stuffed” the impressionable minds of their children with useless information to cast themselves in a culturally favorable light and bolster their own egos"" (p. 190). He ""turned the detailed notes that parents had provided to him—which were so helpful in developing a clear picture of their children’s development—into a weapon, citing them as a “telling illustration of parental obsessiveness.”"" (p. 190)Asperger preceded Kanner, but his view of autistic children was more benign. It was also lost during WW2 and rediscovered later.Asperger: “Not everything that steps out of the line, and is thus ‘abnormal,’ must necessarily be ‘inferior.’” ""This boy’s difficulties—which particularly affect his relationships with himself and other people—are the price that he has to pay for his special gifts” (p. 128).It matters how we see these children (and adults), right? Are they low functioning, severely affected, or profoundly impaired or a “high-octane boy,” as one parent argued? Are the parents the cause of problems, as Kanner and Theodore and Ruth Lidz argued, or are they their children's supports? Some more quotes:Rudolf Ekstein: ""Tommy’s precocious interest in science was likely the result of “early childhood intensive sexual traumata” caused by seduction by his mother or a nursemaid"" (p. 211). Bernard Rimland: “Brightness gone awry” (p. 272)Ivar Lovaas (who believed you should punish self-injury): ""Once you had taken it upon yourself to physically strike a child, you were morally responsible for his fate. “No one punishes who isn’t prepared to devote a major part of his life to that child. Nobody punishes a child who doesn’t also love that child,” he told a reporter. “Once you lay your hand on a child it morally obligates you to work with that child. You see, that is one of the reasons that people stay away from punishment—they don’t want to commit themselves. After you hit a kid you can’t just get up and leave him; you are hooked to that kid.”"" (pp. 312-313)George Rekers and Ivar Lovaas: ""It’s easier to change a child’s behavior than it is to destigmatize that behavior in society—whether it’s limp wrists or flapping hands."" (p. 323)Barry Morrow:  “What Bill taught me... is that not only do people like Bill need society, society needs people like Bill.” (p. 363)Judith Gould: “We were not surprised when people started saying it was an epidemic. Obviously, by broadening the spectrum, you’re going to get higher numbers."" (p. 421)Temple Grandin: ""A “handicap” rather than a mental illness, invoking the humanizing language of disability over the stigmatizing lexicon of psychiatry"" (p. 426). Oliver Sacks: Their autism, “while it may be seen as a medical condition, and pathologized as a syndrome, must also be seen as a whole mode of being, a deeply different mode or identity, one that needs to be conscious (and proud) of itself.” (p. 430)Walter Spitzer: ""Autism as “a terminal illness . . . a dead soul in a live body.”"" (p. 431)Jim Sinclair: “Being autistic does not mean being inhuman. But it means that what is normal for other people is not normal for me, and what is normal for me is not normal for other people.”[I'm like] “an extraterrestrial stranded without an orientation manual” (p. 437)Laura Tyroncik: “Neurotypical syndrome is a neurobiological disorder characterized by preoccupation with social concerns, delusions of superiority, and obsession with conformity... There is no known cure.” (p. 441)Jim Sinclair: “Saying ‘person with autism’ suggests that autism is something bad—so bad that it isn’t even consistent with being a person...We talk about left-handed people, not ‘people with left-handedness,’ and about athletic or musical people, not about ‘people with athleticism’ or ‘people with musicality’ . . . It is only when someone has decided that the characteristic being referred to is negative that suddenly people want to separate it from the person.” (p. 441)Susan Moreno: ""Her life had been enriched in ways that she could never have predicted by coping with the challenges of raising Beth."" (p. 444)Ivar Lovaas: ""a normal child trapped within the “autistic shell,” waiting to be rescued.Dan Grover: “The goal is to alleviate those with Asperger’s from this pressure that they need to conform,” Grover said in the press release. “What is best is to learn how to use your uniqueness to your advantage and find your place in the world.” (p. 455)Ari Ne'eman: ""Not “symptoms” of his autism, but problems built into the ways that society treats people who don’t meet the standard expectations of “normal.”"" (p. 458)Carol Greenberg: “When I look at my son,” she says, “I think, ‘He’s not broken. He’s just neurologically outnumbered, like me.’” (p. 467).Do we understand autism? We have, at least, some interesting and useful understandings – and some that are not."

The diagnostic history of the concept of autism (and related diagnoses) makes for an interesting story that deals with human tragedy, political struggle, and scientific discovery. Silberman has written an engaging book that gives readers a better understanding of the convoluted history of the condition and the importance of the social struggles of ""neurodiverse"" people.Since autistic people often (but not always) have a difficulty communicating and representing themselves in society, it is important that books that deal with the issue respect the source material - i.e. the patients and their families, with their very real human emotions and passions. In this regard, the book does a pretty good job. The copious anecdotes and tales of the daily life of autistic people remind us of the individuality and humanity of autistic people, including even the most uncommunicative (or differently communicative) individuals. That said, Silberman understandably focuses more on the parents and their struggles, on the one hand, and the doctors and their ambitions, on the other hand, rather than the inscrutable inner life of autistic people. The story focuses mostly on the dual stories of Leo Kenner and Hans Asperger, the two independent co-discovers of diagnostic autism. Their different interpretations and visions of the nature of the disorder (or, less disparagingly, the personality type) have shaped treatment options, medical practices, social attitudes, and social policies that have impacted the lives of autistic people. This story is absolutely fascinating. It contains insights about the often convoluted shape of the history of science, the importance of constructing a coherent and humane social narrative, the dangers of false beliefs, the social value of psychological difference (""neurodiversity""), and the importance of hearing multiple viewpoints in highlighting different aspects of the same phenomenon.The book is quite long. Sometimes I wish that it had pruned its narrative. The big picture often gets lost in trivia. There are way too many chapters narrating issues that are only tangentially related to autism, such as the biographies of several scientists, the history of science fiction fandom, the personal habits of individuals, etc... In a way, such an obsessive focus on trivia might be appropriate to the subject matter, but the end result is a book that is a 100 pages too long. Thankfully, this is just about the only negative thing I can say about the book, aside from the aforementioned fact that the book - mostly out of necessity - speaks mostly in the language of parents and doctors, rather than the autistic people themselves. This carries the danger of misrepresenting them. Overall, I really enjoyed the book. Human beings live in a complex world. Our capacity to understand difference and diversity, even in our own communities, is limited. We have trouble coping with psychological and behavioural traits that do not fit into our established models. Coming to grips with autism - and other forms of neurodiversity, such as ADHD, psychopathy, manic depressive disorder, narcissism, schizophrenia, etc. - will be crucial in helping people with those conditions. It will also allow society to take full advantage of the unique skills that diverse people bring to society. Recognizing difference in our society is the first step; treating people with kindness is another. And the final step is putting diversity in the service of science, technology, business, and politics. "
224,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7400591-writer-s-relief,5,"Autism is a disorder that, while prevalent in our society, we still know little about. In the enthralling NEUROTRIBES, journalist Steve Silberman takes readers on a sweeping journey through the history of autism, the hidden presence of autistic people in our society, and the dubious research methods used by psychologists searching for answers.In language that is elegant, engaging, and accessible, Silberman takes a humanizing look at the many people who shaped the conversation about autism before it was a formal diagnosis. We learn about the unconventional scientist Henry Cavendish, whose eccentricities belied a brilliant mind that altered scientific discourse. We also delve into the parallel lives and careers of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger (whom Asperger’s Syndrome is named after) and their complex lives and legacies. Silberman also depicts several disturbing elements of child abuse occurring within institutions for autistic children. Many of these passages are not for the faint of heart or for sensitive readers, but they are crucial in understanding the history of how autism was treated in our society. He also explores Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s destructive “study” alleging the MMR vaccine was linked to autism, which several reputable studies have since disproven. Wakefield’s faulty data gave rise to a movement of parents searching for a cure to autism—rather than pushing society to understand and make accommodations for their children.Through his in-depth research and accessible writing, Silberman communicates a powerful message: If we adjust our world to accommodate and make space for autistic people, they can change our world for the better. NEUROTRIBES is an informative, compelling, enlightening, and moving book you should read regardless of whether or not autism affects you, your family, or someone you know. And after reading it, you will likely learn that autism has indeed impacted your life in ways you never imagined."

It took me such a long time because it is so information heavy that I could only read a couple pages in a day because I wouldn’t want to overload on information. It was shocking to see how disabled people have been treated throughout history. And to learn more about autism as it is such a wide spectrum. “If you meet one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism.” Though I definitely would’ve wanted to learn more about autism in that sense, where this book focused instead more on the history. It became super confusing to follow the timeline, especially jumping between years and countries. Though I don’t regret reading it I’ll probably only retain like 10% of the information xD"
228,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7325648-dan,5,"I have worked with autistic children for some years now but knew little of the history of the disorder. That has all changed now that I've read this excellent book. It's not entirely clear exactly what this book is about from the title but essentially it's a history of autism. It covers some people who were likely autistic long before the disorder was diagnosed, how Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner 'discovered' autism (independently), how Lorna Wing made diagnosis clearer than ever, how Rain Main ended up being made, the MMR scandal and much more besides. It feels quite a long book but when you consider just how much information it crams in it seems quite concise!There are several reasons this book works as well as it does. Silberman writes very neutrally, rarely giving an opinion on theories. There are plenty of uncomfortable sections of the book, from Kanner leading a surge of blaming parents' for autism to the attempt to cure autism with electric shock therapy. Silberman leaves the reader to decide the rights and wrongs by stating the evidence and quoting contemporaries. The author does a good job with his description of the autistic people included in the research. If you are very familiar with autism, like I am, he doesn't spend long periods time explaining many of the common traits of autism but he gives enough so that no matter how little you know of the disorder you can understand it. I also liked how much of the book focused on the autistic people themselves, something much of the research covered somehow failed to do. The book also helped me to refined my thoughts on autism and it's place in the world. For some readers I imagine it could completely changes their views on it. The book shows us how much value autistic people have added to our society and that they are not simply ""retarded"" as they were once considered. The idea that the human race wouldn't have evolved to where it is today without autistic people is a remarkable but plausible one. This is surely the best history of autism that exists. A challenging read at times, not least because of its length, but also due to views and actions that are incomprehensible today. But ultimately it's an inspiring one which celebrates autism for the remarkable way of thinking that it is."
229,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53177731-anouk,5,"Not only does this book give an incredibly detailed overview of the various medical and social concepts of autism over the last century, but it manages to do so in a way that is, for once, respectful of autistic and other neurodivergent people. It condemns the frankly barbaric methods used in early psychiatry, and never once forgets that at the core of all this talk about treatments and cures and diseases and plagues, are very real people with very real lives; who have real hopes and needs. Above all however, it highlights the deeply problematic attitudes ingrained in (western) society towards neurodivergent people, and puts those in a the broader historical context of psychiatry. The fact that it ends on a chapter dedicated to neurodiversity and self-advocacy is fantastic and wraps the whole thing up very neatly. "
230,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This is a bit of a slog to read, because it spends a lot of time lingering on details that you may or may not feel are relevant. It goes into the lives of the people who ‘discovered’ autism and described it clinically, much more than it goes into the lives of actual autistic people, and there’s one chapter I found rather troubling which follows the family of an autistic child. It focuses on their anguish and confusion, and their increasingly desperate attempts to “treat” their son with whatever unpleasant, pseudo-scientific methods they could find. By the end, I was desperate to hear that someone had actually ever asked the child what effect it had on him. (As far as I can tell, nobody did.) Those particular parents weren’t extreme, but nonetheless, I got very tired of their desperation to have a “normal” child.It also does some retrospective diagnosing of a couple of scientists and thinkers from days before there was such a diagnosis. I’m always a bit iffy on that: there do seem to be good grounds to make those judgements, but… most of the people I know now don’t know much about what goes on in my head and why I react the way I do. I don’t want them diagnosing me once I’m dead. Still, at least it does provide autistic models and heroes for people now.I’m also a little leery of the ubiquity of being on the spectrum in Silberman’s view. Lots of fandom, lots of engineers, maybe even most in the picture he’s painting — it’s a stereotype of fandom and of STEM that I haven’t necessarily found to be true. And fandom hasn’t been so very welcoming of actual neurodiverse people, either. If it’s ever been the perfect home for them, it isn’t now.All in all, though, I did find the book interesting, and the perspective on neurodiversity as something to be accommodated and used productively is one that’s definitely timely. Despite my criticisms, I found it an interesting book — and it definitely treats autism as a spectrum, touching all kinds of people. This definitely isn’t the attitudes of Autism Speaks: instead, Silberman urges understanding, accommodation and respect.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
231,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27045365-katy,4,"This is a book that needed to be written. As someone on the spectrum, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the ""autism as a disease"" rhetoric and focus on finding a cure instead of finding solutions to integrate autistic people into society. I happened to study psychology in undergraduate, a field I did not end up pursuing because I felt so alienated from it because of the way autism was talked about by my professors and peers. Nobody would believe me if I voiced my opinion on the potential harms of ""erasing"" autistic behavior, and why should they? Due to a lifetime of internalized ableism, I have grown to hate autistic aspects of myself, like my social awkwardness. Any attempts to prove that my autism was an acceptable part of who I am would just prove futile.This is the book that every psychology student, every social worker, and frankly everyone should read. It covers not only the history of autism but the beginnings of the neurodiversity movement and its momentum. It sheds light on the hoaxes and misinformation that people still believe today. This is the most comprehensive yet also humanizing work by a neurotypical writer on autism out there, and I'm glad it exists.That being said, the book does suffer from a lack of focus at points. I could've done without the digressions into the life stories of all the researchers who studied autism save Hans Asperger. There is too much focus on the history of how the autism diagnosis came to be, where the more meaty story comes from the neurodiversity movement (especially in defiance of false psychology), which is sadly only relegated as more of an afterthought even though I think it's the point Silberman was building up to starting with Hans Asperger. Despite the fact that many sections meander off-topic and therefore make it difficult to slog through, I still think this book is required reading because it offers such a holistic view on the fascinating history of how ""autism"" came to be and how it fits into the world. "
232,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29044542-jo-salas,5,"Essential reading for anyone involved with or concerned about autism--Silberman does a brilliant job of reframing this huge topic by telling the little-known story of how autism was discovered more or less simultaneously in the US, by Leo Kanner, and in Germany--Nazi Germany--by Hans Asperger. Kanner pathologized the condition and concluded it was very rare: Asperger thought it was a fascinating, often enriching, and common human condition. Tragically, his work was obscured by the era he lived in. In his writing he foregrounded a few very high-functioning kids in order to save many others from Hitler, who was murdering people considered disabled. It meant that for decades the few researchers and doctors who were aware of Asperger's work thought it related only to one end of the spectrum. Although Kanner's contribution was important as well, his very different analysis has led, directly and indirectly, to much of the panic and misinformation that shadows autism today. Thousands of lives could have been far happier if Asperger's rather than Kanner's interpretation had been the basis for further research and treatment. It is heartbreaking to read of the inadvertent cruelty inflicted by well-meaning but ill-informed people. There's much more to this story, of course: many other heroes (including autistic children and adults) and a few shocking villains. I hope the book changes the picture and allows us to embrace all ""neurotribes,"" and to emphasize lifelong resources and support, rather than a ""cure."" "

Because I decided I didn't have time and it was long and I had school work and a million other books to read. I'm an idiot. Seriously, I am. I should have just sacrificed the other books and gone for this one. Oh well. I read it now and that's what counts.I've always had an interest in autism and Asperger's, along with many other odd interests. Don't ask me about the others or we'd spend the whole review on them rather than this wonderful book. I did a lot of research on it once to accurately write a character I wanted to explore, but nothing really came of it. Now, I definitely want this book on my shelf when I have an actual office in the distant future. It's a handy book to tell people that autism has been around as long as humans have been and even as long as humans began recording history.This book was incredibly amazing to listen to because it takes you from early conceptions and case studies of actual historical people and modern day parents living with autistic children. Dotted throughout the real life stories, the conception of autism and how it was treated throughout history also was laid out and explained. I think that right now, as the book shows it, we're in a very good spot for autism. Right now, they're practically being hailed in popular TV shows with portrayals that speak to non-autistic (also called NTs in the autism community, which I loved) people. It can only keep going up."

This book is an excellent introduction to the history of autism and the diagnostic debates but it spend only one chapter on the future. Even the chapters on self-advocacy and patient rights came at the end and felt more focused on past victories than on how to work to create a more inclusive society going forward.""Neurotribes"" provides a cultural history of autism in western Europe and the United States from about 1700 to the present. I found the exclusive focus on white, western families disappointing. Although Silberman acknowledges that a diagnosis of autism is very different for poor families or families (especially boys) of color, he does not include these stories in the book or explicitly suggest that these families have a place in a neurodiverse world. These critiques aside, I am sure this is a book I will use in my teaching on autism, the vaccine ""controversy,"" and ableism. Silberman's text is deeply human and rich with individual stories, emotion, and compassion. I found that his account of dry, medical in-fighting managed to retain some of the passion its participants surely felt in the 1930s to the present. What it lacked in hard science it more than made up for in its cultural work. "
235,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502519-julie,4,"This book gave an historical perspective that released me from guilt and anxiety as a parent of a child on the spectrum. I understand now, that in 1999, when we got the diagnosis, that the 'experts' knew almost as little as we did. We did therapies, meds, IEPs, homeschooled, started a social group, changed diets, and held together as best we could. We did the best with what we knew, and I can see now that we did amazingly well considering the machines we were up against. I do feel like this book portrays too rosy of a picture. There is a profound loneliness. Maybe not all of our kids have a special talent. As a parent with tendencies of my own, that makes it hard to network and socialize in a way that brings opportunities to my child. There is a lot of emphasis on what can your child ""do"" to make them valuable, and this is a dangerous view. It can be frustrating when society thinks that if you are on the spectrum, you must have some supernatural talent for numbers, engineering, memorization, etc. There's also a mostly unaddressed issue of the parents or communities who don't go out of their way to be accommodating. What will happen when we aren't there to advocate? When one is unable to live independently, how will this generation manage?

I don't have the details about Asperger and Kanner now (because my memory is not strong) but I've retained a sense for the ways these doctors were relentless in noticing their overlooked patients. I'm left with so much gratitude for those who have come before us, so many parents who were loving activists for their children, so many children whose lives were forgotten and misunderstood. My son with autism has incredible resources (not enough, of course, but what we have is pretty great) that are helping him live his best life and maximize his strengths so that he can get along in the world of people. I'm taken with the notion and reality of neurodiversity. Autism is not a monolith and it is not new. I love that Silberman ends with how much work there is to do regarding autism and people of color, epilepsy for people with autism who are considered intellectually disabled, and, for those who are not (like my son), mental health treatment. The statistic that people like my son are nine times more likely to commit suicide than neurotypical people hits too close to home. "

I don't know why I expected it to be about neurobiology or neurochemistry ... I guess that piece of word ""neuro"" in the title threw me off. Mr. Silberman has a degree in English, so he's a very good writer... but he's not at all a scientist of any sort. What a disappointment. He really is a wonderful writer and if I were interested in history, I'd love this book. I'll keep an eye out for future books of his if he writes about something more interesting. This book is a history of ASD, told entirely from a non-scientific perspective. It contains many mildly interesting stories of researchers and people with autism over the years. It touches superficially on the contributions to science, literature, and technology that a few famous people with autism have made to mainstream society. It really is probably a good book if you haven't read anything like it before. But you could probably just read his famous Wired article and get the gist. If you're super interested in the lives of famous people with autism, I'd suggest simply picking one and reading one of their biographies."

As someone currently investigating their own possible autism, this was truly an essential read. Rarely does work on autism focus so much on who autistic people are, and all that they have accomplished, rather tending to focus on limits of autism solely. One thing that stood out so much to me was the enormous scientific contribution to society made by autistic people, weighed against the sheer volume of bad science that has led to complete misunderstandings of the diagnosis and a focus on cures rather than provisions. Neurotribes spans the history of autism, through Asperger's and Kanner's work with autistic people, through to online support networks created by autistic people, gleefully mentioning the wonderful work of Oliver Sacks, Lorna Wing, and the representation of autistic people in the media, thanks to the film Rain Man and the works of Temple Grandin.I wholeheartedly recommend this, especially if you work with or know autistic people."

From the darkest periods of widespread institutionalization and horrific experiments to shining examples of brilliant autistic minds, loving families and positive steps forward in policy and advocacy, this book really covers it all.If your child has just been diagnosed, you’ll likely find that the internet is inundated with a whole lot of doom-and-gloom narratives perpetuated by self-pitying autism warrior parents and organizations like Autism Speaks. What a relief it is when you dig deeper and discover the vibrant, inclusive, autistic-led neurodiversity movement that celebrates your child’s neurology instead of dehumanizing it. Definitely read this book."

Silberman does an amazing job of giving an in depth history of a medical condition that we only have just learned about within the last 70 years. His chapters run the gamut. From institutionalizations to special schools, from Asperger's initial findings, to Kanners complete appropriation of Asperger's ideas. He talks about the different treatments of Autism from electroshock therapy, to major antipsychotics, to biomedical interventions. He spends a lot of time on the words used to describe the diagnosis. He spends a lot of time on helping you get to know the individuals who helped shape the idea and diagnosis of autism. It is almost overwhelming, and sometimes it's hard to keep the players straight. I thoroughly enjoyed the end of the book, in which he talks about where autism is headed. It's headed in a new direction. The direction is not steered by parents of autistic children, as in the past, but by autistic individuals themselves. And this is exciting. We wouldn't be the enlightened, cultured civilization if not for the advancements that autistic people have given us. I feel like this book is a gift, to help us better understand our own human race, and the people who help shape our lives, in some unexpected ways. A great read if you are interested in the history of autism and human rights. "
241,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,5,"This is extremely good nonfiction. Although other reviewers have noted that it is a very long book, packed full of details, I found it to be extremely engaging, with only a few very short dull parts (it is hard to make changes to DSM criteria riveting, but actually Silberman did better than you could ever imagine). Silberman's writing voice is upbeat and entertaining, and a dense topic is made readable with lots of wonderful and colorful personal details and anecdotes. I don't know if this would be such a page-turner to someone with less personal interest in autism spectrum issues, but I found it absolutely compelling. In addition to being extremely well written, Silberman is consistently pro-autistic and his message of neurodiversity is powerful and very needed. It would be wrong to call it ""ground breaking"" - as some have - because he is just digesting and conveying ideas that have been out there for decades, but it is also impossible to underestimate the importance of getting those ideas out to a bigger audience. For that, it comes back to how wonderfully well written this book is, and Silberman deserves real credit. This is definitely one of my favorite nonfiction reads of 2015 and maybe for the past couple years. "
242,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,4,"The last two chapters of the book, which are about the movement for neurodiversity, are exemplary. The rest of the book is about the history of the psychologists who ""discovered"" autism in the early twentieth century, and the methods that parents and doctors thought would cure autistic people -- electroshock, corporal punishment, severe dietary restrictions (which is still trendy among ""leaky gut"" proponents). It was horrifying. Indeed, let others praise not-so ancient times, I am glad I was born in these.My one criticism is that the narrative isn't linear. In the span of a few pages, Silberman discussed events in one decade, backtracked to a previous decade, and returned to the initial decade.

When a polemic, it is snarky and poorly reasoned, taking potshots at psychoanalysis and casting aspersions on researchers motivations without much to back them up. When it is reporting, it is informative and though provoking and has much to recommend it. I came away feeling that there was an axe being ground here, but was not clear what the axe was really.

Read this book."
245,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14219722-edoardo-albert,4,"As the father of two autistic boys, I've read more than my fair share of the burgeoning field of autistic books so it's a pleasure to find a new departure in reading on the subject. Up until now, most books on autism have fallen into one of three categories:1. the inspiring parental story of recovering a child from the depths of autistic disengagement via some new and unlikely therapy often involving animals and/or shamans;2. the inspiring autistic autobiography, telling how an autistic person overcame discrimination and misunderstanding to achieve personal autonomy and a good life;3. the how-to guide for parents with autistic children.Now Steve Silberman has added a third category: the history of autism as a medically recognised condition, from the physicians who first spotted it and struggled, more or less successfully, to describe, through the various therapies tried to cure/treat/ameliorate/accommodate it, to the split between different autistic 'camps' and schools, to about where we are now: a condition that has gone from almost nothing to almost everyday within two generations. As a history, it's generally excellent, although a little marred by Silberman's tendency to paint people as 'good guys' (Hans Asperger - the Austrian physician who first recognised the condition and pioneered a notably gentle and appreciative treatment) and 'bad guys' (Leo Kanner - Austrian-American psychiatrist who popularised a restrictive view of autism in America whom Silberger basically accuses of stealing Asperger's work). The reality seems greyer and harder to define, particularly in light of recent evidence that Asperger fell into the morally grey areas of a doctor working under the Nazi regime: he seems to have sent at least two of his children to the Spiegelgrund clinic knowing that they would likely be euthanised there, while managing to protect most of the children under his care. The history of autism thus becomes entwined with the history of the century and the changing nature of medical theorising: from restrictive diagnoses that sought to exclude those who were borderline to diagnoses that now tend to bring far more children within a diagnostic framework. What is clear, is that autism is a spectrum, with many of its traits being potentially highly useful. I do sometimes wonder, as a parent, whether the insight that drove the MMR anxiety that linked the vaccine to the increase in levels of autism might have other sources. It's quite common for parents of autistic children to think they are developing normally and then, at an early age but usually somewhere between one and three, for there to be a sudden falling off in the child's development: the first of many subsequent meltdowns. I remember that with the eldest of my two autistic sons. In his case, the decline coincided with his starting at school. Now autism is a developmental disorder and I wonder if one possible factor in its increase is the earlier and earlier ages at which we are putting children into school. For any child, and particularly for boys, the sudden move from the predictable and stable environment of home, dealing mainly with parents and siblings, into the far less predictable environment of school where volatile peers are the main source of interaction might cause a social-system overload leading to a massive withdrawal from social and linguistic learning as the child tries desperately to accommodate and cope with the sudden huge increase in stimuli, both physical and sensory. If there's any truth in this idea, then countries where children begin school later should have lower rates of autism. It would be interesting to see if this bears out. In the meantime, read Silberman's book if you want to know how autism, as a medically recognised condition with a wide and often competing range of therapies, arrived at its present stage. For all our difficulties today, it's still a huge improvement over the days of 'refrigerator mothers' when much of the medical profession basically blamed the parents for the child's condition or some of the frankly horrible 'cures' devised by the Behaviourist. It also serves as a useful reminder that the real expert is one who understands that he still has much to learn about a subject."
246,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"This is definitely more a book about the history of autism than it is a book about autism itself, so if you're looking for the nitty gritty of what it means to be on the spectrum or how the brain works, it's probably better to look elsewhere. NeuroTribes seems to have mainly been written in response to all the hubbub in recent years by the contingent claiming that there is an autism epidemic and that it is being caused by vaccinations. Silberman looks back at how long autism has existed (probably pretty much as long as people have existed), including looking back at a number of historical figures that were most likely autistic, like Henry Cavendish and Paul Dirac. Then he goes into all the details of how it's been diagnosed over the course of the last couple hundred years and why the fact that more and more people are being diagnosed with it now than ever before doesn't mean that more people are actually autistic than ever before; it's just that recent corrections in diagnostic guidelines have made it easier for people to receive ""on the spectrum"" diagnoses, and therefore more people are now able to gain access to the support and services they need. Silberman goes through all of this in a very balanced way, and without demonizing anyone, recognizing that the data can seem misleading, and that parents on both sides just want what's best for their kids. But I love that he does bend the focus more towards working on gaining support and services for people with autism and their families than working towards finding a cure for autism. His opinion, and I think what a lot of his research shows, is that people on the autism spectrum have made and continue to make a lot of really important contributions, especially in the fields of science and technology, but in lots of other areas as well, not in spite of the ways their minds work, but because of it, and that we're all just working on different operating systems. I like that description a lot.Anyway, this is a really good look through how our view of autism has changed throughout history, as well as how it's been diagnosed and treated. And definitely well worth a read if you're looking for a fairly balanced account of how and why the whole vaccinations-might-cause-autism debate began."

Any accomplished educator is well aware that no two students are alike. Devising curriculum and instruction to meet the needs of a classroom full of independent thinkers and learners is a challenge to say the least. I was one who lived for that challenge and, in retirement, still teach two classes a semester at a community college. I am most alive in the classroom and thrive on the challenges of diversity. During my last five years in public high school education, I taught in an inclusion classroom with an exceptional special education teacher who taught me more in those few years than any other educator over the course of my career!Steve Silberman's book is a revelation! It validates so much of what I have come to believe as an educator. His work is well-researched and well-written for anyone to access. The history of neurodiversity is filled with tragedy, but is overwhelmingly full of the ""aha!"" moments that make life so interesting. This book is for everyone who is alive on our world today! We share space with others who are as diverse as we are and with whom we need to learn to create the future. In reading this book, we recognize ourselves, significant others, friends, relatives, colleagues, and fascinating strangers. In negotiating our way through life, we have to embrace diversity around us in all of its may facets, including the diversity in the working of the minds around us.My real hope is that this and other books like it will lead to the revolution in education so may of us have been seeking which will provide comprehensive change to meet the needs of every individual mind entering a school or classroom. Individual Education Plans for EVERY student should not be a dream of the few, but a reality that can not happen soon enough. Certainly all of the very diverse people populating this book and our world make this inevitable!"
248,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5531911-brandy,5,"I enjoyed the book very much for what it is, a non-fiction book primarily focused on the history of autism. Most professionals (therapists, teachers, psychiatrists, etc.) could probably benefit from it. Autistics themselves may enjoy the book for the extensive level of detail Mr. Silberman goes into. Or if you enjoy history of disability rights, psychology books, or non-fiction in general it's worth reading. I finished it rather quickly since it's engrossing and moves smoothly. Some of it may be familiar territory to people with an extensive knowledge of psychiatry history (such as the bit about refrigerator mothers) but much of it is new and fresh information not previously included in any books. I'd consider it an essential reading on neurodiversity as well. My only caveat is I wouldn't really recommend it as an introduction to autism, since it's heavy on history and short on practical advice. So, if you're a parent of a newly diagnosed offspring, I'd direct you towards The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism first. Or if you are an adult newly diagnosed, ""Been There. Done That. Try This!: An Aspie's Guide to Life on Earth"" by Tony Attwood is a more practical starting point."

If I had known what I was getting into, I probably wouldn't have read it, at 542 pages. Still, I enjoyed this as a philosophy of science, as the descriptions of varying perceptions of autistics, as they currently like being called, over the course of the almost 100 years that they have been described. These varying descriptions and their implications are themselves fascinating. Kanner was the dominant early voice in the US.Kanner: ""Overambitious parents like the Tripletts had “stuffed” the impressionable minds of their children with useless information to cast themselves in a culturally favorable light and bolster their own egos"" (p. 190). He ""turned the detailed notes that parents had provided to him—which were so helpful in developing a clear picture of their children’s development—into a weapon, citing them as a “telling illustration of parental obsessiveness.”"" (p. 190)Asperger preceded Kanner, but his view of autistic children was more benign. It was also lost during WW2 and rediscovered later.Asperger: “Not everything that steps out of the line, and is thus ‘abnormal,’ must necessarily be ‘inferior.’” ""This boy’s difficulties—which particularly affect his relationships with himself and other people—are the price that he has to pay for his special gifts” (p. 128).It matters how we see these children (and adults), right? Are they low functioning, severely affected, or profoundly impaired or a “high-octane boy,” as one parent argued? Are the parents the cause of problems, as Kanner and Theodore and Ruth Lidz argued, or are they their children's supports? Some more quotes:Rudolf Ekstein: ""Tommy’s precocious interest in science was likely the result of “early childhood intensive sexual traumata” caused by seduction by his mother or a nursemaid"" (p. 211). Bernard Rimland: “Brightness gone awry” (p. 272)Ivar Lovaas (who believed you should punish self-injury): ""Once you had taken it upon yourself to physically strike a child, you were morally responsible for his fate. “No one punishes who isn’t prepared to devote a major part of his life to that child. Nobody punishes a child who doesn’t also love that child,” he told a reporter. “Once you lay your hand on a child it morally obligates you to work with that child. You see, that is one of the reasons that people stay away from punishment—they don’t want to commit themselves. After you hit a kid you can’t just get up and leave him; you are hooked to that kid.”"" (pp. 312-313)George Rekers and Ivar Lovaas: ""It’s easier to change a child’s behavior than it is to destigmatize that behavior in society—whether it’s limp wrists or flapping hands."" (p. 323)Barry Morrow:  “What Bill taught me... is that not only do people like Bill need society, society needs people like Bill.” (p. 363)Judith Gould: “We were not surprised when people started saying it was an epidemic. Obviously, by broadening the spectrum, you’re going to get higher numbers."" (p. 421)Temple Grandin: ""A “handicap” rather than a mental illness, invoking the humanizing language of disability over the stigmatizing lexicon of psychiatry"" (p. 426). Oliver Sacks: Their autism, “while it may be seen as a medical condition, and pathologized as a syndrome, must also be seen as a whole mode of being, a deeply different mode or identity, one that needs to be conscious (and proud) of itself.” (p. 430)Walter Spitzer: ""Autism as “a terminal illness . . . a dead soul in a live body.”"" (p. 431)Jim Sinclair: “Being autistic does not mean being inhuman. But it means that what is normal for other people is not normal for me, and what is normal for me is not normal for other people.”[I'm like] “an extraterrestrial stranded without an orientation manual” (p. 437)Laura Tyroncik: “Neurotypical syndrome is a neurobiological disorder characterized by preoccupation with social concerns, delusions of superiority, and obsession with conformity... There is no known cure.” (p. 441)Jim Sinclair: “Saying ‘person with autism’ suggests that autism is something bad—so bad that it isn’t even consistent with being a person...We talk about left-handed people, not ‘people with left-handedness,’ and about athletic or musical people, not about ‘people with athleticism’ or ‘people with musicality’ . . . It is only when someone has decided that the characteristic being referred to is negative that suddenly people want to separate it from the person.” (p. 441)Susan Moreno: ""Her life had been enriched in ways that she could never have predicted by coping with the challenges of raising Beth."" (p. 444)Ivar Lovaas: ""a normal child trapped within the “autistic shell,” waiting to be rescued.Dan Grover: “The goal is to alleviate those with Asperger’s from this pressure that they need to conform,” Grover said in the press release. “What is best is to learn how to use your uniqueness to your advantage and find your place in the world.” (p. 455)Ari Ne'eman: ""Not “symptoms” of his autism, but problems built into the ways that society treats people who don’t meet the standard expectations of “normal.”"" (p. 458)Carol Greenberg: “When I look at my son,” she says, “I think, ‘He’s not broken. He’s just neurologically outnumbered, like me.’” (p. 467).Do we understand autism? We have, at least, some interesting and useful understandings – and some that are not."
253,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"In pop psychology, nothing appears as self-evident as the statement that ""autism is a spectrum."" Silberman's book explains how recent this insight is, how controversial it remains, and how bumpy the road has been. The diagnostic history of the concept of autism (and related diagnoses) makes for an interesting story that deals with human tragedy, political struggle, and scientific discovery. Silberman has written an engaging book that gives readers a better understanding of the convoluted history of the condition and the importance of the social struggles of ""neurodiverse"" people.Since autistic people often (but not always) have a difficulty communicating and representing themselves in society, it is important that books that deal with the issue respect the source material - i.e. the patients and their families, with their very real human emotions and passions. In this regard, the book does a pretty good job. The copious anecdotes and tales of the daily life of autistic people remind us of the individuality and humanity of autistic people, including even the most uncommunicative (or differently communicative) individuals. That said, Silberman understandably focuses more on the parents and their struggles, on the one hand, and the doctors and their ambitions, on the other hand, rather than the inscrutable inner life of autistic people. The story focuses mostly on the dual stories of Leo Kenner and Hans Asperger, the two independent co-discovers of diagnostic autism. Their different interpretations and visions of the nature of the disorder (or, less disparagingly, the personality type) have shaped treatment options, medical practices, social attitudes, and social policies that have impacted the lives of autistic people. This story is absolutely fascinating. It contains insights about the often convoluted shape of the history of science, the importance of constructing a coherent and humane social narrative, the dangers of false beliefs, the social value of psychological difference (""neurodiversity""), and the importance of hearing multiple viewpoints in highlighting different aspects of the same phenomenon.The book is quite long. Sometimes I wish that it had pruned its narrative. The big picture often gets lost in trivia. There are way too many chapters narrating issues that are only tangentially related to autism, such as the biographies of several scientists, the history of science fiction fandom, the personal habits of individuals, etc... In a way, such an obsessive focus on trivia might be appropriate to the subject matter, but the end result is a book that is a 100 pages too long. Thankfully, this is just about the only negative thing I can say about the book, aside from the aforementioned fact that the book - mostly out of necessity - speaks mostly in the language of parents and doctors, rather than the autistic people themselves. This carries the danger of misrepresenting them. Overall, I really enjoyed the book. Human beings live in a complex world. Our capacity to understand difference and diversity, even in our own communities, is limited. We have trouble coping with psychological and behavioural traits that do not fit into our established models. Coming to grips with autism - and other forms of neurodiversity, such as ADHD, psychopathy, manic depressive disorder, narcissism, schizophrenia, etc. - will be crucial in helping people with those conditions. It will also allow society to take full advantage of the unique skills that diverse people bring to society. Recognizing difference in our society is the first step; treating people with kindness is another. And the final step is putting diversity in the service of science, technology, business, and politics. "

In the enthralling NEUROTRIBES, journalist Steve Silberman takes readers on a sweeping journey through the history of autism, the hidden presence of autistic people in our society, and the dubious research methods used by psychologists searching for answers.In language that is elegant, engaging, and accessible, Silberman takes a humanizing look at the many people who shaped the conversation about autism before it was a formal diagnosis. We learn about the unconventional scientist Henry Cavendish, whose eccentricities belied a brilliant mind that altered scientific discourse. We also delve into the parallel lives and careers of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger (whom Asperger’s Syndrome is named after) and their complex lives and legacies. Silberman also depicts several disturbing elements of child abuse occurring within institutions for autistic children. Many of these passages are not for the faint of heart or for sensitive readers, but they are crucial in understanding the history of how autism was treated in our society. He also explores Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s destructive “study” alleging the MMR vaccine was linked to autism, which several reputable studies have since disproven. Wakefield’s faulty data gave rise to a movement of parents searching for a cure to autism—rather than pushing society to understand and make accommodations for their children.Through his in-depth research and accessible writing, Silberman communicates a powerful message: If we adjust our world to accommodate and make space for autistic people, they can change our world for the better. NEUROTRIBES is an informative, compelling, enlightening, and moving book you should read regardless of whether or not autism affects you, your family, or someone you know. And after reading it, you will likely learn that autism has indeed impacted your life in ways you never imagined."

It took me such a long time because it is so information heavy that I could only read a couple pages in a day because I wouldn’t want to overload on information. It was shocking to see how disabled people have been treated throughout history. And to learn more about autism as it is such a wide spectrum. “If you meet one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism.” Though I definitely would’ve wanted to learn more about autism in that sense, where this book focused instead more on the history. It became super confusing to follow the timeline, especially jumping between years and countries. Though I don’t regret reading it I’ll probably only retain like 10% of the information xD"
258,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7325648-dan,5,"I have worked with autistic children for some years now but knew little of the history of the disorder. That has all changed now that I've read this excellent book. It's not entirely clear exactly what this book is about from the title but essentially it's a history of autism. It covers some people who were likely autistic long before the disorder was diagnosed, how Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner 'discovered' autism (independently), how Lorna Wing made diagnosis clearer than ever, how Rain Main ended up being made, the MMR scandal and much more besides. It feels quite a long book but when you consider just how much information it crams in it seems quite concise!There are several reasons this book works as well as it does. Silberman writes very neutrally, rarely giving an opinion on theories. There are plenty of uncomfortable sections of the book, from Kanner leading a surge of blaming parents' for autism to the attempt to cure autism with electric shock therapy. Silberman leaves the reader to decide the rights and wrongs by stating the evidence and quoting contemporaries. The author does a good job with his description of the autistic people included in the research. If you are very familiar with autism, like I am, he doesn't spend long periods time explaining many of the common traits of autism but he gives enough so that no matter how little you know of the disorder you can understand it. I also liked how much of the book focused on the autistic people themselves, something much of the research covered somehow failed to do. The book also helped me to refined my thoughts on autism and it's place in the world. For some readers I imagine it could completely changes their views on it. The book shows us how much value autistic people have added to our society and that they are not simply ""retarded"" as they were once considered. The idea that the human race wouldn't have evolved to where it is today without autistic people is a remarkable but plausible one. This is surely the best history of autism that exists. A challenging read at times, not least because of its length, but also due to views and actions that are incomprehensible today. But ultimately it's an inspiring one which celebrates autism for the remarkable way of thinking that it is."

It condemns the frankly barbaric methods used in early psychiatry, and never once forgets that at the core of all this talk about treatments and cures and diseases and plagues, are very real people with very real lives; who have real hopes and needs. Above all however, it highlights the deeply problematic attitudes ingrained in (western) society towards neurodivergent people, and puts those in a the broader historical context of psychiatry. The fact that it ends on a chapter dedicated to neurodiversity and self-advocacy is fantastic and wraps the whole thing up very neatly. "
260,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This is a bit of a slog to read, because it spends a lot of time lingering on details that you may or may not feel are relevant. It goes into the lives of the people who ‘discovered’ autism and described it clinically, much more than it goes into the lives of actual autistic people, and there’s one chapter I found rather troubling which follows the family of an autistic child. It focuses on their anguish and confusion, and their increasingly desperate attempts to “treat” their son with whatever unpleasant, pseudo-scientific methods they could find. By the end, I was desperate to hear that someone had actually ever asked the child what effect it had on him. (As far as I can tell, nobody did.) Those particular parents weren’t extreme, but nonetheless, I got very tired of their desperation to have a “normal” child.It also does some retrospective diagnosing of a couple of scientists and thinkers from days before there was such a diagnosis. I’m always a bit iffy on that: there do seem to be good grounds to make those judgements, but… most of the people I know now don’t know much about what goes on in my head and why I react the way I do. I don’t want them diagnosing me once I’m dead. Still, at least it does provide autistic models and heroes for people now.I’m also a little leery of the ubiquity of being on the spectrum in Silberman’s view. Lots of fandom, lots of engineers, maybe even most in the picture he’s painting — it’s a stereotype of fandom and of STEM that I haven’t necessarily found to be true. And fandom hasn’t been so very welcoming of actual neurodiverse people, either. If it’s ever been the perfect home for them, it isn’t now.All in all, though, I did find the book interesting, and the perspective on neurodiversity as something to be accommodated and used productively is one that’s definitely timely. Despite my criticisms, I found it an interesting book — and it definitely treats autism as a spectrum, touching all kinds of people. This definitely isn’t the attitudes of Autism Speaks: instead, Silberman urges understanding, accommodation and respect.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
261,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27045365-katy,4,"This is a book that needed to be written. As someone on the spectrum, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the ""autism as a disease"" rhetoric and focus on finding a cure instead of finding solutions to integrate autistic people into society. I happened to study psychology in undergraduate, a field I did not end up pursuing because I felt so alienated from it because of the way autism was talked about by my professors and peers. Nobody would believe me if I voiced my opinion on the potential harms of ""erasing"" autistic behavior, and why should they? Due to a lifetime of internalized ableism, I have grown to hate autistic aspects of myself, like my social awkwardness. Any attempts to prove that my autism was an acceptable part of who I am would just prove futile.This is the book that every psychology student, every social worker, and frankly everyone should read. It covers not only the history of autism but the beginnings of the neurodiversity movement and its momentum. It sheds light on the hoaxes and misinformation that people still believe today. This is the most comprehensive yet also humanizing work by a neurotypical writer on autism out there, and I'm glad it exists.That being said, the book does suffer from a lack of focus at points. I could've done without the digressions into the life stories of all the researchers who studied autism save Hans Asperger. There is too much focus on the history of how the autism diagnosis came to be, where the more meaty story comes from the neurodiversity movement (especially in defiance of false psychology), which is sadly only relegated as more of an afterthought even though I think it's the point Silberman was building up to starting with Hans Asperger. Despite the fact that many sections meander off-topic and therefore make it difficult to slog through, I still think this book is required reading because it offers such a holistic view on the fascinating history of how ""autism"" came to be and how it fits into the world.

262,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29044542-jo-salas,5,"Essential reading for anyone involved with or concerned about autism--Silberman does a brilliant job of reframing this huge topic by telling the little-known story of how autism was discovered more or less simultaneously in the US, by Leo Kanner, and in Germany--Nazi Germany--by Hans Asperger. Kanner pathologized the condition and concluded it was very rare: Asperger thought it was a fascinating, often enriching, and common human condition. Tragically, his work was obscured by the era he lived in. In his writing he foregrounded a few very high-functioning kids in order to save many others from Hitler, who was murdering people considered disabled. It meant that for decades the few researchers and doctors who were aware of Asperger's work thought it related only to one end of the spectrum. Although Kanner's contribution was important as well, his very different analysis has led, directly and indirectly, to much of the panic and misinformation that shadows autism today. Thousands of lives could have been far happier if Asperger's rather than Kanner's interpretation had been the basis for further research and treatment. It is heartbreaking to read of the inadvertent cruelty inflicted by well-meaning but ill-informed people. There's much more to this story, of course: many other heroes (including autistic children and adults) and a few shocking villains. I hope the book changes the picture and allows us to embrace all ""neurotribes,"" and to emphasize lifelong resources and support, rather than a ""cure."" "

It's a handy book to tell people that autism has been around as long as humans have been and even as long as humans began recording history.This book was incredibly amazing to listen to because it takes you from early conceptions and case studies of actual historical people and modern day parents living with autistic children. Dotted throughout the real life stories, the conception of autism and how it was treated throughout history also was laid out and explained. I think that right now, as the book shows it, we're in a very good spot for autism. Right now, they're practically being hailed in popular TV shows with portrayals that speak to non-autistic (also called NTs in the autism community, which I loved) people. It can only keep going up."

I found the exclusive focus on white, western families disappointing. Although Silberman acknowledges that a diagnosis of autism is very different for poor families or families (especially boys) of color, he does not include these stories in the book or explicitly suggest that these families have a place in a neurodiverse world. These critiques aside, I am sure this is a book I will use in my teaching on autism, the vaccine ""controversy,"" and ableism. Silberman's text is deeply human and rich with individual stories, emotion, and compassion. I found that his account of dry, medical in-fighting managed to retain some of the passion its participants surely felt in the 1930s to the present. What it lacked in hard science it more than made up for in its cultural work. "

I understand now, that in 1999, when we got the diagnosis, that the 'experts' knew almost as little as we did. We did therapies, meds, IEPs, homeschooled, started a social group, changed diets, and held together as best we could. We did the best with what we knew, and I can see now that we did amazingly well considering the machines we were up against. I do feel like this book portrays too rosy of a picture. There is a profound loneliness. Maybe not all of our kids have a special talent. As a parent with tendencies of my own, that makes it hard to network and socialize in a way that brings opportunities to my child. There is a lot of emphasis on what can your child ""do"" to make them valuable, and this is a dangerous view. It can be frustrating when society thinks that if you are on the spectrum, you must have some supernatural talent for numbers, engineering, memorization, etc. There's also a mostly unaddressed issue of the parents or communities who don't go out of their way to be accommodating. What will happen when we aren't there to advocate? When one is unable to live independently, how will this generation manage?

My son with autism has incredible resources (not enough, of course, but what we have is pretty great) that are helping him live his best life and maximize his strengths so that he can get along in the world of people. I'm taken with the notion and reality of neurodiversity. Autism is not a monolith and it is not new. I love that Silberman ends with how much work there is to do regarding autism and people of color, epilepsy for people with autism who are considered intellectually disabled, and, for those who are not (like my son), mental health treatment. The statistic that people like my son are nine times more likely to commit suicide than neurotypical people hits too close to home. "

I don't know why I expected it to be about neurobiology or neurochemistry ... I guess that piece of word ""neuro"" in the title threw me off. Mr. Silberman has a degree in English, so he's a very good writer... but he's not at all a scientist of any sort. What a disappointment. He really is a wonderful writer and if I were interested in history, I'd love this book. I'll keep an eye out for future books of his if he writes about something more interesting. This book is a history of ASD, told entirely from a non-scientific perspective. It contains many mildly interesting stories of researchers and people with autism over the years. It touches superficially on the contributions to science, literature, and technology that a few famous people with autism have made to mainstream society. It really is probably a good book if you haven't read anything like it before. But you could probably just read his famous Wired article and get the gist. If you're super interested in the lives of famous people with autism, I'd suggest simply picking one and reading one of their biographies."

As someone currently investigating their own possible autism, this was truly an essential read. Rarely does work on autism focus so much on who autistic people are, and all that they have accomplished, rather tending to focus on limits of autism solely. One thing that stood out so much to me was the enormous scientific contribution to society made by autistic people, weighed against the sheer volume of bad science that has led to complete misunderstandings of the diagnosis and a focus on cures rather than provisions. Neurotribes spans the history of autism, through Asperger's and Kanner's work with autistic people, through to online support networks created by autistic people, gleefully mentioning the wonderful work of Oliver Sacks, Lorna Wing, and the representation of autistic people in the media, thanks to the film Rain Man and the works of Temple Grandin.I wholeheartedly recommend this, especially if you work with or know autistic people."

Inspiring at times and heartbreaking at others, this book chronicles the long journey of autism from obscurity to discovery to awareness and the evolution of its diagnostic criteria along the way. From the darkest periods of widespread institutionalization and horrific experiments to shining examples of brilliant autistic minds, loving families and positive steps forward in policy and advocacy, this book really covers it all.If your child has just been diagnosed, you’ll likely find that the internet is inundated with a whole lot of doom-and-gloom narratives perpetuated by self-pitying autism warrior parents and organizations like Autism Speaks. What a relief it is when you dig deeper and discover the vibrant, inclusive, autistic-led neurodiversity movement that celebrates your child’s neurology instead of dehumanizing it. Definitely read this book."
270,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3856605-rebecca-mcphedran,4,"I received this book as an advanced readers copy from NetGalley.A smart, accessible, comprehensive history of autism. Silberman does an amazing job of giving an in depth history of a medical condition that we only have just learned about within the last 70 years. His chapters run the gamut. From institutionalizations to special schools, from Asperger's initial findings, to Kanners complete appropriation of Asperger's ideas. He talks about the different treatments of Autism from electroshock therapy, to major antipsychotics, to biomedical interventions. He spends a lot of time on the words used to describe the diagnosis. He spends a lot of time on helping you get to know the individuals who helped shape the idea and diagnosis of autism. It is almost overwhelming, and sometimes it's hard to keep the players straight. I thoroughly enjoyed the end of the book, in which he talks about where autism is headed. It's headed in a new direction. The direction is not steered by parents of autistic children, as in the past, but by autistic individuals themselves. And this is exciting. We wouldn't be the enlightened, cultured civilization if not for the advancements that autistic people have given us. I feel like this book is a gift, to help us better understand our own human race, and the people who help shape our lives, in some unexpected ways. A great read if you are interested in the history of autism and human rights. "
271,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250817-inder,5,"This is extremely good nonfiction. Although other reviewers have noted that it is a very long book, packed full of details, I found it to be extremely engaging, with only a few very short dull parts (it is hard to make changes to DSM criteria riveting, but actually Silberman did better than you could ever imagine). Silberman's writing voice is upbeat and entertaining, and a dense topic is made readable with lots of wonderful and colorful personal details and anecdotes. I don't know if this would be such a page-turner to someone with less personal interest in autism spectrum issues, but I found it absolutely compelling. In addition to being extremely well written, Silberman is consistently pro-autistic and his message of neurodiversity is powerful and very needed. It would be wrong to call it ""ground breaking"" - as some have - because he is just digesting and conveying ideas that have been out there for decades, but it is also impossible to underestimate the importance of getting those ideas out to a bigger audience. For that, it comes back to how wonderfully well written this book is, and Silberman deserves real credit. This is definitely one of my favorite nonfiction reads of 2015 and maybe for the past couple years. "
272,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,4,"The last two chapters of the book, which are about the movement for neurodiversity, are exemplary. The rest of the book is about the history of the psychologists who ""discovered"" autism in the early twentieth century, and the methods that parents and doctors thought would cure autistic people -- electroshock, corporal punishment, severe dietary restrictions (which is still trendy among ""leaky gut"" proponents). It was horrifying. Indeed, let others praise not-so ancient times, I am glad I was born in these.My one criticism is that the narrative isn't linear. In the span of a few pages, Silberman discussed events in one decade, backtracked to a previous decade, and returned to the initial decade. I didn't read very much during my time in Rome, but I finished during the flight home."
273,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/626748-leonard,2,"This is a book that cannot decide if it is a polemic or a report about the complex world of Autism and other neurologies. When a polemic, it is snarky and poorly reasoned, taking potshots at psychoanalysis and casting aspersions on researchers motivations without much to back them up. When it is reporting, it is informative and though provoking and has much to recommend it. I came away feeling that there was an axe being ground here, but was not clear what the axe was really. This could have been a much better book and so I was greatly disappointed."

Read this book."
275,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14219722-edoardo-albert,4,"As the father of two autistic boys, I've read more than my fair share of the burgeoning field of autistic books so it's a pleasure to find a new departure in reading on the subject. Up until now, most books on autism have fallen into one of three categories:1. the inspiring parental story of recovering a child from the depths of autistic disengagement via some new and unlikely therapy often involving animals and/or shamans;2. the inspiring autistic autobiography, telling how an autistic person overcame discrimination and misunderstanding to achieve personal autonomy and a good life;3. the how-to guide for parents with autistic children.Now Steve Silberman has added a third category: the history of autism as a medically recognised condition, from the physicians who first spotted it and struggled, more or less successfully, to describe, through the various therapies tried to cure/treat/ameliorate/accommodate it, to the split between different autistic 'camps' and schools, to about where we are now: a condition that has gone from almost nothing to almost everyday within two generations. As a history, it's generally excellent, although a little marred by Silberman's tendency to paint people as 'good guys' (Hans Asperger - the Austrian physician who first recognised the condition and pioneered a notably gentle and appreciative treatment) and 'bad guys' (Leo Kanner - Austrian-American psychiatrist who popularised a restrictive view of autism in America whom Silberger basically accuses of stealing Asperger's work). The reality seems greyer and harder to define, particularly in light of recent evidence that Asperger fell into the morally grey areas of a doctor working under the Nazi regime: he seems to have sent at least two of his children to the Spiegelgrund clinic knowing that they would likely be euthanised there, while managing to protect most of the children under his care. The history of autism thus becomes entwined with the history of the century and the changing nature of medical theorising: from restrictive diagnoses that sought to exclude those who were borderline to diagnoses that now tend to bring far more children within a diagnostic framework. What is clear, is that autism is a spectrum, with many of its traits being potentially highly useful. I do sometimes wonder, as a parent, whether the insight that drove the MMR anxiety that linked the vaccine to the increase in levels of autism might have other sources. It's quite common for parents of autistic children to think they are developing normally and then, at an early age but usually somewhere between one and three, for there to be a sudden falling off in the child's development: the first of many subsequent meltdowns. I remember that with the eldest of my two autistic sons. In his case, the decline coincided with his starting at school. Now autism is a developmental disorder and I wonder if one possible factor in its increase is the earlier and earlier ages at which we are putting children into school. For any child, and particularly for boys, the sudden move from the predictable and stable environment of home, dealing mainly with parents and siblings, into the far less predictable environment of school where volatile peers are the main source of interaction might cause a social-system overload leading to a massive withdrawal from social and linguistic learning as the child tries desperately to accommodate and cope with the sudden huge increase in stimuli, both physical and sensory. If there's any truth in this idea, then countries where children begin school later should have lower rates of autism. It would be interesting to see if this bears out. In the meantime, read Silberman's book if you want to know how autism, as a medically recognised condition with a wide and often competing range of therapies, arrived at its present stage. For all our difficulties today, it's still a huge improvement over the days of 'refrigerator mothers' when much of the medical profession basically blamed the parents for the child's condition or some of the frankly horrible 'cures' devised by the Behaviourist. It also serves as a useful reminder that the real expert is one who understands that he still has much to learn about a subject."
276,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"This is definitely more a book about the history of autism than it is a book about autism itself, so if you're looking for the nitty gritty of what it means to be on the spectrum or how the brain works, it's probably better to look elsewhere. NeuroTribes seems to have mainly been written in response to all the hubbub in recent years by the contingent claiming that there is an autism epidemic and that it is being caused by vaccinations. Silberman looks back at how long autism has existed (probably pretty much as long as people have existed), including looking back at a number of historical figures that were most likely autistic, like Henry Cavendish and Paul Dirac. Then he goes into all the details of how it's been diagnosed over the course of the last couple hundred years and why the fact that more and more people are being diagnosed with it now than ever before doesn't mean that more people are actually autistic than ever before; it's just that recent corrections in diagnostic guidelines have made it easier for people to receive ""on the spectrum"" diagnoses, and therefore more people are now able to gain access to the support and services they need. Silberman goes through all of this in a very balanced way, and without demonizing anyone, recognizing that the data can seem misleading, and that parents on both sides just want what's best for their kids. But I love that he does bend the focus more towards working on gaining support and services for people with autism and their families than working towards finding a cure for autism. His opinion, and I think what a lot of his research shows, is that people on the autism spectrum have made and continue to make a lot of really important contributions, especially in the fields of science and technology, but in lots of other areas as well, not in spite of the ways their minds work, but because of it, and that we're all just working on different operating systems. I like that description a lot.Anyway, this is a really good look through how our view of autism has changed throughout history, as well as how it's been diagnosed and treated. And definitely well worth a read if you're looking for a fairly balanced account of how and why the whole vaccinations-might-cause-autism debate began."
277,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7874958-joleigh,5,"Teaching high school for over thirty years made me more than aware of neurodiversity. Any accomplished educator is well aware that no two students are alike. Devising curriculum and instruction to meet the needs of a classroom full of independent thinkers and learners is a challenge to say the least. I was one who lived for that challenge and, in retirement, still teach two classes a semester at a community college. I am most alive in the classroom and thrive on the challenges of diversity. During my last five years in public high school education, I taught in an inclusion classroom with an exceptional special education teacher who taught me more in those few years than any other educator over the course of my career!Steve Silberman's book is a revelation! It validates so much of what I have come to believe as an educator. His work is well-researched and well-written for anyone to access. The history of neurodiversity is filled with tragedy, but is overwhelmingly full of the ""aha!"" moments that make life so interesting. This book is for everyone who is alive on our world today! We share space with others who are as diverse as we are and with whom we need to learn to create the future. In reading this book, we recognize ourselves, significant others, friends, relatives, colleagues, and fascinating strangers. In negotiating our way through life, we have to embrace diversity around us in all of its may facets, including the diversity in the working of the minds around us.My real hope is that this and other books like it will lead to the revolution in education so may of us have been seeking which will provide comprehensive change to meet the needs of every individual mind entering a school or classroom. Individual Education Plans for EVERY student should not be a dream of the few, but a reality that can not happen soon enough. Certainly all of the very diverse people populating this book and our world make this inevitable!"
278,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5531911-brandy,5,"I enjoyed the book very much for what it is, a non-fiction book primarily focused on the history of autism. Most professionals (therapists, teachers, psychiatrists, etc.) could probably benefit from it. Autistics themselves may enjoy the book for the extensive level of detail Mr. Silberman goes into. Or if you enjoy history of disability rights, psychology books, or non-fiction in general it's worth reading. I finished it rather quickly since it's engrossing and moves smoothly. Some of it may be familiar territory to people with an extensive knowledge of psychiatry history (such as the bit about refrigerator mothers) but much of it is new and fresh information not previously included in any books. I'd consider it an essential reading on neurodiversity as well. My only caveat is I wouldn't really recommend it as an introduction to autism, since it's heavy on history and short on practical advice. So, if you're a parent of a newly diagnosed offspring, I'd direct you towards The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism first. Or if you are an adult newly diagnosed, ""Been There. Done That. Try This!: An Aspie's Guide to Life on Earth"" by Tony Attwood is a more practical starting point."

282,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,4,"Although it was not clear to me in the title or even in the earliest chapters, Neurotribes is a history of the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. If I had known what I was getting into, I probably wouldn't have read it, at 542 pages. Still, I enjoyed this as a philosophy of science, as the descriptions of varying perceptions of autistics, as they currently like being called, over the course of the almost 100 years that they have been described. These varying descriptions and their implications are themselves fascinating. Kanner was the dominant early voice in the US.Kanner: ""Overambitious parents like the Tripletts had “stuffed” the impressionable minds of their children with useless information to cast themselves in a culturally favorable light and bolster their own egos"" (p. 190). He ""turned the detailed notes that parents had provided to him—which were so helpful in developing a clear picture of their children’s development—into a weapon, citing them as a “telling illustration of parental obsessiveness.”"" (p. 190)Asperger preceded Kanner, but his view of autistic children was more benign. It was also lost during WW2 and rediscovered later.Asperger: “Not everything that steps out of the line, and is thus ‘abnormal,’ must necessarily be ‘inferior.’” ""This boy’s difficulties—which particularly affect his relationships with himself and other people—are the price that he has to pay for his special gifts” (p. 128).It matters how we see these children (and adults), right? Are they low functioning, severely affected, or profoundly impaired or a “high-octane boy,” as one parent argued? Are the parents the cause of problems, as Kanner and Theodore and Ruth Lidz argued, or are they their children's supports? Some more quotes:Rudolf Ekstein: ""Tommy’s precocious interest in science was likely the result of “early childhood intensive sexual traumata” caused by seduction by his mother or a nursemaid"" (p. 211). Bernard Rimland: “Brightness gone awry” (p. 272)Ivar Lovaas (who believed you should punish self-injury): ""Once you had taken it upon yourself to physically strike a child, you were morally responsible for his fate. “No one punishes who isn’t prepared to devote a major part of his life to that child. Nobody punishes a child who doesn’t also love that child,” he told a reporter. “Once you lay your hand on a child it morally obligates you to work with that child. You see, that is one of the reasons that people stay away from punishment—they don’t want to commit themselves. After you hit a kid you can’t just get up and leave him; you are hooked to that kid.”"" (pp. 312-313)George Rekers and Ivar Lovaas: ""It’s easier to change a child’s behavior than it is to destigmatize that behavior in society—whether it’s limp wrists or flapping hands."" (p. 323)Barry Morrow:  “What Bill taught me... is that not only do people like Bill need society, society needs people like Bill.” (p. 363)Judith Gould: “We were not surprised when people started saying it was an epidemic. Obviously, by broadening the spectrum, you’re going to get higher numbers."" (p. 421)Temple Grandin: ""A “handicap” rather than a mental illness, invoking the humanizing language of disability over the stigmatizing lexicon of psychiatry"" (p. 426). Oliver Sacks: Their autism, “while it may be seen as a medical condition, and pathologized as a syndrome, must also be seen as a whole mode of being, a deeply different mode or identity, one that needs to be conscious (and proud) of itself.” (p. 430)Walter Spitzer: ""Autism as “a terminal illness . . . a dead soul in a live body.”"" (p. 431)Jim Sinclair: “Being autistic does not mean being inhuman. But it means that what is normal for other people is not normal for me, and what is normal for me is not normal for other people.”[I'm like] “an extraterrestrial stranded without an orientation manual” (p. 437)Laura Tyroncik: “Neurotypical syndrome is a neurobiological disorder characterized by preoccupation with social concerns, delusions of superiority, and obsession with conformity... There is no known cure.” (p. 441)Jim Sinclair: “Saying ‘person with autism’ suggests that autism is something bad—so bad that it isn’t even consistent with being a person...We talk about left-handed people, not ‘people with left-handedness,’ and about athletic or musical people, not about ‘people with athleticism’ or ‘people with musicality’ . . . It is only when someone has decided that the characteristic being referred to is negative that suddenly people want to separate it from the person.” (p. 441)Susan Moreno: ""Her life had been enriched in ways that she could never have predicted by coping with the challenges of raising Beth."" (p. 444)Ivar Lovaas: ""a normal child trapped within the “autistic shell,” waiting to be rescued.Dan Grover: “The goal is to alleviate those with Asperger’s from this pressure that they need to conform,” Grover said in the press release. “What is best is to learn how to use your uniqueness to your advantage and find your place in the world.” (p. 455)Ari Ne'eman: ""Not “symptoms” of his autism, but problems built into the ways that society treats people who don’t meet the standard expectations of “normal.”"" (p. 458)Carol Greenberg: “When I look at my son,” she says, “I think, ‘He’s not broken. He’s just neurologically outnumbered, like me.’” (p. 467).Do we understand autism? We have, at least, some interesting and useful understandings – and some that are not."
283,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"In pop psychology, nothing appears as self-evident as the statement that ""autism is a spectrum."" Silberman's book explains how recent this insight is, how controversial it remains, and how bumpy the road has been. The diagnostic history of the concept of autism (and related diagnoses) makes for an interesting story that deals with human tragedy, political struggle, and scientific discovery. Silberman has written an engaging book that gives readers a better understanding of the convoluted history of the condition and the importance of the social struggles of ""neurodiverse"" people.Since autistic people often (but not always) have a difficulty communicating and representing themselves in society, it is important that books that deal with the issue respect the source material - i.e. the patients and their families, with their very real human emotions and passions. In this regard, the book does a pretty good job. The copious anecdotes and tales of the daily life of autistic people remind us of the individuality and humanity of autistic people, including even the most uncommunicative (or differently communicative) individuals. That said, Silberman understandably focuses more on the parents and their struggles, on the one hand, and the doctors and their ambitions, on the other hand, rather than the inscrutable inner life of autistic people. The story focuses mostly on the dual stories of Leo Kenner and Hans Asperger, the two independent co-discovers of diagnostic autism. Their different interpretations and visions of the nature of the disorder (or, less disparagingly, the personality type) have shaped treatment options, medical practices, social attitudes, and social policies that have impacted the lives of autistic people. This story is absolutely fascinating. It contains insights about the often convoluted shape of the history of science, the importance of constructing a coherent and humane social narrative, the dangers of false beliefs, the social value of psychological difference (""neurodiversity""), and the importance of hearing multiple viewpoints in highlighting different aspects of the same phenomenon.The book is quite long. Sometimes I wish that it had pruned its narrative. The big picture often gets lost in trivia. There are way too many chapters narrating issues that are only tangentially related to autism, such as the biographies of several scientists, the history of science fiction fandom, the personal habits of individuals, etc... In a way, such an obsessive focus on trivia might be appropriate to the subject matter, but the end result is a book that is a 100 pages too long. Thankfully, this is just about the only negative thing I can say about the book, aside from the aforementioned fact that the book - mostly out of necessity - speaks mostly in the language of parents and doctors, rather than the autistic people themselves. This carries the danger of misrepresenting them. Overall, I really enjoyed the book. Human beings live in a complex world. Our capacity to understand difference and diversity, even in our own communities, is limited. We have trouble coping with psychological and behavioural traits that do not fit into our established models. Coming to grips with autism - and other forms of neurodiversity, such as ADHD, psychopathy, manic depressive disorder, narcissism, schizophrenia, etc. - will be crucial in helping people with those conditions. It will also allow society to take full advantage of the unique skills that diverse people bring to society. Recognizing difference in our society is the first step; treating people with kindness is another. And the final step is putting diversity in the service of science, technology, business, and politics. "

In the enthralling NEUROTRIBES, journalist Steve Silberman takes readers on a sweeping journey through the history of autism, the hidden presence of autistic people in our society, and the dubious research methods used by psychologists searching for answers.In language that is elegant, engaging, and accessible, Silberman takes a humanizing look at the many people who shaped the conversation about autism before it was a formal diagnosis. We learn about the unconventional scientist Henry Cavendish, whose eccentricities belied a brilliant mind that altered scientific discourse. We also delve into the parallel lives and careers of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger (whom Asperger’s Syndrome is named after) and their complex lives and legacies. Silberman also depicts several disturbing elements of child abuse occurring within institutions for autistic children. Many of these passages are not for the faint of heart or for sensitive readers, but they are crucial in understanding the history of how autism was treated in our society. He also explores Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s destructive “study” alleging the MMR vaccine was linked to autism, which several reputable studies have since disproven. Wakefield’s faulty data gave rise to a movement of parents searching for a cure to autism—rather than pushing society to understand and make accommodations for their children.Through his in-depth research and accessible writing, Silberman communicates a powerful message: If we adjust our world to accommodate and make space for autistic people, they can change our world for the better. NEUROTRIBES is an informative, compelling, enlightening, and moving book you should read regardless of whether or not autism affects you, your family, or someone you know. And after reading it, you will likely learn that autism has indeed impacted your life in ways you never imagined."

That has all changed now that I've read this excellent book. It's not entirely clear exactly what this book is about from the title but essentially it's a history of autism. It covers some people who were likely autistic long before the disorder was diagnosed, how Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner 'discovered' autism (independently), how Lorna Wing made diagnosis clearer than ever, how Rain Main ended up being made, the MMR scandal and much more besides. It feels quite a long book but when you consider just how much information it crams in it seems quite concise!There are several reasons this book works as well as it does. Silberman writes very neutrally, rarely giving an opinion on theories. There are plenty of uncomfortable sections of the book, from Kanner leading a surge of blaming parents' for autism to the attempt to cure autism with electric shock therapy. Silberman leaves the reader to decide the rights and wrongs by stating the evidence and quoting contemporaries. The author does a good job with his description of the autistic people included in the research. If you are very familiar with autism, like I am, he doesn't spend long periods time explaining many of the common traits of autism but he gives enough so that no matter how little you know of the disorder you can understand it. I also liked how much of the book focused on the autistic people themselves, something much of the research covered somehow failed to do. The book also helped me to refined my thoughts on autism and it's place in the world. For some readers I imagine it could completely changes their views on it. The book shows us how much value autistic people have added to our society and that they are not simply ""retarded"" as they were once considered. The idea that the human race wouldn't have evolved to where it is today without autistic people is a remarkable but plausible one. This is surely the best history of autism that exists. A challenging read at times, not least because of its length, but also due to views and actions that are incomprehensible today. But ultimately it's an inspiring one which celebrates autism for the remarkable way of thinking that it is."

It condemns the frankly barbaric methods used in early psychiatry, and never once forgets that at the core of all this talk about treatments and cures and diseases and plagues, are very real people with very real lives; who have real hopes and needs. Above all however, it highlights the deeply problematic attitudes ingrained in (western) society towards neurodivergent people, and puts those in a the broader historical context of psychiatry. The fact that it ends on a chapter dedicated to neurodiversity and self-advocacy is fantastic and wraps the whole thing up very neatly. "
290,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This is a bit of a slog to read, because it spends a lot of time lingering on details that you may or may not feel are relevant. It goes into the lives of the people who ‘discovered’ autism and described it clinically, much more than it goes into the lives of actual autistic people, and there’s one chapter I found rather troubling which follows the family of an autistic child. It focuses on their anguish and confusion, and their increasingly desperate attempts to “treat” their son with whatever unpleasant, pseudo-scientific methods they could find. By the end, I was desperate to hear that someone had actually ever asked the child what effect it had on him. (As far as I can tell, nobody did.) Those particular parents weren’t extreme, but nonetheless, I got very tired of their desperation to have a “normal” child.It also does some retrospective diagnosing of a couple of scientists and thinkers from days before there was such a diagnosis. I’m always a bit iffy on that: there do seem to be good grounds to make those judgements, but… most of the people I know now don’t know much about what goes on in my head and why I react the way I do. I don’t want them diagnosing me once I’m dead. Still, at least it does provide autistic models and heroes for people now.I’m also a little leery of the ubiquity of being on the spectrum in Silberman’s view. Lots of fandom, lots of engineers, maybe even most in the picture he’s painting — it’s a stereotype of fandom and of STEM that I haven’t necessarily found to be true. And fandom hasn’t been so very welcoming of actual neurodiverse people, either. If it’s ever been the perfect home for them, it isn’t now.All in all, though, I did find the book interesting, and the perspective on neurodiversity as something to be accommodated and used productively is one that’s definitely timely. Despite my criticisms, I found it an interesting book — and it definitely treats autism as a spectrum, touching all kinds of people. This definitely isn’t the attitudes of Autism Speaks: instead, Silberman urges understanding, accommodation and respect.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
291,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27045365-katy,4,"This is a book that needed to be written. As someone on the spectrum, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the ""autism as a disease"" rhetoric and focus on finding a cure instead of finding solutions to integrate autistic people into society. I happened to study psychology in undergraduate, a field I did not end up pursuing because I felt so alienated from it because of the way autism was talked about by my professors and peers. Nobody would believe me if I voiced my opinion on the potential harms of ""erasing"" autistic behavior, and why should they? Due to a lifetime of internalized ableism, I have grown to hate autistic aspects of myself, like my social awkwardness. Any attempts to prove that my autism was an acceptable part of who I am would just prove futile.This is the book that every psychology student, every social worker, and frankly everyone should read. It covers not only the history of autism but the beginnings of the neurodiversity movement and its momentum. It sheds light on the hoaxes and misinformation that people still believe today. This is the most comprehensive yet also humanizing work by a neurotypical writer on autism out there, and I'm glad it exists.That being said, the book does suffer from a lack of focus at points. I could've done without the digressions into the life stories of all the researchers who studied autism save Hans Asperger. There is too much focus on the history of how the autism diagnosis came to be, where the more meaty story comes from the neurodiversity movement (especially in defiance of false psychology), which is sadly only relegated as more of an afterthought even though I think it's the point Silberman was building up to starting with Hans Asperger. Despite the fact that many sections meander off-topic and therefore make it difficult to slog through, I still think this book is required reading because it offers such a holistic view on the fascinating history of how ""autism"" came to be and how it fits into the world. "
292,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29044542-jo-salas,5,"Essential reading for anyone involved with or concerned about autism--Silberman does a brilliant job of reframing this huge topic by telling the little-known story of how autism was discovered more or less simultaneously in the US, by Leo Kanner, and in Germany--Nazi Germany--by Hans Asperger. Kanner pathologized the condition and concluded it was very rare: Asperger thought it was a fascinating, often enriching, and common human condition. Tragically, his work was obscured by the era he lived in. In his writing he foregrounded a few very high-functioning kids in order to save many others from Hitler, who was murdering people considered disabled. It meant that for decades the few researchers and doctors who were aware of Asperger's work thought it related only to one end of the spectrum. Although Kanner's contribution was important as well, his very different analysis has led, directly and indirectly, to much of the panic and misinformation that shadows autism today. Thousands of lives could have been far happier if Asperger's rather than Kanner's interpretation had been the basis for further research and treatment. It is heartbreaking to read of the inadvertent cruelty inflicted by well-meaning but ill-informed people. There's much more to this story, of course: many other heroes (including autistic children and adults) and a few shocking villains. I hope the book changes the picture and allows us to embrace all ""neurotribes,"" and to emphasize lifelong resources and support, rather than a ""cure."" "
293,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13614926-caidyn-he-him-his,4,"Why, oh why did I fail to read this book when I literally got it from Netgalley? Because I decided I didn't have time and it was long and I had school work and a million other books to read. I'm an idiot. Seriously, I am. I should have just sacrificed the other books and gone for this one. Oh well. I read it now and that's what counts.I've always had an interest in autism and Asperger's, along with many other odd interests. Don't ask me about the others or we'd spend the whole review on them rather than this wonderful book. I did a lot of research on it once to accurately write a character I wanted to explore, but nothing really came of it. Now, I definitely want this book on my shelf when I have an actual office in the distant future. It's a handy book to tell people that autism has been around as long as humans have been and even as long as humans began recording history.This book was incredibly amazing to listen to because it takes you from early conceptions and case studies of actual historical people and modern day parents living with autistic children. Dotted throughout the real life stories, the conception of autism and how it was treated throughout history also was laid out and explained. I think that right now, as the book shows it, we're in a very good spot for autism. Right now, they're practically being hailed in popular TV shows with portrayals that speak to non-autistic (also called NTs in the autism community, which I loved) people. It can only keep going up."
294,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56704-ashley,0,"I wanted to love this book but I found it oddly incomplete for a 400+ page book. Ultimately, it may be that the subtitle over-promsied. This book is an excellent introduction to the history of autism and the diagnostic debates but it spend only one chapter on the future. Even the chapters on self-advocacy and patient rights came at the end and felt more focused on past victories than on how to work to create a more inclusive society going forward.""Neurotribes"" provides a cultural history of autism in western Europe and the United States from about 1700 to the present. I found the exclusive focus on white, western families disappointing. Although Silberman acknowledges that a diagnosis of autism is very different for poor families or families (especially boys) of color, he does not include these stories in the book or explicitly suggest that these families have a place in a neurodiverse world. These critiques aside, I am sure this is a book I will use in my teaching on autism, the vaccine ""controversy,"" and ableism. Silberman's text is deeply human and rich with individual stories, emotion, and compassion. I found that his account of dry, medical in-fighting managed to retain some of the passion its participants surely felt in the 1930s to the present. What it lacked in hard science it more than made up for in its cultural work. "
295,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502519-julie,4,"This book gave an historical perspective that released me from guilt and anxiety as a parent of a child on the spectrum. I understand now, that in 1999, when we got the diagnosis, that the 'experts' knew almost as little as we did. We did therapies, meds, IEPs, homeschooled, started a social group, changed diets, and held together as best we could. We did the best with what we knew, and I can see now that we did amazingly well considering the machines we were up against. I do feel like this book portrays too rosy of a picture. There is a profound loneliness. Maybe not all of our kids have a special talent. As a parent with tendencies of my own, that makes it hard to network and socialize in a way that brings opportunities to my child. There is a lot of emphasis on what can your child ""do"" to make them valuable, and this is a dangerous view. It can be frustrating when society thinks that if you are on the spectrum, you must have some supernatural talent for numbers, engineering, memorization, etc. There's also a mostly unaddressed issue of the parents or communities who don't go out of their way to be accommodating. What will happen when we aren't there to advocate? When one is unable to live independently, how will this generation manage? Ultimately, this is a positive, empowering book, and that's a good thing."
296,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1102217-jamie,4,"At close to 500 pages, this history of autism was exhaustive and at times exhausting. I had to put it down several times because the specificity of the stories but I'm grateful for the work and for having the experience. I don't have the details about Asperger and Kanner now (because my memory is not strong) but I've retained a sense for the ways these doctors were relentless in noticing their overlooked patients. I'm left with so much gratitude for those who have come before us, so many parents who were loving activists for their children, so many children whose lives were forgotten and misunderstood. My son with autism has incredible resources (not enough, of course, but what we have is pretty great) that are helping him live his best life and maximize his strengths so that he can get along in the world of people. I'm taken with the notion and reality of neurodiversity. Autism is not a monolith and it is not new. I love that Silberman ends with how much work there is to do regarding autism and people of color, epilepsy for people with autism who are considered intellectually disabled, and, for those who are not (like my son), mental health treatment. The statistic that people like my son are nine times more likely to commit suicide than neurotypical people hits too close to home. "
297,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3600426-summer,2,"DNF 50%I'm sorry, my review is kind of unfair, but this was simply not at all what I thought it would be. I don't know why I expected it to be about neurobiology or neurochemistry ... I guess that piece of word ""neuro"" in the title threw me off. Mr. Silberman has a degree in English, so he's a very good writer... but he's not at all a scientist of any sort. What a disappointment. He really is a wonderful writer and if I were interested in history, I'd love this book. I'll keep an eye out for future books of his if he writes about something more interesting. This book is a history of ASD, told entirely from a non-scientific perspective. It contains many mildly interesting stories of researchers and people with autism over the years. It touches superficially on the contributions to science, literature, and technology that a few famous people with autism have made to mainstream society. It really is probably a good book if you haven't read anything like it before. But you could probably just read his famous Wired article and get the gist. If you're super interested in the lives of famous people with autism, I'd suggest simply picking one and reading one of their biographies."
298,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51406628-lizzie-huxley-jones,5,"Neurotribes is a truly astounding book that deserves its Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction. As someone currently investigating their own possible autism, this was truly an essential read. Rarely does work on autism focus so much on who autistic people are, and all that they have accomplished, rather tending to focus on limits of autism solely. One thing that stood out so much to me was the enormous scientific contribution to society made by autistic people, weighed against the sheer volume of bad science that has led to complete misunderstandings of the diagnosis and a focus on cures rather than provisions. Neurotribes spans the history of autism, through Asperger's and Kanner's work with autistic people, through to online support networks created by autistic people, gleefully mentioning the wonderful work of Oliver Sacks, Lorna Wing, and the representation of autistic people in the media, thanks to the film Rain Man and the works of Temple Grandin.I wholeheartedly recommend this, especially if you work with or know autistic people."
299,158333467X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15602974-chelsea-norton,5,"This is an incredibly well-researched book and one that I would highly recommend to all parents and teachers of autistic children. Inspiring at times and heartbreaking at others, this book chronicles the long journey of autism from obscurity to discovery to awareness and the evolution of its diagnostic criteria along the way. From the darkest periods of widespread institutionalization and horrific experiments to shining examples of brilliant autistic minds, loving families and positive steps forward in policy and advocacy, this book really covers it all.If your child has just been diagnosed, you’ll likely find that the internet is inundated with a whole lot of doom-and-gloom narratives perpetuated by self-pitying autism warrior parents and organizations like Autism Speaks. What a relief it is when you dig deeper and discover the vibrant, inclusive, autistic-led neurodiversity movement that celebrates your child’s neurology instead of dehumanizing it. Definitely read this book."
