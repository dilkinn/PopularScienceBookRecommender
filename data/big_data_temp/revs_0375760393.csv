To that last end, I found the chapter on Johnny Appleseed very enlightening as well as highly entertaining. Michael Pollan is more humorous and, let's just say, more adventurous than one might expect from a journalist/botanist (see his passages on hallucinogenic plants.) I appreciate his willingness to ""go first"" in the same way I tip my hat to daring bastard who first tried, say, lobster. I assume it went down like this: ""What's this? A giant, saltwater, armor-clad cockroach? Definitely looks poisonous....Fuck it, I'm hungry."" Trying new, unknown food must have been done on a dare or at least with starvation lurking close at-hand. Farmers on any scale will enjoy and find use in The Botany of Desire. As a pallid yellow-thumb aspiring to green, I know I learned a few things. For one, I've finally transitioned over to organic apples. I don't know who would eat another kind after reading this book. Why with the chemicals already?! Good lord!"

Growing up, my father regularly told me the same thing. Once when walking home from school on a windy day, a large branch fell on me, striking my shoulder and knocking me to the ground. Since my collar bone was not broken, I got up and walked home. When I told my father what happened, he said,""Of course. The trees are always hoping we'll drop dead. This one was just a bit more aggressive about it.""CARMEN: o.OPAPI: ""Trees are always hoping that the humans or animals walking by will drop dead. That way they will have a tasty snack.""I've never forgotten what my father told me. He was halfway serious in these remarks, and I take them halfway seriously, too. Even though I've seen tons of ""stupid"" or ""silly"" horror films which dream up scenarios in which ""plants are trying to kill us!,"" there is an undercurrent of truth in the notion that, in a way, plants are very evolved organisms, much more evolved than humans themselves. Who can say what their true intentions are? (I'm only half-joking, here.)Despite the rather ""hokey horror film"" premise of Pollan's introduction, the book is a smart yet entertaining look at plants and their history of coevolution and codependence with human beings.The book is divided into four parts.1.) APPLES. This is a very interesting portion of the book. A lot of focus is on Johnny Appleseed. We also get some fascinating discussions of religion.There was an old tradition in northern Europe linking the grape, which flourished all through Latin Christendom, with the corruptions of the Catholic Church, while casting the apple as the wholesome fruit of Protestantism. Wine figured in the Eucharist; also, the Old Testament warned against the temptations of the grape. But the Bible didn't have a bad word to say about the apple or even the strong drink that could be made from it. Even the most God-fearing Puritan could persuade himself that cider had been given a theological free pass.2.) TULIPS. This section was hella boring. I was bored out of my skull. Ugh. SO BORING.3.) MARIJUANA. This was a fascinating section about drugs, Pollan's experiences growing and smoking pot, and why plants that alter human consciousness could be a good thing.We also get gems like this:[Witches'] potion recipes called for such things as datura, opium poppies, belladonna, hashish, fly-agaric mushrooms, and the skins of toads. These ingredients would be combined in a hempseed-oil-based ""flying ointment"" that the witches would then administer vaginally using a special dildo. This was the ""broomstick"" by which these women were said to travel.Pollan posits that many of our philosophies and our religions come from the influence of drugs. There's a lot of research to back him up, which I won't go into here.4.) POTATO. This was interesting because Pollan discusses the Potato Famine and also GMO potatoes. He even grows some GMO potatoes himself in his garden as an experiment. Blah blah blah food industry blah blah blah monoculture blah blah blah....Tl;dr - 3 out of 4 ain't bad. The mindnumbing tulip section stops this from being a 5-star book, but I think this is a better book than the only other Pollan book I've read: Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation, in which Pollan comes off as a rather entitled and condescending wealthy person. There's not much of that here, Pollan is much more relatable in this book, perhaps because he's not trying to tell people what to eat and how to live their lives.Wow, Carmen, bitter much?I call it how I see it! :pThis book has so much information and interesting thinking points that I think it is definitely worth reading for anyone who has even the slightest interest in the topics presented here. I was surprised the book was so good. I'm impressed."
2,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/282633-emily,5,"Okay, okay, books by Michael Pollan are clearly a fad right now, but I have bought into it whole-heartedly. He is an amazing, amazing writer: he makes me want to plant a garden, to tour his garden (his bedroom? what?), to only eat organic food, and to find out the story and origin of every morsel of food I put in my body. But he does it in a way that isn't overly preachy or agenda-driven. Instead, he lets you get what he is saying while at the same time telling an engaging, well-researched story, both personal and historic, and one that made me want to read quickly to the very end. I took many a too-long lunch break because I was so hooked. "
3,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,4,"The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World by Michael Pollan introduces the possibility to the reader that plants are using insects, animals and humans to ensure their own survival. An interesting book about the symbiosis between all living organism and how Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory of natural selection is happening. 
In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires—sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control—with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind’s most basic yearnings. And just as we’ve benefited from these plants, we have also done well by them. So who is really domesticating whom?
What the author did in the book is to address the hybridizing of plant species to fit our needs. Although domesticated plants have been multiplied at a much greater rate than in nature, they also stand to disappear due to over-hybridization. This is highlighted in this book.Hail to Flora, the Roman goddess of flowers! How plants manipulate us, as well as animals and insects are riveting reading for sure. But how we domesticated plants, and the consequences of our own actions, are much more disturbing. Watch this documentary for a fascinating insight into this part of plant behaviour. The information in this document is much more detailed than the book and one is of my favorites. If you watched this documentary, you will get a much better idea of how it works.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-4w5...It is indeed a mysterious world to get involved in, even if you only want to read about it. Plants have souls and feelings. That's the bottomline! :-))There so many anecdotes I can share concerning the interaction between plants, animals, insects and humans, that it will require a book to do so. So I will unhappily sit on my hands and just allow the urge pass me by for now! :-))You probably will have to read the book, yes, definitely read the book. It's a great start. The author approached his subject with sensitivity and great care.OKAY ...... IT'S SOAP BOX TIME!!!One comment in the book made me sit up straight. Had me hackles raised. :-) It's losing a star as a result.I've sent an excerpt of the book to 30 botanist friends from all over the world, who worked with me on an international DNA project of the natural flora in our country, and just loved the reactions. Serious researchers, doing their jobs for decades, could not believe this assumption made in the book:
According to Jack Goody, an English anthropologist ...who has studied the role of flowers in most of the world’s cultures—East and West, past and present—the love of flowers is almost, but not quite, universal. The “not quite” refers to Africa, where, Goody writes in 'The Culture of Flowers', flowers play almost no part in religious observance or everyday social ritual. (The exceptions are those parts of Africa that came into early contact with other civilizations—the Islamic north, for example.) Africans seldom grow domesticated flowers, and flower imagery seldom shows up in African art or religion. Apparently when Africans speak or write about flowers, it is usually with an eye to the promise of fruit rather than the thing itself.
 That is certainly an interesting, and true statement. However, the next paragraph had us all gasping for air. Dumbfounded!
 ... the ecology of Africa doesn’t offer a lot of flowers, or at least not a lot of showy ones. Relatively few of the world’s domesticated flowers have come from Africa, and the range of flower species on the continent is nowhere near as extensive as it is in, say, Asia or even North America. What flowers one does encounter on the savanna, for example, tend to bloom briefly and then vanish for the duration of the dry season.
My first thought was that an anthropologist won't know that more than 80% of the ± 2400 Pelargonium species originate in southern Africa; numerous orchards, too many to list here, horde of proteas, ericas, lilies, flowering trees, and hundreds of highly sought-after succulents come from dear mother Africa. Some of the international well-known botanists' comments (which can be shared publicly, the rest is unpublishable!) : -- ""I read that piece. It is nonsense."" -- ""Badly written and poorly researched is my comment!""-- ""Africa is the best at all things natural, most especially flowers. I think they are also missing that flowers are attached to plants and we Africans have been more interested in the other parts as they hold the goodies that cure us of almost any illness. We used the flowers to help us get to the right plant. It has been so tied up in African culture that it is magical and mysterious – sangoma style – so the knowledge never made it into books."" -- ""We laugh at this book from a dizzy height!""Nevertheless, let's leave it at that. Michael Pollan concentrates on four domesticated plants and their uses to humans. The philosophy, history, and huge impact the plants had on human survival is discussed with a focus on the uses which satisfied mankind's four basic needs: sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control. He confirms why it has become highly essential to preserve the original plant species in nature. The more plants are altered, the less chance there is of the species to survive-a dangerous situation for both this planet and mankind. Hybridization also happens in nature. For instance, bees pollinate a different variety of one species with the result of new species developing from it. Crassulas, in nature, is a prime example of this. So many cross-breeds develop that it is a headache for botanists to identify those species correctly. Most people in the world are not aware of the huge challenges facing global food production. More than 60% of the world's population currently reside in cities, with little or no access to land. Countries, such as Japan, have already began to expand vertically, and not horizontally. A complete city, providing housing, schools, hospital and shopping areas are provided in high-rise buildings. There is simply not enough space horizontally anymore to expand. Another current trend worldwide is for people to move out of suburbs into inner cities again. It is predicted that suburbs will become the future slums. Highways, the cost of vehicles, fuel and traffic congestion, the decline in oil resources, are discouraging the future development of more suburbs. Many boarded-up or abandoned houses can be found everywhere. Huge inner slums and squatter camps are popping up all over the world as a result of uncontrolled population growth, unemployment, job losses and lack of job opportunities. Urban people are more and more unable to propagate their own food. Add to that the limited areas suitable for agriculture in the world, with limited water resources, and the picture becomes a little more complicated. While the world's human population increases at an alarming rate, the agricultural land to produce food for the masses do not. As a result it was necessary to develop plants that could produce more fruits on the same parcel of land and have new possibilities to protect themselves against water restrictions and pests. Extended families do not manage farms anymore. Farmers are forced to mechanize, which is not only expensive, but also detrimental to oil resources in the world. A staggering number of farmers are leaving the industry annually due to the high costs and low profits (or no profits) in food production.In hybridization, and the very expensive research to accomplish the outcomes, different plants are used to cross-breed in order to address the challenges. For instance, the DNA of one plant which has a natural defense against pests are bred with another plant which do not have the ability. My husband produced hybridized seeds of tomatoes which produced uniform color and fruit size and had a longer shelf life. I cannot name the company who sponsored it (not Monsanto), but can mention that a cantaloupe gene was used to accomplish this - another edible fruit. In pumpkin hybrids two different varieties were used to produce a uniform, round pumpkin which which was smaller in size and could fit into a shopping bag so that the consumer could handle it.  The author mentions an incident he read about in which the DNA of fireflies were added to tobacco plants! My philosophy is: if you haven't seen it with your own eyes, don't spread the story! I almost lost interest in this book after reading that. However, the author made the effort to visit the research facilities of the Monsanto company, interviewed farmers, and made an effort to understand what is recently done to increase food production and the methods that is used. He states that unrelated species in nature cannot be crossed. But then alleges that Monsanto crossed that barrier. ""Nature"", he says, ""exercise a kind of veto over what culture can do with a potato."" Donkeys and horses were cross-bred, but the resulting animal were sterile. That's a fact in nature. I agree with the author's statement: 
All domesticated plants are in some sense artifical, living archives of both cultural and natural information that people have helped to ""design"". Any given type of potato reflects the human desires that have been bred into it.
There is sadly not enough space left on earth to allow people each a piece of land and enough water to produce their own food. We cannot go back to wearing natural fibers, since there are not enough grazing or space, once again, to keep the animals on that land which will produce those needed fibers. That's the bottom line. Too many people, too little natural resources. For instance, if we allow 7 billion people to strip mine plants in trying to return to natural medicines, there will be nothing left of nature. It is therefore essential that everything we use be produced commercially in particular agricultural zones all over the world, and to protect natural fauna and flora in designated protected zones. We have to hybridize to survive as the human race. For the past seventy years it has become necessary and the challenge will be bigger in future. Humans are already dependent on it and there's no way out of it. If you are fortunate enough to have space for your own fruit and vegetable garden, make use of it to plant your own food. Use vintage seed and go organic, since you do not have to produce masses of fruits and vegetables for billions of people living in urban areas with limited space. Organic farming is labor intensive. Commercial farmers do not have enough labor resources to do the same.The good news is that more and more commercial farmers are moving away from monocultural farming, with more involvement in the agronomic side of soil management. Biodiversity is making a comeback.In the end, it is obvious from the discussions in the book, why Africa is still the cradle of mankind. Not mentioned in the book, it is just my own reaction. In Africa, people did not 'listen' to the flowers to spread them in unnatural selections. Africans had a vast knowledge of the value of plants in their natural state, for thousands of years, used it for various purposes, still do, but allowed the plants to remain part of the natural biodiversity around them. In fact, should an apocalypse hit this planet, it will be the people who respected the natural laws, who would survive. And that will be the Africans, most probably. They did not change nature, and lived in harmony with it all their lives. The message I take from the book, as an African and naturalist, is that my continent knew what they were doing when they left nature alone. Perhaps they were not left behind, they were in fact far ahead in time! Oh well, it is something to think about, at least. I enjoyed the book and recommend it for sure. Sometimes there are fairy tales in real life. Just listen to the flowers!"

5,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"In East Asian cultures – according to my increasingly Japanese daughters – the number four brings bad luck. This is because it sounds a bit like the word for death. Clearly the number four has no such associations for Michael Pollan. The Omnivore’s Dilemma is based around four meals and this one is based around four plants. I’ve done more than just enjoy these two books, they have completely enchanted me whilst also informing me and keeping me greatly amused.Now, desire sounds like a strong word to use about botany. There is, of course, that Frank Zappa song Call Any Vegetable and it will respond to you – I think this is also the song which ends with the memorable line, “O what a pumpkin!”Now that isn’t quite the desire Pollan is talking about here. His four plants are: the apple, the tulip, marijuana and the potato. As a one time Irishman I have no problem with the idea that the potato might make the list of plants of desire, but I can see that others might struggle most with that one being included.This book is based on the idea that plants use us as much as we use them – and the plants best able to meet our desires are the plants we help most to spread about the world. So much so that we tend to make monocultures of those plants that best match our desires – something that is arguably as much a problem for the plants as it is a boon for them.Do you know when you sort of know the story to something, even if you don’t quite know the details? I had that kind of relationship with the story of Johnny Appleseed (aka John Chapman). While I had some notion of him going around frontier America planting apple seeds (and ten points for promoting dental health) he was never really going to cut it beside, say, Daniel Boone (what a dream come-er-true-er was he!). Little did I know that rather than being a man dedicated to the random distribution of apple seeds, he actually sold apple trees to pioneers (when not considering matrimony with stray 10 year olds). Pioneers were keen to buy the said apple trees not due to the dearth of doctors being kept away by all those apples being eaten, but rather the equally troubling shortage of bartenders. Apples being as good a way as any to make a pleasant alcoholic drink – and one that wasn’t complained about in the Bible. It is here that Pollan develops one of his major metaphors – borrowed from Nietzsche (that most popular of masturbatory German philosophers) of the dichotomy between the Apollonian and the Dionysian. I’ve generally found this to be one of the more lucid and intelligent things Nietzsche ever said and so wasn’t disappointed that so much time was devoted to this idea in this book. Basically, Apollo was the god of order and light, Dionysus the god of wine and orgies. Our obsession with growing the same potato all over the world to make the perfect McDonalds fry is symbolic of the Apollonian desire – Johnny Appleseed growing apple trees from seed and thereby getting a vast number of genetically different trees symbolic of the Dionysian.This central tension forms a large part of the basis of the book. It proves an interesting thing to say about Tulips too, and obviously also of marijuana. I guess it is possible that if Dionysus was with us today he might well be a pot head. The stuff about marijuana is very interesting. Particularly the fact that it has become about 10 times more potent over the years and that this increase in potency is directly attributable to the ‘war on drugs’. Pollan makes an interesting case for the idea that if the US government hadn’t spent billions of dollars imprisoning its citizens and fighting a war it could never win, pot would still be coming into the States from Mexico and would not have been bred up to being the super drug it is today. Pollan says that his initial reaction to smoking pot was much the same as mine has always been. That its main effects seemed to be to make me feel paranoid and stupid. Having been brought up in the loony left I really didn’t need chemistry to help me be paranoid, or stupid, for that matter. Apparently, this is because on the rare occasions when I did smoke pot I was smoking ‘blue collar’ marijuana. Which is probably for the best.Again, as with the apples and the tulips, I did know much of the story of marijuana before I started reading, but not really all of the details. The story of tulips causing a major economic bubble is worth reflecting on at the moment. The plants themselves are equally fascinating, as are little facts gleaned along the way about depression and plant viruses.But the section on the potato is riveting – and not just for the Irish. This is similar to the first section of The Omnivore’s Dilemma on corn. We really are going to have to do something about the way we produce food – and if you need to know why, then reading this chapter will make it all clear. If the only way we can grow potatoes for McDonald’s fries is to kill the planet then perhaps (and this is just a suggestion) we shouldn’t be eating McDonald’s fries.I think I liked The Omnivore’s Dilemma better than this one, but really, they were both fascinating and well worth the read."
6,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,4,"This is a marvellous book, which discusses the science, sociology, aesthetics and culture, relating to four plants.ApplesTulipsMarijuanaPotatoesBecause of who I am, the things that interested me most were the tulip and potato sections.With the first, he discusses the notorious obsession surrounding tulip cultivation in Holland in the 17th century. With the second he discusses a genetically modified potato which was on sale in the US at the time he wrote the book, in 2001. The potato is a variety called NewLeaf. This is no longer a product being promoted by the company which produces the seeds for it (Monsanto of course), but what the author has to say about it is still very relevant with regard to current and future vegetable research. It has left me feeling a lot less blazé about GM vegetables and monocultures. This may be the only way forward if we are to feed the vast number of people on this planet, but it comes at a price - and that price may be largely unknown. In contrast to the huge vegetable factory-type farming discussed in most of this section, Pollan also visits an organic farmer, and the difference hits you big time. Everything about the factory farms are so alien, and brutal in their approach, (they seemingly use anything they can to get the most produce for the least bucks); and everything about the organic farm is so much more harmonious, and working respectfully with nature. Interestingly the main factory-type vegetable farmer he spoke to, also grows organic vegetables, but just for him and his family's consumption. Go figure.He also fairly briefly discusses the horrors of the Irish Potato Famine between 1845 and 1852, and that too was extremely interesting.And now on to matters of the heart. The section on tulips in the 17th century was a great pleasure to read. Here I am just going to type a few chunks out of the book, (some rather chopped about I'm afraid) for those of you who fancy a brief excursion into a time of passion, madness and decadence.(view spoiler)[
  Tulip mania in Holland reached its peak between 1634 and 1637.The queen of all tulips was Semper Augustus. ""Generally regarded at the time as the most beautiful flower in the world. In 1624 there were only a dozen or so specimens, most of them owned by Dr. Adriaen Pauw.This was the intricately-feathered red and white tulip - one bulb of which could change hands for 10,000 guilders at the height of the mania, a sum that would have bought one of the grandest canal houses in Amsterdam. It is now gone from nature. But I have seen paintings of it (the Dutch would commission portraits of venerable tulips they couldn't afford to buy.) Beside a Semper Augustus a modern tulip looks like a toy.A tulip that falls out of favour soon goes extinct. Generally a strain won't last unless it is regularly replanted, so the chain of genetic continuity can be broken in a generation. Even when people do continue to plant a particular tulip, the vigour of that variety (which is propagated by removing and planting the bulb's ""offsets"", the little genetically identical bulblets that form at its base) eventually fades and must be abandoned...... Tulips, in other words, are mortal.No tulip appears in the flower-crowded borders of medieval tapestries, nor is the flower ever mentioned in the early 'herbals' - the Old World encyclopedias of the world's known plants and their uses. The fierceness of the passion that the tulip unleashed in Holland in the seventeenth century (and to a lesser extent in France and England) may have had something to do with the flower's novelty in the west, and the suddenness of its appearance. It is the youngest of our canonical flowers. Ogier Ghislain De Busbecq, an Austrian, claimed to have introduced the first tulip to Europe, sending a consignment of bulbs from Constantinople in 1554. (The word 'tulip' is a corruption of the Turkish word for 'turban'.)Tulips, like apples, do not come true from seed - which accounts for the astonishing variety it can produce.....though it takes 7 years before a tulip grown from seed flowers and shows its new colours.(In seventeenth century Holland) botany became a national pastime, followed as closely and avidly as we follow sports today.Land in Holland being so scarce and expensive, Dutch gardens were miniatures, measured in square feet rather than acres and frequently augmented with mirrors. The Dutch thought of their gardens as jewel boxes, and in such a space even a single flower...could make a powerful statement.What the Dutch really sought were 'broken' tulips, these were flowers where you get a white or yellow ground, with intricate feathers or flames of a vividly contrasting hue.In the 1920s the electron microscope was invented, and scientists discovered that the virus causing broken tulips was spread by myzus persicae, the peach potato aphid. Peach trees were common in seventeenth century gardens. By the 1920s the Dutch regarded their tulips as commodities to trade...and since the virus weakened the bulbs it infected (the offsets of a 'broken' tulip were small and few in number), Dutch growers set about ridding their fields of the infection.There was another Dutch obsession - a quest that has gone on for 400 years - the quest for a black tulip. Today we have 'Queen of the Night' - a dark, glossy maroonish purple. Breeders today are busily seeking a new black tulip because they know that this current standard bearer is probably on her way out. Alexandre Dumas wrote a novel 'The Black Tulip' (in 1850) based on this search.""

7,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/224453-jen,1,"I've wanted to read this book ever since it came out, but, so far, I've been pretty deeply disappointed by it. From the jacket copy and reviews I'd read, I'd come to expect a poetic lay-science book about the entwined destinies of plants and humans. Hell, that's what the author's introduction led me to expect, too.I did not expect, nor want, most of the chapter on the apple to be more concerned about the historical realities of Johnny Appleseed than with the apple itself. I didn't want the author to neglect almost the whole history of the fruit before 1776, by virtue, apparently, of being too lazy to do more than pay lip service to anything that didn't happen in America. If I hear one more cute little musing about Johnny Appleseed, I will start seriously considering not listening to this book anymore....I hope the damned thing gets more interesting in the next chapter, that's all I'm saying. But I don't have very high hopes.(Updated: I don't think I ever even finished the dratted thing.)"

9,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,4,"Packed with food-related history, trivia and stories, Michael Pollan attempts to explain how four types of plants have had such a large effect on humanity.""We automatically think of domestication as something we do to other species, but it makes just as much sense to think of it as something certain plants and animals have done to us, a clever evolutionary strategy for advancing their own interests.""I believe that our lives are intimately intertwined with our environment, even if we can't quite see how. Pollan removes the veil between apples, tulips, marijuana, potatoes, and mankind in order to illustrate how the plants evolved and what kinds of shenanigans they've brought on civilization in the process.""Our grammar might teach us to divide the world into active subjects and passive objects, but in a coevolutionary relationship every subject is also an object, every object a subject. That's why it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees.""My favorite chapter was about the tulips. Did you know at one point in the Dutch Republic a tulip bulb cost as much as a house? It was called ""tulipmania"" and it caused enormous havoc in the local economy when the tulip bubble burst.I also learned about the evolution of flowers, which I didn't know anything about before reading this. I had only ever considered them from a spiritual perspective — I think it was Eckhart Tolle who talked about flowers being the ""spiritual evolution of plants"". It's rather interesting actually if you're into that kind of thing.""But I do wonder if it isn't significant that our experience of flowers is so deeply drenched in our sense of time. Maybe there's a good reason we find their fleetingness so piercing, can scarcely look at a flower in bloom without thinking ahead, whether in hope or regret.Pollan's writing style wanders no where quickly, so readers who have little patience for storytelling non-fiction may want to choose a different book. I rather liked it.I think he may have oversimplified the plants and humanity relationship by picking only one motivating desire per plant. Let's be real, things are never as simple as that. But for the premise of this book, it worked well enough.Basically, The Botany of Desire encourages readers to consider what plants get from us as much as what we get from them. It's a different perspective, like looking at your home from the level of a toddler rather than your usual height. There's things to learn and puzzle out and discover that you may have never even imagined.Recommended for readers interested in botany and different worldviews."
10,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,1,"Reminded me of A History of the World in 6 Glasses with the introduction, except it was even worse. Very long, repetitious, & kept wandering into pseudoscientific philosophy. As well as Scott Brick read this, it was incredibly boring listening to the same points for half an hour, so I quit. Yes, it is interesting to contemplate whether we domesticated a plant or it domesticated us. The evolutionary imperative of any organism is to spread copies of its DNA. Yuval Noah Harari mentioned it in Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind a decade later - 'mentioned' being the operative word. That's all it's worth. It is a koan, a philosophical riddle that can mean many things depending on the observer.The history & mechanisms of co-evolution are interesting, too. However, his assertion that plants are almost mystically so wonderful at biochemistry is ridiculous. Biochemically, bacteria & venomous critters can be just as weird as plants. We're no slouches ourselves in our ability to break down wide varieties of materials to feed ourselves. The idea that a strain of cannabis can get us high seems less strange to me than a mere fungus, yeast, doing everything from getting us high to making bread rise & even insulin to treat diabetes.Anyway, I was looking for a scientific & historical book, not sophomoric philosophy."
11,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"It may sound like science fiction, but let me assure you... it's not.Indeed, Pollan writes very well about the history and effects of four plants that have a huge impact on our lives... even if we may never have had two of them. His tone and his command of the various histories managed to make his writing both personal and wildly interesting.I'm speaking of Apples, Tulips, Cannabis, and Potatoes, however.I'll assume that everyone has had apples and potatoes, but I can also assume that everyone is at least AWARE of cannabis. As for tulips, they once caused rather fascinating Dionysian meltdown among the Dutch. Toppled a kingdom. That's pretty heavy. :)The real history of Johnny Appleseed might very well have been about apple alcohol. Cider. But once upon a time, and thanks to the wildly diverse possibilities within the apple seed, the whole nation had thousands of different kinds of apples. People selected and bred the best and all of a sudden this nearly unique source of sweetness (sugar being either rare or distasteful thanks to the slave trade) made apples more than a huge market. Sweetness was the key, but when other foods replaced the apple's kingship of sweetness, by that time, the amazing variety had been reduced to a mere handful.It was our desire for the apples that caused this domestication, but beyond that, the apple trees themselves found themselves in a paradise of genetic dispersion, so helped it along. Selective breeding programs have been a real thing for a long time.Tulips, for their beauty and a sometimes erratic explosion of color (thanks to a virus that made it weaker) became a craze of economic speculation, driving the prices up until it bankrupted a kingdom. Cannabis, also a victim or a happy co-author of selective breeding, has undergone massive changes as well. Maybe it was the prohibition against it that made it so coveted, but this is almost as crazy as the Tulip economic bubble.Potatoes, the last chapter, is all about control. Monsanto. If you like to be freaked out and get the skinny on that debate (as of 2001, when this was published) I can promise you that it will do the job nicely. The kinds of things that are done today with pesticides, GMOs, and the forced termination of genes in order to force farmers to come back, repeatedly, to Monsanto, is a tragedy of epic proportions. And then there's the comparison of this mono-gene-culture to the one that starved a million people in the Potato Famine in Ireland, driving away half the population because they could no longer feed themselves.Can something like that happen to us?It's the big question. We're doing it to ourselves. Our need for perfect french fries may undo us all."

Well, I was kind of familiar with marijuana's development (not from personal toking, honest Asian, but from being surrounded by tokers - hey, it was Oregon) and that it was completely villified in the ""just say no"" era of drug awareness education. The chapters on the apple, tulip, and potato offer cautionary evidence on the danger of destroying diversity in the name of commerce. Dratted industry and their shipping lives, appearance over taste, money over environmental responsibility; dratted consumers and our being trapped in busy schedules, cheap produce, the quick&easy, the short range.Even though I'm probably being manipulated by the plants, I still want a garden in which to spread their genetic material. Plant pimp? If only.On the subject of plants causing us to help them multiply by being appealing to us: I view this language as couching the concept in terms that we might understand, finding a common thread and expounding. I don't imagine Mr. Pollan meant plants as willfully selecting the characteristics that would cause us to replant and increase year after year. It's supposed to be a mutually beneficial interaction. If they could effect deliberate change in us, would they let us spray potatoes like that or make the mealy Red Delicious, I'm sure it was once actually delicious, the most common apple in US supermarkets? I wonder what it would be like if plants could fight us. Or maybe our dependence on the few varieties that now have weaknesses engendered by continuous cloning/inbreeding will result in a plant-revenge."

This was another museum book club pick from our Minneapolis Institute of Art; while I like Michael Pollan it's unlikely I would have otherwise read this fascinating book. Even the description made it look doubtful that it would be my cup of tea. Boy, was I wrong!Pollan looks at four human desires and four plants that satisfy those desires to explore the interdependence of humans and plants. The desires/plants are Sweet/Apple, Beauty/Tulip, Intoxication/Cannabis and Control/Potato. He busts the myth of Johnny Appleseed, shows how Tulipomania was the tech bubble of 17th century Dutch society, tells how cannabis produces the crystal clarity experienced by users and how it's different from others drugs and illustrates the historical folly of man's quest to industrialize food production by creating botanical mono-cultures. My hunch is after reading this you will never eat a commercially grown potato again!Pollan concludes that while humans believe in our ultimate control over plants, plants have equal influence on the destiny of mankind. Biodiversity is his premise and the story he tells to convince us of this will stick with me for a long time. "

15,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"This is an enjoyable book that wanders back and forth through the subjects of botany, history, and literary philosophy. An example of the later is quoted below:""For look into a flower, and what do you see? Into the very heart of nature's double nature--that is, the contending energies of creation and dissolution, the spring toward complex form and the tidal pull away from it. Apollo and Dionysus were names the Greeks gave to these two faces of nature, and nowhere in nature is their contest as plain or as poignant as it is in the beauty of a flower and its rapid passing. There, the achievement of order against all odds and its blithe abandonment. There, the perfection of art and the blind flux of nature. There, somehow, both transcendence and necessity. Could that be it--right there, in a flower--the meaning of life?""By the time a reader has finished this book they'll know more about apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes than ever before. And along the way perhaps the reader will have picked up a slightly enhanced understanding the interaction of humans and plant life. And as indicated in the quote above, they will be introduced to the author's possible insight into the meaning of life. Every topic in this book was subjected to the Apollo vs. Dionysus analysis somewhere along the line.In the section on marijuana the author provides a detailed description of what it means in terms of neurochemistry to be high on marijuana. This information was new to me. I got the impression this subject has not been fully researched and there still remains some speculation in the descriptions. He did make the definitive statement that nobody has ever died from an overdose of THC (active ingredient in marijuana). That certainly cannot be said for alcohol. So why is alcohol legal and marijuana outlawed? They both can pose a danger to society if misused, but one is publicly advertised with the caveat, ""Please drink responsibly."" The other is a crime to possess or use. Surely there's no rational basis for this difference.The last section on the potato came down pretty hard on genetically engineered plants. I am not as emotionally opposed to this science as some appear to be. I'm in favor of asking questions and looking for problems that may arise. But I'm willing to eat genetically engineered food in the meantime. I figure that if we wait to be absolutely sure of no adverse consequences before using advances in science, all scientific and technological advances will cease. My hat is off to Michael Pollan for being able to write an interesting narrative around rather ordinary topics. He has the skills of a talented story teller to combine historical and scientific facts with tales of his own personal adventures and interviews with other people. I had to give the book five stars because, quite frankly, I found it to be an enjoyable and interesting book.Here's a short review of this book from my PageADay Book Lover's Calendar:THE APPLE TREE’S DILEMMA“Without flowers, the reptiles, which had gotten along fine in a leafy, fruitless world, would probably still rule. Without flowers, we would not be,” writes Michael Pollan in his absolutely engaging book on the way plants and humans have lived and evolved together. His method is similar to that in The Omnivore’s Dilemma, in that he takes four plants—apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes—and gives us their perspective on the complex relationship between plants and humans. Delicious and nutritious reading.THE BOTANY OF DESIRE: A PLANT’S-EYE VIEW OF THE WORLD, by Michael Pollan (Random House, 2002)The following is a discussion of problems related to getting adequate nutrition on a vegan diet:https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/1..."
16,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,5,"I really enjoyed this book (and enjoyed the lecture I attended when the author talked about the book and answered questions.) He talks about 4 crops: apples, potatoes, tulips and marijuana, and the interactions between them and humans: history, culture, human psychology, and science, etc. I knew nothing much about botany and have never been particularly interested in that branch of science, but this book was a very easy read and I found it extremely fascinating. Gave it as a gift on a couple of occasions after I read it."
17,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/430930-alexandra,1,"I couldn't get into this book at all and gave up reading it after the first chapter. The premise was a good one, but Pollan's writing style drove me up the wall. I called it quits when he started analogizing Johnny Appleseed and Dionysius. Too much navel-gazing and not enough substance."
18,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"What a wonderful book!Desire. There are many forms of it. It can be a food craving, it can be sexual between two of the same species, it can be the need to possess something, …But what does all that have to do with botany? Well, humans aren’t the only ones wanting something. Plants, like any other life form on this planet, have desires too. The desire to spread and multiply for example.Not to mention that beings can use another’s desire for their own advantage.We have lived with plants for a long time. We need them and they, to some degree, need us. Would they be able to survive without humans? Absolutely. Because they’ve learnt to use other creatures (mammals as well as birds and insects) as well.But who is domesticating who here?In four chapters, the author examines four different kinds of desire represented by four different kinds of plants: sweetness as represented by the apple, beauty as represented by the tulip, intoxication as represented by cannabis and control as represented by the potato.Thus, we discuss anything from how today’s varieties of apples are grown and cultivated (no, planting a seed from your favorite apple isn’t gonna get you anywhere, I’m afraid), to how the tulip became more valuable than gold in the Netherlands in the 17th century and how something as (seemingly) unimportant as beauty was also a great commodity, to the biology of intoxication and plants’ evolution to either kill or manipulate the brains of their consumers, to the cultivation / genetic manipulation of food like the potato and Monsanto’s impact on today’s farming industry.We learn a lot about evolution and history, but also about politics and man’s need to dominate his world. Some of these stories (like that of Johnny Appleseed) are quirky or downright funny, others are fascinating. I knew much about apples and tulips but learned a lot about cannabis (from the transformation of the political landscape surrounding this mild drug to why plants use this kind of effect as a way to ensure we keep cultivating and even spreading it, to say nothing about the intoxication of animals). The last chapter was my least favourite one. That is not to say that it was bad. It was just that I already know how bad Monsanto is (not even necessarily morally but because of the spread of mono-cultures and limiting new forms from evolving / being invented) as well as genetic modifications to pesticides as much as the food plants themselves and the impact this has on the wilderness. I also know how crazy some food standards are (the best example was the requirements for french fries the author spoke about) and this makes the topic the most depressing of the four. *lol* A holistic but quite unique view at plants and our relationship with them. I loved how he included everything from biology, chemistry and history to politics and (human as well as animal) psychology.Last but not least, the writing style was also highly … addictive. *lol* Seriously, I always say that the key to non-fiction becoming more popular is having more authors who can break down complex topics in nice ways without dumbing any given subject down too much and being eloquent in a way that holds the readers’ attention. In this case, I guarantee you’ll even be enthusiastic!"
19,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,4,"Pollan represents one of my favorite types of writers: modern polymaths who can bring scientific, historic and literary knowledge to bear on whatever they're writing about. When it's done well, I don't care what the question is; for instance, tulips aren't really my thing, despite their presence on my dining room table right now. The conversation between history, literature and science really interests me, though, which is why nearly all of the books I read fall into one of those categories.(That's sortof a joke.)But I couldn't get into the first half of Botany of Desire, and the reason is that the book is padded. I've been curious about the reality behind the Johnny Appleseed legend, so it's terrific that he delved into it - but it would have made a great ten-page essay. Pollan stretches it for nearly 60 pages. He repeats himself (a lot); he circles around; he includes details about people he's met that are irrelevant and not all that interesting.So far, so three star book.The section on pot, though, gets hilariously loopier. Halfway through this chapter - after an interesting history of what the War on Drugs has done for pot, and right at the point where, in other chapters, he would have started to repeat himself - he instead ends up in Amsterdam, trying the new breeds of pot for the first time, apparently, in years, and the rest of the chapter is one long, adoring love letter to the glories of weed, written while ecstatically baked. Non-pot-fans might find this chapter less endearing than I did, but for me, as a casual fan of the drug and, more importantly, as a guy who finds the question of what mind-altering drugs do for us interesting, it was the best part of the book. Too bad he still can't get past the slightly apologetic tone most grown-ups who still smoke pot feel forced to adopt - why not just mention it matter-of-factly as a normal thing many people do? That is, after all, what it is. But still. Fun stuff.The final chapter on potatoes contains some of the usual ""Holy shit, we have no idea what we're doing"" stuff on genetic engineering, and there's a ""sky is falling"" feel to it that made me roll my eyes, but his take on in it is interesting enough. I dug this book."

In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires—sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control—with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind’s most basic yearnings. And just as we’ve benefited from these plants, we have also done well by them. So who is really domesticating whom?Read by Scott BrickFirst up is the apple, John Chapman aka Johnny Appleseed aka the American Dionysus.

21,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,3,"A brief but compelling history of four plants whose genetic destiny has been markedly altered by man – the apple, the tulip, cannabis, and the potato. Pollan’s argument is that, though we see domestication as a strictly top-down, subject-to-object process, there really may also be some co-evolutionary force at work. Johnny Appleseed’s efforts were to the overwhelming advantage of apple genetic proliferation, and the science of mass potato farming means more seeds are planted every year. But we’ll get to the argument bit in a minute.As quirky, offbeat history, this is fabulous. It turns out botany is an incredibly versatile vehicle in which to travel from social psychology to religion to bioethics. Pollan makes fascinating detours through early American advertising schemes, pauses briefly to describe the hallucinogenic mixture of mushrooms and opium European witches would administer via dildo, and then hops blithely on to the cost-benefit economics of potato plants engineered to make their own pesticide. It’s a wonderfully engaging trip, made all the more so by Pollan’s lucid, thoughtful, frankly lovely writing. I haven’t enjoyed a spot of nonfiction prose on a purely esthetic level in a long time, and for that pleasure alone I could recommend this book.As for the argument – how best to put this – it’s not so much one. This whole co-evolution idea occurred to Pollan one day as he was gardening, and it never really leaves the realm of warm afternoon, busy hands, strange and intriguing thought. The whole thing comes out interesting, undeniably pretty, but ultimately nothing more than an intellectual exercise. An exercise I enjoyed, mind you, but I’m really not after musings over the Apollonian and Dionysian paradigms in my discussions of anything related to evolution: I’m after, you know, scientifically sound genotypic mechanisms. But like I said, I was perfectly happy to go along. I just fervently hope no one came away from this book believing this is what is meant by “theory of evolution.”Eclectic, engaging subject matter. A bit of pleasant but deeply fluffy intellectual masturbation tacked around the edges for an excuse. Wonderful writing. A good time, all around."
22,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214200-don-lavange,5,"I read this a few days after ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"", and began it the day after picking up ""In Defense of Food"". I loved the former, thought the latter was thin and a resaying of what he'd already said. This book was a beautiful book, though not the tome that O.D was, it's beautifully written. It also sets the stage nicely for O.D.Here, using apples (with their amazing capacity to evolve based on seeds that don't grow true to the parent), tuplips, cannabis and potatoes Pollan sets out plainly the case that Richard Attenborough made several years before: that both humans and the foods they eat co-evolve. In the final chapter, he begins to describe the connundrum of monoculture that he deals a death-blow to in O.D (in that anyone who reads it will understand for once and for all what a death-blow to humanity monoculture is).I loved this beautiful book."
23,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62390164-numidica,4,"Michael Pollan has convinced me to buy only organic potatoes from now on.The Botany of Desire is a book which presages two of Pollan’s later books, The Omnivore’s Dilemma, and How to Change Your Mind; the other two books were written later, and are better books, in my opinion. That said, there is much to learn in reading the Botany of Desire (BoD, hereinafter). Pollan, like me, is a gardener, so I have common beliefs on many issues touching land use and food; anyone who has gardened for a long time comes to understand soil and ecology, and Pollan clearly does. BoD is divided in four sections: Apples, Tulips, Marijuana, and Potatoes. The section on potatoes was clearly the basis for, or dry run for The Omnivore’s Dilemma, but Omnivore’s Dilemma is a better treatment of modern agriculture in general, as well as organic farming and its uses. I will say the recitation of pesticides and herbicides that get dumped on standard potato crops is scary; one farmer said that after application of one of the more potent pesticides, he does not go into the fields for five days for any reason, and he does not allow his employees to do so. Also, the use of GMO plants with built-in pesticides like bt (bacillus thuringiensis) engineered into their DNA is frightening, especially given the now widely known worldwide decline of insects. Pollan’s point, which is perhaps better made in Omnivore’s Dilemma, is that it doesn’t have to be this way; for a slightly higher price we could have organic produce, or at least we could have far less chemically treated produce. The other point Pollan makes, both with regard to potatoes and apples is that clones (which is what all the varieties of spuds and apples are) are more susceptible to insect pests and eventually lose vigor. Remember the term, “hybrid vigor”? Clones don’t have it, because, well, they’re clones, not hybrids.The section on marijuana is interesting, but Pollan covered the same ground much more comprehensively in How to Change Your Mind. The section on tulips mostly was uninteresting to me because it was more about the tulip “bubble” in Holland in the 1600’s than about gardening or plants, and I could have learned all I wanted to know about “tulipmania” in three or four paragraphs, versus the twenty or more pages spent on it. Also, I’ll admit that as a gardener I dislike tulips. One could create a plastic replica of a tulip that has as much interest to me; I don’t like formal gardens. There was some interesting stuff in this section about how plants have evolved to attract pollinators (bees, mostly).As for apples, that part was interesting, and I learned some things I did not know, though perhaps a bit more than I wanted to about Johnny Appleseed.So my recommendation is to read The Omnivore’s Dilemma to learn about food, and How to Change Your Mind to learn about psychoactive drugs; both are excellent books. If you read those two, you can decide for yourself whether you would like the added information available in BoD. As always, Pollan’s prose is engaging, and he clearly has studied in depth the subjects he is writing about, though sometimes he tells the reader a bit more than is absolutely necessary. Three and a half stars."
24,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,"This may be my favorite Pollan book of all time. It's so beautifully written and full of wonder at the plant world. The section on tulips as a flower embodying Apollo and Dionysus and about the apple were just brilliant. However, I do think the goes a little nuts about GMOs at the end. I'm tempted to go with him into skepticism, but I am not sure it's warranted. I think the dangers of monoculture are real, but I am not as concerned about the GMOs as he is"
25,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53216-kat,5,"Pollan's The Botany of Desire is by far one of the best books I have ever read, and it is one of those books that has changed my world view for the better. Pollan takes his readers on an odyssey through the natural histories of four plants that have been important to the course of human history, and relates them to a certain form of desire that he believes to be inherent in each and every person. He chronicles the potato (sustenance), the tulip (beauty), cannabis (pleasure), and the apple (sweetness). His prose is unrivaled, and he draws readers into his narrative with seamless ease."
26,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"Michael Pollan approaches the relationship between plants and humans through the aperture of the plant. The altered perspective displays the multiple props of genetic diversity — color, shape, size, fragrance, taste and robustness — offered to seduce the gardener's favors. Of course Pollan realizes that intent cannot be ascribed to the plant. These are merely the standard tools available to the plant for survival and procreation. ”Our desires are simply more grist for evolution's mill, no different from a change in the weather: a peril for some species, an opportunity for others.” (xxi) Nevertheless, this novel perspective shifts the focus away from a narrative of static human mastery to a dynamic Pollan calls the coevolutionary relationship.Pollan divides his exploration into four sections whose titles are consistent with his theme. The third section is titled “Desire: Intoxication/Plant: Marijuana.” Some readers might be tempted to skip ahead to this intriguing chapter. Don't! What looks at first glance like four separate essays are carefully structured stories of historical change reflecting abstract and ironic connections. The apple of chapter 1 is a plant of extreme biodiversity. The five seeds of a single fruit are a roll of the genetic dice. To bear fruit that resemble the parent apple, the tree must be grafted, a technique developed by the Chinese by the dawn of their dynastic history. This extreme biodiversity enabled the apple to adapt. The seeds John Chapman planted with both evangelical and entrepreneurial zeal sprouted all manner of fruit, most of it harvested for cider. Its familiarity was a welcome symbol of civilization. By contrast “Desire: Control/Plant: The Potato (chapter four) chronicles a recurring tragedy of monoculture. The tulip of chapter two and marijuana of chapter three, two unlikely fellow-travelers, have obverse stories that intersect in Holland. Pollan reminds the readers of changes now taken for granted. Gardens were not always landscaped for aesthetic appeal. Plants were prized for their utility. Not only did they provide food, but they were an important source for apothecary experiment. Sweetness was once a metaphor for rarity and perfection, as in the Shakespearean sense. This was before plentiful cheap sugar reduced the sensation to something commonplace and without nuance. (Talk to a Japanese person and she will aver that Japanese desserts have a “different” kind of sweetness if you doubt the flavor's true complexity). ”Like a shimmering equal sign, the word sweetness denoted a reality commensurate with human desire: it stood for fulfillment. Since then sweetness has lost much of its power and become slightly … well, saccarine.”  The Incas were model farmers. They combated mountainous terrain, variegated microclimates and plant infestation by planting multiple varieties of potato. Hence, the affliction that destroyed them was not a potato famine. Of course no account of the tulip would be complete without a review of tulipomania. Pollan travels the route of John Chapman through the then Northwest Territory and journeys to Idaho and Holland to interview modern day growers. He also inserts colorful and truly funny anecdotes from his own garden. His chapter on marijuana is a sobering reflection on the effects of a misguided public policy, and a fascinating look at ongoing research in neuroscience. Finally, his thoughts on genetic engineering are thought provoking. He presents the efforts of genetic engineers, commercial growers and small-scale organic farmers with depth and objectivity. Pollan's writing is transcendent. He is informative, poetic and philosophical. His phrasings are experiences to be savored over and over again. "

Aside from making me incredibly sad at not having a garden patch anymore in my home and having to contend with purchased pots and soil, this book was a delightful read. Michael Pollan takes a simple question - Have we domesticated plants or have plants domesticated us?- and to make a case for the latter, provides us with a heady mix of history,science,philosophy,botany,literature and what not, punctuating the text with juicy anecdotes, which I must say made for a truly spell-binding read.The bumblebee thinks that he is the subject in the garden and the bloom he's plundering for its drop of nectar is the object. But we know that this is just a failure of his imagination. The truth of the matter is that the flower has cleverly manipulated the bee into hauling its pollen from blossom to blossom.And so it is with us. There is no subject and no object. The grammar is all wrong. We plant and disperse the apple, thinking we act from our volition, yet from the apple's point of view, it has enticed us through its bribe of sweetness to further its propagation. It has played upon our desire. The same can be said of every other plant ""domesticated"" by humans.Of course, this idea is not Pollen's and it has been in existence for centuries right from the Vedic times, but the way he does the exposition through the 4 sections of this book- Apple, Tulip, Marijuana and Potato- is what is so good about this book.Failed miserably in trying to pick a clear favourite among the 4 sections. The Apple section dealt with the incredible life of Johnny Appleseed and the apple's journey from its original home in the wilderness of Kazakhstan- the way it was told was nothing short of an immigration drama, and apple-human games which have largely if not completely determined the Apple's biodiversity or the lack of it.The Tulip section focusses on why on earth humans have been so fascinated with flowers and even let their desire for flowers result in great economic collapses like the infamous Dutch Tulipomania. The section on Marijuana will definitely convince most people that US Government officials and politicians who brought about Cannabis illegalization not just in US but subsequently in countries like India where people have been using it for eons, were either nuts or downright maniacal. And the potato section was downright scary.One heck of a captivating read!"
29,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/294130-manderson,3,"In a kind of a meandering, relaxed writing style,  Michael Pollan tells the tale of apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes and their co-evolution with human desire. Although I agree somewhat with his premise---that plants also influence human desires, not just vice versa---I never found that he fully developed a convincing proof of it. Rather, he just gently threads a tangential narrative about his subjects, as if he were having a conversation with you in his study while looking out the window at his garden. I did enjoy most of it, however, especially the Johnny Appleseed information, though at times I didn't find his narrative especially compelling.His sections on marijuana and the Monsanto NewLeaf potato reveal that he starts his narrative excursions from the standpoint of moderate conservatism, and he usually ends up slightly on the other side, though still keeping it centrist. I think he could definitely use a little more fire under his feet in setting out to write a book."

32,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"The chapter on the apple was sort of enlightening, but had too much obsession with Johnny appleseed.The chapter on Tulips was really boring.Pollan's evolutionary/philosophical speculation in this chapter is all wrong.Many scientific facts, too, are misguided or incorrect. Lots of face-palms.The musings on the effects of Marijuana is really uncomfortable.Pollan obviously wrote this chapter while high.He suggests that meditation can get you high like Marijuana, which just isn't true.He rambles on about spirituality, which is bizarre and metaphysical.The potato.Pollan shares with us his ignorance-fueled skepticism about GM crops.He states, falsely, that Monsanto has a patent on the BT gene.In fact, Monsanto's patents cover specific plant genomes with the BT gene inserted at a particular location.The difference being, Monsanto did not come up with the BT gene.What they rightfully call their intellectual property is the work of figuring out how to make the BT gene work inside each plant.Evil patents are no argument against GM crops than they are an argument against pharmaceuticals.His other argument is some philosophical nuance of object vs. subject.He seems to be putting forth an argument for purity.That intentional tampering directly with the genome is different and worse than using ""natural"" techniques like cloning, grafting, crossing, and other forms of artificial selection.Really, there's no functional difference between modifying the sequence of genes with one or another technique.Some techniques, like recombinant genetic engineering, offer more possibilities.Then, he whines about monoculture for a few dozen pages.This part sounds like it's right out of omnivore's dilemma.Apollonian verses Dionysian, blah, blah, blah.I wish Pollan would stick to the fascinating anecdotes."
33,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,4,"In The Botany of Desire Michael Pollan goes into our relationship with four plants: the tulip, marijuana, the apple, and the potato. He looks at these four plants from historical, political, and personal point of view. In many ways this is a fascinating account. For example the first one that goes into the tulip mania that the Dutch got into, which is both comic, and ridiculous at the same time, but of course if we look at the stock market in general, these sorts of things still take place, just in a slightly different way. Are the plants themselves passive victims in all of this or are they active participants is one of the more interesting question that he tries to answer in his book, but of course he can't really prove it one way or the other. Still, he does present the case for them being much more active members in this relationship so well that a question that might have seemed a little silly actually becomes an interesting one. There is one thing about Pollen's writing style, he does tend to take detours, in fact he takes quite a few one of those. This does make the book at times feel a little unfocused, but still it never really got uninteresting, even despite that. I actually got quite a bit of enjoyment out of this read. And I gained some inside into this subject. One can't really ask much more out of a nonfiction book, so I think I may read something else by him. "
34,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"Wonderful, wonderful book, full of fantastic info and insights. My main critique is Pollan's main conceit, and the language used to express it: plant species have domesticated humanity just as much as humanity has domesticated them. My problem is his constant insertion of agency into the process of evolution and mixing metaphors of individuals and of species. Flowers are not individually clever, and neither are species of flowers. Flowers do not manipulate bees in the same way that a botanist manipulates a flower species through artificial selection or genetic modification. Species do not have agency, the will to act. Only individuals have that, and individuals bees, potatoes, or water buffalo do not (to our knowledge), willfully offer themselves up as partners to humanity.Pollan draws an interesting distinction that I haven't encountered in my amateur meanderings between ""wilderness"" and ""wildness."" He uses ""wilderness"" in the sense of the Wilderness Act of 1964, ""an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."" ""Wildness,"" on the other hand, is anything that humans cannot control. As Bill McKibben famously pointed out, the atmosphere of our planet is no longer a wilderness, tainted as it is by the byproducts of our industry, but as every hurricane and tornado reminds us, it is still profoundly wild.Pollan uses this distinction to emphasize that while all domestication is a destruction of wilderness, it is almost never an abolition of wildness. The gardener uses his sense of order not to control his plants absolutely, but to guide and shape their wildness in certain ways. He goes on to suggest that genetic engineering may violate this pact, that by attempting to guide evolution on such a basic level is a powerful new way to write wildness out of the equation. He also offers the counterpoint that current techniques for gene insertion are (sometimes literally) so scattershot as to yield results that are even less predictable that conventional breeding.The topic of wilderness feeds into another interesting point, which is that ""memory is the enemy of wonder"" (168). He argues that cannabinoids like THC help us experience awe and wonder by forcing constant short term memory loss, and that meditation or physical exertion probably induce the same effect, making the view from a mountain peak infinitely more profound after having hiked to it instead of having driven.Another insight he had about marijuana is that drugs could be considered the mutagens of culture. If one assumes a meme is like a gene, then a culture is like a genome. Memes are constantly recombining through thought and discourse (intercourse in both culture and biology), but genuinely new ideas are rare. At the risk of spreading a metaphor too thin, Pollan suggests that drugs could be thought of as mutagens, radiation nuking the genetic fundaments of culture, producing mostly irrelevant or deleterious nonsense, but now and again creating viable gems (149). Kind of a fun thought."
35,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark,3,"This guy has inspired me to grow my own food and keep a few hens in the backyard. Being a little self-reliant in these unsettling times gives me a sense of stability and hope.In this book, Pollan takes a look at four plants and relates them to human desires, I think . . . He starts things off with the apple and goes into a bit of long-winded ramble about Johnny Appleseed's quest to sell his trees to pioneers and his lust for a 10 year old bride (fortunately this bit wasn't dug into with any sort of detail). Johnny's enthusiasm for the apple and his desire to plant the seed (and refusal to graft) results in the many varieties that adapted to new climates. Though I'm learning a lot about Johnny here, I'd rather have more factoids about the apple. I'm hoping the following chapters are more interesting because I find my mind wandering more than usual while listening to this.I've now finished up the tulip section and made it about halfway through the marijuana chapter but, at this point, I have come to the realization that this book just doesn't interest me. It's very repetitive and meandering. I'll finish it up and hope the potato's treatment can grab me enough to get through it.Later: I finished up and did find the potato section much more interesting but that's because I'm always interested in GMO foods, the science, the corruption, the danger to our society, the greed . . . I didn't really learn anything new as this was written quite a few years ago but it still captured my attention all the same. "
36,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/610744-luke,3,"The Botany of Desire was written in language that made it obvious that Michael Pollan likes to hear himself write. His ideas were interesting, following four plants, the potato, cannabis, the apple, and the tulip through their journey with mankind. I like how he approaches the topic, observing not only what people have done to the plants to develop them to our own use, but also how the plants have in some ways used us for their own ends. It is true that we, while we think we are masters of our own destinies, are intimately tied to the world around us. there is an ecological cause and effect that often escapes us because of our anthropogenic perspective. My argument with the book is that Pollan overuses imagery from Greek mythology and as a result becomes tedious to read in some sections. By far the most interesting is the last section on the interaction between humanity and the potato. "
37,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2967061-anne,4,"The same brilliant and creative thinking which I recall from my first read. The marijuana section is a bit dated at least in my state, CO, but otherwise, this book held up well."
38,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6894205-allie,2,"Do you talk to your plants? More to the point, do you think your plants talk back to you? If so, I have just the book for you…The Botany of Desire explores the relationship between plants and humans, but rather than focusing on human agency, food journalist and gardener Michael Pollan tells the story from the plants’ point of view. He takes the idea of co-evolution as his starting point: the idea that two species evolve in a mutually dependent manner leading to the selection of certain traits. Pollan attempts to apply this evolutionary concept to human interactions with plants.* 
""Plants hit on a remarkably clever strategy: getting us to move or think for them…it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees.""
Reading this book was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope; the perspective felt distorted. I was not persuaded that Pollan completely understood some of the scientific concepts that he was trying to explain. It all felt a little…Gladwell-esque. Pollan tries to illustrate the intertwined evolutionary relationship between plants and humans by telling the story of four plants and the desires that they satisfy. Sweetness: the first section focused on apples and the story of John Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed). Pollan dedicates many, many pages to Chapman’s life and his ‘Dionysian’ apple planting efforts, which allowed homesteaders to get reliably drunk on alcoholic cider. (Inspired by this chapter, I created a drinking game where I had a sip of scotch every time Pollan mentioned Dionysus or Apollo. I was forced to abandon this delightful crutch since there were so many references to both gods, I was getting woozy.) Beauty: the second section covered the speculative boom and bust around tulip mania in Holland, with some random thoughts about flowers throughout history and some general ideas around beauty (e.g., symmetry is appealing as a proxy for good health). There were a lot of opinion-led statements such as 
“beauty always takes place in the particular”
 that didn’t resonate with me; I find the ocean more beautiful in its entirety than a solitary wave. Intoxication: by far the most interesting, the third section discussed how humans seek intoxication through plants, which produce stimulants like caffeine, nicotine, THC, and hallucinogens. There is some fascinating published research about these drugs, but Pollan spirals away from the science to speculate on how THC mediates consciousness and can enhance creativity by blunting memory and creating the perception of heightened senses. (Huxley is referenced, which is never a good sign. Also, you can apparently get high from hallucinogens secreted by some toads.) Control over the natural environment: the final section is all about the humble potato, from the diverse varieties grown by the Aztecs to the Irish famine to Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potatoes. Pollan is in his element here as a food journalist, talking to scientists about gene transfer and farmers about the impact of GMO potatoes on their livelihoods. This section raised interesting concerns about the unintended consequences of tinkering with the plant genome since genes can “jump” to other plants via cross-pollination and their impact on the rest of the food chain is unknown.Perhaps if Pollan had focused on just one of the four desires, it would have been a more cohesive reading experience. But while there are interesting facts peppered throughout each chapter, the book attempts to cover so many different ideas that are only tangentially related, there was no space for thoughtful analysis. After finishing the book, I’m still not convinced by the author’s premise that: 
""Desire might be too strong a word for whatever it is that drives plants to reinvent themselves so that we might do their bidding, but then, our own designs have often been no more willful than the plants.""
Honestly, finishing this book was a Herculean task; only my determination not to disappoint my friend Scot who was reading the book with me enabled me to climb this metaphorical Mount Olympus. (Where, I should note, I looked down at all the plants from my lofty perch. Not a toad in sight up here!) It’s a shame, because Pollan writes beautifully, and could probably be very compelling if he was covering a topic where he has more expertise.*This is a established concept in biology applied to relationships between plants and pollinating insects or animals; predators and prey; pathogens and humans; and some domesticated animals (like dogs) and humans. The idea that plants and humans have a co-evolutionary relationship does not seem to be well-supported in the scientific literature. I mean, it’s not as far out there as the people who claim plants are silently screaming when we cut them down, but it’s pretty fringe."

41,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558460-caterina,4,"What if we humans are being manipulated by plants to serve their desires? From this slightly creepy flipped perspective, masterful storyteller Michael Pollan illuminates the crazy and complex interdependency of living things -- and also, some of the dangers we inflict on ourselves and our entire world by contemporary agricultural practices -- through four stories - and what stories! -- of the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. (Ok, he admits the conceit of manipulative plants to be a bit of a stretch -- but it's a fascinating way to see how we and our favorite foods, flowers, and intoxicants are, for better or worse, co-evolving.)Biggest surprise of the book - the potato's story turned out to be the most interesting and important (really, after marijuana?) and the best showcase of Pollan's skills as an investigative journalist/interviewer and experimental gardener. Who knew, for example, that Monsanto scientists created genetically engineered potato plants with a ""gene gun"" that uses a .22 shell to fire DNA-coated stainless steel projectiles into potato leaves in the hope that some of the alien DNA (from some non-potato species) combine with the plant's own DNA? Unless, as a Yankee from Connecticut, Pollan was being set up for a huge Southern joke -- which seems to me a distinct possibility -- this actually happened at the Monsanto lab he visited in Missouri. But possible joke aside, this story contained the most intelligent and nuanced discussion of genetic modification of foods that I've ever seen, with input from numerous scientists and farmers, as well as exploring the advantages and dangers of monoculture and colonial commodity agriculture (and some of its horrific history), chemical versus organic agriculture, and the effects of food culture on farming. Also, Michael Pollan clearly just loves to grow and eat potatoes -- it may be his relish that gave this story its extra glow. (Without ever mentioning vodka.)I also especially loved the apple's story, with the mysterious Dionysian and yet somehow pure, childlike figure of Johnny Appleseed spreading seeds -- not for nice wholesome lunchbox treats but for alcohol, and plenty of it, in the wilds of Pennsylvania and Ohio. (The woods I played in, growing up in southwestern Pennsylvania, were full of abandoned and decrepit old apple trees -- I had no idea of their history.) As this book came out in 2001 the MJ story was a bit dated, and although it focused on why the plant was so strongly prohibited, it never mentioned what I understand to be the two biggest reasons -- racism/anti-Mexican sentiment, and pressure by the American pharmaceutical industry. Nor does the current battle between states and federal government come up (which maybe echoes historic battles over hard cider and whiskey). Nevertheless, all four stories are surprising and fascinating, combining investigative journalism (involving quite a bit of travel), personal experimentation, and a good dose of wild imaginative speculation -- sometimes fueled by that experimentation."
42,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666,4,"Michael Pollan's book is certainly an interesting one. It germinates (pun intended) in Pollan's mind, one day, as he was working in his garden. He thought what if human beings were similar to bumblebees? It is an interesting take on ""coevolution"", which stipulates that two parties can act on each other to advance their individual interests but end up producing a mutually beneficial outcome.What if plants were able to develop traits that would cause other animals to help them in their goal to reproduce? As plants are immobile, they tend to rely on wind and rain to spread their pollen. But with the evolution of angiosperms, plants with flowers and seeds, animals had a new reason to eat those plants and they spread the seeds for the plant, or pollen in the case of the bee.He then stipulates that the four plants he covers have also evolved in such a way as to appeal to the human animal and, by doing so, have been able to spread their seed all across the world. The four plants he looks at are perfect examples of how they have managed to ""attract"" human beings. Pollan also links each of these plants to a specific desire. They are as follows:The apple, which utilizes the sense of sweetness.The Tulip, which utilizes the sense of beauty.The potato, which utilizes the sense of control.The marijuana plant, which utilizes the sense of intoxication.Each of these plants gets a detailed history. You will learn where they came from, how they were modified and how they entered into the human world. The stories are interesting, though I could have done with less of the personal ruminations, it is the history and the science behind these four plants that make this an interesting book to read.It is hardly overly technical and quite easy for a science dunce to comprehend. If you are looking for something more science-heavy, I'd pass on this. This is a book that tells the tale of science through the prism of human desire. Pollan does a good job of explaining things like the Diyonisian concepts and how they melded into how humans view intoxication and their views on marijuana.An interesting book that will make you think and while not science-heavy, this is a book that will interest science and non-science people alike. Interesting anecdotes and some cool history make this a rather unique book."

I mean, I want to know about Michael Pollan, he is huge and important, right? And everybody in Berkeley wants him to be Obama's Secretary of Agriculture. (Though I guess I haven't read Obama's books, so.) I liked it! I was kind of surprised, I think I was expecting something dryer. Mostly it was just this pretty smart guy talking about stuff he likes: natural selection, Johnny Appleseed, weed stories, people, Dionysus, bugs and genetically modified foods. I thought it was pretty great how in the beginning he was like, Here are four things I'm going to talk about, but then he didn't tell you what he was gonna say about 'em- like, you know the last chapter's gonna be about potatoes, but you don't know that it's going to be a conversation about the safety of genetically modified potatoes. And dude loves his plants, which is nice. It felt pretty repetitive at times, just saying the same stuff over and over, and that definitely got boring, but whatever. I was sucked in enough to bust through it between bouts of neck-pain sleep on planes and buses and trains while I was on the east coast for three days, which is more than I can say for bell hooks, who's all writing stuff I have to pay attention to and think critically about.

44,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,3,"An earlier Pollan book, and a bestseller. Like the later, better, books, Botany explores its thesis, that the plants co-evolve with us, in four sections. There is some fluff here; the best section is easily on the one on intoxication. Doubters should read the introduction and skip to section 3.Pollan's best stuff always makes me see the world differently, and this passage changed the way I conceived of gardens, what they are, and what they could be:""I sometimes think we've allowed our gardens to be bowdlerized, that the full range of their powers and possibilities has been sacrificed to a cult of plant prettiness that obscures more dubious truths about nature, our own included. It hasn't always been this way, and we may someday come to regard the contemporary garden of vegetables and flowers as a place almost Victorian in its repressions and elisions.""He goes on to discuss a witch's garden, which included intoxicants and medicines, rather than just beautiful flowers. He argues that when the church murdered witches, they converted the contents of these gardens from taboo objects to medicines made acceptable by what we'd now call physicians. I'm sure I'm bastardizing the argument, but it was interesting. Great chapter.And here is one on what might be Pollan's greatest weakness as a reporter but what is also his greatest strength as a writer: ""I am literally absentminded, prone to be thinking about something else, something past, when I am ostensibly having a fresh experience.""Of the other chapters, the best is on potatoes, and the other two are about apples and tulips.As for the books, I still rate Omnivore, Cooked, and A Place of My Own ahead of this one, but if you broke it down to chapters, Botany's chapter on intoxication would jump ahead to the top five Pollan chapters, alongside the Omnivore stuff and Cooked's chapter on fermented foods."
45,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Not as good as the Omnivore's Dilemma, but definitely worth a read if you love thinking about plants as much as I do.The first section, on apples, was really dry (to me). Actually, it's less about apples and more about John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) and I just... don't... care about him. Right, great, he planted lots of apples, we get it, he's a hometown hero. The rest is pretty well done, though. I especially loved the section on cannabis. I harbour a lot of curiosity as to how psychotropic plants and humans have co-evolved, and why exactly certain plants have developed those mechanisms, and how we humans came to have a neurology that happened to respond to those plants' chemicals. So that was extremely engrossing.Tulips also held my interest pretty aggressively, for similar reasons. The subject of why we even like and are drawn to things as seemingly useless (evolutionarily speaking) as flowers is fascinating. It's much easier to know without having to read a book that apples or potatoes and humans have fed off one another in time. Tulips are a little bit more intriguing.I like Pollan's dry humour but also his rich curiosity, but I suspect that when he wrote this book, what was really on his mind was his next book. The section on potatoes is essentially a short verse of the Omnivore's Dilemma. In the Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan seemed more enthusiastic about the material and more concerned with the topic (not that he isn't here, but he really hits his stride there). "

I personally liked the sections on apple and potatoes, while I found the tulip and marijuana chapters less engaging. The last section, that explains the practice and risks of mono-culture and the processes of genetics manipulation employed by large corporations (e.g. Monsanto) were fascinating and scaring at the same time.3.5 stars rounded down because I found the repetition of the Apollo-Dionysus metaphor annoying and pompous in its tone.Fav.

It seems that by the time the singular beauty of a flower in bloom can no longer pierce the veil of black or obsessive thoughts in a person’s mind, that mind’s connection to the sensual world has grown dangerously frayed.

Those plants then (over generations) alter their genetics to transform themselves into even more desirable individuals of their species. The human benefit is obvious, but the plant also benefits because humans cultivate many times more of that species of plant than would ever occur naturally.The history and the science fascinated me, but I felt that some of the book was a bit repetitive and in a few places difficult to follow the flow and narrative."
48,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2163177-kishor,5,"Mr Pollan uses The Botany of Desire to posit that the nature of our relationship with plants is a lot more nuanced than it seems at first glance. While we may have succeeded in domesticating a large number of photosynthetic species, they in turn are exerting various influences on mankind. In the process of regaling us with stories of four specific plants, he manages to lay a wealth of information on the reader. The four plants are the apple (symbolizing sweetness), the tulip (beauty), marijuana (intoxication), and the potato (control).Here are some interesting things I learnt about each of them:Apple trees grown from seed produce really bitter fruit; grafting allows the cloning of trees with good fruit at the cost of loss of genetic diversity. Produce from the former type of tree was (and is?) primarily used for producing cider and applejack; Johnny ""Appleseed"" Chapman, it turns out, was responsible for keeping the American frontier well lubricated with spirits.The tulip flower is colored by two chemicals; a base layer of pigment and another (anthocyanin) on top. Famous beauties amongst the tulip family (check out the Semper Augustus, it's *amazing*) are patterned due to the activity of a virus that causes the anthocyanin to degrade, allowing the base layer to be seen. The author draws on Apollo and Dionysus heavily in this chapter, contrasting the Apollonian austerity and order of the tulip with the Dionysian seduction of other flowers like the peony and the rose.The marijuana plant diverged at some point in history to grow as two different varieties - the indica strain is much more potent and can withstand frost, while the sativa strain gives the consumer a ""clear, bell-like high"" but requires equatorial climes to grow. Growers have hybridized the two, thereby combining their strengths and downplaying their weaknesses. An interesting point that Michael brings up in this section is that humanity is constantly seeking out ways to alter its state of consciousness; in fact, this is a thing we do even as children, be it by consuming sugary snacks, spinning around fast until dizziness causes visual hallucinations, holding our breath until we spots, and so on. Adults do this too, through the mechanisms of ""meditation, fasting, exercise, amusement park rides, ..., music, eating spicy foods"", etc. The human body has its own cannabinoid system, and produces a THC-like neurotransmitter named ""anandamide"" by the discoverer; the name stems from ""ananda"", the Sanskrit word for bliss.He uses his section on the potato to talk about genetic engineering, again weaving a narrative of Apollonian order vs Dionysian wildness. Mr Pollan planted in his garden the potato known as the NewLeaf, engineered by the Monsanto corporation, producing its own insecticide in its leaves. While this helps fight the evil Colorado potato beetle and saves farmers from having to coat their fields with nasty chemicals, it means that agriculture is moving towards a monoculture and a subsequent loss of biodiversity. The organic farmer who seeds their fields with a variety of crop, however, doesn't care about the susceptibilities of any one plant; the overall crop is always (barring bizarre tornadoes, I mean) guaranteed to do fine.All this plant talk makes me want to take up gardening!"
49,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"This is another time where I've read a book and only come back to write the review many, many, many months later. In this case, I read the book (listened to the Audible, technically) back in March 2017 and now I'm reviewing it in January 2018. The reason it's taken so long is that I flagged several passages for transcription into my notes, and I only just now got around to doing it. (19 notes in an hour is actually pretty good for me.)So I'll just have to leave you with some vague impressions.For one, Michael Pollan can write. I was struck--going through and transcribing some of my notes--once again by the variety and precision of his language. He is a really, really great writer. Quick sample:Imagine a moment when the sensation of honey or sugar on the tongue was an astonishment, a kind of intoxication. The closest I've ever come to recovering such a sense of sweetness was secondhand, though it left a powerful impression on me ever so. I'm thinking of my son's first experience of sugar: the icing on the cake at his first birthday. I have only the testimony of Isaac's face to go by (that, and his fierceness to repeat the experience), but it was plain that his first encounter with sugar had intoxicated him--was in fact an ecstasy, in the literal sense of the word. That is, he was beside himself with the pleasure of it, no longer her with me in space and time in quite the same way he had been just a moment before. Between bites Isaac gazed up at me in amazement (he was on my lap, and I was delivering the ambrosial forkfuls to his gaping mouth) as if to exclaim, ""Your world contains this? From this day forward I shall dedicate my life to it."" (Which he basically has done.) And I remember thinking, this is no minor desire, and then wondered: Could it be that sweetness is the prototype of all desire?I almost feel like this talent is lost on non-fiction. Why isn't Pollan writing novels?(Just went and checked. He hasn't written any. He did get both his BA and MA in English, though. So that goes some distance to explaining his writing chops.)The passage above is also a good example of Pollan's wide-ranging syntheses. He's very good at pulling from pretty disparate sources in surprising and illuminating ways.The most powerful passages of the book for me were the ones about Johnny Appleseed. I was really impressed by how Pollan was able to bring some historical weight along with almost mythic significance to the story, and was surprised again and again by what I learned about apples (along with, later, potatoes and tulips. Cannabis was less impressive.)I can see where critics can find fault with the book. Because it's a broad approach, it is also a little thin and shallow in spots. I'm fine with that. More often than not, the problem with 200-page popular science books is that they have way too little material and far too much padding. Although there are a few patchy spots, in general Pollan never runs out of ideas or material, and the book is satisfyingly compelling from page 1 on to the end."

It took me three years to get around to reading this book, but I'm glad I finally did. It's a bit more metaphysical than the other books I've read by him, but still very informative and interesting. I was fascinated by his exploration of the four different kinds of plants and the human desires sated by each. And I was amused by his continual revisitation of the Dionysus/Apollo metaphor throughout the book. interesting quotes:""So the question arose in my mind that day: Did I choose to plant these potatoes, or did the potato make me do it? In fact, both statements are true...Yet evolution consists of an infinitude of trivial, unconscious events, and in the evolution of the potato my reading of a particular seed catalog on a particular January evening counts as one of them."" (p. xv)""Domesticated species don't command our respect the way their wild cousins often do. Evolution may reward interdependence, but our thinking selves continue to prize self-reliance. The wolf is somehow more impressive than the dog. Yet there are fifty million dogs in America today, only ten thousand wolves. So what does the dog know about getting along in this world that its wild ancestor doesn't? The big thing the dog knows about-the subject matter it has mastered in the ten thousand years it has been evolving at our side-is us: our needs and desires, our emotions and values, all of which it has folded into its genes as part of a sophisticated strategy for survival."" (pp. xvi-xvii)""The four desires I explore here are sweetness, broadly defined, in the story of the apple;beauty in the tulip's;intoxication in the story of cannibis; and control in the story of the potato-specifically, in the story of a genetically altered potato I grew in my garden to see where the ancient arts of domestication may now be headed. (p. xviii)""Every wild apple shrub excites our expectations thus,"" Thoreau wrote, ""somewhat as every wild child. It is, perhaps, a prince in disguise. What a lesson to man!...Poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures, and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men."" (p. 45)""Symmetry is an unmistakable sign that there's relevant information in a place. That's because symmetry is a property shared by a relatively small number of things in the landscape, all of them of keen interest to us. The shortlist of nature's symmetricals includes other creatures, other people (most notably the faces of other people), human artifacts, and plants--but especially flowers. Symmetry is also a sign of health in a creature, since mutations and environmental stresses can easily disturb it. So paying attention to symmetrical things makes good sense: symmetry is usually significant."" (p. 76)""Though we self-importantly regard domestication as something people have done to plants, it is at the same time a strategy by which the plants have exploited us and our desires--even our most idiosyncratic notions of beauty--to advance their own interests. Depending on the environment in which a species finds itself, different adaptations will avail. Mutations that nature would have rejected out of hand in the wild sometimes prove to be brilliant adaptations in an environment that's been shaped by human desire."" (p. 81)""Although by any conventional measure it is folly to pay thousands for a tulip bulb (or for that matter an Internet stock), as long as there is an even greater fool out there willing to pay even more, doing so is the most logical thing in the world."" (p. 103)""Yet this new biotechnology has overthrown the old rules governing the relationship of nature and culture in a plant. Domestication has never been a simple one-way process in which our species has controlled others; other species participate only so far as their interests are served, and many plants (such as the oak) simply sit the whole game out. That game is the one Darwin called 'artificial selection,' and its rules have never been any different from the ones that govern natural selection. The plant in its wildness proposes new qualities, and then man (or, in the case of natural selection, nature) selects which of those qualities will survive and prosper. But about one rule Darwin was emphatic; as he wrote in The Origin of Species, 'Man does not actually produce variability.' Now he does."" (p. 196)""Yet for reasons we don't completely understand, distinct species do exist in nature, and they exhibit a certain genetic integrity--sex between them, when it does occur, doesn't produce fertile offspring. Nature presumably has some reason for erecting these walls, even if they are permeable on occasion. Perhaps, as some biologists believe, the purpose of keeping species separate is to put barriers in the path of pathogens, to contain their damage so that a single germ can't wipe out life on Earth at a stroke."" (pp. 196-197)""This is, of course, how chemical companies have always handled the problem of pest resistance: by simply introducing a new and improved pesticide every few years. With any luck, the effectiveness of the last one will expire around the same time its patent does.""

53,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67444659-katie-hamilton,4,"Reading Pollan’s work feels like a conversation with him in the most casual setting, discussing science, while also chuckling every so often at his comments strategically placed in parentheses. He is an incredibly gifted non-fiction writer whose first-person style makes his work as readable as it is educational. This book personifies the foods described and paints them as our partners in consumption and in life."
54,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,5,"Michael Pollan is swiftly solidifying his position as ""somebody I want to know."" He's a clever writer, an inquisitive journalist, and a creative storyteller, as well as a shining light of simple food consciousness in an era of either not asking at all or asking far too much.This book is equal parts natural history, social history, regular history, botanical musing, plant biology, evolutionary theory, and psychology, with a smattering of classical mythology, memoir, neuroscience, and investigative journalism to hold the threads together. Pollan sets out with the aim of tracking four plants along their coevolution with society, tying each to a human desire that shaped it into what it is today: the apple and sweetness, the tulip and beauty, marijuana and intoxication, and potatoes and control. What he ends up writing from this neat little package of a thesis is something much greater than the sum of its parts, a veritable exploration (I use the word a lot but I think it really applies here) of what it means to be human in a determinedly natural world. One of the ideas he returns to often is that our relationship to the natural world is a balancing of Apollonian (controlled, geometric, structured, artificial) and Dionysian (frenetic, shifting, chaotic, and natural) forces, and I think he really hit the nail on the head with the notion as much as with the conclusion that it's a much more complicated relationship than it first appears. The complexity of the question is due in part to the many human urges (such as morality) that don't fit cleanly in either camp, and in part to the ambiguity of the agent in control within the framework of nature's chaos. It's an impressively thoughtful approach, and the broad reach allowed by a philosophical, as opposed to purely scientific, foundation means the reader gets to learn a little about a lot along the way.I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by divulging details of HOW each plant and desire is examined, but I will assure you that the how is not as straightforward and easy as you'd expect. This is becoming a mark of Pollan's writing as much as it always has been a hallmark of great writing: a clear and simple idea considered with breadth and depth in a manner so well-organized that you don't realize how much you're learning until you're done. I cannot wait to read more of his work."
55,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196103-jenn,3,"I thought this was an interesting but long winded book. The author discusses 4 different plants and how they have 'coevolved' with humans to reap the benefits of human interaction. It is best summed up in one of the first chapters of the book as the author ponders if he planted potatoes in his garden out of his own accord of did the potatoes, by virtue of their deliciousness, pursuade him to plant them?One of the main things I learned from this book is the value of diversity. From the loss of heritage apple varieties due to the desire for sickly sweet varieties to the monsanto NewLeaf potatoes that are themselves registered with the EPA as a pesticide i was introduced to this monoculture idea that I didnt know existed. I was shocked to learn about the stringent potato requirements of the fast food industry - only 1 type of potato without blemish is acceptable for french fry production. With the razor slim profit margins of farming a farmer selling to these companies nearly HAS to use GMO crops and/or huge amounts of pesticides to make ends meet.This definitely changed the way I think about organic vs non organic foods. I used to think buying non-organic potatoes was alright, but faced with the fact of what could potentially be in them (one of the potato farmers wouldnt even eat the potatoes he grew) i now feel that i really need to buy local and or organic for the sake of my health."
56,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914674-isis,5,"I liked this book even better than The Omnivore's Dilemma. When you strip aside the somewhat heavy-handed Apollo vs. Dionysus metaphor and the provocative subtitle that suggests that it's plants, not people, who invented agriculture -- that we're essentially only sophisticated bees -- you get a fascinating set of histories of four very interesting plants: apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes. And yes, they co-evolved with people, but that's really nothing surprising or shocking. But it is both entertaining and educational, written well and read (in the audio edition I listened to) superbly.Pollan takes a vast road-trip through history, and although it seems like a pleasantly meandering journey, it's actually quite focused and organized. In the chapter on apples we learn of the real Johnny Appleseed, and of the concept of sweetness, and of how Prohibition changed apple marketing for good. The tulip chapter touches on not only the (obvious) tulip mania speculative bubble, but also on the genetics of tulips and the virus that affected them, and on the idea of floral beauty in different cultures. And so on. There is a bit of moralizing: the drug war comes in for some criticism, and monoculture is reviled as the root of all of industrial agriculture's evil. But I don't disagree with these points!"
57,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431129-brian,4,"By the end of this book, I really wanted to have Michael Pollan's life, more or less. Though I'd settle for a nice house somewhere where I can have a big garden with all types of plants like his; that was the main attraction, along with the requisite knowledge and experience of nature itself and the nature of how things grow, in a word. As noble as it sounds in theory for man to be in harmony with nature, it becomes clear by his summation in the epilogue that it's nothing less than quite practical. But most of all, it's rewarding.Part of why I must feel this even stronger pull towards plants after finishing was that I think the order of the chapters was well-chosen. The themes on which he hit were introduced best with the apple and finished best with the potato, though I would have to call cannabis and potato my two favorite chapters. Loading up on everything else before you see the contrast of commercial Monsanto-controlled potato farming in Idaho with Michael Pollan's own backyard, you're smart and informed enough on the subject to feel passionate about cultivating a more symbiotic relationship with your environment. Again, which is why I want a nice house with a big garden even more now. "

Lots of face-palms.The musings on the effects of Marijuana is really uncomfortable.Pollan obviously wrote this chapter while high.He suggests that meditation can get you high like Marijuana, which just isn't true.He rambles on about spirituality, which is bizarre and metaphysical.The potato.Pollan shares with us his ignorance-fueled skepticism about GM crops.He states, falsely, that Monsanto has a patent on the BT gene.In fact, Monsanto's patents cover specific plant genomes with the BT gene inserted at a particular location.The difference being, Monsanto did not come up with the BT gene.What they rightfully call their intellectual property is the work of figuring out how to make the BT gene work inside each plant.Evil patents are no argument against GM crops than they are an argument against pharmaceuticals.His other argument is some philosophical nuance of object vs. subject.He seems to be putting forth an argument for purity.That intentional tampering directly with the genome is different and worse than using ""natural"" techniques like cloning, grafting, crossing, and other forms of artificial selection.Really, there's no functional difference between modifying the sequence of genes with one or another technique.Some techniques, like recombinant genetic engineering, offer more possibilities.Then, he whines about monoculture for a few dozen pages.This part sounds like it's right out of omnivore's dilemma.Apollonian verses Dionysian, blah, blah, blah.I wish Pollan would stick to the fascinating anecdotes."
63,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,4,"In The Botany of Desire Michael Pollan goes into our relationship with four plants: the tulip, marijuana, the apple, and the potato. He looks at these four plants from historical, political, and personal point of view. In many ways this is a fascinating account. For example the first one that goes into the tulip mania that the Dutch got into, which is both comic, and ridiculous at the same time, but of course if we look at the stock market in general, these sorts of things still take place, just in a slightly different way. Are the plants themselves passive victims in all of this or are they active participants is one of the more interesting question that he tries to answer in his book, but of course he can't really prove it one way or the other. Still, he does present the case for them being much more active members in this relationship so well that a question that might have seemed a little silly actually becomes an interesting one. There is one thing about Pollen's writing style, he does tend to take detours, in fact he takes quite a few one of those. This does make the book at times feel a little unfocused, but still it never really got uninteresting, even despite that. I actually got quite a bit of enjoyment out of this read. And I gained some inside into this subject. One can't really ask much more out of a nonfiction book, so I think I may read something else by him. "
64,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"Wonderful, wonderful book, full of fantastic info and insights. My main critique is Pollan's main conceit, and the language used to express it: plant species have domesticated humanity just as much as humanity has domesticated them. My problem is his constant insertion of agency into the process of evolution and mixing metaphors of individuals and of species. Flowers are not individually clever, and neither are species of flowers. Flowers do not manipulate bees in the same way that a botanist manipulates a flower species through artificial selection or genetic modification. Species do not have agency, the will to act. Only individuals have that, and individuals bees, potatoes, or water buffalo do not (to our knowledge), willfully offer themselves up as partners to humanity.Pollan draws an interesting distinction that I haven't encountered in my amateur meanderings between ""wilderness"" and ""wildness."" He uses ""wilderness"" in the sense of the Wilderness Act of 1964, ""an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."" ""Wildness,"" on the other hand, is anything that humans cannot control. As Bill McKibben famously pointed out, the atmosphere of our planet is no longer a wilderness, tainted as it is by the byproducts of our industry, but as every hurricane and tornado reminds us, it is still profoundly wild.Pollan uses this distinction to emphasize that while all domestication is a destruction of wilderness, it is almost never an abolition of wildness. The gardener uses his sense of order not to control his plants absolutely, but to guide and shape their wildness in certain ways. He goes on to suggest that genetic engineering may violate this pact, that by attempting to guide evolution on such a basic level is a powerful new way to write wildness out of the equation. He also offers the counterpoint that current techniques for gene insertion are (sometimes literally) so scattershot as to yield results that are even less predictable that conventional breeding.The topic of wilderness feeds into another interesting point, which is that ""memory is the enemy of wonder"" (168). He argues that cannabinoids like THC help us experience awe and wonder by forcing constant short term memory loss, and that meditation or physical exertion probably induce the same effect, making the view from a mountain peak infinitely more profound after having hiked to it instead of having driven.Another insight he had about marijuana is that drugs could be considered the mutagens of culture. If one assumes a meme is like a gene, then a culture is like a genome. Memes are constantly recombining through thought and discourse (intercourse in both culture and biology), but genuinely new ideas are rare. At the risk of spreading a metaphor too thin, Pollan suggests that drugs could be thought of as mutagens, radiation nuking the genetic fundaments of culture, producing mostly irrelevant or deleterious nonsense, but now and again creating viable gems (149). Kind of a fun thought."
65,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark,3,"This guy has inspired me to grow my own food and keep a few hens in the backyard. Being a little self-reliant in these unsettling times gives me a sense of stability and hope.In this book, Pollan takes a look at four plants and relates them to human desires, I think . . . He starts things off with the apple and goes into a bit of long-winded ramble about Johnny Appleseed's quest to sell his trees to pioneers and his lust for a 10 year old bride (fortunately this bit wasn't dug into with any sort of detail). Johnny's enthusiasm for the apple and his desire to plant the seed (and refusal to graft) results in the many varieties that adapted to new climates. Though I'm learning a lot about Johnny here, I'd rather have more factoids about the apple. I'm hoping the following chapters are more interesting because I find my mind wandering more than usual while listening to this.I've now finished up the tulip section and made it about halfway through the marijuana chapter but, at this point, I have come to the realization that this book just doesn't interest me. It's very repetitive and meandering. I'll finish it up and hope the potato's treatment can grab me enough to get through it.Later: I finished up and did find the potato section much more interesting but that's because I'm always interested in GMO foods, the science, the corruption, the danger to our society, the greed . . . I didn't really learn anything new as this was written quite a few years ago but it still captured my attention all the same. "
66,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/610744-luke,3,"The Botany of Desire was written in language that made it obvious that Michael Pollan likes to hear himself write. His ideas were interesting, following four plants, the potato, cannabis, the apple, and the tulip through their journey with mankind. I like how he approaches the topic, observing not only what people have done to the plants to develop them to our own use, but also how the plants have in some ways used us for their own ends. It is true that we, while we think we are masters of our own destinies, are intimately tied to the world around us. there is an ecological cause and effect that often escapes us because of our anthropogenic perspective. My argument with the book is that Pollan overuses imagery from Greek mythology and as a result becomes tedious to read in some sections. By far the most interesting is the last section on the interaction between humanity and the potato. "
67,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2967061-anne,4,"The same brilliant and creative thinking which I recall from my first read. The marijuana section is a bit dated at least in my state, CO, but otherwise, this book held up well."
68,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6894205-allie,2,"Do you talk to your plants? More to the point, do you think your plants talk back to you? If so, I have just the book for you…The Botany of Desire explores the relationship between plants and humans, but rather than focusing on human agency, food journalist and gardener Michael Pollan tells the story from the plants’ point of view. He takes the idea of co-evolution as his starting point: the idea that two species evolve in a mutually dependent manner leading to the selection of certain traits. Pollan attempts to apply this evolutionary concept to human interactions with plants.* 
""Plants hit on a remarkably clever strategy: getting us to move or think for them…it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees.""
Reading this book was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope; the perspective felt distorted. I was not persuaded that Pollan completely understood some of the scientific concepts that he was trying to explain. It all felt a little…Gladwell-esque. Pollan tries to illustrate the intertwined evolutionary relationship between plants and humans by telling the story of four plants and the desires that they satisfy. Sweetness: the first section focused on apples and the story of John Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed). Pollan dedicates many, many pages to Chapman’s life and his ‘Dionysian’ apple planting efforts, which allowed homesteaders to get reliably drunk on alcoholic cider. (Inspired by this chapter, I created a drinking game where I had a sip of scotch every time Pollan mentioned Dionysus or Apollo. I was forced to abandon this delightful crutch since there were so many references to both gods, I was getting woozy.) Beauty: the second section covered the speculative boom and bust around tulip mania in Holland, with some random thoughts about flowers throughout history and some general ideas around beauty (e.g., symmetry is appealing as a proxy for good health). There were a lot of opinion-led statements such as 
“beauty always takes place in the particular”
 that didn’t resonate with me; I find the ocean more beautiful in its entirety than a solitary wave. Intoxication: by far the most interesting, the third section discussed how humans seek intoxication through plants, which produce stimulants like caffeine, nicotine, THC, and hallucinogens. There is some fascinating published research about these drugs, but Pollan spirals away from the science to speculate on how THC mediates consciousness and can enhance creativity by blunting memory and creating the perception of heightened senses. (Huxley is referenced, which is never a good sign. Also, you can apparently get high from hallucinogens secreted by some toads.) Control over the natural environment: the final section is all about the humble potato, from the diverse varieties grown by the Aztecs to the Irish famine to Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potatoes. Pollan is in his element here as a food journalist, talking to scientists about gene transfer and farmers about the impact of GMO potatoes on their livelihoods. This section raised interesting concerns about the unintended consequences of tinkering with the plant genome since genes can “jump” to other plants via cross-pollination and their impact on the rest of the food chain is unknown.Perhaps if Pollan had focused on just one of the four desires, it would have been a more cohesive reading experience. But while there are interesting facts peppered throughout each chapter, the book attempts to cover so many different ideas that are only tangentially related, there was no space for thoughtful analysis. After finishing the book, I’m still not convinced by the author’s premise that: 
""Desire might be too strong a word for whatever it is that drives plants to reinvent themselves so that we might do their bidding, but then, our own designs have often been no more willful than the plants.""
Honestly, finishing this book was a Herculean task; only my determination not to disappoint my friend Scot who was reading the book with me enabled me to climb this metaphorical Mount Olympus. (Where, I should note, I looked down at all the plants from my lofty perch. Not a toad in sight up here!) It’s a shame, because Pollan writes beautifully, and could probably be very compelling if he was covering a topic where he has more expertise.*This is a established concept in biology applied to relationships between plants and pollinating insects or animals; predators and prey; pathogens and humans; and some domesticated animals (like dogs) and humans. The idea that plants and humans have a co-evolutionary relationship does not seem to be well-supported in the scientific literature. I mean, it’s not as far out there as the people who claim plants are silently screaming when we cut them down, but it’s pretty fringe."

71,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558460-caterina,4,"What if we humans are being manipulated by plants to serve their desires? From this slightly creepy flipped perspective, masterful storyteller Michael Pollan illuminates the crazy and complex interdependency of living things -- and also, some of the dangers we inflict on ourselves and our entire world by contemporary agricultural practices -- through four stories - and what stories! -- of the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. (Ok, he admits the conceit of manipulative plants to be a bit of a stretch -- but it's a fascinating way to see how we and our favorite foods, flowers, and intoxicants are, for better or worse, co-evolving.)Biggest surprise of the book - the potato's story turned out to be the most interesting and important (really, after marijuana?) and the best showcase of Pollan's skills as an investigative journalist/interviewer and experimental gardener. Who knew, for example, that Monsanto scientists created genetically engineered potato plants with a ""gene gun"" that uses a .22 shell to fire DNA-coated stainless steel projectiles into potato leaves in the hope that some of the alien DNA (from some non-potato species) combine with the plant's own DNA? Unless, as a Yankee from Connecticut, Pollan was being set up for a huge Southern joke -- which seems to me a distinct possibility -- this actually happened at the Monsanto lab he visited in Missouri. But possible joke aside, this story contained the most intelligent and nuanced discussion of genetic modification of foods that I've ever seen, with input from numerous scientists and farmers, as well as exploring the advantages and dangers of monoculture and colonial commodity agriculture (and some of its horrific history), chemical versus organic agriculture, and the effects of food culture on farming. Also, Michael Pollan clearly just loves to grow and eat potatoes -- it may be his relish that gave this story its extra glow. (Without ever mentioning vodka.)I also especially loved the apple's story, with the mysterious Dionysian and yet somehow pure, childlike figure of Johnny Appleseed spreading seeds -- not for nice wholesome lunchbox treats but for alcohol, and plenty of it, in the wilds of Pennsylvania and Ohio. (The woods I played in, growing up in southwestern Pennsylvania, were full of abandoned and decrepit old apple trees -- I had no idea of their history.) As this book came out in 2001 the MJ story was a bit dated, and although it focused on why the plant was so strongly prohibited, it never mentioned what I understand to be the two biggest reasons -- racism/anti-Mexican sentiment, and pressure by the American pharmaceutical industry. Nor does the current battle between states and federal government come up (which maybe echoes historic battles over hard cider and whiskey). Nevertheless, all four stories are surprising and fascinating, combining investigative journalism (involving quite a bit of travel), personal experimentation, and a good dose of wild imaginative speculation -- sometimes fueled by that experimentation."
72,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666,4,"Michael Pollan's book is certainly an interesting one. It germinates (pun intended) in Pollan's mind, one day, as he was working in his garden. He thought what if human beings were similar to bumblebees? It is an interesting take on ""coevolution"", which stipulates that two parties can act on each other to advance their individual interests but end up producing a mutually beneficial outcome.What if plants were able to develop traits that would cause other animals to help them in their goal to reproduce? As plants are immobile, they tend to rely on wind and rain to spread their pollen. But with the evolution of angiosperms, plants with flowers and seeds, animals had a new reason to eat those plants and they spread the seeds for the plant, or pollen in the case of the bee.He then stipulates that the four plants he covers have also evolved in such a way as to appeal to the human animal and, by doing so, have been able to spread their seed all across the world. The four plants he looks at are perfect examples of how they have managed to ""attract"" human beings. Pollan also links each of these plants to a specific desire. They are as follows:The apple, which utilizes the sense of sweetness.The Tulip, which utilizes the sense of beauty.The potato, which utilizes the sense of control.The marijuana plant, which utilizes the sense of intoxication.Each of these plants gets a detailed history. You will learn where they came from, how they were modified and how they entered into the human world. The stories are interesting, though I could have done with less of the personal ruminations, it is the history and the science behind these four plants that make this an interesting book to read.It is hardly overly technical and quite easy for a science dunce to comprehend. If you are looking for something more science-heavy, I'd pass on this. This is a book that tells the tale of science through the prism of human desire. Pollan does a good job of explaining things like the Diyonisian concepts and how they melded into how humans view intoxication and their views on marijuana.An interesting book that will make you think and while not science-heavy, this is a book that will interest science and non-science people alike. Interesting anecdotes and some cool history make this a rather unique book."

I mean, I want to know about Michael Pollan, he is huge and important, right? And everybody in Berkeley wants him to be Obama's Secretary of Agriculture. (Though I guess I haven't read Obama's books, so.) I liked it! I was kind of surprised, I think I was expecting something dryer. Mostly it was just this pretty smart guy talking about stuff he likes: natural selection, Johnny Appleseed, weed stories, people, Dionysus, bugs and genetically modified foods. I thought it was pretty great how in the beginning he was like, Here are four things I'm going to talk about, but then he didn't tell you what he was gonna say about 'em- like, you know the last chapter's gonna be about potatoes, but you don't know that it's going to be a conversation about the safety of genetically modified potatoes. And dude loves his plants, which is nice. It felt pretty repetitive at times, just saying the same stuff over and over, and that definitely got boring, but whatever. I was sucked in enough to bust through it between bouts of neck-pain sleep on planes and buses and trains while I was on the east coast for three days, which is more than I can say for bell hooks, who's all writing stuff I have to pay attention to and think critically about.

74,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,3,"An earlier Pollan book, and a bestseller. Like the later, better, books, Botany explores its thesis, that the plants co-evolve with us, in four sections. There is some fluff here; the best section is easily on the one on intoxication. Doubters should read the introduction and skip to section 3.Pollan's best stuff always makes me see the world differently, and this passage changed the way I conceived of gardens, what they are, and what they could be:""I sometimes think we've allowed our gardens to be bowdlerized, that the full range of their powers and possibilities has been sacrificed to a cult of plant prettiness that obscures more dubious truths about nature, our own included. It hasn't always been this way, and we may someday come to regard the contemporary garden of vegetables and flowers as a place almost Victorian in its repressions and elisions.""He goes on to discuss a witch's garden, which included intoxicants and medicines, rather than just beautiful flowers. He argues that when the church murdered witches, they converted the contents of these gardens from taboo objects to medicines made acceptable by what we'd now call physicians. I'm sure I'm bastardizing the argument, but it was interesting. Great chapter.And here is one on what might be Pollan's greatest weakness as a reporter but what is also his greatest strength as a writer: ""I am literally absentminded, prone to be thinking about something else, something past, when I am ostensibly having a fresh experience.""Of the other chapters, the best is on potatoes, and the other two are about apples and tulips.As for the books, I still rate Omnivore, Cooked, and A Place of My Own ahead of this one, but if you broke it down to chapters, Botany's chapter on intoxication would jump ahead to the top five Pollan chapters, alongside the Omnivore stuff and Cooked's chapter on fermented foods."
75,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Not as good as the Omnivore's Dilemma, but definitely worth a read if you love thinking about plants as much as I do.The first section, on apples, was really dry (to me). Actually, it's less about apples and more about John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) and I just... don't... care about him. Right, great, he planted lots of apples, we get it, he's a hometown hero. The rest is pretty well done, though. I especially loved the section on cannabis. I harbour a lot of curiosity as to how psychotropic plants and humans have co-evolved, and why exactly certain plants have developed those mechanisms, and how we humans came to have a neurology that happened to respond to those plants' chemicals. So that was extremely engrossing.Tulips also held my interest pretty aggressively, for similar reasons. The subject of why we even like and are drawn to things as seemingly useless (evolutionarily speaking) as flowers is fascinating. It's much easier to know without having to read a book that apples or potatoes and humans have fed off one another in time. Tulips are a little bit more intriguing.I like Pollan's dry humour but also his rich curiosity, but I suspect that when he wrote this book, what was really on his mind was his next book. The section on potatoes is essentially a short verse of the Omnivore's Dilemma. In the Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan seemed more enthusiastic about the material and more concerned with the topic (not that he isn't here, but he really hits his stride there). "

The last section, that explains the practice and risks of mono-culture and the processes of genetics manipulation employed by large corporations (e.g. Monsanto) were fascinating and scaring at the same time.3.5 stars rounded down because I found the repetition of the Apollo-Dionysus metaphor annoying and pompous in its tone.Fav.

Those plants then (over generations) alter their genetics to transform themselves into even more desirable individuals of their species. The human benefit is obvious, but the plant also benefits because humans cultivate many times more of that species of plant than would ever occur naturally.The history and the science fascinated me, but I felt that some of the book was a bit repetitive and in a few places difficult to follow the flow and narrative."
78,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2163177-kishor,5,"Mr Pollan uses The Botany of Desire to posit that the nature of our relationship with plants is a lot more nuanced than it seems at first glance. While we may have succeeded in domesticating a large number of photosynthetic species, they in turn are exerting various influences on mankind. In the process of regaling us with stories of four specific plants, he manages to lay a wealth of information on the reader. The four plants are the apple (symbolizing sweetness), the tulip (beauty), marijuana (intoxication), and the potato (control).Here are some interesting things I learnt about each of them:Apple trees grown from seed produce really bitter fruit; grafting allows the cloning of trees with good fruit at the cost of loss of genetic diversity. Produce from the former type of tree was (and is?) primarily used for producing cider and applejack; Johnny ""Appleseed"" Chapman, it turns out, was responsible for keeping the American frontier well lubricated with spirits.The tulip flower is colored by two chemicals; a base layer of pigment and another (anthocyanin) on top. Famous beauties amongst the tulip family (check out the Semper Augustus, it's *amazing*) are patterned due to the activity of a virus that causes the anthocyanin to degrade, allowing the base layer to be seen. The author draws on Apollo and Dionysus heavily in this chapter, contrasting the Apollonian austerity and order of the tulip with the Dionysian seduction of other flowers like the peony and the rose.The marijuana plant diverged at some point in history to grow as two different varieties - the indica strain is much more potent and can withstand frost, while the sativa strain gives the consumer a ""clear, bell-like high"" but requires equatorial climes to grow. Growers have hybridized the two, thereby combining their strengths and downplaying their weaknesses. An interesting point that Michael brings up in this section is that humanity is constantly seeking out ways to alter its state of consciousness; in fact, this is a thing we do even as children, be it by consuming sugary snacks, spinning around fast until dizziness causes visual hallucinations, holding our breath until we spots, and so on. Adults do this too, through the mechanisms of ""meditation, fasting, exercise, amusement park rides, ..., music, eating spicy foods"", etc. The human body has its own cannabinoid system, and produces a THC-like neurotransmitter named ""anandamide"" by the discoverer; the name stems from ""ananda"", the Sanskrit word for bliss.He uses his section on the potato to talk about genetic engineering, again weaving a narrative of Apollonian order vs Dionysian wildness. Mr Pollan planted in his garden the potato known as the NewLeaf, engineered by the Monsanto corporation, producing its own insecticide in its leaves. While this helps fight the evil Colorado potato beetle and saves farmers from having to coat their fields with nasty chemicals, it means that agriculture is moving towards a monoculture and a subsequent loss of biodiversity. The organic farmer who seeds their fields with a variety of crop, however, doesn't care about the susceptibilities of any one plant; the overall crop is always (barring bizarre tornadoes, I mean) guaranteed to do fine.All this plant talk makes me want to take up gardening!"
79,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"This is another time where I've read a book and only come back to write the review many, many, many months later. In this case, I read the book (listened to the Audible, technically) back in March 2017 and now I'm reviewing it in January 2018. The reason it's taken so long is that I flagged several passages for transcription into my notes, and I only just now got around to doing it. (19 notes in an hour is actually pretty good for me.)So I'll just have to leave you with some vague impressions.For one, Michael Pollan can write. I was struck--going through and transcribing some of my notes--once again by the variety and precision of his language. He is a really, really great writer. Quick sample:Imagine a moment when the sensation of honey or sugar on the tongue was an astonishment, a kind of intoxication. The closest I've ever come to recovering such a sense of sweetness was secondhand, though it left a powerful impression on me ever so. I'm thinking of my son's first experience of sugar: the icing on the cake at his first birthday. I have only the testimony of Isaac's face to go by (that, and his fierceness to repeat the experience), but it was plain that his first encounter with sugar had intoxicated him--was in fact an ecstasy, in the literal sense of the word. That is, he was beside himself with the pleasure of it, no longer her with me in space and time in quite the same way he had been just a moment before. Between bites Isaac gazed up at me in amazement (he was on my lap, and I was delivering the ambrosial forkfuls to his gaping mouth) as if to exclaim, ""Your world contains this? From this day forward I shall dedicate my life to it."" (Which he basically has done.) And I remember thinking, this is no minor desire, and then wondered: Could it be that sweetness is the prototype of all desire?I almost feel like this talent is lost on non-fiction. Why isn't Pollan writing novels?(Just went and checked. He hasn't written any. He did get both his BA and MA in English, though. So that goes some distance to explaining his writing chops.)The passage above is also a good example of Pollan's wide-ranging syntheses. He's very good at pulling from pretty disparate sources in surprising and illuminating ways.The most powerful passages of the book for me were the ones about Johnny Appleseed. I was really impressed by how Pollan was able to bring some historical weight along with almost mythic significance to the story, and was surprised again and again by what I learned about apples (along with, later, potatoes and tulips. Cannabis was less impressive.)I can see where critics can find fault with the book. Because it's a broad approach, it is also a little thin and shallow in spots. I'm fine with that. More often than not, the problem with 200-page popular science books is that they have way too little material and far too much padding. Although there are a few patchy spots, in general Pollan never runs out of ideas or material, and the book is satisfyingly compelling from page 1 on to the end."
80,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,4,"After reading The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals, I was determined to read more by Michael Pollan. It took me three years to get around to reading this book, but I'm glad I finally did. It's a bit more metaphysical than the other books I've read by him, but still very informative and interesting. I was fascinated by his exploration of the four different kinds of plants and the human desires sated by each. And I was amused by his continual revisitation of the Dionysus/Apollo metaphor throughout the book. interesting quotes:""So the question arose in my mind that day: Did I choose to plant these potatoes, or did the potato make me do it? In fact, both statements are true...Yet evolution consists of an infinitude of trivial, unconscious events, and in the evolution of the potato my reading of a particular seed catalog on a particular January evening counts as one of them."" (p. xv)""Domesticated species don't command our respect the way their wild cousins often do. Evolution may reward interdependence, but our thinking selves continue to prize self-reliance. The wolf is somehow more impressive than the dog. Yet there are fifty million dogs in America today, only ten thousand wolves. So what does the dog know about getting along in this world that its wild ancestor doesn't? The big thing the dog knows about-the subject matter it has mastered in the ten thousand years it has been evolving at our side-is us: our needs and desires, our emotions and values, all of which it has folded into its genes as part of a sophisticated strategy for survival."" (pp. xvi-xvii)""The four desires I explore here are sweetness, broadly defined, in the story of the apple;beauty in the tulip's;intoxication in the story of cannibis; and control in the story of the potato-specifically, in the story of a genetically altered potato I grew in my garden to see where the ancient arts of domestication may now be headed. (p. xviii)""Every wild apple shrub excites our expectations thus,"" Thoreau wrote, ""somewhat as every wild child. It is, perhaps, a prince in disguise. What a lesson to man!...Poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures, and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men."" (p. 45)""Symmetry is an unmistakable sign that there's relevant information in a place. That's because symmetry is a property shared by a relatively small number of things in the landscape, all of them of keen interest to us. The shortlist of nature's symmetricals includes other creatures, other people (most notably the faces of other people), human artifacts, and plants--but especially flowers. Symmetry is also a sign of health in a creature, since mutations and environmental stresses can easily disturb it. So paying attention to symmetrical things makes good sense: symmetry is usually significant."" (p. 76)""Though we self-importantly regard domestication as something people have done to plants, it is at the same time a strategy by which the plants have exploited us and our desires--even our most idiosyncratic notions of beauty--to advance their own interests. Depending on the environment in which a species finds itself, different adaptations will avail. Mutations that nature would have rejected out of hand in the wild sometimes prove to be brilliant adaptations in an environment that's been shaped by human desire."" (p. 81)""Although by any conventional measure it is folly to pay thousands for a tulip bulb (or for that matter an Internet stock), as long as there is an even greater fool out there willing to pay even more, doing so is the most logical thing in the world."" (p. 103)""Yet this new biotechnology has overthrown the old rules governing the relationship of nature and culture in a plant. Domestication has never been a simple one-way process in which our species has controlled others; other species participate only so far as their interests are served, and many plants (such as the oak) simply sit the whole game out. That game is the one Darwin called 'artificial selection,' and its rules have never been any different from the ones that govern natural selection. The plant in its wildness proposes new qualities, and then man (or, in the case of natural selection, nature) selects which of those qualities will survive and prosper. But about one rule Darwin was emphatic; as he wrote in The Origin of Species, 'Man does not actually produce variability.' Now he does."" (p. 196)""Yet for reasons we don't completely understand, distinct species do exist in nature, and they exhibit a certain genetic integrity--sex between them, when it does occur, doesn't produce fertile offspring. Nature presumably has some reason for erecting these walls, even if they are permeable on occasion. Perhaps, as some biologists believe, the purpose of keeping species separate is to put barriers in the path of pathogens, to contain their damage so that a single germ can't wipe out life on Earth at a stroke."" (pp. 196-197)""This is, of course, how chemical companies have always handled the problem of pest resistance: by simply introducing a new and improved pesticide every few years. With any luck, the effectiveness of the last one will expire around the same time its patent does."" (p. 215)""As much as I love the firm grasp and cerebral order of spring, there's a ripe, almost sensual pleasure in its August abandonment, too.""

He is an incredibly gifted non-fiction writer whose first-person style makes his work as readable as it is educational. This book personifies the foods described and paints them as our partners in consumption and in life."
84,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,5,"Michael Pollan is swiftly solidifying his position as ""somebody I want to know."" He's a clever writer, an inquisitive journalist, and a creative storyteller, as well as a shining light of simple food consciousness in an era of either not asking at all or asking far too much.This book is equal parts natural history, social history, regular history, botanical musing, plant biology, evolutionary theory, and psychology, with a smattering of classical mythology, memoir, neuroscience, and investigative journalism to hold the threads together. Pollan sets out with the aim of tracking four plants along their coevolution with society, tying each to a human desire that shaped it into what it is today: the apple and sweetness, the tulip and beauty, marijuana and intoxication, and potatoes and control. What he ends up writing from this neat little package of a thesis is something much greater than the sum of its parts, a veritable exploration (I use the word a lot but I think it really applies here) of what it means to be human in a determinedly natural world. One of the ideas he returns to often is that our relationship to the natural world is a balancing of Apollonian (controlled, geometric, structured, artificial) and Dionysian (frenetic, shifting, chaotic, and natural) forces, and I think he really hit the nail on the head with the notion as much as with the conclusion that it's a much more complicated relationship than it first appears. The complexity of the question is due in part to the many human urges (such as morality) that don't fit cleanly in either camp, and in part to the ambiguity of the agent in control within the framework of nature's chaos. It's an impressively thoughtful approach, and the broad reach allowed by a philosophical, as opposed to purely scientific, foundation means the reader gets to learn a little about a lot along the way.I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by divulging details of HOW each plant and desire is examined, but I will assure you that the how is not as straightforward and easy as you'd expect. This is becoming a mark of Pollan's writing as much as it always has been a hallmark of great writing: a clear and simple idea considered with breadth and depth in a manner so well-organized that you don't realize how much you're learning until you're done. I cannot wait to read more of his work."
85,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196103-jenn,3,"I thought this was an interesting but long winded book. The author discusses 4 different plants and how they have 'coevolved' with humans to reap the benefits of human interaction. It is best summed up in one of the first chapters of the book as the author ponders if he planted potatoes in his garden out of his own accord of did the potatoes, by virtue of their deliciousness, pursuade him to plant them?One of the main things I learned from this book is the value of diversity. From the loss of heritage apple varieties due to the desire for sickly sweet varieties to the monsanto NewLeaf potatoes that are themselves registered with the EPA as a pesticide i was introduced to this monoculture idea that I didnt know existed. I was shocked to learn about the stringent potato requirements of the fast food industry - only 1 type of potato without blemish is acceptable for french fry production. With the razor slim profit margins of farming a farmer selling to these companies nearly HAS to use GMO crops and/or huge amounts of pesticides to make ends meet.This definitely changed the way I think about organic vs non organic foods. I used to think buying non-organic potatoes was alright, but faced with the fact of what could potentially be in them (one of the potato farmers wouldnt even eat the potatoes he grew) i now feel that i really need to buy local and or organic for the sake of my health."
86,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914674-isis,5,"I liked this book even better than The Omnivore's Dilemma. When you strip aside the somewhat heavy-handed Apollo vs. Dionysus metaphor and the provocative subtitle that suggests that it's plants, not people, who invented agriculture -- that we're essentially only sophisticated bees -- you get a fascinating set of histories of four very interesting plants: apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes. And yes, they co-evolved with people, but that's really nothing surprising or shocking. But it is both entertaining and educational, written well and read (in the audio edition I listened to) superbly.Pollan takes a vast road-trip through history, and although it seems like a pleasantly meandering journey, it's actually quite focused and organized. In the chapter on apples we learn of the real Johnny Appleseed, and of the concept of sweetness, and of how Prohibition changed apple marketing for good. The tulip chapter touches on not only the (obvious) tulip mania speculative bubble, but also on the genetics of tulips and the virus that affected them, and on the idea of floral beauty in different cultures. And so on. There is a bit of moralizing: the drug war comes in for some criticism, and monoculture is reviled as the root of all of industrial agriculture's evil. But I don't disagree with these points!"
87,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431129-brian,4,"By the end of this book, I really wanted to have Michael Pollan's life, more or less. Though I'd settle for a nice house somewhere where I can have a big garden with all types of plants like his; that was the main attraction, along with the requisite knowledge and experience of nature itself and the nature of how things grow, in a word. As noble as it sounds in theory for man to be in harmony with nature, it becomes clear by his summation in the epilogue that it's nothing less than quite practical. But most of all, it's rewarding.Part of why I must feel this even stronger pull towards plants after finishing was that I think the order of the chapters was well-chosen. The themes on which he hit were introduced best with the apple and finished best with the potato, though I would have to call cannabis and potato my two favorite chapters. Loading up on everything else before you see the contrast of commercial Monsanto-controlled potato farming in Idaho with Michael Pollan's own backyard, you're smart and informed enough on the subject to feel passionate about cultivating a more symbiotic relationship with your environment. Again, which is why I want a nice house with a big garden even more now. "

Rather than us manipulating the traits of our crops, we've been manipulated by them!Though I disagree with this premise (you can never determine an evolutionary reason for something, and it's hardly parsimonious to think of organisms acting as agents of selection on our perceptions of them (and how does this translate to fitness?), leading to us selecting for desirable traits in those organisms), I loved tracing the history of 4 important plants (apple, potato, tulip, marijuana) and their interactions with humans."

Lots of face-palms.The musings on the effects of Marijuana is really uncomfortable.Pollan obviously wrote this chapter while high.He suggests that meditation can get you high like Marijuana, which just isn't true.He rambles on about spirituality, which is bizarre and metaphysical.The potato.Pollan shares with us his ignorance-fueled skepticism about GM crops.He states, falsely, that Monsanto has a patent on the BT gene.In fact, Monsanto's patents cover specific plant genomes with the BT gene inserted at a particular location.The difference being, Monsanto did not come up with the BT gene.What they rightfully call their intellectual property is the work of figuring out how to make the BT gene work inside each plant.Evil patents are no argument against GM crops than they are an argument against pharmaceuticals.His other argument is some philosophical nuance of object vs. subject.He seems to be putting forth an argument for purity.That intentional tampering directly with the genome is different and worse than using ""natural"" techniques like cloning, grafting, crossing, and other forms of artificial selection.Really, there's no functional difference between modifying the sequence of genes with one or another technique.Some techniques, like recombinant genetic engineering, offer more possibilities.Then, he whines about monoculture for a few dozen pages.This part sounds like it's right out of omnivore's dilemma.Apollonian verses Dionysian, blah, blah, blah.I wish Pollan would stick to the fascinating anecdotes."

He looks at these four plants from historical, political, and personal point of view. In many ways this is a fascinating account. For example the first one that goes into the tulip mania that the Dutch got into, which is both comic, and ridiculous at the same time, but of course if we look at the stock market in general, these sorts of things still take place, just in a slightly different way. Are the plants themselves passive victims in all of this or are they active participants is one of the more interesting question that he tries to answer in his book, but of course he can't really prove it one way or the other. Still, he does present the case for them being much more active members in this relationship so well that a question that might have seemed a little silly actually becomes an interesting one. There is one thing about Pollen's writing style, he does tend to take detours, in fact he takes quite a few one of those. This does make the book at times feel a little unfocused, but still it never really got uninteresting, even despite that. I actually got quite a bit of enjoyment out of this read. And I gained some inside into this subject. One can't really ask much more out of a nonfiction book, so I think I may read something else by him. "
94,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"Wonderful, wonderful book, full of fantastic info and insights. My main critique is Pollan's main conceit, and the language used to express it: plant species have domesticated humanity just as much as humanity has domesticated them. My problem is his constant insertion of agency into the process of evolution and mixing metaphors of individuals and of species. Flowers are not individually clever, and neither are species of flowers. Flowers do not manipulate bees in the same way that a botanist manipulates a flower species through artificial selection or genetic modification. Species do not have agency, the will to act. Only individuals have that, and individuals bees, potatoes, or water buffalo do not (to our knowledge), willfully offer themselves up as partners to humanity.Pollan draws an interesting distinction that I haven't encountered in my amateur meanderings between ""wilderness"" and ""wildness."" He uses ""wilderness"" in the sense of the Wilderness Act of 1964, ""an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."" ""Wildness,"" on the other hand, is anything that humans cannot control. As Bill McKibben famously pointed out, the atmosphere of our planet is no longer a wilderness, tainted as it is by the byproducts of our industry, but as every hurricane and tornado reminds us, it is still profoundly wild.Pollan uses this distinction to emphasize that while all domestication is a destruction of wilderness, it is almost never an abolition of wildness. The gardener uses his sense of order not to control his plants absolutely, but to guide and shape their wildness in certain ways. He goes on to suggest that genetic engineering may violate this pact, that by attempting to guide evolution on such a basic level is a powerful new way to write wildness out of the equation. He also offers the counterpoint that current techniques for gene insertion are (sometimes literally) so scattershot as to yield results that are even less predictable that conventional breeding.The topic of wilderness feeds into another interesting point, which is that ""memory is the enemy of wonder"" (168). He argues that cannabinoids like THC help us experience awe and wonder by forcing constant short term memory loss, and that meditation or physical exertion probably induce the same effect, making the view from a mountain peak infinitely more profound after having hiked to it instead of having driven.Another insight he had about marijuana is that drugs could be considered the mutagens of culture. If one assumes a meme is like a gene, then a culture is like a genome. Memes are constantly recombining through thought and discourse (intercourse in both culture and biology), but genuinely new ideas are rare. At the risk of spreading a metaphor too thin, Pollan suggests that drugs could be thought of as mutagens, radiation nuking the genetic fundaments of culture, producing mostly irrelevant or deleterious nonsense, but now and again creating viable gems (149). Kind of a fun thought."

Being a little self-reliant in these unsettling times gives me a sense of stability and hope.In this book, Pollan takes a look at four plants and relates them to human desires, I think . . . He starts things off with the apple and goes into a bit of long-winded ramble about Johnny Appleseed's quest to sell his trees to pioneers and his lust for a 10 year old bride (fortunately this bit wasn't dug into with any sort of detail). Johnny's enthusiasm for the apple and his desire to plant the seed (and refusal to graft) results in the many varieties that adapted to new climates. Though I'm learning a lot about Johnny here, I'd rather have more factoids about the apple. I'm hoping the following chapters are more interesting because I find my mind wandering more than usual while listening to this.I've now finished up the tulip section and made it about halfway through the marijuana chapter but, at this point, I have come to the realization that this book just doesn't interest me. It's very repetitive and meandering. I'll finish it up and hope the potato's treatment can grab me enough to get through it.Later: I finished up and did find the potato section much more interesting but that's because I'm always interested in GMO foods, the science, the corruption, the danger to our society, the greed . . . I didn't really learn anything new as this was written quite a few years ago but it still captured my attention all the same. "
96,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/610744-luke,3,"The Botany of Desire was written in language that made it obvious that Michael Pollan likes to hear himself write. His ideas were interesting, following four plants, the potato, cannabis, the apple, and the tulip through their journey with mankind. I like how he approaches the topic, observing not only what people have done to the plants to develop them to our own use, but also how the plants have in some ways used us for their own ends. It is true that we, while we think we are masters of our own destinies, are intimately tied to the world around us. there is an ecological cause and effect that often escapes us because of our anthropogenic perspective. My argument with the book is that Pollan overuses imagery from Greek mythology and as a result becomes tedious to read in some sections. By far the most interesting is the last section on the interaction between humanity and the potato. "

98,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6894205-allie,2,"Do you talk to your plants? More to the point, do you think your plants talk back to you? If so, I have just the book for you…The Botany of Desire explores the relationship between plants and humans, but rather than focusing on human agency, food journalist and gardener Michael Pollan tells the story from the plants’ point of view. He takes the idea of co-evolution as his starting point: the idea that two species evolve in a mutually dependent manner leading to the selection of certain traits. Pollan attempts to apply this evolutionary concept to human interactions with plants.* 
""Plants hit on a remarkably clever strategy: getting us to move or think for them…it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees.""
Reading this book was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope; the perspective felt distorted. I was not persuaded that Pollan completely understood some of the scientific concepts that he was trying to explain. It all felt a little…Gladwell-esque. Pollan tries to illustrate the intertwined evolutionary relationship between plants and humans by telling the story of four plants and the desires that they satisfy. Sweetness: the first section focused on apples and the story of John Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed). Pollan dedicates many, many pages to Chapman’s life and his ‘Dionysian’ apple planting efforts, which allowed homesteaders to get reliably drunk on alcoholic cider. (Inspired by this chapter, I created a drinking game where I had a sip of scotch every time Pollan mentioned Dionysus or Apollo. I was forced to abandon this delightful crutch since there were so many references to both gods, I was getting woozy.) Beauty: the second section covered the speculative boom and bust around tulip mania in Holland, with some random thoughts about flowers throughout history and some general ideas around beauty (e.g., symmetry is appealing as a proxy for good health). There were a lot of opinion-led statements such as 
“beauty always takes place in the particular”
 that didn’t resonate with me; I find the ocean more beautiful in its entirety than a solitary wave. Intoxication: by far the most interesting, the third section discussed how humans seek intoxication through plants, which produce stimulants like caffeine, nicotine, THC, and hallucinogens. There is some fascinating published research about these drugs, but Pollan spirals away from the science to speculate on how THC mediates consciousness and can enhance creativity by blunting memory and creating the perception of heightened senses. (Huxley is referenced, which is never a good sign. Also, you can apparently get high from hallucinogens secreted by some toads.) Control over the natural environment: the final section is all about the humble potato, from the diverse varieties grown by the Aztecs to the Irish famine to Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potatoes. Pollan is in his element here as a food journalist, talking to scientists about gene transfer and farmers about the impact of GMO potatoes on their livelihoods. This section raised interesting concerns about the unintended consequences of tinkering with the plant genome since genes can “jump” to other plants via cross-pollination and their impact on the rest of the food chain is unknown.Perhaps if Pollan had focused on just one of the four desires, it would have been a more cohesive reading experience. But while there are interesting facts peppered throughout each chapter, the book attempts to cover so many different ideas that are only tangentially related, there was no space for thoughtful analysis. After finishing the book, I’m still not convinced by the author’s premise that: 
""Desire might be too strong a word for whatever it is that drives plants to reinvent themselves so that we might do their bidding, but then, our own designs have often been no more willful than the plants.""
Honestly, finishing this book was a Herculean task; only my determination not to disappoint my friend Scot who was reading the book with me enabled me to climb this metaphorical Mount Olympus. (Where, I should note, I looked down at all the plants from my lofty perch. Not a toad in sight up here!) It’s a shame, because Pollan writes beautifully, and could probably be very compelling if he was covering a topic where he has more expertise.*This is a established concept in biology applied to relationships between plants and pollinating insects or animals; predators and prey; pathogens and humans; and some domesticated animals (like dogs) and humans. The idea that plants and humans have a co-evolutionary relationship does not seem to be well-supported in the scientific literature. I mean, it’s not as far out there as the people who claim plants are silently screaming when we cut them down, but it’s pretty fringe."

101,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558460-caterina,4,"What if we humans are being manipulated by plants to serve their desires? From this slightly creepy flipped perspective, masterful storyteller Michael Pollan illuminates the crazy and complex interdependency of living things -- and also, some of the dangers we inflict on ourselves and our entire world by contemporary agricultural practices -- through four stories - and what stories! -- of the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. (Ok, he admits the conceit of manipulative plants to be a bit of a stretch -- but it's a fascinating way to see how we and our favorite foods, flowers, and intoxicants are, for better or worse, co-evolving.)Biggest surprise of the book - the potato's story turned out to be the most interesting and important (really, after marijuana?) and the best showcase of Pollan's skills as an investigative journalist/interviewer and experimental gardener. Who knew, for example, that Monsanto scientists created genetically engineered potato plants with a ""gene gun"" that uses a .22 shell to fire DNA-coated stainless steel projectiles into potato leaves in the hope that some of the alien DNA (from some non-potato species) combine with the plant's own DNA? Unless, as a Yankee from Connecticut, Pollan was being set up for a huge Southern joke -- which seems to me a distinct possibility -- this actually happened at the Monsanto lab he visited in Missouri. But possible joke aside, this story contained the most intelligent and nuanced discussion of genetic modification of foods that I've ever seen, with input from numerous scientists and farmers, as well as exploring the advantages and dangers of monoculture and colonial commodity agriculture (and some of its horrific history), chemical versus organic agriculture, and the effects of food culture on farming. Also, Michael Pollan clearly just loves to grow and eat potatoes -- it may be his relish that gave this story its extra glow. (Without ever mentioning vodka.)I also especially loved the apple's story, with the mysterious Dionysian and yet somehow pure, childlike figure of Johnny Appleseed spreading seeds -- not for nice wholesome lunchbox treats but for alcohol, and plenty of it, in the wilds of Pennsylvania and Ohio. (The woods I played in, growing up in southwestern Pennsylvania, were full of abandoned and decrepit old apple trees -- I had no idea of their history.) As this book came out in 2001 the MJ story was a bit dated, and although it focused on why the plant was so strongly prohibited, it never mentioned what I understand to be the two biggest reasons -- racism/anti-Mexican sentiment, and pressure by the American pharmaceutical industry. Nor does the current battle between states and federal government come up (which maybe echoes historic battles over hard cider and whiskey). Nevertheless, all four stories are surprising and fascinating, combining investigative journalism (involving quite a bit of travel), personal experimentation, and a good dose of wild imaginative speculation -- sometimes fueled by that experimentation."
102,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666,4,"Michael Pollan's book is certainly an interesting one. It germinates (pun intended) in Pollan's mind, one day, as he was working in his garden. He thought what if human beings were similar to bumblebees? It is an interesting take on ""coevolution"", which stipulates that two parties can act on each other to advance their individual interests but end up producing a mutually beneficial outcome.What if plants were able to develop traits that would cause other animals to help them in their goal to reproduce? As plants are immobile, they tend to rely on wind and rain to spread their pollen. But with the evolution of angiosperms, plants with flowers and seeds, animals had a new reason to eat those plants and they spread the seeds for the plant, or pollen in the case of the bee.He then stipulates that the four plants he covers have also evolved in such a way as to appeal to the human animal and, by doing so, have been able to spread their seed all across the world. The four plants he looks at are perfect examples of how they have managed to ""attract"" human beings. Pollan also links each of these plants to a specific desire. They are as follows:The apple, which utilizes the sense of sweetness.The Tulip, which utilizes the sense of beauty.The potato, which utilizes the sense of control.The marijuana plant, which utilizes the sense of intoxication.Each of these plants gets a detailed history. You will learn where they came from, how they were modified and how they entered into the human world. The stories are interesting, though I could have done with less of the personal ruminations, it is the history and the science behind these four plants that make this an interesting book to read.It is hardly overly technical and quite easy for a science dunce to comprehend. If you are looking for something more science-heavy, I'd pass on this. This is a book that tells the tale of science through the prism of human desire. Pollan does a good job of explaining things like the Diyonisian concepts and how they melded into how humans view intoxication and their views on marijuana.An interesting book that will make you think and while not science-heavy, this is a book that will interest science and non-science people alike. Interesting anecdotes and some cool history make this a rather unique book."

I mean, I want to know about Michael Pollan, he is huge and important, right? And everybody in Berkeley wants him to be Obama's Secretary of Agriculture. (Though I guess I haven't read Obama's books, so.) I liked it! I was kind of surprised, I think I was expecting something dryer. Mostly it was just this pretty smart guy talking about stuff he likes: natural selection, Johnny Appleseed, weed stories, people, Dionysus, bugs and genetically modified foods. I thought it was pretty great how in the beginning he was like, Here are four things I'm going to talk about, but then he didn't tell you what he was gonna say about 'em- like, you know the last chapter's gonna be about potatoes, but you don't know that it's going to be a conversation about the safety of genetically modified potatoes. And dude loves his plants, which is nice. It felt pretty repetitive at times, just saying the same stuff over and over, and that definitely got boring, but whatever. I was sucked in enough to bust through it between bouts of neck-pain sleep on planes and buses and trains while I was on the east coast for three days, which is more than I can say for bell hooks, who's all writing stuff I have to pay attention to and think critically about.

104,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,3,"An earlier Pollan book, and a bestseller. Like the later, better, books, Botany explores its thesis, that the plants co-evolve with us, in four sections. There is some fluff here; the best section is easily on the one on intoxication. Doubters should read the introduction and skip to section 3.Pollan's best stuff always makes me see the world differently, and this passage changed the way I conceived of gardens, what they are, and what they could be:""I sometimes think we've allowed our gardens to be bowdlerized, that the full range of their powers and possibilities has been sacrificed to a cult of plant prettiness that obscures more dubious truths about nature, our own included. It hasn't always been this way, and we may someday come to regard the contemporary garden of vegetables and flowers as a place almost Victorian in its repressions and elisions.""He goes on to discuss a witch's garden, which included intoxicants and medicines, rather than just beautiful flowers. He argues that when the church murdered witches, they converted the contents of these gardens from taboo objects to medicines made acceptable by what we'd now call physicians. I'm sure I'm bastardizing the argument, but it was interesting. Great chapter.And here is one on what might be Pollan's greatest weakness as a reporter but what is also his greatest strength as a writer: ""I am literally absentminded, prone to be thinking about something else, something past, when I am ostensibly having a fresh experience.""Of the other chapters, the best is on potatoes, and the other two are about apples and tulips.As for the books, I still rate Omnivore, Cooked, and A Place of My Own ahead of this one, but if you broke it down to chapters, Botany's chapter on intoxication would jump ahead to the top five Pollan chapters, alongside the Omnivore stuff and Cooked's chapter on fermented foods."
105,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Not as good as the Omnivore's Dilemma, but definitely worth a read if you love thinking about plants as much as I do.The first section, on apples, was really dry (to me). Actually, it's less about apples and more about John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) and I just... don't... care about him. Right, great, he planted lots of apples, we get it, he's a hometown hero. The rest is pretty well done, though. I especially loved the section on cannabis. I harbour a lot of curiosity as to how psychotropic plants and humans have co-evolved, and why exactly certain plants have developed those mechanisms, and how we humans came to have a neurology that happened to respond to those plants' chemicals. So that was extremely engrossing.Tulips also held my interest pretty aggressively, for similar reasons. The subject of why we even like and are drawn to things as seemingly useless (evolutionarily speaking) as flowers is fascinating. It's much easier to know without having to read a book that apples or potatoes and humans have fed off one another in time. Tulips are a little bit more intriguing.I like Pollan's dry humour but also his rich curiosity, but I suspect that when he wrote this book, what was really on his mind was his next book. The section on potatoes is essentially a short verse of the Omnivore's Dilemma. In the Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan seemed more enthusiastic about the material and more concerned with the topic (not that he isn't here, but he really hits his stride there). "

I personally liked the sections on apple and potatoes, while I found the tulip and marijuana chapters less engaging. The last section, that explains the practice and risks of mono-culture and the processes of genetics manipulation employed by large corporations (e.g. Monsanto) were fascinating and scaring at the same time.3.5 stars rounded down because I found the repetition of the Apollo-Dionysus metaphor annoying and pompous in its tone.Fav.

It seems that by the time the singular beauty of a flower in bloom can no longer pierce the veil of black or obsessive thoughts in a person’s mind, that mind’s connection to the sensual world has grown dangerously frayed.

Those plants then (over generations) alter their genetics to transform themselves into even more desirable individuals of their species. The human benefit is obvious, but the plant also benefits because humans cultivate many times more of that species of plant than would ever occur naturally.The history and the science fascinated me, but I felt that some of the book was a bit repetitive and in a few places difficult to follow the flow and narrative."
108,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2163177-kishor,5,"Mr Pollan uses The Botany of Desire to posit that the nature of our relationship with plants is a lot more nuanced than it seems at first glance. While we may have succeeded in domesticating a large number of photosynthetic species, they in turn are exerting various influences on mankind. In the process of regaling us with stories of four specific plants, he manages to lay a wealth of information on the reader. The four plants are the apple (symbolizing sweetness), the tulip (beauty), marijuana (intoxication), and the potato (control).Here are some interesting things I learnt about each of them:Apple trees grown from seed produce really bitter fruit; grafting allows the cloning of trees with good fruit at the cost of loss of genetic diversity. Produce from the former type of tree was (and is?) primarily used for producing cider and applejack; Johnny ""Appleseed"" Chapman, it turns out, was responsible for keeping the American frontier well lubricated with spirits.The tulip flower is colored by two chemicals; a base layer of pigment and another (anthocyanin) on top. Famous beauties amongst the tulip family (check out the Semper Augustus, it's *amazing*) are patterned due to the activity of a virus that causes the anthocyanin to degrade, allowing the base layer to be seen. The author draws on Apollo and Dionysus heavily in this chapter, contrasting the Apollonian austerity and order of the tulip with the Dionysian seduction of other flowers like the peony and the rose.The marijuana plant diverged at some point in history to grow as two different varieties - the indica strain is much more potent and can withstand frost, while the sativa strain gives the consumer a ""clear, bell-like high"" but requires equatorial climes to grow. Growers have hybridized the two, thereby combining their strengths and downplaying their weaknesses. An interesting point that Michael brings up in this section is that humanity is constantly seeking out ways to alter its state of consciousness; in fact, this is a thing we do even as children, be it by consuming sugary snacks, spinning around fast until dizziness causes visual hallucinations, holding our breath until we spots, and so on. Adults do this too, through the mechanisms of ""meditation, fasting, exercise, amusement park rides, ..., music, eating spicy foods"", etc. The human body has its own cannabinoid system, and produces a THC-like neurotransmitter named ""anandamide"" by the discoverer; the name stems from ""ananda"", the Sanskrit word for bliss.He uses his section on the potato to talk about genetic engineering, again weaving a narrative of Apollonian order vs Dionysian wildness. Mr Pollan planted in his garden the potato known as the NewLeaf, engineered by the Monsanto corporation, producing its own insecticide in its leaves. While this helps fight the evil Colorado potato beetle and saves farmers from having to coat their fields with nasty chemicals, it means that agriculture is moving towards a monoculture and a subsequent loss of biodiversity. The organic farmer who seeds their fields with a variety of crop, however, doesn't care about the susceptibilities of any one plant; the overall crop is always (barring bizarre tornadoes, I mean) guaranteed to do fine.All this plant talk makes me want to take up gardening!"
109,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"This is another time where I've read a book and only come back to write the review many, many, many months later. In this case, I read the book (listened to the Audible, technically) back in March 2017 and now I'm reviewing it in January 2018. The reason it's taken so long is that I flagged several passages for transcription into my notes, and I only just now got around to doing it. (19 notes in an hour is actually pretty good for me.)So I'll just have to leave you with some vague impressions.For one, Michael Pollan can write. I was struck--going through and transcribing some of my notes--once again by the variety and precision of his language. He is a really, really great writer. Quick sample:Imagine a moment when the sensation of honey or sugar on the tongue was an astonishment, a kind of intoxication. The closest I've ever come to recovering such a sense of sweetness was secondhand, though it left a powerful impression on me ever so. I'm thinking of my son's first experience of sugar: the icing on the cake at his first birthday. I have only the testimony of Isaac's face to go by (that, and his fierceness to repeat the experience), but it was plain that his first encounter with sugar had intoxicated him--was in fact an ecstasy, in the literal sense of the word. That is, he was beside himself with the pleasure of it, no longer her with me in space and time in quite the same way he had been just a moment before. Between bites Isaac gazed up at me in amazement (he was on my lap, and I was delivering the ambrosial forkfuls to his gaping mouth) as if to exclaim, ""Your world contains this? From this day forward I shall dedicate my life to it."" (Which he basically has done.) And I remember thinking, this is no minor desire, and then wondered: Could it be that sweetness is the prototype of all desire?I almost feel like this talent is lost on non-fiction. Why isn't Pollan writing novels?(Just went and checked. He hasn't written any. He did get both his BA and MA in English, though. So that goes some distance to explaining his writing chops.)The passage above is also a good example of Pollan's wide-ranging syntheses. He's very good at pulling from pretty disparate sources in surprising and illuminating ways.The most powerful passages of the book for me were the ones about Johnny Appleseed. I was really impressed by how Pollan was able to bring some historical weight along with almost mythic significance to the story, and was surprised again and again by what I learned about apples (along with, later, potatoes and tulips. Cannabis was less impressive.)I can see where critics can find fault with the book. Because it's a broad approach, it is also a little thin and shallow in spots. I'm fine with that. More often than not, the problem with 200-page popular science books is that they have way too little material and far too much padding. Although there are a few patchy spots, in general Pollan never runs out of ideas or material, and the book is satisfyingly compelling from page 1 on to the end."

It took me three years to get around to reading this book, but I'm glad I finally did. It's a bit more metaphysical than the other books I've read by him, but still very informative and interesting. I was fascinated by his exploration of the four different kinds of plants and the human desires sated by each. And I was amused by his continual revisitation of the Dionysus/Apollo metaphor throughout the book. interesting quotes:""So the question arose in my mind that day: Did I choose to plant these potatoes, or did the potato make me do it? In fact, both statements are true...Yet evolution consists of an infinitude of trivial, unconscious events, and in the evolution of the potato my reading of a particular seed catalog on a particular January evening counts as one of them."" (p. xv)""Domesticated species don't command our respect the way their wild cousins often do. Evolution may reward interdependence, but our thinking selves continue to prize self-reliance. The wolf is somehow more impressive than the dog. Yet there are fifty million dogs in America today, only ten thousand wolves. So what does the dog know about getting along in this world that its wild ancestor doesn't? The big thing the dog knows about-the subject matter it has mastered in the ten thousand years it has been evolving at our side-is us: our needs and desires, our emotions and values, all of which it has folded into its genes as part of a sophisticated strategy for survival."" (pp. xvi-xvii)""The four desires I explore here are sweetness, broadly defined, in the story of the apple;beauty in the tulip's;intoxication in the story of cannibis; and control in the story of the potato-specifically, in the story of a genetically altered potato I grew in my garden to see where the ancient arts of domestication may now be headed. (p. xviii)""Every wild apple shrub excites our expectations thus,"" Thoreau wrote, ""somewhat as every wild child. It is, perhaps, a prince in disguise. What a lesson to man!...Poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures, and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men."" (p. 45)""Symmetry is an unmistakable sign that there's relevant information in a place. That's because symmetry is a property shared by a relatively small number of things in the landscape, all of them of keen interest to us. The shortlist of nature's symmetricals includes other creatures, other people (most notably the faces of other people), human artifacts, and plants--but especially flowers. Symmetry is also a sign of health in a creature, since mutations and environmental stresses can easily disturb it. So paying attention to symmetrical things makes good sense: symmetry is usually significant."" (p. 76)""Though we self-importantly regard domestication as something people have done to plants, it is at the same time a strategy by which the plants have exploited us and our desires--even our most idiosyncratic notions of beauty--to advance their own interests. Depending on the environment in which a species finds itself, different adaptations will avail. Mutations that nature would have rejected out of hand in the wild sometimes prove to be brilliant adaptations in an environment that's been shaped by human desire."" (p. 81)""Although by any conventional measure it is folly to pay thousands for a tulip bulb (or for that matter an Internet stock), as long as there is an even greater fool out there willing to pay even more, doing so is the most logical thing in the world."" (p. 103)""Yet this new biotechnology has overthrown the old rules governing the relationship of nature and culture in a plant. Domestication has never been a simple one-way process in which our species has controlled others; other species participate only so far as their interests are served, and many plants (such as the oak) simply sit the whole game out. That game is the one Darwin called 'artificial selection,' and its rules have never been any different from the ones that govern natural selection. The plant in its wildness proposes new qualities, and then man (or, in the case of natural selection, nature) selects which of those qualities will survive and prosper. But about one rule Darwin was emphatic; as he wrote in The Origin of Species, 'Man does not actually produce variability.' Now he does."" (p. 196)""Yet for reasons we don't completely understand, distinct species do exist in nature, and they exhibit a certain genetic integrity--sex between them, when it does occur, doesn't produce fertile offspring. Nature presumably has some reason for erecting these walls, even if they are permeable on occasion. Perhaps, as some biologists believe, the purpose of keeping species separate is to put barriers in the path of pathogens, to contain their damage so that a single germ can't wipe out life on Earth at a stroke.""

112,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6879819-susan-defreitas,5,This book changed how I see plants and our relationship with them. I also now have an irrational desire to grow apple trees from seed and plant them everywhere. =)
113,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67444659-katie-hamilton,4,"Reading Pollan’s work feels like a conversation with him in the most casual setting, discussing science, while also chuckling every so often at his comments strategically placed in parentheses. He is an incredibly gifted non-fiction writer whose first-person style makes his work as readable as it is educational. This book personifies the foods described and paints them as our partners in consumption and in life."
114,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,5,"Michael Pollan is swiftly solidifying his position as ""somebody I want to know."" He's a clever writer, an inquisitive journalist, and a creative storyteller, as well as a shining light of simple food consciousness in an era of either not asking at all or asking far too much.This book is equal parts natural history, social history, regular history, botanical musing, plant biology, evolutionary theory, and psychology, with a smattering of classical mythology, memoir, neuroscience, and investigative journalism to hold the threads together. Pollan sets out with the aim of tracking four plants along their coevolution with society, tying each to a human desire that shaped it into what it is today: the apple and sweetness, the tulip and beauty, marijuana and intoxication, and potatoes and control. What he ends up writing from this neat little package of a thesis is something much greater than the sum of its parts, a veritable exploration (I use the word a lot but I think it really applies here) of what it means to be human in a determinedly natural world. One of the ideas he returns to often is that our relationship to the natural world is a balancing of Apollonian (controlled, geometric, structured, artificial) and Dionysian (frenetic, shifting, chaotic, and natural) forces, and I think he really hit the nail on the head with the notion as much as with the conclusion that it's a much more complicated relationship than it first appears. The complexity of the question is due in part to the many human urges (such as morality) that don't fit cleanly in either camp, and in part to the ambiguity of the agent in control within the framework of nature's chaos. It's an impressively thoughtful approach, and the broad reach allowed by a philosophical, as opposed to purely scientific, foundation means the reader gets to learn a little about a lot along the way.I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by divulging details of HOW each plant and desire is examined, but I will assure you that the how is not as straightforward and easy as you'd expect. This is becoming a mark of Pollan's writing as much as it always has been a hallmark of great writing: a clear and simple idea considered with breadth and depth in a manner so well-organized that you don't realize how much you're learning until you're done. I cannot wait to read more of his work."
115,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196103-jenn,3,"I thought this was an interesting but long winded book. The author discusses 4 different plants and how they have 'coevolved' with humans to reap the benefits of human interaction. It is best summed up in one of the first chapters of the book as the author ponders if he planted potatoes in his garden out of his own accord of did the potatoes, by virtue of their deliciousness, pursuade him to plant them?One of the main things I learned from this book is the value of diversity. From the loss of heritage apple varieties due to the desire for sickly sweet varieties to the monsanto NewLeaf potatoes that are themselves registered with the EPA as a pesticide i was introduced to this monoculture idea that I didnt know existed. I was shocked to learn about the stringent potato requirements of the fast food industry - only 1 type of potato without blemish is acceptable for french fry production. With the razor slim profit margins of farming a farmer selling to these companies nearly HAS to use GMO crops and/or huge amounts of pesticides to make ends meet.This definitely changed the way I think about organic vs non organic foods. I used to think buying non-organic potatoes was alright, but faced with the fact of what could potentially be in them (one of the potato farmers wouldnt even eat the potatoes he grew) i now feel that i really need to buy local and or organic for the sake of my health."
116,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914674-isis,5,"I liked this book even better than The Omnivore's Dilemma. When you strip aside the somewhat heavy-handed Apollo vs. Dionysus metaphor and the provocative subtitle that suggests that it's plants, not people, who invented agriculture -- that we're essentially only sophisticated bees -- you get a fascinating set of histories of four very interesting plants: apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes. And yes, they co-evolved with people, but that's really nothing surprising or shocking. But it is both entertaining and educational, written well and read (in the audio edition I listened to) superbly.Pollan takes a vast road-trip through history, and although it seems like a pleasantly meandering journey, it's actually quite focused and organized. In the chapter on apples we learn of the real Johnny Appleseed, and of the concept of sweetness, and of how Prohibition changed apple marketing for good. The tulip chapter touches on not only the (obvious) tulip mania speculative bubble, but also on the genetics of tulips and the virus that affected them, and on the idea of floral beauty in different cultures. And so on. There is a bit of moralizing: the drug war comes in for some criticism, and monoculture is reviled as the root of all of industrial agriculture's evil. But I don't disagree with these points!"
117,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431129-brian,4,"By the end of this book, I really wanted to have Michael Pollan's life, more or less. Though I'd settle for a nice house somewhere where I can have a big garden with all types of plants like his; that was the main attraction, along with the requisite knowledge and experience of nature itself and the nature of how things grow, in a word. As noble as it sounds in theory for man to be in harmony with nature, it becomes clear by his summation in the epilogue that it's nothing less than quite practical. But most of all, it's rewarding.Part of why I must feel this even stronger pull towards plants after finishing was that I think the order of the chapters was well-chosen. The themes on which he hit were introduced best with the apple and finished best with the potato, though I would have to call cannabis and potato my two favorite chapters. Loading up on everything else before you see the contrast of commercial Monsanto-controlled potato farming in Idaho with Michael Pollan's own backyard, you're smart and informed enough on the subject to feel passionate about cultivating a more symbiotic relationship with your environment. Again, which is why I want a nice house with a big garden even more now. "

Rather than us manipulating the traits of our crops, we've been manipulated by them!Though I disagree with this premise (you can never determine an evolutionary reason for something, and it's hardly parsimonious to think of organisms acting as agents of selection on our perceptions of them (and how does this translate to fitness?), leading to us selecting for desirable traits in those organisms), I loved tracing the history of 4 important plants (apple, potato, tulip, marijuana) and their interactions with humans."

Lots of face-palms.The musings on the effects of Marijuana is really uncomfortable.Pollan obviously wrote this chapter while high.He suggests that meditation can get you high like Marijuana, which just isn't true.He rambles on about spirituality, which is bizarre and metaphysical.The potato.Pollan shares with us his ignorance-fueled skepticism about GM crops.He states, falsely, that Monsanto has a patent on the BT gene.In fact, Monsanto's patents cover specific plant genomes with the BT gene inserted at a particular location.The difference being, Monsanto did not come up with the BT gene.What they rightfully call their intellectual property is the work of figuring out how to make the BT gene work inside each plant.Evil patents are no argument against GM crops than they are an argument against pharmaceuticals.His other argument is some philosophical nuance of object vs. subject.He seems to be putting forth an argument for purity.That intentional tampering directly with the genome is different and worse than using ""natural"" techniques like cloning, grafting, crossing, and other forms of artificial selection.Really, there's no functional difference between modifying the sequence of genes with one or another technique.Some techniques, like recombinant genetic engineering, offer more possibilities.Then, he whines about monoculture for a few dozen pages.This part sounds like it's right out of omnivore's dilemma.Apollonian verses Dionysian, blah, blah, blah.I wish Pollan would stick to the fascinating anecdotes."
123,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,4,"In The Botany of Desire Michael Pollan goes into our relationship with four plants: the tulip, marijuana, the apple, and the potato. He looks at these four plants from historical, political, and personal point of view. In many ways this is a fascinating account. For example the first one that goes into the tulip mania that the Dutch got into, which is both comic, and ridiculous at the same time, but of course if we look at the stock market in general, these sorts of things still take place, just in a slightly different way. Are the plants themselves passive victims in all of this or are they active participants is one of the more interesting question that he tries to answer in his book, but of course he can't really prove it one way or the other. Still, he does present the case for them being much more active members in this relationship so well that a question that might have seemed a little silly actually becomes an interesting one. There is one thing about Pollen's writing style, he does tend to take detours, in fact he takes quite a few one of those. This does make the book at times feel a little unfocused, but still it never really got uninteresting, even despite that. I actually got quite a bit of enjoyment out of this read. And I gained some inside into this subject. One can't really ask much more out of a nonfiction book, so I think I may read something else by him. "
124,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"Wonderful, wonderful book, full of fantastic info and insights. My main critique is Pollan's main conceit, and the language used to express it: plant species have domesticated humanity just as much as humanity has domesticated them. My problem is his constant insertion of agency into the process of evolution and mixing metaphors of individuals and of species. Flowers are not individually clever, and neither are species of flowers. Flowers do not manipulate bees in the same way that a botanist manipulates a flower species through artificial selection or genetic modification. Species do not have agency, the will to act. Only individuals have that, and individuals bees, potatoes, or water buffalo do not (to our knowledge), willfully offer themselves up as partners to humanity.Pollan draws an interesting distinction that I haven't encountered in my amateur meanderings between ""wilderness"" and ""wildness."" He uses ""wilderness"" in the sense of the Wilderness Act of 1964, ""an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."" ""Wildness,"" on the other hand, is anything that humans cannot control. As Bill McKibben famously pointed out, the atmosphere of our planet is no longer a wilderness, tainted as it is by the byproducts of our industry, but as every hurricane and tornado reminds us, it is still profoundly wild.Pollan uses this distinction to emphasize that while all domestication is a destruction of wilderness, it is almost never an abolition of wildness. The gardener uses his sense of order not to control his plants absolutely, but to guide and shape their wildness in certain ways. He goes on to suggest that genetic engineering may violate this pact, that by attempting to guide evolution on such a basic level is a powerful new way to write wildness out of the equation. He also offers the counterpoint that current techniques for gene insertion are (sometimes literally) so scattershot as to yield results that are even less predictable that conventional breeding.The topic of wilderness feeds into another interesting point, which is that ""memory is the enemy of wonder"" (168). He argues that cannabinoids like THC help us experience awe and wonder by forcing constant short term memory loss, and that meditation or physical exertion probably induce the same effect, making the view from a mountain peak infinitely more profound after having hiked to it instead of having driven.Another insight he had about marijuana is that drugs could be considered the mutagens of culture. If one assumes a meme is like a gene, then a culture is like a genome. Memes are constantly recombining through thought and discourse (intercourse in both culture and biology), but genuinely new ideas are rare. At the risk of spreading a metaphor too thin, Pollan suggests that drugs could be thought of as mutagens, radiation nuking the genetic fundaments of culture, producing mostly irrelevant or deleterious nonsense, but now and again creating viable gems (149). Kind of a fun thought."
125,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark,3,"This guy has inspired me to grow my own food and keep a few hens in the backyard. Being a little self-reliant in these unsettling times gives me a sense of stability and hope.In this book, Pollan takes a look at four plants and relates them to human desires, I think . . . He starts things off with the apple and goes into a bit of long-winded ramble about Johnny Appleseed's quest to sell his trees to pioneers and his lust for a 10 year old bride (fortunately this bit wasn't dug into with any sort of detail). Johnny's enthusiasm for the apple and his desire to plant the seed (and refusal to graft) results in the many varieties that adapted to new climates. Though I'm learning a lot about Johnny here, I'd rather have more factoids about the apple. I'm hoping the following chapters are more interesting because I find my mind wandering more than usual while listening to this.I've now finished up the tulip section and made it about halfway through the marijuana chapter but, at this point, I have come to the realization that this book just doesn't interest me. It's very repetitive and meandering. I'll finish it up and hope the potato's treatment can grab me enough to get through it.Later: I finished up and did find the potato section much more interesting but that's because I'm always interested in GMO foods, the science, the corruption, the danger to our society, the greed . . . I didn't really learn anything new as this was written quite a few years ago but it still captured my attention all the same. "
126,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/610744-luke,3,"The Botany of Desire was written in language that made it obvious that Michael Pollan likes to hear himself write. His ideas were interesting, following four plants, the potato, cannabis, the apple, and the tulip through their journey with mankind. I like how he approaches the topic, observing not only what people have done to the plants to develop them to our own use, but also how the plants have in some ways used us for their own ends. It is true that we, while we think we are masters of our own destinies, are intimately tied to the world around us. there is an ecological cause and effect that often escapes us because of our anthropogenic perspective. My argument with the book is that Pollan overuses imagery from Greek mythology and as a result becomes tedious to read in some sections. By far the most interesting is the last section on the interaction between humanity and the potato. "
127,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2967061-anne,4,"The same brilliant and creative thinking which I recall from my first read. The marijuana section is a bit dated at least in my state, CO, but otherwise, this book held up well."
128,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6894205-allie,2,"Do you talk to your plants? More to the point, do you think your plants talk back to you? If so, I have just the book for you…The Botany of Desire explores the relationship between plants and humans, but rather than focusing on human agency, food journalist and gardener Michael Pollan tells the story from the plants’ point of view. He takes the idea of co-evolution as his starting point: the idea that two species evolve in a mutually dependent manner leading to the selection of certain traits. Pollan attempts to apply this evolutionary concept to human interactions with plants.* 
""Plants hit on a remarkably clever strategy: getting us to move or think for them…it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees.""
Reading this book was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope; the perspective felt distorted. I was not persuaded that Pollan completely understood some of the scientific concepts that he was trying to explain. It all felt a little…Gladwell-esque. Pollan tries to illustrate the intertwined evolutionary relationship between plants and humans by telling the story of four plants and the desires that they satisfy. Sweetness: the first section focused on apples and the story of John Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed). Pollan dedicates many, many pages to Chapman’s life and his ‘Dionysian’ apple planting efforts, which allowed homesteaders to get reliably drunk on alcoholic cider. (Inspired by this chapter, I created a drinking game where I had a sip of scotch every time Pollan mentioned Dionysus or Apollo. I was forced to abandon this delightful crutch since there were so many references to both gods, I was getting woozy.) Beauty: the second section covered the speculative boom and bust around tulip mania in Holland, with some random thoughts about flowers throughout history and some general ideas around beauty (e.g., symmetry is appealing as a proxy for good health). There were a lot of opinion-led statements such as 
“beauty always takes place in the particular”
 that didn’t resonate with me; I find the ocean more beautiful in its entirety than a solitary wave. Intoxication: by far the most interesting, the third section discussed how humans seek intoxication through plants, which produce stimulants like caffeine, nicotine, THC, and hallucinogens. There is some fascinating published research about these drugs, but Pollan spirals away from the science to speculate on how THC mediates consciousness and can enhance creativity by blunting memory and creating the perception of heightened senses. (Huxley is referenced, which is never a good sign. Also, you can apparently get high from hallucinogens secreted by some toads.) Control over the natural environment: the final section is all about the humble potato, from the diverse varieties grown by the Aztecs to the Irish famine to Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potatoes. Pollan is in his element here as a food journalist, talking to scientists about gene transfer and farmers about the impact of GMO potatoes on their livelihoods. This section raised interesting concerns about the unintended consequences of tinkering with the plant genome since genes can “jump” to other plants via cross-pollination and their impact on the rest of the food chain is unknown.Perhaps if Pollan had focused on just one of the four desires, it would have been a more cohesive reading experience. But while there are interesting facts peppered throughout each chapter, the book attempts to cover so many different ideas that are only tangentially related, there was no space for thoughtful analysis. After finishing the book, I’m still not convinced by the author’s premise that: 
""Desire might be too strong a word for whatever it is that drives plants to reinvent themselves so that we might do their bidding, but then, our own designs have often been no more willful than the plants.""
Honestly, finishing this book was a Herculean task; only my determination not to disappoint my friend Scot who was reading the book with me enabled me to climb this metaphorical Mount Olympus. (Where, I should note, I looked down at all the plants from my lofty perch. Not a toad in sight up here!) It’s a shame, because Pollan writes beautifully, and could probably be very compelling if he was covering a topic where he has more expertise.*This is a established concept in biology applied to relationships between plants and pollinating insects or animals; predators and prey; pathogens and humans; and some domesticated animals (like dogs) and humans. The idea that plants and humans have a co-evolutionary relationship does not seem to be well-supported in the scientific literature. I mean, it’s not as far out there as the people who claim plants are silently screaming when we cut them down, but it’s pretty fringe."

131,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558460-caterina,4,"What if we humans are being manipulated by plants to serve their desires? From this slightly creepy flipped perspective, masterful storyteller Michael Pollan illuminates the crazy and complex interdependency of living things -- and also, some of the dangers we inflict on ourselves and our entire world by contemporary agricultural practices -- through four stories - and what stories! -- of the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. (Ok, he admits the conceit of manipulative plants to be a bit of a stretch -- but it's a fascinating way to see how we and our favorite foods, flowers, and intoxicants are, for better or worse, co-evolving.)Biggest surprise of the book - the potato's story turned out to be the most interesting and important (really, after marijuana?) and the best showcase of Pollan's skills as an investigative journalist/interviewer and experimental gardener. Who knew, for example, that Monsanto scientists created genetically engineered potato plants with a ""gene gun"" that uses a .22 shell to fire DNA-coated stainless steel projectiles into potato leaves in the hope that some of the alien DNA (from some non-potato species) combine with the plant's own DNA? Unless, as a Yankee from Connecticut, Pollan was being set up for a huge Southern joke -- which seems to me a distinct possibility -- this actually happened at the Monsanto lab he visited in Missouri. But possible joke aside, this story contained the most intelligent and nuanced discussion of genetic modification of foods that I've ever seen, with input from numerous scientists and farmers, as well as exploring the advantages and dangers of monoculture and colonial commodity agriculture (and some of its horrific history), chemical versus organic agriculture, and the effects of food culture on farming. Also, Michael Pollan clearly just loves to grow and eat potatoes -- it may be his relish that gave this story its extra glow. (Without ever mentioning vodka.)I also especially loved the apple's story, with the mysterious Dionysian and yet somehow pure, childlike figure of Johnny Appleseed spreading seeds -- not for nice wholesome lunchbox treats but for alcohol, and plenty of it, in the wilds of Pennsylvania and Ohio. (The woods I played in, growing up in southwestern Pennsylvania, were full of abandoned and decrepit old apple trees -- I had no idea of their history.) As this book came out in 2001 the MJ story was a bit dated, and although it focused on why the plant was so strongly prohibited, it never mentioned what I understand to be the two biggest reasons -- racism/anti-Mexican sentiment, and pressure by the American pharmaceutical industry. Nor does the current battle between states and federal government come up (which maybe echoes historic battles over hard cider and whiskey). Nevertheless, all four stories are surprising and fascinating, combining investigative journalism (involving quite a bit of travel), personal experimentation, and a good dose of wild imaginative speculation -- sometimes fueled by that experimentation."
132,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666,4,"Michael Pollan's book is certainly an interesting one. It germinates (pun intended) in Pollan's mind, one day, as he was working in his garden. He thought what if human beings were similar to bumblebees? It is an interesting take on ""coevolution"", which stipulates that two parties can act on each other to advance their individual interests but end up producing a mutually beneficial outcome.What if plants were able to develop traits that would cause other animals to help them in their goal to reproduce? As plants are immobile, they tend to rely on wind and rain to spread their pollen. But with the evolution of angiosperms, plants with flowers and seeds, animals had a new reason to eat those plants and they spread the seeds for the plant, or pollen in the case of the bee.He then stipulates that the four plants he covers have also evolved in such a way as to appeal to the human animal and, by doing so, have been able to spread their seed all across the world. The four plants he looks at are perfect examples of how they have managed to ""attract"" human beings. Pollan also links each of these plants to a specific desire. They are as follows:The apple, which utilizes the sense of sweetness.The Tulip, which utilizes the sense of beauty.The potato, which utilizes the sense of control.The marijuana plant, which utilizes the sense of intoxication.Each of these plants gets a detailed history. You will learn where they came from, how they were modified and how they entered into the human world. The stories are interesting, though I could have done with less of the personal ruminations, it is the history and the science behind these four plants that make this an interesting book to read.It is hardly overly technical and quite easy for a science dunce to comprehend. If you are looking for something more science-heavy, I'd pass on this. This is a book that tells the tale of science through the prism of human desire. Pollan does a good job of explaining things like the Diyonisian concepts and how they melded into how humans view intoxication and their views on marijuana.An interesting book that will make you think and while not science-heavy, this is a book that will interest science and non-science people alike. Interesting anecdotes and some cool history make this a rather unique book."

I mean, I want to know about Michael Pollan, he is huge and important, right? And everybody in Berkeley wants him to be Obama's Secretary of Agriculture. (Though I guess I haven't read Obama's books, so.) I liked it! I was kind of surprised, I think I was expecting something dryer. Mostly it was just this pretty smart guy talking about stuff he likes: natural selection, Johnny Appleseed, weed stories, people, Dionysus, bugs and genetically modified foods. I thought it was pretty great how in the beginning he was like, Here are four things I'm going to talk about, but then he didn't tell you what he was gonna say about 'em- like, you know the last chapter's gonna be about potatoes, but you don't know that it's going to be a conversation about the safety of genetically modified potatoes. And dude loves his plants, which is nice. It felt pretty repetitive at times, just saying the same stuff over and over, and that definitely got boring, but whatever. I was sucked in enough to bust through it between bouts of neck-pain sleep on planes and buses and trains while I was on the east coast for three days, which is more than I can say for bell hooks, who's all writing stuff I have to pay attention to and think critically about. "
134,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,3,"An earlier Pollan book, and a bestseller. Like the later, better, books, Botany explores its thesis, that the plants co-evolve with us, in four sections. There is some fluff here; the best section is easily on the one on intoxication. Doubters should read the introduction and skip to section 3.Pollan's best stuff always makes me see the world differently, and this passage changed the way I conceived of gardens, what they are, and what they could be:""I sometimes think we've allowed our gardens to be bowdlerized, that the full range of their powers and possibilities has been sacrificed to a cult of plant prettiness that obscures more dubious truths about nature, our own included. It hasn't always been this way, and we may someday come to regard the contemporary garden of vegetables and flowers as a place almost Victorian in its repressions and elisions.""He goes on to discuss a witch's garden, which included intoxicants and medicines, rather than just beautiful flowers. He argues that when the church murdered witches, they converted the contents of these gardens from taboo objects to medicines made acceptable by what we'd now call physicians. I'm sure I'm bastardizing the argument, but it was interesting. Great chapter.And here is one on what might be Pollan's greatest weakness as a reporter but what is also his greatest strength as a writer: ""I am literally absentminded, prone to be thinking about something else, something past, when I am ostensibly having a fresh experience.""Of the other chapters, the best is on potatoes, and the other two are about apples and tulips.As for the books, I still rate Omnivore, Cooked, and A Place of My Own ahead of this one, but if you broke it down to chapters, Botany's chapter on intoxication would jump ahead to the top five Pollan chapters, alongside the Omnivore stuff and Cooked's chapter on fermented foods."
135,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Not as good as the Omnivore's Dilemma, but definitely worth a read if you love thinking about plants as much as I do.The first section, on apples, was really dry (to me). Actually, it's less about apples and more about John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) and I just... don't... care about him. Right, great, he planted lots of apples, we get it, he's a hometown hero. The rest is pretty well done, though. I especially loved the section on cannabis. I harbour a lot of curiosity as to how psychotropic plants and humans have co-evolved, and why exactly certain plants have developed those mechanisms, and how we humans came to have a neurology that happened to respond to those plants' chemicals. So that was extremely engrossing.Tulips also held my interest pretty aggressively, for similar reasons. The subject of why we even like and are drawn to things as seemingly useless (evolutionarily speaking) as flowers is fascinating. It's much easier to know without having to read a book that apples or potatoes and humans have fed off one another in time. Tulips are a little bit more intriguing.I like Pollan's dry humour but also his rich curiosity, but I suspect that when he wrote this book, what was really on his mind was his next book. The section on potatoes is essentially a short verse of the Omnivore's Dilemma. In the Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan seemed more enthusiastic about the material and more concerned with the topic (not that he isn't here, but he really hits his stride there). "

The last section, that explains the practice and risks of mono-culture and the processes of genetics manipulation employed by large corporations (e.g. Monsanto) were fascinating and scaring at the same time.3.5 stars rounded down because I found the repetition of the Apollo-Dionysus metaphor annoying and pompous in its tone.Fav.

137,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,3,"A very interesting description of the symbiotic relationships that exist between humans and plants -- specifically, apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes.Humans select certain beneficial species of plants, and specific individual plants within that species for culturing and propagation. Those plants then (over generations) alter their genetics to transform themselves into even more desirable individuals of their species. The human benefit is obvious, but the plant also benefits because humans cultivate many times more of that species of plant than would ever occur naturally.The history and the science fascinated me, but I felt that some of the book was a bit repetitive and in a few places difficult to follow the flow and narrative."
138,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2163177-kishor,5,"Mr Pollan uses The Botany of Desire to posit that the nature of our relationship with plants is a lot more nuanced than it seems at first glance. While we may have succeeded in domesticating a large number of photosynthetic species, they in turn are exerting various influences on mankind. In the process of regaling us with stories of four specific plants, he manages to lay a wealth of information on the reader. The four plants are the apple (symbolizing sweetness), the tulip (beauty), marijuana (intoxication), and the potato (control).Here are some interesting things I learnt about each of them:Apple trees grown from seed produce really bitter fruit; grafting allows the cloning of trees with good fruit at the cost of loss of genetic diversity. Produce from the former type of tree was (and is?) primarily used for producing cider and applejack; Johnny ""Appleseed"" Chapman, it turns out, was responsible for keeping the American frontier well lubricated with spirits.The tulip flower is colored by two chemicals; a base layer of pigment and another (anthocyanin) on top. Famous beauties amongst the tulip family (check out the Semper Augustus, it's *amazing*) are patterned due to the activity of a virus that causes the anthocyanin to degrade, allowing the base layer to be seen. The author draws on Apollo and Dionysus heavily in this chapter, contrasting the Apollonian austerity and order of the tulip with the Dionysian seduction of other flowers like the peony and the rose.The marijuana plant diverged at some point in history to grow as two different varieties - the indica strain is much more potent and can withstand frost, while the sativa strain gives the consumer a ""clear, bell-like high"" but requires equatorial climes to grow. Growers have hybridized the two, thereby combining their strengths and downplaying their weaknesses. An interesting point that Michael brings up in this section is that humanity is constantly seeking out ways to alter its state of consciousness; in fact, this is a thing we do even as children, be it by consuming sugary snacks, spinning around fast until dizziness causes visual hallucinations, holding our breath until we spots, and so on. Adults do this too, through the mechanisms of ""meditation, fasting, exercise, amusement park rides, ..., music, eating spicy foods"", etc. The human body has its own cannabinoid system, and produces a THC-like neurotransmitter named ""anandamide"" by the discoverer; the name stems from ""ananda"", the Sanskrit word for bliss.He uses his section on the potato to talk about genetic engineering, again weaving a narrative of Apollonian order vs Dionysian wildness. Mr Pollan planted in his garden the potato known as the NewLeaf, engineered by the Monsanto corporation, producing its own insecticide in its leaves. While this helps fight the evil Colorado potato beetle and saves farmers from having to coat their fields with nasty chemicals, it means that agriculture is moving towards a monoculture and a subsequent loss of biodiversity. The organic farmer who seeds their fields with a variety of crop, however, doesn't care about the susceptibilities of any one plant; the overall crop is always (barring bizarre tornadoes, I mean) guaranteed to do fine.All this plant talk makes me want to take up gardening!"
139,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"This is another time where I've read a book and only come back to write the review many, many, many months later. In this case, I read the book (listened to the Audible, technically) back in March 2017 and now I'm reviewing it in January 2018. The reason it's taken so long is that I flagged several passages for transcription into my notes, and I only just now got around to doing it. (19 notes in an hour is actually pretty good for me.)So I'll just have to leave you with some vague impressions.For one, Michael Pollan can write. I was struck--going through and transcribing some of my notes--once again by the variety and precision of his language. He is a really, really great writer. Quick sample:Imagine a moment when the sensation of honey or sugar on the tongue was an astonishment, a kind of intoxication. The closest I've ever come to recovering such a sense of sweetness was secondhand, though it left a powerful impression on me ever so. I'm thinking of my son's first experience of sugar: the icing on the cake at his first birthday. I have only the testimony of Isaac's face to go by (that, and his fierceness to repeat the experience), but it was plain that his first encounter with sugar had intoxicated him--was in fact an ecstasy, in the literal sense of the word. That is, he was beside himself with the pleasure of it, no longer her with me in space and time in quite the same way he had been just a moment before. Between bites Isaac gazed up at me in amazement (he was on my lap, and I was delivering the ambrosial forkfuls to his gaping mouth) as if to exclaim, ""Your world contains this? From this day forward I shall dedicate my life to it."" (Which he basically has done.) And I remember thinking, this is no minor desire, and then wondered: Could it be that sweetness is the prototype of all desire?I almost feel like this talent is lost on non-fiction. Why isn't Pollan writing novels?(Just went and checked. He hasn't written any. He did get both his BA and MA in English, though. So that goes some distance to explaining his writing chops.)The passage above is also a good example of Pollan's wide-ranging syntheses. He's very good at pulling from pretty disparate sources in surprising and illuminating ways.The most powerful passages of the book for me were the ones about Johnny Appleseed. I was really impressed by how Pollan was able to bring some historical weight along with almost mythic significance to the story, and was surprised again and again by what I learned about apples (along with, later, potatoes and tulips. Cannabis was less impressive.)I can see where critics can find fault with the book. Because it's a broad approach, it is also a little thin and shallow in spots. I'm fine with that. More often than not, the problem with 200-page popular science books is that they have way too little material and far too much padding. Although there are a few patchy spots, in general Pollan never runs out of ideas or material, and the book is satisfyingly compelling from page 1 on to the end."
140,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,4,"After reading The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals, I was determined to read more by Michael Pollan. It took me three years to get around to reading this book, but I'm glad I finally did. It's a bit more metaphysical than the other books I've read by him, but still very informative and interesting. I was fascinated by his exploration of the four different kinds of plants and the human desires sated by each. And I was amused by his continual revisitation of the Dionysus/Apollo metaphor throughout the book. interesting quotes:""So the question arose in my mind that day: Did I choose to plant these potatoes, or did the potato make me do it? In fact, both statements are true...Yet evolution consists of an infinitude of trivial, unconscious events, and in the evolution of the potato my reading of a particular seed catalog on a particular January evening counts as one of them."" (p. xv)""Domesticated species don't command our respect the way their wild cousins often do. Evolution may reward interdependence, but our thinking selves continue to prize self-reliance. The wolf is somehow more impressive than the dog. Yet there are fifty million dogs in America today, only ten thousand wolves. So what does the dog know about getting along in this world that its wild ancestor doesn't? The big thing the dog knows about-the subject matter it has mastered in the ten thousand years it has been evolving at our side-is us: our needs and desires, our emotions and values, all of which it has folded into its genes as part of a sophisticated strategy for survival."" (pp. xvi-xvii)""The four desires I explore here are sweetness, broadly defined, in the story of the apple;beauty in the tulip's;intoxication in the story of cannibis; and control in the story of the potato-specifically, in the story of a genetically altered potato I grew in my garden to see where the ancient arts of domestication may now be headed. (p. xviii)""Every wild apple shrub excites our expectations thus,"" Thoreau wrote, ""somewhat as every wild child. It is, perhaps, a prince in disguise. What a lesson to man!...Poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures, and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men."" (p. 45)""Symmetry is an unmistakable sign that there's relevant information in a place. That's because symmetry is a property shared by a relatively small number of things in the landscape, all of them of keen interest to us. The shortlist of nature's symmetricals includes other creatures, other people (most notably the faces of other people), human artifacts, and plants--but especially flowers. Symmetry is also a sign of health in a creature, since mutations and environmental stresses can easily disturb it. So paying attention to symmetrical things makes good sense: symmetry is usually significant."" (p. 76)""Though we self-importantly regard domestication as something people have done to plants, it is at the same time a strategy by which the plants have exploited us and our desires--even our most idiosyncratic notions of beauty--to advance their own interests. Depending on the environment in which a species finds itself, different adaptations will avail. Mutations that nature would have rejected out of hand in the wild sometimes prove to be brilliant adaptations in an environment that's been shaped by human desire."" (p. 81)""Although by any conventional measure it is folly to pay thousands for a tulip bulb (or for that matter an Internet stock), as long as there is an even greater fool out there willing to pay even more, doing so is the most logical thing in the world."" (p. 103)""Yet this new biotechnology has overthrown the old rules governing the relationship of nature and culture in a plant. Domestication has never been a simple one-way process in which our species has controlled others; other species participate only so far as their interests are served, and many plants (such as the oak) simply sit the whole game out. That game is the one Darwin called 'artificial selection,' and its rules have never been any different from the ones that govern natural selection. The plant in its wildness proposes new qualities, and then man (or, in the case of natural selection, nature) selects which of those qualities will survive and prosper. But about one rule Darwin was emphatic; as he wrote in The Origin of Species, 'Man does not actually produce variability.' Now he does."" (p. 196)""Yet for reasons we don't completely understand, distinct species do exist in nature, and they exhibit a certain genetic integrity--sex between them, when it does occur, doesn't produce fertile offspring. Nature presumably has some reason for erecting these walls, even if they are permeable on occasion. Perhaps, as some biologists believe, the purpose of keeping species separate is to put barriers in the path of pathogens, to contain their damage so that a single germ can't wipe out life on Earth at a stroke."" (pp. 196-197)""This is, of course, how chemical companies have always handled the problem of pest resistance: by simply introducing a new and improved pesticide every few years. With any luck, the effectiveness of the last one will expire around the same time its patent does."" (p. 215)""As much as I love the firm grasp and cerebral order of spring, there's a ripe, almost sensual pleasure in its August abandonment, too.""

He is an incredibly gifted non-fiction writer whose first-person style makes his work as readable as it is educational. This book personifies the foods described and paints them as our partners in consumption and in life."
144,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,5,"Michael Pollan is swiftly solidifying his position as ""somebody I want to know."" He's a clever writer, an inquisitive journalist, and a creative storyteller, as well as a shining light of simple food consciousness in an era of either not asking at all or asking far too much.This book is equal parts natural history, social history, regular history, botanical musing, plant biology, evolutionary theory, and psychology, with a smattering of classical mythology, memoir, neuroscience, and investigative journalism to hold the threads together. Pollan sets out with the aim of tracking four plants along their coevolution with society, tying each to a human desire that shaped it into what it is today: the apple and sweetness, the tulip and beauty, marijuana and intoxication, and potatoes and control. What he ends up writing from this neat little package of a thesis is something much greater than the sum of its parts, a veritable exploration (I use the word a lot but I think it really applies here) of what it means to be human in a determinedly natural world. One of the ideas he returns to often is that our relationship to the natural world is a balancing of Apollonian (controlled, geometric, structured, artificial) and Dionysian (frenetic, shifting, chaotic, and natural) forces, and I think he really hit the nail on the head with the notion as much as with the conclusion that it's a much more complicated relationship than it first appears. The complexity of the question is due in part to the many human urges (such as morality) that don't fit cleanly in either camp, and in part to the ambiguity of the agent in control within the framework of nature's chaos. It's an impressively thoughtful approach, and the broad reach allowed by a philosophical, as opposed to purely scientific, foundation means the reader gets to learn a little about a lot along the way.I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by divulging details of HOW each plant and desire is examined, but I will assure you that the how is not as straightforward and easy as you'd expect. This is becoming a mark of Pollan's writing as much as it always has been a hallmark of great writing: a clear and simple idea considered with breadth and depth in a manner so well-organized that you don't realize how much you're learning until you're done. I cannot wait to read more of his work."
145,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196103-jenn,3,"I thought this was an interesting but long winded book. The author discusses 4 different plants and how they have 'coevolved' with humans to reap the benefits of human interaction. It is best summed up in one of the first chapters of the book as the author ponders if he planted potatoes in his garden out of his own accord of did the potatoes, by virtue of their deliciousness, pursuade him to plant them?One of the main things I learned from this book is the value of diversity. From the loss of heritage apple varieties due to the desire for sickly sweet varieties to the monsanto NewLeaf potatoes that are themselves registered with the EPA as a pesticide i was introduced to this monoculture idea that I didnt know existed. I was shocked to learn about the stringent potato requirements of the fast food industry - only 1 type of potato without blemish is acceptable for french fry production. With the razor slim profit margins of farming a farmer selling to these companies nearly HAS to use GMO crops and/or huge amounts of pesticides to make ends meet.This definitely changed the way I think about organic vs non organic foods. I used to think buying non-organic potatoes was alright, but faced with the fact of what could potentially be in them (one of the potato farmers wouldnt even eat the potatoes he grew) i now feel that i really need to buy local and or organic for the sake of my health."
146,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914674-isis,5,"I liked this book even better than The Omnivore's Dilemma. When you strip aside the somewhat heavy-handed Apollo vs. Dionysus metaphor and the provocative subtitle that suggests that it's plants, not people, who invented agriculture -- that we're essentially only sophisticated bees -- you get a fascinating set of histories of four very interesting plants: apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes. And yes, they co-evolved with people, but that's really nothing surprising or shocking. But it is both entertaining and educational, written well and read (in the audio edition I listened to) superbly.Pollan takes a vast road-trip through history, and although it seems like a pleasantly meandering journey, it's actually quite focused and organized. In the chapter on apples we learn of the real Johnny Appleseed, and of the concept of sweetness, and of how Prohibition changed apple marketing for good. The tulip chapter touches on not only the (obvious) tulip mania speculative bubble, but also on the genetics of tulips and the virus that affected them, and on the idea of floral beauty in different cultures. And so on. There is a bit of moralizing: the drug war comes in for some criticism, and monoculture is reviled as the root of all of industrial agriculture's evil. But I don't disagree with these points!"
147,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431129-brian,4,"By the end of this book, I really wanted to have Michael Pollan's life, more or less. Though I'd settle for a nice house somewhere where I can have a big garden with all types of plants like his; that was the main attraction, along with the requisite knowledge and experience of nature itself and the nature of how things grow, in a word. As noble as it sounds in theory for man to be in harmony with nature, it becomes clear by his summation in the epilogue that it's nothing less than quite practical. But most of all, it's rewarding.Part of why I must feel this even stronger pull towards plants after finishing was that I think the order of the chapters was well-chosen. The themes on which he hit were introduced best with the apple and finished best with the potato, though I would have to call cannabis and potato my two favorite chapters. Loading up on everything else before you see the contrast of commercial Monsanto-controlled potato farming in Idaho with Michael Pollan's own backyard, you're smart and informed enough on the subject to feel passionate about cultivating a more symbiotic relationship with your environment. Again, which is why I want a nice house with a big garden even more now. "
148,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249241-meg,5,"The author adds a wrinkle to our thoughts about domestication by arguing that plants have selected for a preference for their qualities in humans, leading to their cultivation, ensuring their survival. Rather than us manipulating the traits of our crops, we've been manipulated by them!Though I disagree with this premise (you can never determine an evolutionary reason for something, and it's hardly parsimonious to think of organisms acting as agents of selection on our perceptions of them (and how does this translate to fitness?), leading to us selecting for desirable traits in those organisms), I loved tracing the history of 4 important plants (apple, potato, tulip, marijuana) and their interactions with humans."

Lots of face-palms.The musings on the effects of Marijuana is really uncomfortable.Pollan obviously wrote this chapter while high.He suggests that meditation can get you high like Marijuana, which just isn't true.He rambles on about spirituality, which is bizarre and metaphysical.The potato.Pollan shares with us his ignorance-fueled skepticism about GM crops.He states, falsely, that Monsanto has a patent on the BT gene.In fact, Monsanto's patents cover specific plant genomes with the BT gene inserted at a particular location.The difference being, Monsanto did not come up with the BT gene.What they rightfully call their intellectual property is the work of figuring out how to make the BT gene work inside each plant.Evil patents are no argument against GM crops than they are an argument against pharmaceuticals.His other argument is some philosophical nuance of object vs. subject.He seems to be putting forth an argument for purity.That intentional tampering directly with the genome is different and worse than using ""natural"" techniques like cloning, grafting, crossing, and other forms of artificial selection.Really, there's no functional difference between modifying the sequence of genes with one or another technique.Some techniques, like recombinant genetic engineering, offer more possibilities.Then, he whines about monoculture for a few dozen pages.This part sounds like it's right out of omnivore's dilemma.Apollonian verses Dionysian, blah, blah, blah.I wish Pollan would stick to the fascinating anecdotes."
153,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,4,"In The Botany of Desire Michael Pollan goes into our relationship with four plants: the tulip, marijuana, the apple, and the potato. He looks at these four plants from historical, political, and personal point of view. In many ways this is a fascinating account. For example the first one that goes into the tulip mania that the Dutch got into, which is both comic, and ridiculous at the same time, but of course if we look at the stock market in general, these sorts of things still take place, just in a slightly different way. Are the plants themselves passive victims in all of this or are they active participants is one of the more interesting question that he tries to answer in his book, but of course he can't really prove it one way or the other. Still, he does present the case for them being much more active members in this relationship so well that a question that might have seemed a little silly actually becomes an interesting one. There is one thing about Pollen's writing style, he does tend to take detours, in fact he takes quite a few one of those. This does make the book at times feel a little unfocused, but still it never really got uninteresting, even despite that. I actually got quite a bit of enjoyment out of this read. And I gained some inside into this subject. One can't really ask much more out of a nonfiction book, so I think I may read something else by him. "
154,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"Wonderful, wonderful book, full of fantastic info and insights. My main critique is Pollan's main conceit, and the language used to express it: plant species have domesticated humanity just as much as humanity has domesticated them. My problem is his constant insertion of agency into the process of evolution and mixing metaphors of individuals and of species. Flowers are not individually clever, and neither are species of flowers. Flowers do not manipulate bees in the same way that a botanist manipulates a flower species through artificial selection or genetic modification. Species do not have agency, the will to act. Only individuals have that, and individuals bees, potatoes, or water buffalo do not (to our knowledge), willfully offer themselves up as partners to humanity.Pollan draws an interesting distinction that I haven't encountered in my amateur meanderings between ""wilderness"" and ""wildness."" He uses ""wilderness"" in the sense of the Wilderness Act of 1964, ""an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."" ""Wildness,"" on the other hand, is anything that humans cannot control. As Bill McKibben famously pointed out, the atmosphere of our planet is no longer a wilderness, tainted as it is by the byproducts of our industry, but as every hurricane and tornado reminds us, it is still profoundly wild.Pollan uses this distinction to emphasize that while all domestication is a destruction of wilderness, it is almost never an abolition of wildness. The gardener uses his sense of order not to control his plants absolutely, but to guide and shape their wildness in certain ways. He goes on to suggest that genetic engineering may violate this pact, that by attempting to guide evolution on such a basic level is a powerful new way to write wildness out of the equation. He also offers the counterpoint that current techniques for gene insertion are (sometimes literally) so scattershot as to yield results that are even less predictable that conventional breeding.The topic of wilderness feeds into another interesting point, which is that ""memory is the enemy of wonder"" (168). He argues that cannabinoids like THC help us experience awe and wonder by forcing constant short term memory loss, and that meditation or physical exertion probably induce the same effect, making the view from a mountain peak infinitely more profound after having hiked to it instead of having driven.Another insight he had about marijuana is that drugs could be considered the mutagens of culture. If one assumes a meme is like a gene, then a culture is like a genome. Memes are constantly recombining through thought and discourse (intercourse in both culture and biology), but genuinely new ideas are rare. At the risk of spreading a metaphor too thin, Pollan suggests that drugs could be thought of as mutagens, radiation nuking the genetic fundaments of culture, producing mostly irrelevant or deleterious nonsense, but now and again creating viable gems (149). Kind of a fun thought."
155,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark,3,"This guy has inspired me to grow my own food and keep a few hens in the backyard. Being a little self-reliant in these unsettling times gives me a sense of stability and hope.In this book, Pollan takes a look at four plants and relates them to human desires, I think . . . He starts things off with the apple and goes into a bit of long-winded ramble about Johnny Appleseed's quest to sell his trees to pioneers and his lust for a 10 year old bride (fortunately this bit wasn't dug into with any sort of detail). Johnny's enthusiasm for the apple and his desire to plant the seed (and refusal to graft) results in the many varieties that adapted to new climates. Though I'm learning a lot about Johnny here, I'd rather have more factoids about the apple. I'm hoping the following chapters are more interesting because I find my mind wandering more than usual while listening to this.I've now finished up the tulip section and made it about halfway through the marijuana chapter but, at this point, I have come to the realization that this book just doesn't interest me. It's very repetitive and meandering. I'll finish it up and hope the potato's treatment can grab me enough to get through it.Later: I finished up and did find the potato section much more interesting but that's because I'm always interested in GMO foods, the science, the corruption, the danger to our society, the greed . . . I didn't really learn anything new as this was written quite a few years ago but it still captured my attention all the same. "
156,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/610744-luke,3,"The Botany of Desire was written in language that made it obvious that Michael Pollan likes to hear himself write. His ideas were interesting, following four plants, the potato, cannabis, the apple, and the tulip through their journey with mankind. I like how he approaches the topic, observing not only what people have done to the plants to develop them to our own use, but also how the plants have in some ways used us for their own ends. It is true that we, while we think we are masters of our own destinies, are intimately tied to the world around us. there is an ecological cause and effect that often escapes us because of our anthropogenic perspective. My argument with the book is that Pollan overuses imagery from Greek mythology and as a result becomes tedious to read in some sections. By far the most interesting is the last section on the interaction between humanity and the potato. "

If so, I have just the book for you…The Botany of Desire explores the relationship between plants and humans, but rather than focusing on human agency, food journalist and gardener Michael Pollan tells the story from the plants’ point of view. He takes the idea of co-evolution as his starting point: the idea that two species evolve in a mutually dependent manner leading to the selection of certain traits. Pollan attempts to apply this evolutionary concept to human interactions with plants.* 
""Plants hit on a remarkably clever strategy: getting us to move or think for them…it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees.""
Reading this book was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope; the perspective felt distorted. I was not persuaded that Pollan completely understood some of the scientific concepts that he was trying to explain. It all felt a little…Gladwell-esque. Pollan tries to illustrate the intertwined evolutionary relationship between plants and humans by telling the story of four plants and the desires that they satisfy. Sweetness: the first section focused on apples and the story of John Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed). Pollan dedicates many, many pages to Chapman’s life and his ‘Dionysian’ apple planting efforts, which allowed homesteaders to get reliably drunk on alcoholic cider. (Inspired by this chapter, I created a drinking game where I had a sip of scotch every time Pollan mentioned Dionysus or Apollo. I was forced to abandon this delightful crutch since there were so many references to both gods, I was getting woozy.) Beauty: the second section covered the speculative boom and bust around tulip mania in Holland, with some random thoughts about flowers throughout history and some general ideas around beauty (e.g., symmetry is appealing as a proxy for good health). There were a lot of opinion-led statements such as 
“beauty always takes place in the particular”
 that didn’t resonate with me; I find the ocean more beautiful in its entirety than a solitary wave. Intoxication: by far the most interesting, the third section discussed how humans seek intoxication through plants, which produce stimulants like caffeine, nicotine, THC, and hallucinogens. There is some fascinating published research about these drugs, but Pollan spirals away from the science to speculate on how THC mediates consciousness and can enhance creativity by blunting memory and creating the perception of heightened senses. (Huxley is referenced, which is never a good sign. Also, you can apparently get high from hallucinogens secreted by some toads.) Control over the natural environment: the final section is all about the humble potato, from the diverse varieties grown by the Aztecs to the Irish famine to Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potatoes. Pollan is in his element here as a food journalist, talking to scientists about gene transfer and farmers about the impact of GMO potatoes on their livelihoods. This section raised interesting concerns about the unintended consequences of tinkering with the plant genome since genes can “jump” to other plants via cross-pollination and their impact on the rest of the food chain is unknown.Perhaps if Pollan had focused on just one of the four desires, it would have been a more cohesive reading experience. But while there are interesting facts peppered throughout each chapter, the book attempts to cover so many different ideas that are only tangentially related, there was no space for thoughtful analysis. After finishing the book, I’m still not convinced by the author’s premise that: 
""Desire might be too strong a word for whatever it is that drives plants to reinvent themselves so that we might do their bidding, but then, our own designs have often been no more willful than the plants.""
Honestly, finishing this book was a Herculean task; only my determination not to disappoint my friend Scot who was reading the book with me enabled me to climb this metaphorical Mount Olympus. (Where, I should note, I looked down at all the plants from my lofty perch. Not a toad in sight up here!) It’s a shame, because Pollan writes beautifully, and could probably be very compelling if he was covering a topic where he has more expertise.*This is a established concept in biology applied to relationships between plants and pollinating insects or animals; predators and prey; pathogens and humans; and some domesticated animals (like dogs) and humans. The idea that plants and humans have a co-evolutionary relationship does not seem to be well-supported in the scientific literature. I mean, it’s not as far out there as the people who claim plants are silently screaming when we cut them down, but it’s pretty fringe."

161,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558460-caterina,4,"What if we humans are being manipulated by plants to serve their desires? From this slightly creepy flipped perspective, masterful storyteller Michael Pollan illuminates the crazy and complex interdependency of living things -- and also, some of the dangers we inflict on ourselves and our entire world by contemporary agricultural practices -- through four stories - and what stories! -- of the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. (Ok, he admits the conceit of manipulative plants to be a bit of a stretch -- but it's a fascinating way to see how we and our favorite foods, flowers, and intoxicants are, for better or worse, co-evolving.)Biggest surprise of the book - the potato's story turned out to be the most interesting and important (really, after marijuana?) and the best showcase of Pollan's skills as an investigative journalist/interviewer and experimental gardener. Who knew, for example, that Monsanto scientists created genetically engineered potato plants with a ""gene gun"" that uses a .22 shell to fire DNA-coated stainless steel projectiles into potato leaves in the hope that some of the alien DNA (from some non-potato species) combine with the plant's own DNA? Unless, as a Yankee from Connecticut, Pollan was being set up for a huge Southern joke -- which seems to me a distinct possibility -- this actually happened at the Monsanto lab he visited in Missouri. But possible joke aside, this story contained the most intelligent and nuanced discussion of genetic modification of foods that I've ever seen, with input from numerous scientists and farmers, as well as exploring the advantages and dangers of monoculture and colonial commodity agriculture (and some of its horrific history), chemical versus organic agriculture, and the effects of food culture on farming. Also, Michael Pollan clearly just loves to grow and eat potatoes -- it may be his relish that gave this story its extra glow. (Without ever mentioning vodka.)I also especially loved the apple's story, with the mysterious Dionysian and yet somehow pure, childlike figure of Johnny Appleseed spreading seeds -- not for nice wholesome lunchbox treats but for alcohol, and plenty of it, in the wilds of Pennsylvania and Ohio. (The woods I played in, growing up in southwestern Pennsylvania, were full of abandoned and decrepit old apple trees -- I had no idea of their history.) As this book came out in 2001 the MJ story was a bit dated, and although it focused on why the plant was so strongly prohibited, it never mentioned what I understand to be the two biggest reasons -- racism/anti-Mexican sentiment, and pressure by the American pharmaceutical industry. Nor does the current battle between states and federal government come up (which maybe echoes historic battles over hard cider and whiskey). Nevertheless, all four stories are surprising and fascinating, combining investigative journalism (involving quite a bit of travel), personal experimentation, and a good dose of wild imaginative speculation -- sometimes fueled by that experimentation."
162,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666,4,"Michael Pollan's book is certainly an interesting one. It germinates (pun intended) in Pollan's mind, one day, as he was working in his garden. He thought what if human beings were similar to bumblebees? It is an interesting take on ""coevolution"", which stipulates that two parties can act on each other to advance their individual interests but end up producing a mutually beneficial outcome.What if plants were able to develop traits that would cause other animals to help them in their goal to reproduce? As plants are immobile, they tend to rely on wind and rain to spread their pollen. But with the evolution of angiosperms, plants with flowers and seeds, animals had a new reason to eat those plants and they spread the seeds for the plant, or pollen in the case of the bee.He then stipulates that the four plants he covers have also evolved in such a way as to appeal to the human animal and, by doing so, have been able to spread their seed all across the world. The four plants he looks at are perfect examples of how they have managed to ""attract"" human beings. Pollan also links each of these plants to a specific desire. They are as follows:The apple, which utilizes the sense of sweetness.The Tulip, which utilizes the sense of beauty.The potato, which utilizes the sense of control.The marijuana plant, which utilizes the sense of intoxication.Each of these plants gets a detailed history. You will learn where they came from, how they were modified and how they entered into the human world. The stories are interesting, though I could have done with less of the personal ruminations, it is the history and the science behind these four plants that make this an interesting book to read.It is hardly overly technical and quite easy for a science dunce to comprehend. If you are looking for something more science-heavy, I'd pass on this. This is a book that tells the tale of science through the prism of human desire. Pollan does a good job of explaining things like the Diyonisian concepts and how they melded into how humans view intoxication and their views on marijuana.An interesting book that will make you think and while not science-heavy, this is a book that will interest science and non-science people alike. Interesting anecdotes and some cool history make this a rather unique book."

I mean, I want to know about Michael Pollan, he is huge and important, right? And everybody in Berkeley wants him to be Obama's Secretary of Agriculture. (Though I guess I haven't read Obama's books, so.) I liked it! I was kind of surprised, I think I was expecting something dryer. Mostly it was just this pretty smart guy talking about stuff he likes: natural selection, Johnny Appleseed, weed stories, people, Dionysus, bugs and genetically modified foods. I thought it was pretty great how in the beginning he was like, Here are four things I'm going to talk about, but then he didn't tell you what he was gonna say about 'em- like, you know the last chapter's gonna be about potatoes, but you don't know that it's going to be a conversation about the safety of genetically modified potatoes. And dude loves his plants, which is nice. It felt pretty repetitive at times, just saying the same stuff over and over, and that definitely got boring, but whatever. I was sucked in enough to bust through it between bouts of neck-pain sleep on planes and buses and trains while I was on the east coast for three days, which is more than I can say for bell hooks, who's all writing stuff I have to pay attention to and think critically about.

164,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,3,"An earlier Pollan book, and a bestseller. Like the later, better, books, Botany explores its thesis, that the plants co-evolve with us, in four sections. There is some fluff here; the best section is easily on the one on intoxication. Doubters should read the introduction and skip to section 3.Pollan's best stuff always makes me see the world differently, and this passage changed the way I conceived of gardens, what they are, and what they could be:""I sometimes think we've allowed our gardens to be bowdlerized, that the full range of their powers and possibilities has been sacrificed to a cult of plant prettiness that obscures more dubious truths about nature, our own included. It hasn't always been this way, and we may someday come to regard the contemporary garden of vegetables and flowers as a place almost Victorian in its repressions and elisions.""He goes on to discuss a witch's garden, which included intoxicants and medicines, rather than just beautiful flowers. He argues that when the church murdered witches, they converted the contents of these gardens from taboo objects to medicines made acceptable by what we'd now call physicians. I'm sure I'm bastardizing the argument, but it was interesting. Great chapter.And here is one on what might be Pollan's greatest weakness as a reporter but what is also his greatest strength as a writer: ""I am literally absentminded, prone to be thinking about something else, something past, when I am ostensibly having a fresh experience.""Of the other chapters, the best is on potatoes, and the other two are about apples and tulips.As for the books, I still rate Omnivore, Cooked, and A Place of My Own ahead of this one, but if you broke it down to chapters, Botany's chapter on intoxication would jump ahead to the top five Pollan chapters, alongside the Omnivore stuff and Cooked's chapter on fermented foods."
165,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Not as good as the Omnivore's Dilemma, but definitely worth a read if you love thinking about plants as much as I do.The first section, on apples, was really dry (to me). Actually, it's less about apples and more about John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) and I just... don't... care about him. Right, great, he planted lots of apples, we get it, he's a hometown hero. The rest is pretty well done, though. I especially loved the section on cannabis. I harbour a lot of curiosity as to how psychotropic plants and humans have co-evolved, and why exactly certain plants have developed those mechanisms, and how we humans came to have a neurology that happened to respond to those plants' chemicals. So that was extremely engrossing.Tulips also held my interest pretty aggressively, for similar reasons. The subject of why we even like and are drawn to things as seemingly useless (evolutionarily speaking) as flowers is fascinating. It's much easier to know without having to read a book that apples or potatoes and humans have fed off one another in time. Tulips are a little bit more intriguing.I like Pollan's dry humour but also his rich curiosity, but I suspect that when he wrote this book, what was really on his mind was his next book. The section on potatoes is essentially a short verse of the Omnivore's Dilemma. In the Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan seemed more enthusiastic about the material and more concerned with the topic (not that he isn't here, but he really hits his stride there). "

The last section, that explains the practice and risks of mono-culture and the processes of genetics manipulation employed by large corporations (e.g. Monsanto) were fascinating and scaring at the same time.3.5 stars rounded down because I found the repetition of the Apollo-Dionysus metaphor annoying and pompous in its tone.Fav.

Those plants then (over generations) alter their genetics to transform themselves into even more desirable individuals of their species. The human benefit is obvious, but the plant also benefits because humans cultivate many times more of that species of plant than would ever occur naturally.The history and the science fascinated me, but I felt that some of the book was a bit repetitive and in a few places difficult to follow the flow and narrative."
168,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2163177-kishor,5,"Mr Pollan uses The Botany of Desire to posit that the nature of our relationship with plants is a lot more nuanced than it seems at first glance. While we may have succeeded in domesticating a large number of photosynthetic species, they in turn are exerting various influences on mankind. In the process of regaling us with stories of four specific plants, he manages to lay a wealth of information on the reader. The four plants are the apple (symbolizing sweetness), the tulip (beauty), marijuana (intoxication), and the potato (control).Here are some interesting things I learnt about each of them:Apple trees grown from seed produce really bitter fruit; grafting allows the cloning of trees with good fruit at the cost of loss of genetic diversity. Produce from the former type of tree was (and is?) primarily used for producing cider and applejack; Johnny ""Appleseed"" Chapman, it turns out, was responsible for keeping the American frontier well lubricated with spirits.The tulip flower is colored by two chemicals; a base layer of pigment and another (anthocyanin) on top. Famous beauties amongst the tulip family (check out the Semper Augustus, it's *amazing*) are patterned due to the activity of a virus that causes the anthocyanin to degrade, allowing the base layer to be seen. The author draws on Apollo and Dionysus heavily in this chapter, contrasting the Apollonian austerity and order of the tulip with the Dionysian seduction of other flowers like the peony and the rose.The marijuana plant diverged at some point in history to grow as two different varieties - the indica strain is much more potent and can withstand frost, while the sativa strain gives the consumer a ""clear, bell-like high"" but requires equatorial climes to grow. Growers have hybridized the two, thereby combining their strengths and downplaying their weaknesses. An interesting point that Michael brings up in this section is that humanity is constantly seeking out ways to alter its state of consciousness; in fact, this is a thing we do even as children, be it by consuming sugary snacks, spinning around fast until dizziness causes visual hallucinations, holding our breath until we spots, and so on. Adults do this too, through the mechanisms of ""meditation, fasting, exercise, amusement park rides, ..., music, eating spicy foods"", etc. The human body has its own cannabinoid system, and produces a THC-like neurotransmitter named ""anandamide"" by the discoverer; the name stems from ""ananda"", the Sanskrit word for bliss.He uses his section on the potato to talk about genetic engineering, again weaving a narrative of Apollonian order vs Dionysian wildness. Mr Pollan planted in his garden the potato known as the NewLeaf, engineered by the Monsanto corporation, producing its own insecticide in its leaves. While this helps fight the evil Colorado potato beetle and saves farmers from having to coat their fields with nasty chemicals, it means that agriculture is moving towards a monoculture and a subsequent loss of biodiversity. The organic farmer who seeds their fields with a variety of crop, however, doesn't care about the susceptibilities of any one plant; the overall crop is always (barring bizarre tornadoes, I mean) guaranteed to do fine.All this plant talk makes me want to take up gardening!"
169,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"This is another time where I've read a book and only come back to write the review many, many, many months later. In this case, I read the book (listened to the Audible, technically) back in March 2017 and now I'm reviewing it in January 2018. The reason it's taken so long is that I flagged several passages for transcription into my notes, and I only just now got around to doing it. (19 notes in an hour is actually pretty good for me.)So I'll just have to leave you with some vague impressions.For one, Michael Pollan can write. I was struck--going through and transcribing some of my notes--once again by the variety and precision of his language. He is a really, really great writer. Quick sample:Imagine a moment when the sensation of honey or sugar on the tongue was an astonishment, a kind of intoxication. The closest I've ever come to recovering such a sense of sweetness was secondhand, though it left a powerful impression on me ever so. I'm thinking of my son's first experience of sugar: the icing on the cake at his first birthday. I have only the testimony of Isaac's face to go by (that, and his fierceness to repeat the experience), but it was plain that his first encounter with sugar had intoxicated him--was in fact an ecstasy, in the literal sense of the word. That is, he was beside himself with the pleasure of it, no longer her with me in space and time in quite the same way he had been just a moment before. Between bites Isaac gazed up at me in amazement (he was on my lap, and I was delivering the ambrosial forkfuls to his gaping mouth) as if to exclaim, ""Your world contains this? From this day forward I shall dedicate my life to it."" (Which he basically has done.) And I remember thinking, this is no minor desire, and then wondered: Could it be that sweetness is the prototype of all desire?I almost feel like this talent is lost on non-fiction. Why isn't Pollan writing novels?(Just went and checked. He hasn't written any. He did get both his BA and MA in English, though. So that goes some distance to explaining his writing chops.)The passage above is also a good example of Pollan's wide-ranging syntheses. He's very good at pulling from pretty disparate sources in surprising and illuminating ways.The most powerful passages of the book for me were the ones about Johnny Appleseed. I was really impressed by how Pollan was able to bring some historical weight along with almost mythic significance to the story, and was surprised again and again by what I learned about apples (along with, later, potatoes and tulips. Cannabis was less impressive.)I can see where critics can find fault with the book. Because it's a broad approach, it is also a little thin and shallow in spots. I'm fine with that. More often than not, the problem with 200-page popular science books is that they have way too little material and far too much padding. Although there are a few patchy spots, in general Pollan never runs out of ideas or material, and the book is satisfyingly compelling from page 1 on to the end."
170,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,4,"After reading The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals, I was determined to read more by Michael Pollan. It took me three years to get around to reading this book, but I'm glad I finally did. It's a bit more metaphysical than the other books I've read by him, but still very informative and interesting. I was fascinated by his exploration of the four different kinds of plants and the human desires sated by each. And I was amused by his continual revisitation of the Dionysus/Apollo metaphor throughout the book. interesting quotes:""So the question arose in my mind that day: Did I choose to plant these potatoes, or did the potato make me do it? In fact, both statements are true...Yet evolution consists of an infinitude of trivial, unconscious events, and in the evolution of the potato my reading of a particular seed catalog on a particular January evening counts as one of them."" (p. xv)""Domesticated species don't command our respect the way their wild cousins often do. Evolution may reward interdependence, but our thinking selves continue to prize self-reliance. The wolf is somehow more impressive than the dog. Yet there are fifty million dogs in America today, only ten thousand wolves. So what does the dog know about getting along in this world that its wild ancestor doesn't? The big thing the dog knows about-the subject matter it has mastered in the ten thousand years it has been evolving at our side-is us: our needs and desires, our emotions and values, all of which it has folded into its genes as part of a sophisticated strategy for survival."" (pp. xvi-xvii)""The four desires I explore here are sweetness, broadly defined, in the story of the apple;beauty in the tulip's;intoxication in the story of cannibis; and control in the story of the potato-specifically, in the story of a genetically altered potato I grew in my garden to see where the ancient arts of domestication may now be headed. (p. xviii)""Every wild apple shrub excites our expectations thus,"" Thoreau wrote, ""somewhat as every wild child. It is, perhaps, a prince in disguise. What a lesson to man!...Poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures, and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men."" (p. 45)""Symmetry is an unmistakable sign that there's relevant information in a place. That's because symmetry is a property shared by a relatively small number of things in the landscape, all of them of keen interest to us. The shortlist of nature's symmetricals includes other creatures, other people (most notably the faces of other people), human artifacts, and plants--but especially flowers. Symmetry is also a sign of health in a creature, since mutations and environmental stresses can easily disturb it. So paying attention to symmetrical things makes good sense: symmetry is usually significant."" (p. 76)""Though we self-importantly regard domestication as something people have done to plants, it is at the same time a strategy by which the plants have exploited us and our desires--even our most idiosyncratic notions of beauty--to advance their own interests. Depending on the environment in which a species finds itself, different adaptations will avail. Mutations that nature would have rejected out of hand in the wild sometimes prove to be brilliant adaptations in an environment that's been shaped by human desire."" (p. 81)""Although by any conventional measure it is folly to pay thousands for a tulip bulb (or for that matter an Internet stock), as long as there is an even greater fool out there willing to pay even more, doing so is the most logical thing in the world."" (p. 103)""Yet this new biotechnology has overthrown the old rules governing the relationship of nature and culture in a plant. Domestication has never been a simple one-way process in which our species has controlled others; other species participate only so far as their interests are served, and many plants (such as the oak) simply sit the whole game out. That game is the one Darwin called 'artificial selection,' and its rules have never been any different from the ones that govern natural selection. The plant in its wildness proposes new qualities, and then man (or, in the case of natural selection, nature) selects which of those qualities will survive and prosper. But about one rule Darwin was emphatic; as he wrote in The Origin of Species, 'Man does not actually produce variability.' Now he does."" (p. 196)""Yet for reasons we don't completely understand, distinct species do exist in nature, and they exhibit a certain genetic integrity--sex between them, when it does occur, doesn't produce fertile offspring. Nature presumably has some reason for erecting these walls, even if they are permeable on occasion. Perhaps, as some biologists believe, the purpose of keeping species separate is to put barriers in the path of pathogens, to contain their damage so that a single germ can't wipe out life on Earth at a stroke."" (pp. 196-197)""This is, of course, how chemical companies have always handled the problem of pest resistance: by simply introducing a new and improved pesticide every few years. With any luck, the effectiveness of the last one will expire around the same time its patent does.""

He is an incredibly gifted non-fiction writer whose first-person style makes his work as readable as it is educational. This book personifies the foods described and paints them as our partners in consumption and in life."
174,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,5,"Michael Pollan is swiftly solidifying his position as ""somebody I want to know."" He's a clever writer, an inquisitive journalist, and a creative storyteller, as well as a shining light of simple food consciousness in an era of either not asking at all or asking far too much.This book is equal parts natural history, social history, regular history, botanical musing, plant biology, evolutionary theory, and psychology, with a smattering of classical mythology, memoir, neuroscience, and investigative journalism to hold the threads together. Pollan sets out with the aim of tracking four plants along their coevolution with society, tying each to a human desire that shaped it into what it is today: the apple and sweetness, the tulip and beauty, marijuana and intoxication, and potatoes and control. What he ends up writing from this neat little package of a thesis is something much greater than the sum of its parts, a veritable exploration (I use the word a lot but I think it really applies here) of what it means to be human in a determinedly natural world. One of the ideas he returns to often is that our relationship to the natural world is a balancing of Apollonian (controlled, geometric, structured, artificial) and Dionysian (frenetic, shifting, chaotic, and natural) forces, and I think he really hit the nail on the head with the notion as much as with the conclusion that it's a much more complicated relationship than it first appears. The complexity of the question is due in part to the many human urges (such as morality) that don't fit cleanly in either camp, and in part to the ambiguity of the agent in control within the framework of nature's chaos. It's an impressively thoughtful approach, and the broad reach allowed by a philosophical, as opposed to purely scientific, foundation means the reader gets to learn a little about a lot along the way.I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by divulging details of HOW each plant and desire is examined, but I will assure you that the how is not as straightforward and easy as you'd expect. This is becoming a mark of Pollan's writing as much as it always has been a hallmark of great writing: a clear and simple idea considered with breadth and depth in a manner so well-organized that you don't realize how much you're learning until you're done. I cannot wait to read more of his work."
175,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196103-jenn,3,"I thought this was an interesting but long winded book. The author discusses 4 different plants and how they have 'coevolved' with humans to reap the benefits of human interaction. It is best summed up in one of the first chapters of the book as the author ponders if he planted potatoes in his garden out of his own accord of did the potatoes, by virtue of their deliciousness, pursuade him to plant them?One of the main things I learned from this book is the value of diversity. From the loss of heritage apple varieties due to the desire for sickly sweet varieties to the monsanto NewLeaf potatoes that are themselves registered with the EPA as a pesticide i was introduced to this monoculture idea that I didnt know existed. I was shocked to learn about the stringent potato requirements of the fast food industry - only 1 type of potato without blemish is acceptable for french fry production. With the razor slim profit margins of farming a farmer selling to these companies nearly HAS to use GMO crops and/or huge amounts of pesticides to make ends meet.This definitely changed the way I think about organic vs non organic foods. I used to think buying non-organic potatoes was alright, but faced with the fact of what could potentially be in them (one of the potato farmers wouldnt even eat the potatoes he grew) i now feel that i really need to buy local and or organic for the sake of my health."

When you strip aside the somewhat heavy-handed Apollo vs. Dionysus metaphor and the provocative subtitle that suggests that it's plants, not people, who invented agriculture -- that we're essentially only sophisticated bees -- you get a fascinating set of histories of four very interesting plants: apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes. And yes, they co-evolved with people, but that's really nothing surprising or shocking. But it is both entertaining and educational, written well and read (in the audio edition I listened to) superbly.Pollan takes a vast road-trip through history, and although it seems like a pleasantly meandering journey, it's actually quite focused and organized. In the chapter on apples we learn of the real Johnny Appleseed, and of the concept of sweetness, and of how Prohibition changed apple marketing for good. The tulip chapter touches on not only the (obvious) tulip mania speculative bubble, but also on the genetics of tulips and the virus that affected them, and on the idea of floral beauty in different cultures. And so on. There is a bit of moralizing: the drug war comes in for some criticism, and monoculture is reviled as the root of all of industrial agriculture's evil. But I don't disagree with these points!"

As noble as it sounds in theory for man to be in harmony with nature, it becomes clear by his summation in the epilogue that it's nothing less than quite practical. But most of all, it's rewarding.Part of why I must feel this even stronger pull towards plants after finishing was that I think the order of the chapters was well-chosen. The themes on which he hit were introduced best with the apple and finished best with the potato, though I would have to call cannabis and potato my two favorite chapters. Loading up on everything else before you see the contrast of commercial Monsanto-controlled potato farming in Idaho with Michael Pollan's own backyard, you're smart and informed enough on the subject to feel passionate about cultivating a more symbiotic relationship with your environment. Again, which is why I want a nice house with a big garden even more now. "

Rather than us manipulating the traits of our crops, we've been manipulated by them!Though I disagree with this premise (you can never determine an evolutionary reason for something, and it's hardly parsimonious to think of organisms acting as agents of selection on our perceptions of them (and how does this translate to fitness?), leading to us selecting for desirable traits in those organisms), I loved tracing the history of 4 important plants (apple, potato, tulip, marijuana) and their interactions with humans."

Lots of face-palms.The musings on the effects of Marijuana is really uncomfortable.Pollan obviously wrote this chapter while high.He suggests that meditation can get you high like Marijuana, which just isn't true.He rambles on about spirituality, which is bizarre and metaphysical.The potato.Pollan shares with us his ignorance-fueled skepticism about GM crops.He states, falsely, that Monsanto has a patent on the BT gene.In fact, Monsanto's patents cover specific plant genomes with the BT gene inserted at a particular location.The difference being, Monsanto did not come up with the BT gene.What they rightfully call their intellectual property is the work of figuring out how to make the BT gene work inside each plant.Evil patents are no argument against GM crops than they are an argument against pharmaceuticals.His other argument is some philosophical nuance of object vs. subject.He seems to be putting forth an argument for purity.That intentional tampering directly with the genome is different and worse than using ""natural"" techniques like cloning, grafting, crossing, and other forms of artificial selection.Really, there's no functional difference between modifying the sequence of genes with one or another technique.Some techniques, like recombinant genetic engineering, offer more possibilities.Then, he whines about monoculture for a few dozen pages.This part sounds like it's right out of omnivore's dilemma.Apollonian verses Dionysian, blah, blah, blah.I wish Pollan would stick to the fascinating anecdotes."
183,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,4,"In The Botany of Desire Michael Pollan goes into our relationship with four plants: the tulip, marijuana, the apple, and the potato. He looks at these four plants from historical, political, and personal point of view. In many ways this is a fascinating account. For example the first one that goes into the tulip mania that the Dutch got into, which is both comic, and ridiculous at the same time, but of course if we look at the stock market in general, these sorts of things still take place, just in a slightly different way. Are the plants themselves passive victims in all of this or are they active participants is one of the more interesting question that he tries to answer in his book, but of course he can't really prove it one way or the other. Still, he does present the case for them being much more active members in this relationship so well that a question that might have seemed a little silly actually becomes an interesting one. There is one thing about Pollen's writing style, he does tend to take detours, in fact he takes quite a few one of those. This does make the book at times feel a little unfocused, but still it never really got uninteresting, even despite that. I actually got quite a bit of enjoyment out of this read. And I gained some inside into this subject. One can't really ask much more out of a nonfiction book, so I think I may read something else by him. "
184,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"Wonderful, wonderful book, full of fantastic info and insights. My main critique is Pollan's main conceit, and the language used to express it: plant species have domesticated humanity just as much as humanity has domesticated them. My problem is his constant insertion of agency into the process of evolution and mixing metaphors of individuals and of species. Flowers are not individually clever, and neither are species of flowers. Flowers do not manipulate bees in the same way that a botanist manipulates a flower species through artificial selection or genetic modification. Species do not have agency, the will to act. Only individuals have that, and individuals bees, potatoes, or water buffalo do not (to our knowledge), willfully offer themselves up as partners to humanity.Pollan draws an interesting distinction that I haven't encountered in my amateur meanderings between ""wilderness"" and ""wildness."" He uses ""wilderness"" in the sense of the Wilderness Act of 1964, ""an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."" ""Wildness,"" on the other hand, is anything that humans cannot control. As Bill McKibben famously pointed out, the atmosphere of our planet is no longer a wilderness, tainted as it is by the byproducts of our industry, but as every hurricane and tornado reminds us, it is still profoundly wild.Pollan uses this distinction to emphasize that while all domestication is a destruction of wilderness, it is almost never an abolition of wildness. The gardener uses his sense of order not to control his plants absolutely, but to guide and shape their wildness in certain ways. He goes on to suggest that genetic engineering may violate this pact, that by attempting to guide evolution on such a basic level is a powerful new way to write wildness out of the equation. He also offers the counterpoint that current techniques for gene insertion are (sometimes literally) so scattershot as to yield results that are even less predictable that conventional breeding.The topic of wilderness feeds into another interesting point, which is that ""memory is the enemy of wonder"" (168). He argues that cannabinoids like THC help us experience awe and wonder by forcing constant short term memory loss, and that meditation or physical exertion probably induce the same effect, making the view from a mountain peak infinitely more profound after having hiked to it instead of having driven.Another insight he had about marijuana is that drugs could be considered the mutagens of culture. If one assumes a meme is like a gene, then a culture is like a genome. Memes are constantly recombining through thought and discourse (intercourse in both culture and biology), but genuinely new ideas are rare. At the risk of spreading a metaphor too thin, Pollan suggests that drugs could be thought of as mutagens, radiation nuking the genetic fundaments of culture, producing mostly irrelevant or deleterious nonsense, but now and again creating viable gems (149). Kind of a fun thought."
185,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark,3,"This guy has inspired me to grow my own food and keep a few hens in the backyard. Being a little self-reliant in these unsettling times gives me a sense of stability and hope.In this book, Pollan takes a look at four plants and relates them to human desires, I think . . . He starts things off with the apple and goes into a bit of long-winded ramble about Johnny Appleseed's quest to sell his trees to pioneers and his lust for a 10 year old bride (fortunately this bit wasn't dug into with any sort of detail). Johnny's enthusiasm for the apple and his desire to plant the seed (and refusal to graft) results in the many varieties that adapted to new climates. Though I'm learning a lot about Johnny here, I'd rather have more factoids about the apple. I'm hoping the following chapters are more interesting because I find my mind wandering more than usual while listening to this.I've now finished up the tulip section and made it about halfway through the marijuana chapter but, at this point, I have come to the realization that this book just doesn't interest me. It's very repetitive and meandering. I'll finish it up and hope the potato's treatment can grab me enough to get through it.Later: I finished up and did find the potato section much more interesting but that's because I'm always interested in GMO foods, the science, the corruption, the danger to our society, the greed . . . I didn't really learn anything new as this was written quite a few years ago but it still captured my attention all the same. "
186,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/610744-luke,3,"The Botany of Desire was written in language that made it obvious that Michael Pollan likes to hear himself write. His ideas were interesting, following four plants, the potato, cannabis, the apple, and the tulip through their journey with mankind. I like how he approaches the topic, observing not only what people have done to the plants to develop them to our own use, but also how the plants have in some ways used us for their own ends. It is true that we, while we think we are masters of our own destinies, are intimately tied to the world around us. there is an ecological cause and effect that often escapes us because of our anthropogenic perspective. My argument with the book is that Pollan overuses imagery from Greek mythology and as a result becomes tedious to read in some sections. By far the most interesting is the last section on the interaction between humanity and the potato. "

188,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6894205-allie,2,"Do you talk to your plants? More to the point, do you think your plants talk back to you? If so, I have just the book for you…The Botany of Desire explores the relationship between plants and humans, but rather than focusing on human agency, food journalist and gardener Michael Pollan tells the story from the plants’ point of view. He takes the idea of co-evolution as his starting point: the idea that two species evolve in a mutually dependent manner leading to the selection of certain traits. Pollan attempts to apply this evolutionary concept to human interactions with plants.* 
""Plants hit on a remarkably clever strategy: getting us to move or think for them…it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees.""
Reading this book was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope; the perspective felt distorted. I was not persuaded that Pollan completely understood some of the scientific concepts that he was trying to explain. It all felt a little…Gladwell-esque. Pollan tries to illustrate the intertwined evolutionary relationship between plants and humans by telling the story of four plants and the desires that they satisfy. Sweetness: the first section focused on apples and the story of John Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed). Pollan dedicates many, many pages to Chapman’s life and his ‘Dionysian’ apple planting efforts, which allowed homesteaders to get reliably drunk on alcoholic cider. (Inspired by this chapter, I created a drinking game where I had a sip of scotch every time Pollan mentioned Dionysus or Apollo. I was forced to abandon this delightful crutch since there were so many references to both gods, I was getting woozy.) Beauty: the second section covered the speculative boom and bust around tulip mania in Holland, with some random thoughts about flowers throughout history and some general ideas around beauty (e.g., symmetry is appealing as a proxy for good health). There were a lot of opinion-led statements such as 
“beauty always takes place in the particular”
 that didn’t resonate with me; I find the ocean more beautiful in its entirety than a solitary wave. Intoxication: by far the most interesting, the third section discussed how humans seek intoxication through plants, which produce stimulants like caffeine, nicotine, THC, and hallucinogens. There is some fascinating published research about these drugs, but Pollan spirals away from the science to speculate on how THC mediates consciousness and can enhance creativity by blunting memory and creating the perception of heightened senses. (Huxley is referenced, which is never a good sign. Also, you can apparently get high from hallucinogens secreted by some toads.) Control over the natural environment: the final section is all about the humble potato, from the diverse varieties grown by the Aztecs to the Irish famine to Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potatoes. Pollan is in his element here as a food journalist, talking to scientists about gene transfer and farmers about the impact of GMO potatoes on their livelihoods. This section raised interesting concerns about the unintended consequences of tinkering with the plant genome since genes can “jump” to other plants via cross-pollination and their impact on the rest of the food chain is unknown.Perhaps if Pollan had focused on just one of the four desires, it would have been a more cohesive reading experience. But while there are interesting facts peppered throughout each chapter, the book attempts to cover so many different ideas that are only tangentially related, there was no space for thoughtful analysis. After finishing the book, I’m still not convinced by the author’s premise that: 
""Desire might be too strong a word for whatever it is that drives plants to reinvent themselves so that we might do their bidding, but then, our own designs have often been no more willful than the plants.""
Honestly, finishing this book was a Herculean task; only my determination not to disappoint my friend Scot who was reading the book with me enabled me to climb this metaphorical Mount Olympus. (Where, I should note, I looked down at all the plants from my lofty perch. Not a toad in sight up here!) It’s a shame, because Pollan writes beautifully, and could probably be very compelling if he was covering a topic where he has more expertise.*This is a established concept in biology applied to relationships between plants and pollinating insects or animals; predators and prey; pathogens and humans; and some domesticated animals (like dogs) and humans. The idea that plants and humans have a co-evolutionary relationship does not seem to be well-supported in the scientific literature. I mean, it’s not as far out there as the people who claim plants are silently screaming when we cut them down, but it’s pretty fringe."

191,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558460-caterina,4,"What if we humans are being manipulated by plants to serve their desires? From this slightly creepy flipped perspective, masterful storyteller Michael Pollan illuminates the crazy and complex interdependency of living things -- and also, some of the dangers we inflict on ourselves and our entire world by contemporary agricultural practices -- through four stories - and what stories! -- of the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. (Ok, he admits the conceit of manipulative plants to be a bit of a stretch -- but it's a fascinating way to see how we and our favorite foods, flowers, and intoxicants are, for better or worse, co-evolving.)Biggest surprise of the book - the potato's story turned out to be the most interesting and important (really, after marijuana?) and the best showcase of Pollan's skills as an investigative journalist/interviewer and experimental gardener. Who knew, for example, that Monsanto scientists created genetically engineered potato plants with a ""gene gun"" that uses a .22 shell to fire DNA-coated stainless steel projectiles into potato leaves in the hope that some of the alien DNA (from some non-potato species) combine with the plant's own DNA? Unless, as a Yankee from Connecticut, Pollan was being set up for a huge Southern joke -- which seems to me a distinct possibility -- this actually happened at the Monsanto lab he visited in Missouri. But possible joke aside, this story contained the most intelligent and nuanced discussion of genetic modification of foods that I've ever seen, with input from numerous scientists and farmers, as well as exploring the advantages and dangers of monoculture and colonial commodity agriculture (and some of its horrific history), chemical versus organic agriculture, and the effects of food culture on farming. Also, Michael Pollan clearly just loves to grow and eat potatoes -- it may be his relish that gave this story its extra glow. (Without ever mentioning vodka.)I also especially loved the apple's story, with the mysterious Dionysian and yet somehow pure, childlike figure of Johnny Appleseed spreading seeds -- not for nice wholesome lunchbox treats but for alcohol, and plenty of it, in the wilds of Pennsylvania and Ohio. (The woods I played in, growing up in southwestern Pennsylvania, were full of abandoned and decrepit old apple trees -- I had no idea of their history.) As this book came out in 2001 the MJ story was a bit dated, and although it focused on why the plant was so strongly prohibited, it never mentioned what I understand to be the two biggest reasons -- racism/anti-Mexican sentiment, and pressure by the American pharmaceutical industry. Nor does the current battle between states and federal government come up (which maybe echoes historic battles over hard cider and whiskey). Nevertheless, all four stories are surprising and fascinating, combining investigative journalism (involving quite a bit of travel), personal experimentation, and a good dose of wild imaginative speculation -- sometimes fueled by that experimentation."
192,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666,4,"Michael Pollan's book is certainly an interesting one. It germinates (pun intended) in Pollan's mind, one day, as he was working in his garden. He thought what if human beings were similar to bumblebees? It is an interesting take on ""coevolution"", which stipulates that two parties can act on each other to advance their individual interests but end up producing a mutually beneficial outcome.What if plants were able to develop traits that would cause other animals to help them in their goal to reproduce? As plants are immobile, they tend to rely on wind and rain to spread their pollen. But with the evolution of angiosperms, plants with flowers and seeds, animals had a new reason to eat those plants and they spread the seeds for the plant, or pollen in the case of the bee.He then stipulates that the four plants he covers have also evolved in such a way as to appeal to the human animal and, by doing so, have been able to spread their seed all across the world. The four plants he looks at are perfect examples of how they have managed to ""attract"" human beings. Pollan also links each of these plants to a specific desire. They are as follows:The apple, which utilizes the sense of sweetness.The Tulip, which utilizes the sense of beauty.The potato, which utilizes the sense of control.The marijuana plant, which utilizes the sense of intoxication.Each of these plants gets a detailed history. You will learn where they came from, how they were modified and how they entered into the human world. The stories are interesting, though I could have done with less of the personal ruminations, it is the history and the science behind these four plants that make this an interesting book to read.It is hardly overly technical and quite easy for a science dunce to comprehend. If you are looking for something more science-heavy, I'd pass on this. This is a book that tells the tale of science through the prism of human desire. Pollan does a good job of explaining things like the Diyonisian concepts and how they melded into how humans view intoxication and their views on marijuana.An interesting book that will make you think and while not science-heavy, this is a book that will interest science and non-science people alike. Interesting anecdotes and some cool history make this a rather unique book."

I mean, I want to know about Michael Pollan, he is huge and important, right? And everybody in Berkeley wants him to be Obama's Secretary of Agriculture. (Though I guess I haven't read Obama's books, so.) I liked it! I was kind of surprised, I think I was expecting something dryer. Mostly it was just this pretty smart guy talking about stuff he likes: natural selection, Johnny Appleseed, weed stories, people, Dionysus, bugs and genetically modified foods. I thought it was pretty great how in the beginning he was like, Here are four things I'm going to talk about, but then he didn't tell you what he was gonna say about 'em- like, you know the last chapter's gonna be about potatoes, but you don't know that it's going to be a conversation about the safety of genetically modified potatoes. And dude loves his plants, which is nice. It felt pretty repetitive at times, just saying the same stuff over and over, and that definitely got boring, but whatever. I was sucked in enough to bust through it between bouts of neck-pain sleep on planes and buses and trains while I was on the east coast for three days, which is more than I can say for bell hooks, who's all writing stuff I have to pay attention to and think critically about.

194,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,3,"An earlier Pollan book, and a bestseller. Like the later, better, books, Botany explores its thesis, that the plants co-evolve with us, in four sections. There is some fluff here; the best section is easily on the one on intoxication. Doubters should read the introduction and skip to section 3.Pollan's best stuff always makes me see the world differently, and this passage changed the way I conceived of gardens, what they are, and what they could be:""I sometimes think we've allowed our gardens to be bowdlerized, that the full range of their powers and possibilities has been sacrificed to a cult of plant prettiness that obscures more dubious truths about nature, our own included. It hasn't always been this way, and we may someday come to regard the contemporary garden of vegetables and flowers as a place almost Victorian in its repressions and elisions.""He goes on to discuss a witch's garden, which included intoxicants and medicines, rather than just beautiful flowers. He argues that when the church murdered witches, they converted the contents of these gardens from taboo objects to medicines made acceptable by what we'd now call physicians. I'm sure I'm bastardizing the argument, but it was interesting. Great chapter.And here is one on what might be Pollan's greatest weakness as a reporter but what is also his greatest strength as a writer: ""I am literally absentminded, prone to be thinking about something else, something past, when I am ostensibly having a fresh experience.""Of the other chapters, the best is on potatoes, and the other two are about apples and tulips.As for the books, I still rate Omnivore, Cooked, and A Place of My Own ahead of this one, but if you broke it down to chapters, Botany's chapter on intoxication would jump ahead to the top five Pollan chapters, alongside the Omnivore stuff and Cooked's chapter on fermented foods."
195,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Not as good as the Omnivore's Dilemma, but definitely worth a read if you love thinking about plants as much as I do.The first section, on apples, was really dry (to me). Actually, it's less about apples and more about John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) and I just... don't... care about him. Right, great, he planted lots of apples, we get it, he's a hometown hero. The rest is pretty well done, though. I especially loved the section on cannabis. I harbour a lot of curiosity as to how psychotropic plants and humans have co-evolved, and why exactly certain plants have developed those mechanisms, and how we humans came to have a neurology that happened to respond to those plants' chemicals. So that was extremely engrossing.Tulips also held my interest pretty aggressively, for similar reasons. The subject of why we even like and are drawn to things as seemingly useless (evolutionarily speaking) as flowers is fascinating. It's much easier to know without having to read a book that apples or potatoes and humans have fed off one another in time. Tulips are a little bit more intriguing.I like Pollan's dry humour but also his rich curiosity, but I suspect that when he wrote this book, what was really on his mind was his next book. The section on potatoes is essentially a short verse of the Omnivore's Dilemma. In the Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan seemed more enthusiastic about the material and more concerned with the topic (not that he isn't here, but he really hits his stride there). "

I personally liked the sections on apple and potatoes, while I found the tulip and marijuana chapters less engaging. The last section, that explains the practice and risks of mono-culture and the processes of genetics manipulation employed by large corporations (e.g. Monsanto) were fascinating and scaring at the same time.3.5 stars rounded down because I found the repetition of the Apollo-Dionysus metaphor annoying and pompous in its tone.Fav.

It seems that by the time the singular beauty of a flower in bloom can no longer pierce the veil of black or obsessive thoughts in a person’s mind, that mind’s connection to the sensual world has grown dangerously frayed.

197,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,3,"A very interesting description of the symbiotic relationships that exist between humans and plants -- specifically, apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes.Humans select certain beneficial species of plants, and specific individual plants within that species for culturing and propagation. Those plants then (over generations) alter their genetics to transform themselves into even more desirable individuals of their species. The human benefit is obvious, but the plant also benefits because humans cultivate many times more of that species of plant than would ever occur naturally.The history and the science fascinated me, but I felt that some of the book was a bit repetitive and in a few places difficult to follow the flow and narrative."
198,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2163177-kishor,5,"Mr Pollan uses The Botany of Desire to posit that the nature of our relationship with plants is a lot more nuanced than it seems at first glance. While we may have succeeded in domesticating a large number of photosynthetic species, they in turn are exerting various influences on mankind. In the process of regaling us with stories of four specific plants, he manages to lay a wealth of information on the reader. The four plants are the apple (symbolizing sweetness), the tulip (beauty), marijuana (intoxication), and the potato (control).Here are some interesting things I learnt about each of them:Apple trees grown from seed produce really bitter fruit; grafting allows the cloning of trees with good fruit at the cost of loss of genetic diversity. Produce from the former type of tree was (and is?) primarily used for producing cider and applejack; Johnny ""Appleseed"" Chapman, it turns out, was responsible for keeping the American frontier well lubricated with spirits.The tulip flower is colored by two chemicals; a base layer of pigment and another (anthocyanin) on top. Famous beauties amongst the tulip family (check out the Semper Augustus, it's *amazing*) are patterned due to the activity of a virus that causes the anthocyanin to degrade, allowing the base layer to be seen. The author draws on Apollo and Dionysus heavily in this chapter, contrasting the Apollonian austerity and order of the tulip with the Dionysian seduction of other flowers like the peony and the rose.The marijuana plant diverged at some point in history to grow as two different varieties - the indica strain is much more potent and can withstand frost, while the sativa strain gives the consumer a ""clear, bell-like high"" but requires equatorial climes to grow. Growers have hybridized the two, thereby combining their strengths and downplaying their weaknesses. An interesting point that Michael brings up in this section is that humanity is constantly seeking out ways to alter its state of consciousness; in fact, this is a thing we do even as children, be it by consuming sugary snacks, spinning around fast until dizziness causes visual hallucinations, holding our breath until we spots, and so on. Adults do this too, through the mechanisms of ""meditation, fasting, exercise, amusement park rides, ..., music, eating spicy foods"", etc. The human body has its own cannabinoid system, and produces a THC-like neurotransmitter named ""anandamide"" by the discoverer; the name stems from ""ananda"", the Sanskrit word for bliss.He uses his section on the potato to talk about genetic engineering, again weaving a narrative of Apollonian order vs Dionysian wildness. Mr Pollan planted in his garden the potato known as the NewLeaf, engineered by the Monsanto corporation, producing its own insecticide in its leaves. While this helps fight the evil Colorado potato beetle and saves farmers from having to coat their fields with nasty chemicals, it means that agriculture is moving towards a monoculture and a subsequent loss of biodiversity. The organic farmer who seeds their fields with a variety of crop, however, doesn't care about the susceptibilities of any one plant; the overall crop is always (barring bizarre tornadoes, I mean) guaranteed to do fine.All this plant talk makes me want to take up gardening!"
199,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"This is another time where I've read a book and only come back to write the review many, many, many months later. In this case, I read the book (listened to the Audible, technically) back in March 2017 and now I'm reviewing it in January 2018. The reason it's taken so long is that I flagged several passages for transcription into my notes, and I only just now got around to doing it. (19 notes in an hour is actually pretty good for me.)So I'll just have to leave you with some vague impressions.For one, Michael Pollan can write. I was struck--going through and transcribing some of my notes--once again by the variety and precision of his language. He is a really, really great writer. Quick sample:Imagine a moment when the sensation of honey or sugar on the tongue was an astonishment, a kind of intoxication. The closest I've ever come to recovering such a sense of sweetness was secondhand, though it left a powerful impression on me ever so. I'm thinking of my son's first experience of sugar: the icing on the cake at his first birthday. I have only the testimony of Isaac's face to go by (that, and his fierceness to repeat the experience), but it was plain that his first encounter with sugar had intoxicated him--was in fact an ecstasy, in the literal sense of the word. That is, he was beside himself with the pleasure of it, no longer her with me in space and time in quite the same way he had been just a moment before. Between bites Isaac gazed up at me in amazement (he was on my lap, and I was delivering the ambrosial forkfuls to his gaping mouth) as if to exclaim, ""Your world contains this? From this day forward I shall dedicate my life to it."" (Which he basically has done.) And I remember thinking, this is no minor desire, and then wondered: Could it be that sweetness is the prototype of all desire?I almost feel like this talent is lost on non-fiction. Why isn't Pollan writing novels?(Just went and checked. He hasn't written any. He did get both his BA and MA in English, though. So that goes some distance to explaining his writing chops.)The passage above is also a good example of Pollan's wide-ranging syntheses. He's very good at pulling from pretty disparate sources in surprising and illuminating ways.The most powerful passages of the book for me were the ones about Johnny Appleseed. I was really impressed by how Pollan was able to bring some historical weight along with almost mythic significance to the story, and was surprised again and again by what I learned about apples (along with, later, potatoes and tulips. Cannabis was less impressive.)I can see where critics can find fault with the book. Because it's a broad approach, it is also a little thin and shallow in spots. I'm fine with that. More often than not, the problem with 200-page popular science books is that they have way too little material and far too much padding. Although there are a few patchy spots, in general Pollan never runs out of ideas or material, and the book is satisfyingly compelling from page 1 on to the end."

It took me three years to get around to reading this book, but I'm glad I finally did. It's a bit more metaphysical than the other books I've read by him, but still very informative and interesting. I was fascinated by his exploration of the four different kinds of plants and the human desires sated by each. And I was amused by his continual revisitation of the Dionysus/Apollo metaphor throughout the book. interesting quotes:""So the question arose in my mind that day: Did I choose to plant these potatoes, or did the potato make me do it? In fact, both statements are true...Yet evolution consists of an infinitude of trivial, unconscious events, and in the evolution of the potato my reading of a particular seed catalog on a particular January evening counts as one of them."" (p. xv)""Domesticated species don't command our respect the way their wild cousins often do. Evolution may reward interdependence, but our thinking selves continue to prize self-reliance. The wolf is somehow more impressive than the dog. Yet there are fifty million dogs in America today, only ten thousand wolves. So what does the dog know about getting along in this world that its wild ancestor doesn't? The big thing the dog knows about-the subject matter it has mastered in the ten thousand years it has been evolving at our side-is us: our needs and desires, our emotions and values, all of which it has folded into its genes as part of a sophisticated strategy for survival."" (pp. xvi-xvii)""The four desires I explore here are sweetness, broadly defined, in the story of the apple;beauty in the tulip's;intoxication in the story of cannibis; and control in the story of the potato-specifically, in the story of a genetically altered potato I grew in my garden to see where the ancient arts of domestication may now be headed. (p. xviii)""Every wild apple shrub excites our expectations thus,"" Thoreau wrote, ""somewhat as every wild child. It is, perhaps, a prince in disguise. What a lesson to man!...Poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures, and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men."" (p. 45)""Symmetry is an unmistakable sign that there's relevant information in a place. That's because symmetry is a property shared by a relatively small number of things in the landscape, all of them of keen interest to us. The shortlist of nature's symmetricals includes other creatures, other people (most notably the faces of other people), human artifacts, and plants--but especially flowers. Symmetry is also a sign of health in a creature, since mutations and environmental stresses can easily disturb it. So paying attention to symmetrical things makes good sense: symmetry is usually significant."" (p. 76)""Though we self-importantly regard domestication as something people have done to plants, it is at the same time a strategy by which the plants have exploited us and our desires--even our most idiosyncratic notions of beauty--to advance their own interests. Depending on the environment in which a species finds itself, different adaptations will avail. Mutations that nature would have rejected out of hand in the wild sometimes prove to be brilliant adaptations in an environment that's been shaped by human desire."" (p. 81)""Although by any conventional measure it is folly to pay thousands for a tulip bulb (or for that matter an Internet stock), as long as there is an even greater fool out there willing to pay even more, doing so is the most logical thing in the world."" (p. 103)""Yet this new biotechnology has overthrown the old rules governing the relationship of nature and culture in a plant. Domestication has never been a simple one-way process in which our species has controlled others; other species participate only so far as their interests are served, and many plants (such as the oak) simply sit the whole game out. That game is the one Darwin called 'artificial selection,' and its rules have never been any different from the ones that govern natural selection. The plant in its wildness proposes new qualities, and then man (or, in the case of natural selection, nature) selects which of those qualities will survive and prosper. But about one rule Darwin was emphatic; as he wrote in The Origin of Species, 'Man does not actually produce variability.' Now he does."" (p. 196)""Yet for reasons we don't completely understand, distinct species do exist in nature, and they exhibit a certain genetic integrity--sex between them, when it does occur, doesn't produce fertile offspring. Nature presumably has some reason for erecting these walls, even if they are permeable on occasion. Perhaps, as some biologists believe, the purpose of keeping species separate is to put barriers in the path of pathogens, to contain their damage so that a single germ can't wipe out life on Earth at a stroke."" (pp. 196-197)""This is, of course, how chemical companies have always handled the problem of pest resistance: by simply introducing a new and improved pesticide every few years. With any luck, the effectiveness of the last one will expire around the same time its patent does.""

202,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6879819-susan-defreitas,5,This book changed how I see plants and our relationship with them. I also now have an irrational desire to grow apple trees from seed and plant them everywhere. =)
203,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67444659-katie-hamilton,4,"Reading Pollan’s work feels like a conversation with him in the most casual setting, discussing science, while also chuckling every so often at his comments strategically placed in parentheses. He is an incredibly gifted non-fiction writer whose first-person style makes his work as readable as it is educational. This book personifies the foods described and paints them as our partners in consumption and in life."
204,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,5,"Michael Pollan is swiftly solidifying his position as ""somebody I want to know."" He's a clever writer, an inquisitive journalist, and a creative storyteller, as well as a shining light of simple food consciousness in an era of either not asking at all or asking far too much.This book is equal parts natural history, social history, regular history, botanical musing, plant biology, evolutionary theory, and psychology, with a smattering of classical mythology, memoir, neuroscience, and investigative journalism to hold the threads together. Pollan sets out with the aim of tracking four plants along their coevolution with society, tying each to a human desire that shaped it into what it is today: the apple and sweetness, the tulip and beauty, marijuana and intoxication, and potatoes and control. What he ends up writing from this neat little package of a thesis is something much greater than the sum of its parts, a veritable exploration (I use the word a lot but I think it really applies here) of what it means to be human in a determinedly natural world. One of the ideas he returns to often is that our relationship to the natural world is a balancing of Apollonian (controlled, geometric, structured, artificial) and Dionysian (frenetic, shifting, chaotic, and natural) forces, and I think he really hit the nail on the head with the notion as much as with the conclusion that it's a much more complicated relationship than it first appears. The complexity of the question is due in part to the many human urges (such as morality) that don't fit cleanly in either camp, and in part to the ambiguity of the agent in control within the framework of nature's chaos. It's an impressively thoughtful approach, and the broad reach allowed by a philosophical, as opposed to purely scientific, foundation means the reader gets to learn a little about a lot along the way.I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by divulging details of HOW each plant and desire is examined, but I will assure you that the how is not as straightforward and easy as you'd expect. This is becoming a mark of Pollan's writing as much as it always has been a hallmark of great writing: a clear and simple idea considered with breadth and depth in a manner so well-organized that you don't realize how much you're learning until you're done. I cannot wait to read more of his work."
205,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196103-jenn,3,"I thought this was an interesting but long winded book. The author discusses 4 different plants and how they have 'coevolved' with humans to reap the benefits of human interaction. It is best summed up in one of the first chapters of the book as the author ponders if he planted potatoes in his garden out of his own accord of did the potatoes, by virtue of their deliciousness, pursuade him to plant them?One of the main things I learned from this book is the value of diversity. From the loss of heritage apple varieties due to the desire for sickly sweet varieties to the monsanto NewLeaf potatoes that are themselves registered with the EPA as a pesticide i was introduced to this monoculture idea that I didnt know existed. I was shocked to learn about the stringent potato requirements of the fast food industry - only 1 type of potato without blemish is acceptable for french fry production. With the razor slim profit margins of farming a farmer selling to these companies nearly HAS to use GMO crops and/or huge amounts of pesticides to make ends meet.This definitely changed the way I think about organic vs non organic foods. I used to think buying non-organic potatoes was alright, but faced with the fact of what could potentially be in them (one of the potato farmers wouldnt even eat the potatoes he grew) i now feel that i really need to buy local and or organic for the sake of my health."
206,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914674-isis,5,"I liked this book even better than The Omnivore's Dilemma. When you strip aside the somewhat heavy-handed Apollo vs. Dionysus metaphor and the provocative subtitle that suggests that it's plants, not people, who invented agriculture -- that we're essentially only sophisticated bees -- you get a fascinating set of histories of four very interesting plants: apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes. And yes, they co-evolved with people, but that's really nothing surprising or shocking. But it is both entertaining and educational, written well and read (in the audio edition I listened to) superbly.Pollan takes a vast road-trip through history, and although it seems like a pleasantly meandering journey, it's actually quite focused and organized. In the chapter on apples we learn of the real Johnny Appleseed, and of the concept of sweetness, and of how Prohibition changed apple marketing for good. The tulip chapter touches on not only the (obvious) tulip mania speculative bubble, but also on the genetics of tulips and the virus that affected them, and on the idea of floral beauty in different cultures. And so on. There is a bit of moralizing: the drug war comes in for some criticism, and monoculture is reviled as the root of all of industrial agriculture's evil. But I don't disagree with these points!"
207,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431129-brian,4,"By the end of this book, I really wanted to have Michael Pollan's life, more or less. Though I'd settle for a nice house somewhere where I can have a big garden with all types of plants like his; that was the main attraction, along with the requisite knowledge and experience of nature itself and the nature of how things grow, in a word. As noble as it sounds in theory for man to be in harmony with nature, it becomes clear by his summation in the epilogue that it's nothing less than quite practical. But most of all, it's rewarding.Part of why I must feel this even stronger pull towards plants after finishing was that I think the order of the chapters was well-chosen. The themes on which he hit were introduced best with the apple and finished best with the potato, though I would have to call cannabis and potato my two favorite chapters. Loading up on everything else before you see the contrast of commercial Monsanto-controlled potato farming in Idaho with Michael Pollan's own backyard, you're smart and informed enough on the subject to feel passionate about cultivating a more symbiotic relationship with your environment. Again, which is why I want a nice house with a big garden even more now. "
208,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249241-meg,5,"The author adds a wrinkle to our thoughts about domestication by arguing that plants have selected for a preference for their qualities in humans, leading to their cultivation, ensuring their survival.

Lots of face-palms.The musings on the effects of Marijuana is really uncomfortable.Pollan obviously wrote this chapter while high.He suggests that meditation can get you high like Marijuana, which just isn't true.He rambles on about spirituality, which is bizarre and metaphysical.The potato.Pollan shares with us his ignorance-fueled skepticism about GM crops.He states, falsely, that Monsanto has a patent on the BT gene.In fact, Monsanto's patents cover specific plant genomes with the BT gene inserted at a particular location.The difference being, Monsanto did not come up with the BT gene.What they rightfully call their intellectual property is the work of figuring out how to make the BT gene work inside each plant.Evil patents are no argument against GM crops than they are an argument against pharmaceuticals.His other argument is some philosophical nuance of object vs. subject.He seems to be putting forth an argument for purity.That intentional tampering directly with the genome is different and worse than using ""natural"" techniques like cloning, grafting, crossing, and other forms of artificial selection.Really, there's no functional difference between modifying the sequence of genes with one or another technique.Some techniques, like recombinant genetic engineering, offer more possibilities.Then, he whines about monoculture for a few dozen pages.This part sounds like it's right out of omnivore's dilemma.Apollonian verses Dionysian, blah, blah, blah.I wish Pollan would stick to the fascinating anecdotes."
213,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,4,"In The Botany of Desire Michael Pollan goes into our relationship with four plants: the tulip, marijuana, the apple, and the potato. He looks at these four plants from historical, political, and personal point of view. In many ways this is a fascinating account. For example the first one that goes into the tulip mania that the Dutch got into, which is both comic, and ridiculous at the same time, but of course if we look at the stock market in general, these sorts of things still take place, just in a slightly different way. Are the plants themselves passive victims in all of this or are they active participants is one of the more interesting question that he tries to answer in his book, but of course he can't really prove it one way or the other. Still, he does present the case for them being much more active members in this relationship so well that a question that might have seemed a little silly actually becomes an interesting one. There is one thing about Pollen's writing style, he does tend to take detours, in fact he takes quite a few one of those. This does make the book at times feel a little unfocused, but still it never really got uninteresting, even despite that. I actually got quite a bit of enjoyment out of this read. And I gained some inside into this subject. One can't really ask much more out of a nonfiction book, so I think I may read something else by him. "
214,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"Wonderful, wonderful book, full of fantastic info and insights. My main critique is Pollan's main conceit, and the language used to express it: plant species have domesticated humanity just as much as humanity has domesticated them. My problem is his constant insertion of agency into the process of evolution and mixing metaphors of individuals and of species. Flowers are not individually clever, and neither are species of flowers. Flowers do not manipulate bees in the same way that a botanist manipulates a flower species through artificial selection or genetic modification. Species do not have agency, the will to act. Only individuals have that, and individuals bees, potatoes, or water buffalo do not (to our knowledge), willfully offer themselves up as partners to humanity.Pollan draws an interesting distinction that I haven't encountered in my amateur meanderings between ""wilderness"" and ""wildness."" He uses ""wilderness"" in the sense of the Wilderness Act of 1964, ""an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."" ""Wildness,"" on the other hand, is anything that humans cannot control. As Bill McKibben famously pointed out, the atmosphere of our planet is no longer a wilderness, tainted as it is by the byproducts of our industry, but as every hurricane and tornado reminds us, it is still profoundly wild.Pollan uses this distinction to emphasize that while all domestication is a destruction of wilderness, it is almost never an abolition of wildness. The gardener uses his sense of order not to control his plants absolutely, but to guide and shape their wildness in certain ways. He goes on to suggest that genetic engineering may violate this pact, that by attempting to guide evolution on such a basic level is a powerful new way to write wildness out of the equation. He also offers the counterpoint that current techniques for gene insertion are (sometimes literally) so scattershot as to yield results that are even less predictable that conventional breeding.The topic of wilderness feeds into another interesting point, which is that ""memory is the enemy of wonder"" (168). He argues that cannabinoids like THC help us experience awe and wonder by forcing constant short term memory loss, and that meditation or physical exertion probably induce the same effect, making the view from a mountain peak infinitely more profound after having hiked to it instead of having driven.Another insight he had about marijuana is that drugs could be considered the mutagens of culture. If one assumes a meme is like a gene, then a culture is like a genome. Memes are constantly recombining through thought and discourse (intercourse in both culture and biology), but genuinely new ideas are rare. At the risk of spreading a metaphor too thin, Pollan suggests that drugs could be thought of as mutagens, radiation nuking the genetic fundaments of culture, producing mostly irrelevant or deleterious nonsense, but now and again creating viable gems (149). Kind of a fun thought."
215,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark,3,"This guy has inspired me to grow my own food and keep a few hens in the backyard. Being a little self-reliant in these unsettling times gives me a sense of stability and hope.In this book, Pollan takes a look at four plants and relates them to human desires, I think . . . He starts things off with the apple and goes into a bit of long-winded ramble about Johnny Appleseed's quest to sell his trees to pioneers and his lust for a 10 year old bride (fortunately this bit wasn't dug into with any sort of detail). Johnny's enthusiasm for the apple and his desire to plant the seed (and refusal to graft) results in the many varieties that adapted to new climates. Though I'm learning a lot about Johnny here, I'd rather have more factoids about the apple. I'm hoping the following chapters are more interesting because I find my mind wandering more than usual while listening to this.I've now finished up the tulip section and made it about halfway through the marijuana chapter but, at this point, I have come to the realization that this book just doesn't interest me. It's very repetitive and meandering. I'll finish it up and hope the potato's treatment can grab me enough to get through it.Later: I finished up and did find the potato section much more interesting but that's because I'm always interested in GMO foods, the science, the corruption, the danger to our society, the greed . . . I didn't really learn anything new as this was written quite a few years ago but it still captured my attention all the same. "
216,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/610744-luke,3,"The Botany of Desire was written in language that made it obvious that Michael Pollan likes to hear himself write. His ideas were interesting, following four plants, the potato, cannabis, the apple, and the tulip through their journey with mankind. I like how he approaches the topic, observing not only what people have done to the plants to develop them to our own use, but also how the plants have in some ways used us for their own ends. It is true that we, while we think we are masters of our own destinies, are intimately tied to the world around us. there is an ecological cause and effect that often escapes us because of our anthropogenic perspective. My argument with the book is that Pollan overuses imagery from Greek mythology and as a result becomes tedious to read in some sections. By far the most interesting is the last section on the interaction between humanity and the potato. "
217,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2967061-anne,4,"The same brilliant and creative thinking which I recall from my first read. The marijuana section is a bit dated at least in my state, CO, but otherwise, this book held up well."
218,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6894205-allie,2,"Do you talk to your plants? More to the point, do you think your plants talk back to you? If so, I have just the book for you…The Botany of Desire explores the relationship between plants and humans, but rather than focusing on human agency, food journalist and gardener Michael Pollan tells the story from the plants’ point of view. He takes the idea of co-evolution as his starting point: the idea that two species evolve in a mutually dependent manner leading to the selection of certain traits. Pollan attempts to apply this evolutionary concept to human interactions with plants.* 
""Plants hit on a remarkably clever strategy: getting us to move or think for them…it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees.""
Reading this book was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope; the perspective felt distorted. I was not persuaded that Pollan completely understood some of the scientific concepts that he was trying to explain. It all felt a little…Gladwell-esque. Pollan tries to illustrate the intertwined evolutionary relationship between plants and humans by telling the story of four plants and the desires that they satisfy. Sweetness: the first section focused on apples and the story of John Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed). Pollan dedicates many, many pages to Chapman’s life and his ‘Dionysian’ apple planting efforts, which allowed homesteaders to get reliably drunk on alcoholic cider. (Inspired by this chapter, I created a drinking game where I had a sip of scotch every time Pollan mentioned Dionysus or Apollo. I was forced to abandon this delightful crutch since there were so many references to both gods, I was getting woozy.) Beauty: the second section covered the speculative boom and bust around tulip mania in Holland, with some random thoughts about flowers throughout history and some general ideas around beauty (e.g., symmetry is appealing as a proxy for good health). There were a lot of opinion-led statements such as 
“beauty always takes place in the particular”
 that didn’t resonate with me; I find the ocean more beautiful in its entirety than a solitary wave. Intoxication: by far the most interesting, the third section discussed how humans seek intoxication through plants, which produce stimulants like caffeine, nicotine, THC, and hallucinogens. There is some fascinating published research about these drugs, but Pollan spirals away from the science to speculate on how THC mediates consciousness and can enhance creativity by blunting memory and creating the perception of heightened senses. (Huxley is referenced, which is never a good sign. Also, you can apparently get high from hallucinogens secreted by some toads.) Control over the natural environment: the final section is all about the humble potato, from the diverse varieties grown by the Aztecs to the Irish famine to Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potatoes. Pollan is in his element here as a food journalist, talking to scientists about gene transfer and farmers about the impact of GMO potatoes on their livelihoods. This section raised interesting concerns about the unintended consequences of tinkering with the plant genome since genes can “jump” to other plants via cross-pollination and their impact on the rest of the food chain is unknown.Perhaps if Pollan had focused on just one of the four desires, it would have been a more cohesive reading experience. But while there are interesting facts peppered throughout each chapter, the book attempts to cover so many different ideas that are only tangentially related, there was no space for thoughtful analysis. After finishing the book, I’m still not convinced by the author’s premise that: 
""Desire might be too strong a word for whatever it is that drives plants to reinvent themselves so that we might do their bidding, but then, our own designs have often been no more willful than the plants.""
Honestly, finishing this book was a Herculean task; only my determination not to disappoint my friend Scot who was reading the book with me enabled me to climb this metaphorical Mount Olympus. (Where, I should note, I looked down at all the plants from my lofty perch. Not a toad in sight up here!) It’s a shame, because Pollan writes beautifully, and could probably be very compelling if he was covering a topic where he has more expertise.*This is a established concept in biology applied to relationships between plants and pollinating insects or animals; predators and prey; pathogens and humans; and some domesticated animals (like dogs) and humans. The idea that plants and humans have a co-evolutionary relationship does not seem to be well-supported in the scientific literature. I mean, it’s not as far out there as the people who claim plants are silently screaming when we cut them down, but it’s pretty fringe."

221,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558460-caterina,4,"What if we humans are being manipulated by plants to serve their desires? From this slightly creepy flipped perspective, masterful storyteller Michael Pollan illuminates the crazy and complex interdependency of living things -- and also, some of the dangers we inflict on ourselves and our entire world by contemporary agricultural practices -- through four stories - and what stories! -- of the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. (Ok, he admits the conceit of manipulative plants to be a bit of a stretch -- but it's a fascinating way to see how we and our favorite foods, flowers, and intoxicants are, for better or worse, co-evolving.)Biggest surprise of the book - the potato's story turned out to be the most interesting and important (really, after marijuana?) and the best showcase of Pollan's skills as an investigative journalist/interviewer and experimental gardener. Who knew, for example, that Monsanto scientists created genetically engineered potato plants with a ""gene gun"" that uses a .22 shell to fire DNA-coated stainless steel projectiles into potato leaves in the hope that some of the alien DNA (from some non-potato species) combine with the plant's own DNA? Unless, as a Yankee from Connecticut, Pollan was being set up for a huge Southern joke -- which seems to me a distinct possibility -- this actually happened at the Monsanto lab he visited in Missouri. But possible joke aside, this story contained the most intelligent and nuanced discussion of genetic modification of foods that I've ever seen, with input from numerous scientists and farmers, as well as exploring the advantages and dangers of monoculture and colonial commodity agriculture (and some of its horrific history), chemical versus organic agriculture, and the effects of food culture on farming. Also, Michael Pollan clearly just loves to grow and eat potatoes -- it may be his relish that gave this story its extra glow. (Without ever mentioning vodka.)I also especially loved the apple's story, with the mysterious Dionysian and yet somehow pure, childlike figure of Johnny Appleseed spreading seeds -- not for nice wholesome lunchbox treats but for alcohol, and plenty of it, in the wilds of Pennsylvania and Ohio. (The woods I played in, growing up in southwestern Pennsylvania, were full of abandoned and decrepit old apple trees -- I had no idea of their history.) As this book came out in 2001 the MJ story was a bit dated, and although it focused on why the plant was so strongly prohibited, it never mentioned what I understand to be the two biggest reasons -- racism/anti-Mexican sentiment, and pressure by the American pharmaceutical industry. Nor does the current battle between states and federal government come up (which maybe echoes historic battles over hard cider and whiskey). Nevertheless, all four stories are surprising and fascinating, combining investigative journalism (involving quite a bit of travel), personal experimentation, and a good dose of wild imaginative speculation -- sometimes fueled by that experimentation."

It germinates (pun intended) in Pollan's mind, one day, as he was working in his garden. He thought what if human beings were similar to bumblebees? It is an interesting take on ""coevolution"", which stipulates that two parties can act on each other to advance their individual interests but end up producing a mutually beneficial outcome.What if plants were able to develop traits that would cause other animals to help them in their goal to reproduce? As plants are immobile, they tend to rely on wind and rain to spread their pollen. But with the evolution of angiosperms, plants with flowers and seeds, animals had a new reason to eat those plants and they spread the seeds for the plant, or pollen in the case of the bee.He then stipulates that the four plants he covers have also evolved in such a way as to appeal to the human animal and, by doing so, have been able to spread their seed all across the world. The four plants he looks at are perfect examples of how they have managed to ""attract"" human beings. Pollan also links each of these plants to a specific desire. They are as follows:The apple, which utilizes the sense of sweetness.The Tulip, which utilizes the sense of beauty.The potato, which utilizes the sense of control.The marijuana plant, which utilizes the sense of intoxication.Each of these plants gets a detailed history. You will learn where they came from, how they were modified and how they entered into the human world. The stories are interesting, though I could have done with less of the personal ruminations, it is the history and the science behind these four plants that make this an interesting book to read.It is hardly overly technical and quite easy for a science dunce to comprehend. If you are looking for something more science-heavy, I'd pass on this. This is a book that tells the tale of science through the prism of human desire. Pollan does a good job of explaining things like the Diyonisian concepts and how they melded into how humans view intoxication and their views on marijuana.An interesting book that will make you think and while not science-heavy, this is a book that will interest science and non-science people alike. Interesting anecdotes and some cool history make this a rather unique book."

I mean, I want to know about Michael Pollan, he is huge and important, right? And everybody in Berkeley wants him to be Obama's Secretary of Agriculture. (Though I guess I haven't read Obama's books, so.) I liked it! I was kind of surprised, I think I was expecting something dryer. Mostly it was just this pretty smart guy talking about stuff he likes: natural selection, Johnny Appleseed, weed stories, people, Dionysus, bugs and genetically modified foods. I thought it was pretty great how in the beginning he was like, Here are four things I'm going to talk about, but then he didn't tell you what he was gonna say about 'em- like, you know the last chapter's gonna be about potatoes, but you don't know that it's going to be a conversation about the safety of genetically modified potatoes. And dude loves his plants, which is nice. It felt pretty repetitive at times, just saying the same stuff over and over, and that definitely got boring, but whatever. I was sucked in enough to bust through it between bouts of neck-pain sleep on planes and buses and trains while I was on the east coast for three days, which is more than I can say for bell hooks, who's all writing stuff I have to pay attention to and think critically about. "
224,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,3,"An earlier Pollan book, and a bestseller. Like the later, better, books, Botany explores its thesis, that the plants co-evolve with us, in four sections. There is some fluff here; the best section is easily on the one on intoxication. Doubters should read the introduction and skip to section 3.Pollan's best stuff always makes me see the world differently, and this passage changed the way I conceived of gardens, what they are, and what they could be:""I sometimes think we've allowed our gardens to be bowdlerized, that the full range of their powers and possibilities has been sacrificed to a cult of plant prettiness that obscures more dubious truths about nature, our own included. It hasn't always been this way, and we may someday come to regard the contemporary garden of vegetables and flowers as a place almost Victorian in its repressions and elisions.""He goes on to discuss a witch's garden, which included intoxicants and medicines, rather than just beautiful flowers. He argues that when the church murdered witches, they converted the contents of these gardens from taboo objects to medicines made acceptable by what we'd now call physicians. I'm sure I'm bastardizing the argument, but it was interesting. Great chapter.And here is one on what might be Pollan's greatest weakness as a reporter but what is also his greatest strength as a writer: ""I am literally absentminded, prone to be thinking about something else, something past, when I am ostensibly having a fresh experience.""Of the other chapters, the best is on potatoes, and the other two are about apples and tulips.As for the books, I still rate Omnivore, Cooked, and A Place of My Own ahead of this one, but if you broke it down to chapters, Botany's chapter on intoxication would jump ahead to the top five Pollan chapters, alongside the Omnivore stuff and Cooked's chapter on fermented foods."
225,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Not as good as the Omnivore's Dilemma, but definitely worth a read if you love thinking about plants as much as I do.The first section, on apples, was really dry (to me). Actually, it's less about apples and more about John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) and I just... don't... care about him. Right, great, he planted lots of apples, we get it, he's a hometown hero. The rest is pretty well done, though. I especially loved the section on cannabis. I harbour a lot of curiosity as to how psychotropic plants and humans have co-evolved, and why exactly certain plants have developed those mechanisms, and how we humans came to have a neurology that happened to respond to those plants' chemicals. So that was extremely engrossing.Tulips also held my interest pretty aggressively, for similar reasons. The subject of why we even like and are drawn to things as seemingly useless (evolutionarily speaking) as flowers is fascinating. It's much easier to know without having to read a book that apples or potatoes and humans have fed off one another in time. Tulips are a little bit more intriguing.I like Pollan's dry humour but also his rich curiosity, but I suspect that when he wrote this book, what was really on his mind was his next book. The section on potatoes is essentially a short verse of the Omnivore's Dilemma. In the Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan seemed more enthusiastic about the material and more concerned with the topic (not that he isn't here, but he really hits his stride there). "

I personally liked the sections on apple and potatoes, while I found the tulip and marijuana chapters less engaging. The last section, that explains the practice and risks of mono-culture and the processes of genetics manipulation employed by large corporations (e.g. Monsanto) were fascinating and scaring at the same time.3.5 stars rounded down because I found the repetition of the Apollo-Dionysus metaphor annoying and pompous in its tone.Fav.

It seems that by the time the singular beauty of a flower in bloom can no longer pierce the veil of black or obsessive thoughts in a person’s mind, that mind’s connection to the sensual world has grown dangerously frayed.

227,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,3,"A very interesting description of the symbiotic relationships that exist between humans and plants -- specifically, apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes.Humans select certain beneficial species of plants, and specific individual plants within that species for culturing and propagation. Those plants then (over generations) alter their genetics to transform themselves into even more desirable individuals of their species. The human benefit is obvious, but the plant also benefits because humans cultivate many times more of that species of plant than would ever occur naturally.The history and the science fascinated me, but I felt that some of the book was a bit repetitive and in a few places difficult to follow the flow and narrative."
228,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2163177-kishor,5,"Mr Pollan uses The Botany of Desire to posit that the nature of our relationship with plants is a lot more nuanced than it seems at first glance. While we may have succeeded in domesticating a large number of photosynthetic species, they in turn are exerting various influences on mankind. In the process of regaling us with stories of four specific plants, he manages to lay a wealth of information on the reader. The four plants are the apple (symbolizing sweetness), the tulip (beauty), marijuana (intoxication), and the potato (control).Here are some interesting things I learnt about each of them:Apple trees grown from seed produce really bitter fruit; grafting allows the cloning of trees with good fruit at the cost of loss of genetic diversity. Produce from the former type of tree was (and is?) primarily used for producing cider and applejack; Johnny ""Appleseed"" Chapman, it turns out, was responsible for keeping the American frontier well lubricated with spirits.The tulip flower is colored by two chemicals; a base layer of pigment and another (anthocyanin) on top. Famous beauties amongst the tulip family (check out the Semper Augustus, it's *amazing*) are patterned due to the activity of a virus that causes the anthocyanin to degrade, allowing the base layer to be seen. The author draws on Apollo and Dionysus heavily in this chapter, contrasting the Apollonian austerity and order of the tulip with the Dionysian seduction of other flowers like the peony and the rose.The marijuana plant diverged at some point in history to grow as two different varieties - the indica strain is much more potent and can withstand frost, while the sativa strain gives the consumer a ""clear, bell-like high"" but requires equatorial climes to grow. Growers have hybridized the two, thereby combining their strengths and downplaying their weaknesses. An interesting point that Michael brings up in this section is that humanity is constantly seeking out ways to alter its state of consciousness; in fact, this is a thing we do even as children, be it by consuming sugary snacks, spinning around fast until dizziness causes visual hallucinations, holding our breath until we spots, and so on. Adults do this too, through the mechanisms of ""meditation, fasting, exercise, amusement park rides, ..., music, eating spicy foods"", etc. The human body has its own cannabinoid system, and produces a THC-like neurotransmitter named ""anandamide"" by the discoverer; the name stems from ""ananda"", the Sanskrit word for bliss.He uses his section on the potato to talk about genetic engineering, again weaving a narrative of Apollonian order vs Dionysian wildness. Mr Pollan planted in his garden the potato known as the NewLeaf, engineered by the Monsanto corporation, producing its own insecticide in its leaves. While this helps fight the evil Colorado potato beetle and saves farmers from having to coat their fields with nasty chemicals, it means that agriculture is moving towards a monoculture and a subsequent loss of biodiversity. The organic farmer who seeds their fields with a variety of crop, however, doesn't care about the susceptibilities of any one plant; the overall crop is always (barring bizarre tornadoes, I mean) guaranteed to do fine.All this plant talk makes me want to take up gardening!"
229,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"This is another time where I've read a book and only come back to write the review many, many, many months later. In this case, I read the book (listened to the Audible, technically) back in March 2017 and now I'm reviewing it in January 2018. The reason it's taken so long is that I flagged several passages for transcription into my notes, and I only just now got around to doing it. (19 notes in an hour is actually pretty good for me.)So I'll just have to leave you with some vague impressions.For one, Michael Pollan can write. I was struck--going through and transcribing some of my notes--once again by the variety and precision of his language. He is a really, really great writer. Quick sample:Imagine a moment when the sensation of honey or sugar on the tongue was an astonishment, a kind of intoxication. The closest I've ever come to recovering such a sense of sweetness was secondhand, though it left a powerful impression on me ever so. I'm thinking of my son's first experience of sugar: the icing on the cake at his first birthday. I have only the testimony of Isaac's face to go by (that, and his fierceness to repeat the experience), but it was plain that his first encounter with sugar had intoxicated him--was in fact an ecstasy, in the literal sense of the word. That is, he was beside himself with the pleasure of it, no longer her with me in space and time in quite the same way he had been just a moment before. Between bites Isaac gazed up at me in amazement (he was on my lap, and I was delivering the ambrosial forkfuls to his gaping mouth) as if to exclaim, ""Your world contains this? From this day forward I shall dedicate my life to it."" (Which he basically has done.) And I remember thinking, this is no minor desire, and then wondered: Could it be that sweetness is the prototype of all desire?I almost feel like this talent is lost on non-fiction. Why isn't Pollan writing novels?(Just went and checked. He hasn't written any. He did get both his BA and MA in English, though. So that goes some distance to explaining his writing chops.)The passage above is also a good example of Pollan's wide-ranging syntheses. He's very good at pulling from pretty disparate sources in surprising and illuminating ways.The most powerful passages of the book for me were the ones about Johnny Appleseed. I was really impressed by how Pollan was able to bring some historical weight along with almost mythic significance to the story, and was surprised again and again by what I learned about apples (along with, later, potatoes and tulips. Cannabis was less impressive.)I can see where critics can find fault with the book. Because it's a broad approach, it is also a little thin and shallow in spots. I'm fine with that. More often than not, the problem with 200-page popular science books is that they have way too little material and far too much padding. Although there are a few patchy spots, in general Pollan never runs out of ideas or material, and the book is satisfyingly compelling from page 1 on to the end."
230,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,4,"After reading The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals, I was determined to read more by Michael Pollan. It took me three years to get around to reading this book, but I'm glad I finally did. It's a bit more metaphysical than the other books I've read by him, but still very informative and interesting. I was fascinated by his exploration of the four different kinds of plants and the human desires sated by each. And I was amused by his continual revisitation of the Dionysus/Apollo metaphor throughout the book. interesting quotes:""So the question arose in my mind that day: Did I choose to plant these potatoes, or did the potato make me do it? In fact, both statements are true...Yet evolution consists of an infinitude of trivial, unconscious events, and in the evolution of the potato my reading of a particular seed catalog on a particular January evening counts as one of them."" (p. xv)""Domesticated species don't command our respect the way their wild cousins often do. Evolution may reward interdependence, but our thinking selves continue to prize self-reliance. The wolf is somehow more impressive than the dog. Yet there are fifty million dogs in America today, only ten thousand wolves. So what does the dog know about getting along in this world that its wild ancestor doesn't? The big thing the dog knows about-the subject matter it has mastered in the ten thousand years it has been evolving at our side-is us: our needs and desires, our emotions and values, all of which it has folded into its genes as part of a sophisticated strategy for survival."" (pp. xvi-xvii)""The four desires I explore here are sweetness, broadly defined, in the story of the apple;beauty in the tulip's;intoxication in the story of cannibis; and control in the story of the potato-specifically, in the story of a genetically altered potato I grew in my garden to see where the ancient arts of domestication may now be headed. (p. xviii)""Every wild apple shrub excites our expectations thus,"" Thoreau wrote, ""somewhat as every wild child. It is, perhaps, a prince in disguise. What a lesson to man!...Poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures, and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men."" (p. 45)""Symmetry is an unmistakable sign that there's relevant information in a place. That's because symmetry is a property shared by a relatively small number of things in the landscape, all of them of keen interest to us. The shortlist of nature's symmetricals includes other creatures, other people (most notably the faces of other people), human artifacts, and plants--but especially flowers. Symmetry is also a sign of health in a creature, since mutations and environmental stresses can easily disturb it. So paying attention to symmetrical things makes good sense: symmetry is usually significant."" (p. 76)""Though we self-importantly regard domestication as something people have done to plants, it is at the same time a strategy by which the plants have exploited us and our desires--even our most idiosyncratic notions of beauty--to advance their own interests. Depending on the environment in which a species finds itself, different adaptations will avail. Mutations that nature would have rejected out of hand in the wild sometimes prove to be brilliant adaptations in an environment that's been shaped by human desire."" (p. 81)""Although by any conventional measure it is folly to pay thousands for a tulip bulb (or for that matter an Internet stock), as long as there is an even greater fool out there willing to pay even more, doing so is the most logical thing in the world."" (p. 103)""Yet this new biotechnology has overthrown the old rules governing the relationship of nature and culture in a plant. Domestication has never been a simple one-way process in which our species has controlled others; other species participate only so far as their interests are served, and many plants (such as the oak) simply sit the whole game out. That game is the one Darwin called 'artificial selection,' and its rules have never been any different from the ones that govern natural selection. The plant in its wildness proposes new qualities, and then man (or, in the case of natural selection, nature) selects which of those qualities will survive and prosper. But about one rule Darwin was emphatic; as he wrote in The Origin of Species, 'Man does not actually produce variability.' Now he does."" (p. 196)""Yet for reasons we don't completely understand, distinct species do exist in nature, and they exhibit a certain genetic integrity--sex between them, when it does occur, doesn't produce fertile offspring. Nature presumably has some reason for erecting these walls, even if they are permeable on occasion. Perhaps, as some biologists believe, the purpose of keeping species separate is to put barriers in the path of pathogens, to contain their damage so that a single germ can't wipe out life on Earth at a stroke."" (pp. 196-197)""This is, of course, how chemical companies have always handled the problem of pest resistance: by simply introducing a new and improved pesticide every few years. With any luck, the effectiveness of the last one will expire around the same time its patent does."" (p. 215)""As much as I love the firm grasp and cerebral order of spring, there's a ripe, almost sensual pleasure in its August abandonment, too.""

He is an incredibly gifted non-fiction writer whose first-person style makes his work as readable as it is educational. This book personifies the foods described and paints them as our partners in consumption and in life."
234,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,5,"Michael Pollan is swiftly solidifying his position as ""somebody I want to know."" He's a clever writer, an inquisitive journalist, and a creative storyteller, as well as a shining light of simple food consciousness in an era of either not asking at all or asking far too much.This book is equal parts natural history, social history, regular history, botanical musing, plant biology, evolutionary theory, and psychology, with a smattering of classical mythology, memoir, neuroscience, and investigative journalism to hold the threads together. Pollan sets out with the aim of tracking four plants along their coevolution with society, tying each to a human desire that shaped it into what it is today: the apple and sweetness, the tulip and beauty, marijuana and intoxication, and potatoes and control. What he ends up writing from this neat little package of a thesis is something much greater than the sum of its parts, a veritable exploration (I use the word a lot but I think it really applies here) of what it means to be human in a determinedly natural world. One of the ideas he returns to often is that our relationship to the natural world is a balancing of Apollonian (controlled, geometric, structured, artificial) and Dionysian (frenetic, shifting, chaotic, and natural) forces, and I think he really hit the nail on the head with the notion as much as with the conclusion that it's a much more complicated relationship than it first appears. The complexity of the question is due in part to the many human urges (such as morality) that don't fit cleanly in either camp, and in part to the ambiguity of the agent in control within the framework of nature's chaos. It's an impressively thoughtful approach, and the broad reach allowed by a philosophical, as opposed to purely scientific, foundation means the reader gets to learn a little about a lot along the way.I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by divulging details of HOW each plant and desire is examined, but I will assure you that the how is not as straightforward and easy as you'd expect. This is becoming a mark of Pollan's writing as much as it always has been a hallmark of great writing: a clear and simple idea considered with breadth and depth in a manner so well-organized that you don't realize how much you're learning until you're done. I cannot wait to read more of his work."
235,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196103-jenn,3,"I thought this was an interesting but long winded book. The author discusses 4 different plants and how they have 'coevolved' with humans to reap the benefits of human interaction. It is best summed up in one of the first chapters of the book as the author ponders if he planted potatoes in his garden out of his own accord of did the potatoes, by virtue of their deliciousness, pursuade him to plant them?One of the main things I learned from this book is the value of diversity. From the loss of heritage apple varieties due to the desire for sickly sweet varieties to the monsanto NewLeaf potatoes that are themselves registered with the EPA as a pesticide i was introduced to this monoculture idea that I didnt know existed. I was shocked to learn about the stringent potato requirements of the fast food industry - only 1 type of potato without blemish is acceptable for french fry production. With the razor slim profit margins of farming a farmer selling to these companies nearly HAS to use GMO crops and/or huge amounts of pesticides to make ends meet.This definitely changed the way I think about organic vs non organic foods. I used to think buying non-organic potatoes was alright, but faced with the fact of what could potentially be in them (one of the potato farmers wouldnt even eat the potatoes he grew) i now feel that i really need to buy local and or organic for the sake of my health."
236,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914674-isis,5,"I liked this book even better than The Omnivore's Dilemma. When you strip aside the somewhat heavy-handed Apollo vs. Dionysus metaphor and the provocative subtitle that suggests that it's plants, not people, who invented agriculture -- that we're essentially only sophisticated bees -- you get a fascinating set of histories of four very interesting plants: apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes. And yes, they co-evolved with people, but that's really nothing surprising or shocking. But it is both entertaining and educational, written well and read (in the audio edition I listened to) superbly.Pollan takes a vast road-trip through history, and although it seems like a pleasantly meandering journey, it's actually quite focused and organized. In the chapter on apples we learn of the real Johnny Appleseed, and of the concept of sweetness, and of how Prohibition changed apple marketing for good. The tulip chapter touches on not only the (obvious) tulip mania speculative bubble, but also on the genetics of tulips and the virus that affected them, and on the idea of floral beauty in different cultures. And so on. There is a bit of moralizing: the drug war comes in for some criticism, and monoculture is reviled as the root of all of industrial agriculture's evil. But I don't disagree with these points!"
237,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431129-brian,4,"By the end of this book, I really wanted to have Michael Pollan's life, more or less. Though I'd settle for a nice house somewhere where I can have a big garden with all types of plants like his; that was the main attraction, along with the requisite knowledge and experience of nature itself and the nature of how things grow, in a word. As noble as it sounds in theory for man to be in harmony with nature, it becomes clear by his summation in the epilogue that it's nothing less than quite practical. But most of all, it's rewarding.Part of why I must feel this even stronger pull towards plants after finishing was that I think the order of the chapters was well-chosen. The themes on which he hit were introduced best with the apple and finished best with the potato, though I would have to call cannabis and potato my two favorite chapters. Loading up on everything else before you see the contrast of commercial Monsanto-controlled potato farming in Idaho with Michael Pollan's own backyard, you're smart and informed enough on the subject to feel passionate about cultivating a more symbiotic relationship with your environment. Again, which is why I want a nice house with a big garden even more now. "
238,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249241-meg,5,"The author adds a wrinkle to our thoughts about domestication by arguing that plants have selected for a preference for their qualities in humans, leading to their cultivation, ensuring their survival. Rather than us manipulating the traits of our crops, we've been manipulated by them!Though I disagree with this premise (you can never determine an evolutionary reason for something, and it's hardly parsimonious to think of organisms acting as agents of selection on our perceptions of them (and how does this translate to fitness?), leading to us selecting for desirable traits in those organisms), I loved tracing the history of 4 important plants (apple, potato, tulip, marijuana) and their interactions with humans."

Lots of face-palms.The musings on the effects of Marijuana is really uncomfortable.Pollan obviously wrote this chapter while high.He suggests that meditation can get you high like Marijuana, which just isn't true.He rambles on about spirituality, which is bizarre and metaphysical.The potato.Pollan shares with us his ignorance-fueled skepticism about GM crops.He states, falsely, that Monsanto has a patent on the BT gene.In fact, Monsanto's patents cover specific plant genomes with the BT gene inserted at a particular location.The difference being, Monsanto did not come up with the BT gene.What they rightfully call their intellectual property is the work of figuring out how to make the BT gene work inside each plant.Evil patents are no argument against GM crops than they are an argument against pharmaceuticals.His other argument is some philosophical nuance of object vs. subject.He seems to be putting forth an argument for purity.That intentional tampering directly with the genome is different and worse than using ""natural"" techniques like cloning, grafting, crossing, and other forms of artificial selection.Really, there's no functional difference between modifying the sequence of genes with one or another technique.Some techniques, like recombinant genetic engineering, offer more possibilities.Then, he whines about monoculture for a few dozen pages.This part sounds like it's right out of omnivore's dilemma.Apollonian verses Dionysian, blah, blah, blah.I wish Pollan would stick to the fascinating anecdotes."
243,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,4,"In The Botany of Desire Michael Pollan goes into our relationship with four plants: the tulip, marijuana, the apple, and the potato. He looks at these four plants from historical, political, and personal point of view. In many ways this is a fascinating account. For example the first one that goes into the tulip mania that the Dutch got into, which is both comic, and ridiculous at the same time, but of course if we look at the stock market in general, these sorts of things still take place, just in a slightly different way. Are the plants themselves passive victims in all of this or are they active participants is one of the more interesting question that he tries to answer in his book, but of course he can't really prove it one way or the other. Still, he does present the case for them being much more active members in this relationship so well that a question that might have seemed a little silly actually becomes an interesting one. There is one thing about Pollen's writing style, he does tend to take detours, in fact he takes quite a few one of those. This does make the book at times feel a little unfocused, but still it never really got uninteresting, even despite that. I actually got quite a bit of enjoyment out of this read. And I gained some inside into this subject. One can't really ask much more out of a nonfiction book, so I think I may read something else by him. "
244,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"Wonderful, wonderful book, full of fantastic info and insights. My main critique is Pollan's main conceit, and the language used to express it: plant species have domesticated humanity just as much as humanity has domesticated them. My problem is his constant insertion of agency into the process of evolution and mixing metaphors of individuals and of species. Flowers are not individually clever, and neither are species of flowers. Flowers do not manipulate bees in the same way that a botanist manipulates a flower species through artificial selection or genetic modification. Species do not have agency, the will to act. Only individuals have that, and individuals bees, potatoes, or water buffalo do not (to our knowledge), willfully offer themselves up as partners to humanity.Pollan draws an interesting distinction that I haven't encountered in my amateur meanderings between ""wilderness"" and ""wildness."" He uses ""wilderness"" in the sense of the Wilderness Act of 1964, ""an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."" ""Wildness,"" on the other hand, is anything that humans cannot control. As Bill McKibben famously pointed out, the atmosphere of our planet is no longer a wilderness, tainted as it is by the byproducts of our industry, but as every hurricane and tornado reminds us, it is still profoundly wild.Pollan uses this distinction to emphasize that while all domestication is a destruction of wilderness, it is almost never an abolition of wildness. The gardener uses his sense of order not to control his plants absolutely, but to guide and shape their wildness in certain ways. He goes on to suggest that genetic engineering may violate this pact, that by attempting to guide evolution on such a basic level is a powerful new way to write wildness out of the equation. He also offers the counterpoint that current techniques for gene insertion are (sometimes literally) so scattershot as to yield results that are even less predictable that conventional breeding.The topic of wilderness feeds into another interesting point, which is that ""memory is the enemy of wonder"" (168). He argues that cannabinoids like THC help us experience awe and wonder by forcing constant short term memory loss, and that meditation or physical exertion probably induce the same effect, making the view from a mountain peak infinitely more profound after having hiked to it instead of having driven.Another insight he had about marijuana is that drugs could be considered the mutagens of culture. If one assumes a meme is like a gene, then a culture is like a genome. Memes are constantly recombining through thought and discourse (intercourse in both culture and biology), but genuinely new ideas are rare. At the risk of spreading a metaphor too thin, Pollan suggests that drugs could be thought of as mutagens, radiation nuking the genetic fundaments of culture, producing mostly irrelevant or deleterious nonsense, but now and again creating viable gems (149). Kind of a fun thought."

Being a little self-reliant in these unsettling times gives me a sense of stability and hope.In this book, Pollan takes a look at four plants and relates them to human desires, I think . . . He starts things off with the apple and goes into a bit of long-winded ramble about Johnny Appleseed's quest to sell his trees to pioneers and his lust for a 10 year old bride (fortunately this bit wasn't dug into with any sort of detail). Johnny's enthusiasm for the apple and his desire to plant the seed (and refusal to graft) results in the many varieties that adapted to new climates. Though I'm learning a lot about Johnny here, I'd rather have more factoids about the apple. I'm hoping the following chapters are more interesting because I find my mind wandering more than usual while listening to this.I've now finished up the tulip section and made it about halfway through the marijuana chapter but, at this point, I have come to the realization that this book just doesn't interest me. It's very repetitive and meandering. I'll finish it up and hope the potato's treatment can grab me enough to get through it.Later: I finished up and did find the potato section much more interesting but that's because I'm always interested in GMO foods, the science, the corruption, the danger to our society, the greed . . . I didn't really learn anything new as this was written quite a few years ago but it still captured my attention all the same. "
246,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/610744-luke,3,"The Botany of Desire was written in language that made it obvious that Michael Pollan likes to hear himself write. His ideas were interesting, following four plants, the potato, cannabis, the apple, and the tulip through their journey with mankind. I like how he approaches the topic, observing not only what people have done to the plants to develop them to our own use, but also how the plants have in some ways used us for their own ends. It is true that we, while we think we are masters of our own destinies, are intimately tied to the world around us. there is an ecological cause and effect that often escapes us because of our anthropogenic perspective. My argument with the book is that Pollan overuses imagery from Greek mythology and as a result becomes tedious to read in some sections. By far the most interesting is the last section on the interaction between humanity and the potato. "
247,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2967061-anne,4,"The same brilliant and creative thinking which I recall from my first read. The marijuana section is a bit dated at least in my state, CO, but otherwise, this book held up well."
248,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6894205-allie,2,"Do you talk to your plants? More to the point, do you think your plants talk back to you? If so, I have just the book for you…The Botany of Desire explores the relationship between plants and humans, but rather than focusing on human agency, food journalist and gardener Michael Pollan tells the story from the plants’ point of view. He takes the idea of co-evolution as his starting point: the idea that two species evolve in a mutually dependent manner leading to the selection of certain traits. Pollan attempts to apply this evolutionary concept to human interactions with plants.* 
""Plants hit on a remarkably clever strategy: getting us to move or think for them…it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees.""
Reading this book was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope; the perspective felt distorted. I was not persuaded that Pollan completely understood some of the scientific concepts that he was trying to explain. It all felt a little…Gladwell-esque. Pollan tries to illustrate the intertwined evolutionary relationship between plants and humans by telling the story of four plants and the desires that they satisfy. Sweetness: the first section focused on apples and the story of John Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed). Pollan dedicates many, many pages to Chapman’s life and his ‘Dionysian’ apple planting efforts, which allowed homesteaders to get reliably drunk on alcoholic cider. (Inspired by this chapter, I created a drinking game where I had a sip of scotch every time Pollan mentioned Dionysus or Apollo. I was forced to abandon this delightful crutch since there were so many references to both gods, I was getting woozy.) Beauty: the second section covered the speculative boom and bust around tulip mania in Holland, with some random thoughts about flowers throughout history and some general ideas around beauty (e.g., symmetry is appealing as a proxy for good health). There were a lot of opinion-led statements such as 
“beauty always takes place in the particular”
 that didn’t resonate with me; I find the ocean more beautiful in its entirety than a solitary wave. Intoxication: by far the most interesting, the third section discussed how humans seek intoxication through plants, which produce stimulants like caffeine, nicotine, THC, and hallucinogens. There is some fascinating published research about these drugs, but Pollan spirals away from the science to speculate on how THC mediates consciousness and can enhance creativity by blunting memory and creating the perception of heightened senses. (Huxley is referenced, which is never a good sign. Also, you can apparently get high from hallucinogens secreted by some toads.) Control over the natural environment: the final section is all about the humble potato, from the diverse varieties grown by the Aztecs to the Irish famine to Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potatoes. Pollan is in his element here as a food journalist, talking to scientists about gene transfer and farmers about the impact of GMO potatoes on their livelihoods. This section raised interesting concerns about the unintended consequences of tinkering with the plant genome since genes can “jump” to other plants via cross-pollination and their impact on the rest of the food chain is unknown.Perhaps if Pollan had focused on just one of the four desires, it would have been a more cohesive reading experience. But while there are interesting facts peppered throughout each chapter, the book attempts to cover so many different ideas that are only tangentially related, there was no space for thoughtful analysis. After finishing the book, I’m still not convinced by the author’s premise that: 
""Desire might be too strong a word for whatever it is that drives plants to reinvent themselves so that we might do their bidding, but then, our own designs have often been no more willful than the plants.""
Honestly, finishing this book was a Herculean task; only my determination not to disappoint my friend Scot who was reading the book with me enabled me to climb this metaphorical Mount Olympus. (Where, I should note, I looked down at all the plants from my lofty perch. Not a toad in sight up here!) It’s a shame, because Pollan writes beautifully, and could probably be very compelling if he was covering a topic where he has more expertise.*This is a established concept in biology applied to relationships between plants and pollinating insects or animals; predators and prey; pathogens and humans; and some domesticated animals (like dogs) and humans. The idea that plants and humans have a co-evolutionary relationship does not seem to be well-supported in the scientific literature. I mean, it’s not as far out there as the people who claim plants are silently screaming when we cut them down, but it’s pretty fringe."

251,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558460-caterina,4,"What if we humans are being manipulated by plants to serve their desires? From this slightly creepy flipped perspective, masterful storyteller Michael Pollan illuminates the crazy and complex interdependency of living things -- and also, some of the dangers we inflict on ourselves and our entire world by contemporary agricultural practices -- through four stories - and what stories! -- of the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. (Ok, he admits the conceit of manipulative plants to be a bit of a stretch -- but it's a fascinating way to see how we and our favorite foods, flowers, and intoxicants are, for better or worse, co-evolving.)Biggest surprise of the book - the potato's story turned out to be the most interesting and important (really, after marijuana?) and the best showcase of Pollan's skills as an investigative journalist/interviewer and experimental gardener. Who knew, for example, that Monsanto scientists created genetically engineered potato plants with a ""gene gun"" that uses a .22 shell to fire DNA-coated stainless steel projectiles into potato leaves in the hope that some of the alien DNA (from some non-potato species) combine with the plant's own DNA? Unless, as a Yankee from Connecticut, Pollan was being set up for a huge Southern joke -- which seems to me a distinct possibility -- this actually happened at the Monsanto lab he visited in Missouri. But possible joke aside, this story contained the most intelligent and nuanced discussion of genetic modification of foods that I've ever seen, with input from numerous scientists and farmers, as well as exploring the advantages and dangers of monoculture and colonial commodity agriculture (and some of its horrific history), chemical versus organic agriculture, and the effects of food culture on farming. Also, Michael Pollan clearly just loves to grow and eat potatoes -- it may be his relish that gave this story its extra glow. (Without ever mentioning vodka.)I also especially loved the apple's story, with the mysterious Dionysian and yet somehow pure, childlike figure of Johnny Appleseed spreading seeds -- not for nice wholesome lunchbox treats but for alcohol, and plenty of it, in the wilds of Pennsylvania and Ohio. (The woods I played in, growing up in southwestern Pennsylvania, were full of abandoned and decrepit old apple trees -- I had no idea of their history.) As this book came out in 2001 the MJ story was a bit dated, and although it focused on why the plant was so strongly prohibited, it never mentioned what I understand to be the two biggest reasons -- racism/anti-Mexican sentiment, and pressure by the American pharmaceutical industry. Nor does the current battle between states and federal government come up (which maybe echoes historic battles over hard cider and whiskey). Nevertheless, all four stories are surprising and fascinating, combining investigative journalism (involving quite a bit of travel), personal experimentation, and a good dose of wild imaginative speculation -- sometimes fueled by that experimentation."
252,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666,4,"Michael Pollan's book is certainly an interesting one. It germinates (pun intended) in Pollan's mind, one day, as he was working in his garden. He thought what if human beings were similar to bumblebees? It is an interesting take on ""coevolution"", which stipulates that two parties can act on each other to advance their individual interests but end up producing a mutually beneficial outcome.What if plants were able to develop traits that would cause other animals to help them in their goal to reproduce? As plants are immobile, they tend to rely on wind and rain to spread their pollen. But with the evolution of angiosperms, plants with flowers and seeds, animals had a new reason to eat those plants and they spread the seeds for the plant, or pollen in the case of the bee.He then stipulates that the four plants he covers have also evolved in such a way as to appeal to the human animal and, by doing so, have been able to spread their seed all across the world. The four plants he looks at are perfect examples of how they have managed to ""attract"" human beings. Pollan also links each of these plants to a specific desire. They are as follows:The apple, which utilizes the sense of sweetness.The Tulip, which utilizes the sense of beauty.The potato, which utilizes the sense of control.The marijuana plant, which utilizes the sense of intoxication.Each of these plants gets a detailed history. You will learn where they came from, how they were modified and how they entered into the human world. The stories are interesting, though I could have done with less of the personal ruminations, it is the history and the science behind these four plants that make this an interesting book to read.It is hardly overly technical and quite easy for a science dunce to comprehend. If you are looking for something more science-heavy, I'd pass on this. This is a book that tells the tale of science through the prism of human desire. Pollan does a good job of explaining things like the Diyonisian concepts and how they melded into how humans view intoxication and their views on marijuana.An interesting book that will make you think and while not science-heavy, this is a book that will interest science and non-science people alike. Interesting anecdotes and some cool history make this a rather unique book."

I mean, I want to know about Michael Pollan, he is huge and important, right? And everybody in Berkeley wants him to be Obama's Secretary of Agriculture. (Though I guess I haven't read Obama's books, so.) I liked it! I was kind of surprised, I think I was expecting something dryer. Mostly it was just this pretty smart guy talking about stuff he likes: natural selection, Johnny Appleseed, weed stories, people, Dionysus, bugs and genetically modified foods. I thought it was pretty great how in the beginning he was like, Here are four things I'm going to talk about, but then he didn't tell you what he was gonna say about 'em- like, you know the last chapter's gonna be about potatoes, but you don't know that it's going to be a conversation about the safety of genetically modified potatoes. And dude loves his plants, which is nice. It felt pretty repetitive at times, just saying the same stuff over and over, and that definitely got boring, but whatever. I was sucked in enough to bust through it between bouts of neck-pain sleep on planes and buses and trains while I was on the east coast for three days, which is more than I can say for bell hooks, who's all writing stuff I have to pay attention to and think critically about.

254,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,3,"An earlier Pollan book, and a bestseller. Like the later, better, books, Botany explores its thesis, that the plants co-evolve with us, in four sections. There is some fluff here; the best section is easily on the one on intoxication. Doubters should read the introduction and skip to section 3.Pollan's best stuff always makes me see the world differently, and this passage changed the way I conceived of gardens, what they are, and what they could be:""I sometimes think we've allowed our gardens to be bowdlerized, that the full range of their powers and possibilities has been sacrificed to a cult of plant prettiness that obscures more dubious truths about nature, our own included. It hasn't always been this way, and we may someday come to regard the contemporary garden of vegetables and flowers as a place almost Victorian in its repressions and elisions.""He goes on to discuss a witch's garden, which included intoxicants and medicines, rather than just beautiful flowers. He argues that when the church murdered witches, they converted the contents of these gardens from taboo objects to medicines made acceptable by what we'd now call physicians. I'm sure I'm bastardizing the argument, but it was interesting. Great chapter.And here is one on what might be Pollan's greatest weakness as a reporter but what is also his greatest strength as a writer: ""I am literally absentminded, prone to be thinking about something else, something past, when I am ostensibly having a fresh experience.""Of the other chapters, the best is on potatoes, and the other two are about apples and tulips.As for the books, I still rate Omnivore, Cooked, and A Place of My Own ahead of this one, but if you broke it down to chapters, Botany's chapter on intoxication would jump ahead to the top five Pollan chapters, alongside the Omnivore stuff and Cooked's chapter on fermented foods."
255,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Not as good as the Omnivore's Dilemma, but definitely worth a read if you love thinking about plants as much as I do.The first section, on apples, was really dry (to me). Actually, it's less about apples and more about John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) and I just... don't... care about him. Right, great, he planted lots of apples, we get it, he's a hometown hero. The rest is pretty well done, though. I especially loved the section on cannabis. I harbour a lot of curiosity as to how psychotropic plants and humans have co-evolved, and why exactly certain plants have developed those mechanisms, and how we humans came to have a neurology that happened to respond to those plants' chemicals. So that was extremely engrossing.Tulips also held my interest pretty aggressively, for similar reasons. The subject of why we even like and are drawn to things as seemingly useless (evolutionarily speaking) as flowers is fascinating. It's much easier to know without having to read a book that apples or potatoes and humans have fed off one another in time. Tulips are a little bit more intriguing.I like Pollan's dry humour but also his rich curiosity, but I suspect that when he wrote this book, what was really on his mind was his next book. The section on potatoes is essentially a short verse of the Omnivore's Dilemma. In the Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan seemed more enthusiastic about the material and more concerned with the topic (not that he isn't here, but he really hits his stride there). "

The last section, that explains the practice and risks of mono-culture and the processes of genetics manipulation employed by large corporations (e.g. Monsanto) were fascinating and scaring at the same time.3.5 stars rounded down because I found the repetition of the Apollo-Dionysus metaphor annoying and pompous in its tone.Fav.

It seems that by the time the singular beauty of a flower in bloom can no longer pierce the veil of black or obsessive thoughts in a person’s mind, that mind’s connection to the sensual world has grown dangerously frayed.

Those plants then (over generations) alter their genetics to transform themselves into even more desirable individuals of their species. The human benefit is obvious, but the plant also benefits because humans cultivate many times more of that species of plant than would ever occur naturally.The history and the science fascinated me, but I felt that some of the book was a bit repetitive and in a few places difficult to follow the flow and narrative."
258,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2163177-kishor,5,"Mr Pollan uses The Botany of Desire to posit that the nature of our relationship with plants is a lot more nuanced than it seems at first glance. While we may have succeeded in domesticating a large number of photosynthetic species, they in turn are exerting various influences on mankind. In the process of regaling us with stories of four specific plants, he manages to lay a wealth of information on the reader. The four plants are the apple (symbolizing sweetness), the tulip (beauty), marijuana (intoxication), and the potato (control).Here are some interesting things I learnt about each of them:Apple trees grown from seed produce really bitter fruit; grafting allows the cloning of trees with good fruit at the cost of loss of genetic diversity. Produce from the former type of tree was (and is?) primarily used for producing cider and applejack; Johnny ""Appleseed"" Chapman, it turns out, was responsible for keeping the American frontier well lubricated with spirits.The tulip flower is colored by two chemicals; a base layer of pigment and another (anthocyanin) on top. Famous beauties amongst the tulip family (check out the Semper Augustus, it's *amazing*) are patterned due to the activity of a virus that causes the anthocyanin to degrade, allowing the base layer to be seen. The author draws on Apollo and Dionysus heavily in this chapter, contrasting the Apollonian austerity and order of the tulip with the Dionysian seduction of other flowers like the peony and the rose.The marijuana plant diverged at some point in history to grow as two different varieties - the indica strain is much more potent and can withstand frost, while the sativa strain gives the consumer a ""clear, bell-like high"" but requires equatorial climes to grow. Growers have hybridized the two, thereby combining their strengths and downplaying their weaknesses. An interesting point that Michael brings up in this section is that humanity is constantly seeking out ways to alter its state of consciousness; in fact, this is a thing we do even as children, be it by consuming sugary snacks, spinning around fast until dizziness causes visual hallucinations, holding our breath until we spots, and so on. Adults do this too, through the mechanisms of ""meditation, fasting, exercise, amusement park rides, ..., music, eating spicy foods"", etc. The human body has its own cannabinoid system, and produces a THC-like neurotransmitter named ""anandamide"" by the discoverer; the name stems from ""ananda"", the Sanskrit word for bliss.He uses his section on the potato to talk about genetic engineering, again weaving a narrative of Apollonian order vs Dionysian wildness. Mr Pollan planted in his garden the potato known as the NewLeaf, engineered by the Monsanto corporation, producing its own insecticide in its leaves. While this helps fight the evil Colorado potato beetle and saves farmers from having to coat their fields with nasty chemicals, it means that agriculture is moving towards a monoculture and a subsequent loss of biodiversity. The organic farmer who seeds their fields with a variety of crop, however, doesn't care about the susceptibilities of any one plant; the overall crop is always (barring bizarre tornadoes, I mean) guaranteed to do fine.All this plant talk makes me want to take up gardening!"
259,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"This is another time where I've read a book and only come back to write the review many, many, many months later. In this case, I read the book (listened to the Audible, technically) back in March 2017 and now I'm reviewing it in January 2018. The reason it's taken so long is that I flagged several passages for transcription into my notes, and I only just now got around to doing it. (19 notes in an hour is actually pretty good for me.)So I'll just have to leave you with some vague impressions.For one, Michael Pollan can write. I was struck--going through and transcribing some of my notes--once again by the variety and precision of his language. He is a really, really great writer. Quick sample:Imagine a moment when the sensation of honey or sugar on the tongue was an astonishment, a kind of intoxication. The closest I've ever come to recovering such a sense of sweetness was secondhand, though it left a powerful impression on me ever so. I'm thinking of my son's first experience of sugar: the icing on the cake at his first birthday. I have only the testimony of Isaac's face to go by (that, and his fierceness to repeat the experience), but it was plain that his first encounter with sugar had intoxicated him--was in fact an ecstasy, in the literal sense of the word. That is, he was beside himself with the pleasure of it, no longer her with me in space and time in quite the same way he had been just a moment before. Between bites Isaac gazed up at me in amazement (he was on my lap, and I was delivering the ambrosial forkfuls to his gaping mouth) as if to exclaim, ""Your world contains this? From this day forward I shall dedicate my life to it."" (Which he basically has done.) And I remember thinking, this is no minor desire, and then wondered: Could it be that sweetness is the prototype of all desire?I almost feel like this talent is lost on non-fiction. Why isn't Pollan writing novels?(Just went and checked. He hasn't written any. He did get both his BA and MA in English, though. So that goes some distance to explaining his writing chops.)The passage above is also a good example of Pollan's wide-ranging syntheses. He's very good at pulling from pretty disparate sources in surprising and illuminating ways.The most powerful passages of the book for me were the ones about Johnny Appleseed. I was really impressed by how Pollan was able to bring some historical weight along with almost mythic significance to the story, and was surprised again and again by what I learned about apples (along with, later, potatoes and tulips. Cannabis was less impressive.)I can see where critics can find fault with the book. Because it's a broad approach, it is also a little thin and shallow in spots. I'm fine with that. More often than not, the problem with 200-page popular science books is that they have way too little material and far too much padding. Although there are a few patchy spots, in general Pollan never runs out of ideas or material, and the book is satisfyingly compelling from page 1 on to the end."
260,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,4,"After reading The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals, I was determined to read more by Michael Pollan. It took me three years to get around to reading this book, but I'm glad I finally did. It's a bit more metaphysical than the other books I've read by him, but still very informative and interesting. I was fascinated by his exploration of the four different kinds of plants and the human desires sated by each. And I was amused by his continual revisitation of the Dionysus/Apollo metaphor throughout the book. interesting quotes:""So the question arose in my mind that day: Did I choose to plant these potatoes, or did the potato make me do it? In fact, both statements are true...Yet evolution consists of an infinitude of trivial, unconscious events, and in the evolution of the potato my reading of a particular seed catalog on a particular January evening counts as one of them."" (p. xv)""Domesticated species don't command our respect the way their wild cousins often do. Evolution may reward interdependence, but our thinking selves continue to prize self-reliance. The wolf is somehow more impressive than the dog. Yet there are fifty million dogs in America today, only ten thousand wolves. So what does the dog know about getting along in this world that its wild ancestor doesn't? The big thing the dog knows about-the subject matter it has mastered in the ten thousand years it has been evolving at our side-is us: our needs and desires, our emotions and values, all of which it has folded into its genes as part of a sophisticated strategy for survival."" (pp. xvi-xvii)""The four desires I explore here are sweetness, broadly defined, in the story of the apple;beauty in the tulip's;intoxication in the story of cannibis; and control in the story of the potato-specifically, in the story of a genetically altered potato I grew in my garden to see where the ancient arts of domestication may now be headed. (p. xviii)""Every wild apple shrub excites our expectations thus,"" Thoreau wrote, ""somewhat as every wild child. It is, perhaps, a prince in disguise. What a lesson to man!...Poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures, and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men."" (p. 45)""Symmetry is an unmistakable sign that there's relevant information in a place. That's because symmetry is a property shared by a relatively small number of things in the landscape, all of them of keen interest to us. The shortlist of nature's symmetricals includes other creatures, other people (most notably the faces of other people), human artifacts, and plants--but especially flowers. Symmetry is also a sign of health in a creature, since mutations and environmental stresses can easily disturb it. So paying attention to symmetrical things makes good sense: symmetry is usually significant."" (p. 76)""Though we self-importantly regard domestication as something people have done to plants, it is at the same time a strategy by which the plants have exploited us and our desires--even our most idiosyncratic notions of beauty--to advance their own interests. Depending on the environment in which a species finds itself, different adaptations will avail. Mutations that nature would have rejected out of hand in the wild sometimes prove to be brilliant adaptations in an environment that's been shaped by human desire."" (p. 81)""Although by any conventional measure it is folly to pay thousands for a tulip bulb (or for that matter an Internet stock), as long as there is an even greater fool out there willing to pay even more, doing so is the most logical thing in the world."" (p. 103)""Yet this new biotechnology has overthrown the old rules governing the relationship of nature and culture in a plant. Domestication has never been a simple one-way process in which our species has controlled others; other species participate only so far as their interests are served, and many plants (such as the oak) simply sit the whole game out. That game is the one Darwin called 'artificial selection,' and its rules have never been any different from the ones that govern natural selection. The plant in its wildness proposes new qualities, and then man (or, in the case of natural selection, nature) selects which of those qualities will survive and prosper. But about one rule Darwin was emphatic; as he wrote in The Origin of Species, 'Man does not actually produce variability.' Now he does."" (p. 196)""Yet for reasons we don't completely understand, distinct species do exist in nature, and they exhibit a certain genetic integrity--sex between them, when it does occur, doesn't produce fertile offspring.

262,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6879819-susan-defreitas,5,This book changed how I see plants and our relationship with them. I also now have an irrational desire to grow apple trees from seed and plant them everywhere. =)
263,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67444659-katie-hamilton,4,"Reading Pollan’s work feels like a conversation with him in the most casual setting, discussing science, while also chuckling every so often at his comments strategically placed in parentheses. He is an incredibly gifted non-fiction writer whose first-person style makes his work as readable as it is educational. This book personifies the foods described and paints them as our partners in consumption and in life."
264,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,5,"Michael Pollan is swiftly solidifying his position as ""somebody I want to know."" He's a clever writer, an inquisitive journalist, and a creative storyteller, as well as a shining light of simple food consciousness in an era of either not asking at all or asking far too much.This book is equal parts natural history, social history, regular history, botanical musing, plant biology, evolutionary theory, and psychology, with a smattering of classical mythology, memoir, neuroscience, and investigative journalism to hold the threads together. Pollan sets out with the aim of tracking four plants along their coevolution with society, tying each to a human desire that shaped it into what it is today: the apple and sweetness, the tulip and beauty, marijuana and intoxication, and potatoes and control. What he ends up writing from this neat little package of a thesis is something much greater than the sum of its parts, a veritable exploration (I use the word a lot but I think it really applies here) of what it means to be human in a determinedly natural world. One of the ideas he returns to often is that our relationship to the natural world is a balancing of Apollonian (controlled, geometric, structured, artificial) and Dionysian (frenetic, shifting, chaotic, and natural) forces, and I think he really hit the nail on the head with the notion as much as with the conclusion that it's a much more complicated relationship than it first appears. The complexity of the question is due in part to the many human urges (such as morality) that don't fit cleanly in either camp, and in part to the ambiguity of the agent in control within the framework of nature's chaos. It's an impressively thoughtful approach, and the broad reach allowed by a philosophical, as opposed to purely scientific, foundation means the reader gets to learn a little about a lot along the way.I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by divulging details of HOW each plant and desire is examined, but I will assure you that the how is not as straightforward and easy as you'd expect. This is becoming a mark of Pollan's writing as much as it always has been a hallmark of great writing: a clear and simple idea considered with breadth and depth in a manner so well-organized that you don't realize how much you're learning until you're done. I cannot wait to read more of his work."
265,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196103-jenn,3,"I thought this was an interesting but long winded book. The author discusses 4 different plants and how they have 'coevolved' with humans to reap the benefits of human interaction. It is best summed up in one of the first chapters of the book as the author ponders if he planted potatoes in his garden out of his own accord of did the potatoes, by virtue of their deliciousness, pursuade him to plant them?One of the main things I learned from this book is the value of diversity. From the loss of heritage apple varieties due to the desire for sickly sweet varieties to the monsanto NewLeaf potatoes that are themselves registered with the EPA as a pesticide i was introduced to this monoculture idea that I didnt know existed. I was shocked to learn about the stringent potato requirements of the fast food industry - only 1 type of potato without blemish is acceptable for french fry production. With the razor slim profit margins of farming a farmer selling to these companies nearly HAS to use GMO crops and/or huge amounts of pesticides to make ends meet.This definitely changed the way I think about organic vs non organic foods. I used to think buying non-organic potatoes was alright, but faced with the fact of what could potentially be in them (one of the potato farmers wouldnt even eat the potatoes he grew) i now feel that i really need to buy local and or organic for the sake of my health."
266,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914674-isis,5,"I liked this book even better than The Omnivore's Dilemma. When you strip aside the somewhat heavy-handed Apollo vs. Dionysus metaphor and the provocative subtitle that suggests that it's plants, not people, who invented agriculture -- that we're essentially only sophisticated bees -- you get a fascinating set of histories of four very interesting plants: apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes. And yes, they co-evolved with people, but that's really nothing surprising or shocking. But it is both entertaining and educational, written well and read (in the audio edition I listened to) superbly.Pollan takes a vast road-trip through history, and although it seems like a pleasantly meandering journey, it's actually quite focused and organized. In the chapter on apples we learn of the real Johnny Appleseed, and of the concept of sweetness, and of how Prohibition changed apple marketing for good. The tulip chapter touches on not only the (obvious) tulip mania speculative bubble, but also on the genetics of tulips and the virus that affected them, and on the idea of floral beauty in different cultures. And so on. There is a bit of moralizing: the drug war comes in for some criticism, and monoculture is reviled as the root of all of industrial agriculture's evil. But I don't disagree with these points!"
267,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431129-brian,4,"By the end of this book, I really wanted to have Michael Pollan's life, more or less. Though I'd settle for a nice house somewhere where I can have a big garden with all types of plants like his; that was the main attraction, along with the requisite knowledge and experience of nature itself and the nature of how things grow, in a word. As noble as it sounds in theory for man to be in harmony with nature, it becomes clear by his summation in the epilogue that it's nothing less than quite practical. But most of all, it's rewarding.Part of why I must feel this even stronger pull towards plants after finishing was that I think the order of the chapters was well-chosen. The themes on which he hit were introduced best with the apple and finished best with the potato, though I would have to call cannabis and potato my two favorite chapters. Loading up on everything else before you see the contrast of commercial Monsanto-controlled potato farming in Idaho with Michael Pollan's own backyard, you're smart and informed enough on the subject to feel passionate about cultivating a more symbiotic relationship with your environment. Again, which is why I want a nice house with a big garden even more now. "

Rather than us manipulating the traits of our crops, we've been manipulated by them!Though I disagree with this premise (you can never determine an evolutionary reason for something, and it's hardly parsimonious to think of organisms acting as agents of selection on our perceptions of them (and how does this translate to fitness?), leading to us selecting for desirable traits in those organisms), I loved tracing the history of 4 important plants (apple, potato, tulip, marijuana) and their interactions with humans."

Lots of face-palms.The musings on the effects of Marijuana is really uncomfortable.Pollan obviously wrote this chapter while high.He suggests that meditation can get you high like Marijuana, which just isn't true.He rambles on about spirituality, which is bizarre and metaphysical.The potato.Pollan shares with us his ignorance-fueled skepticism about GM crops.He states, falsely, that Monsanto has a patent on the BT gene.In fact, Monsanto's patents cover specific plant genomes with the BT gene inserted at a particular location.The difference being, Monsanto did not come up with the BT gene.What they rightfully call their intellectual property is the work of figuring out how to make the BT gene work inside each plant.Evil patents are no argument against GM crops than they are an argument against pharmaceuticals.His other argument is some philosophical nuance of object vs. subject.He seems to be putting forth an argument for purity.That intentional tampering directly with the genome is different and worse than using ""natural"" techniques like cloning, grafting, crossing, and other forms of artificial selection.Really, there's no functional difference between modifying the sequence of genes with one or another technique.Some techniques, like recombinant genetic engineering, offer more possibilities.Then, he whines about monoculture for a few dozen pages.This part sounds like it's right out of omnivore's dilemma.Apollonian verses Dionysian, blah, blah, blah.I wish Pollan would stick to the fascinating anecdotes."
273,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498454-h-kon-gunnarsson,4,"In The Botany of Desire Michael Pollan goes into our relationship with four plants: the tulip, marijuana, the apple, and the potato. He looks at these four plants from historical, political, and personal point of view. In many ways this is a fascinating account. For example the first one that goes into the tulip mania that the Dutch got into, which is both comic, and ridiculous at the same time, but of course if we look at the stock market in general, these sorts of things still take place, just in a slightly different way. Are the plants themselves passive victims in all of this or are they active participants is one of the more interesting question that he tries to answer in his book, but of course he can't really prove it one way or the other. Still, he does present the case for them being much more active members in this relationship so well that a question that might have seemed a little silly actually becomes an interesting one. There is one thing about Pollen's writing style, he does tend to take detours, in fact he takes quite a few one of those. This does make the book at times feel a little unfocused, but still it never really got uninteresting, even despite that. I actually got quite a bit of enjoyment out of this read. And I gained some inside into this subject. One can't really ask much more out of a nonfiction book, so I think I may read something else by him. "
274,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"Wonderful, wonderful book, full of fantastic info and insights. My main critique is Pollan's main conceit, and the language used to express it: plant species have domesticated humanity just as much as humanity has domesticated them. My problem is his constant insertion of agency into the process of evolution and mixing metaphors of individuals and of species. Flowers are not individually clever, and neither are species of flowers. Flowers do not manipulate bees in the same way that a botanist manipulates a flower species through artificial selection or genetic modification. Species do not have agency, the will to act. Only individuals have that, and individuals bees, potatoes, or water buffalo do not (to our knowledge), willfully offer themselves up as partners to humanity.Pollan draws an interesting distinction that I haven't encountered in my amateur meanderings between ""wilderness"" and ""wildness."" He uses ""wilderness"" in the sense of the Wilderness Act of 1964, ""an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."" ""Wildness,"" on the other hand, is anything that humans cannot control. As Bill McKibben famously pointed out, the atmosphere of our planet is no longer a wilderness, tainted as it is by the byproducts of our industry, but as every hurricane and tornado reminds us, it is still profoundly wild.Pollan uses this distinction to emphasize that while all domestication is a destruction of wilderness, it is almost never an abolition of wildness. The gardener uses his sense of order not to control his plants absolutely, but to guide and shape their wildness in certain ways. He goes on to suggest that genetic engineering may violate this pact, that by attempting to guide evolution on such a basic level is a powerful new way to write wildness out of the equation. He also offers the counterpoint that current techniques for gene insertion are (sometimes literally) so scattershot as to yield results that are even less predictable that conventional breeding.The topic of wilderness feeds into another interesting point, which is that ""memory is the enemy of wonder"" (168). He argues that cannabinoids like THC help us experience awe and wonder by forcing constant short term memory loss, and that meditation or physical exertion probably induce the same effect, making the view from a mountain peak infinitely more profound after having hiked to it instead of having driven.Another insight he had about marijuana is that drugs could be considered the mutagens of culture. If one assumes a meme is like a gene, then a culture is like a genome. Memes are constantly recombining through thought and discourse (intercourse in both culture and biology), but genuinely new ideas are rare. At the risk of spreading a metaphor too thin, Pollan suggests that drugs could be thought of as mutagens, radiation nuking the genetic fundaments of culture, producing mostly irrelevant or deleterious nonsense, but now and again creating viable gems (149). Kind of a fun thought."
275,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark,3,"This guy has inspired me to grow my own food and keep a few hens in the backyard. Being a little self-reliant in these unsettling times gives me a sense of stability and hope.In this book, Pollan takes a look at four plants and relates them to human desires, I think . . . He starts things off with the apple and goes into a bit of long-winded ramble about Johnny Appleseed's quest to sell his trees to pioneers and his lust for a 10 year old bride (fortunately this bit wasn't dug into with any sort of detail). Johnny's enthusiasm for the apple and his desire to plant the seed (and refusal to graft) results in the many varieties that adapted to new climates. Though I'm learning a lot about Johnny here, I'd rather have more factoids about the apple. I'm hoping the following chapters are more interesting because I find my mind wandering more than usual while listening to this.I've now finished up the tulip section and made it about halfway through the marijuana chapter but, at this point, I have come to the realization that this book just doesn't interest me. It's very repetitive and meandering. I'll finish it up and hope the potato's treatment can grab me enough to get through it.Later: I finished up and did find the potato section much more interesting but that's because I'm always interested in GMO foods, the science, the corruption, the danger to our society, the greed . . . I didn't really learn anything new as this was written quite a few years ago but it still captured my attention all the same. "
276,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/610744-luke,3,"The Botany of Desire was written in language that made it obvious that Michael Pollan likes to hear himself write. His ideas were interesting, following four plants, the potato, cannabis, the apple, and the tulip through their journey with mankind. I like how he approaches the topic, observing not only what people have done to the plants to develop them to our own use, but also how the plants have in some ways used us for their own ends. It is true that we, while we think we are masters of our own destinies, are intimately tied to the world around us. there is an ecological cause and effect that often escapes us because of our anthropogenic perspective. My argument with the book is that Pollan overuses imagery from Greek mythology and as a result becomes tedious to read in some sections. By far the most interesting is the last section on the interaction between humanity and the potato. "
277,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2967061-anne,4,"The same brilliant and creative thinking which I recall from my first read. The marijuana section is a bit dated at least in my state, CO, but otherwise, this book held up well."
278,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6894205-allie,2,"Do you talk to your plants? More to the point, do you think your plants talk back to you? If so, I have just the book for you…The Botany of Desire explores the relationship between plants and humans, but rather than focusing on human agency, food journalist and gardener Michael Pollan tells the story from the plants’ point of view. He takes the idea of co-evolution as his starting point: the idea that two species evolve in a mutually dependent manner leading to the selection of certain traits. Pollan attempts to apply this evolutionary concept to human interactions with plants.* 
""Plants hit on a remarkably clever strategy: getting us to move or think for them…it makes just as much sense to think of agriculture as something the grasses did to people as a way to conquer the trees.""
Reading this book was like looking through the wrong end of a telescope; the perspective felt distorted. I was not persuaded that Pollan completely understood some of the scientific concepts that he was trying to explain. It all felt a little…Gladwell-esque. Pollan tries to illustrate the intertwined evolutionary relationship between plants and humans by telling the story of four plants and the desires that they satisfy. Sweetness: the first section focused on apples and the story of John Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed). Pollan dedicates many, many pages to Chapman’s life and his ‘Dionysian’ apple planting efforts, which allowed homesteaders to get reliably drunk on alcoholic cider. (Inspired by this chapter, I created a drinking game where I had a sip of scotch every time Pollan mentioned Dionysus or Apollo. I was forced to abandon this delightful crutch since there were so many references to both gods, I was getting woozy.) Beauty: the second section covered the speculative boom and bust around tulip mania in Holland, with some random thoughts about flowers throughout history and some general ideas around beauty (e.g., symmetry is appealing as a proxy for good health). There were a lot of opinion-led statements such as 
“beauty always takes place in the particular”
 that didn’t resonate with me; I find the ocean more beautiful in its entirety than a solitary wave. Intoxication: by far the most interesting, the third section discussed how humans seek intoxication through plants, which produce stimulants like caffeine, nicotine, THC, and hallucinogens. There is some fascinating published research about these drugs, but Pollan spirals away from the science to speculate on how THC mediates consciousness and can enhance creativity by blunting memory and creating the perception of heightened senses. (Huxley is referenced, which is never a good sign. Also, you can apparently get high from hallucinogens secreted by some toads.) Control over the natural environment: the final section is all about the humble potato, from the diverse varieties grown by the Aztecs to the Irish famine to Monsanto's genetically engineered NewLeaf potatoes. Pollan is in his element here as a food journalist, talking to scientists about gene transfer and farmers about the impact of GMO potatoes on their livelihoods. This section raised interesting concerns about the unintended consequences of tinkering with the plant genome since genes can “jump” to other plants via cross-pollination and their impact on the rest of the food chain is unknown.Perhaps if Pollan had focused on just one of the four desires, it would have been a more cohesive reading experience. But while there are interesting facts peppered throughout each chapter, the book attempts to cover so many different ideas that are only tangentially related, there was no space for thoughtful analysis. After finishing the book, I’m still not convinced by the author’s premise that: 
""Desire might be too strong a word for whatever it is that drives plants to reinvent themselves so that we might do their bidding, but then, our own designs have often been no more willful than the plants.""
Honestly, finishing this book was a Herculean task; only my determination not to disappoint my friend Scot who was reading the book with me enabled me to climb this metaphorical Mount Olympus. (Where, I should note, I looked down at all the plants from my lofty perch. Not a toad in sight up here!) It’s a shame, because Pollan writes beautifully, and could probably be very compelling if he was covering a topic where he has more expertise.*This is a established concept in biology applied to relationships between plants and pollinating insects or animals; predators and prey; pathogens and humans; and some domesticated animals (like dogs) and humans. The idea that plants and humans have a co-evolutionary relationship does not seem to be well-supported in the scientific literature. I mean, it’s not as far out there as the people who claim plants are silently screaming when we cut them down, but it’s pretty fringe."

281,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558460-caterina,4,"What if we humans are being manipulated by plants to serve their desires? From this slightly creepy flipped perspective, masterful storyteller Michael Pollan illuminates the crazy and complex interdependency of living things -- and also, some of the dangers we inflict on ourselves and our entire world by contemporary agricultural practices -- through four stories - and what stories! -- of the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. (Ok, he admits the conceit of manipulative plants to be a bit of a stretch -- but it's a fascinating way to see how we and our favorite foods, flowers, and intoxicants are, for better or worse, co-evolving.)Biggest surprise of the book - the potato's story turned out to be the most interesting and important (really, after marijuana?) and the best showcase of Pollan's skills as an investigative journalist/interviewer and experimental gardener. Who knew, for example, that Monsanto scientists created genetically engineered potato plants with a ""gene gun"" that uses a .22 shell to fire DNA-coated stainless steel projectiles into potato leaves in the hope that some of the alien DNA (from some non-potato species) combine with the plant's own DNA? Unless, as a Yankee from Connecticut, Pollan was being set up for a huge Southern joke -- which seems to me a distinct possibility -- this actually happened at the Monsanto lab he visited in Missouri. But possible joke aside, this story contained the most intelligent and nuanced discussion of genetic modification of foods that I've ever seen, with input from numerous scientists and farmers, as well as exploring the advantages and dangers of monoculture and colonial commodity agriculture (and some of its horrific history), chemical versus organic agriculture, and the effects of food culture on farming. Also, Michael Pollan clearly just loves to grow and eat potatoes -- it may be his relish that gave this story its extra glow. (Without ever mentioning vodka.)I also especially loved the apple's story, with the mysterious Dionysian and yet somehow pure, childlike figure of Johnny Appleseed spreading seeds -- not for nice wholesome lunchbox treats but for alcohol, and plenty of it, in the wilds of Pennsylvania and Ohio. (The woods I played in, growing up in southwestern Pennsylvania, were full of abandoned and decrepit old apple trees -- I had no idea of their history.) As this book came out in 2001 the MJ story was a bit dated, and although it focused on why the plant was so strongly prohibited, it never mentioned what I understand to be the two biggest reasons -- racism/anti-Mexican sentiment, and pressure by the American pharmaceutical industry. Nor does the current battle between states and federal government come up (which maybe echoes historic battles over hard cider and whiskey). Nevertheless, all four stories are surprising and fascinating, combining investigative journalism (involving quite a bit of travel), personal experimentation, and a good dose of wild imaginative speculation -- sometimes fueled by that experimentation."
282,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36890366-sud666,4,"Michael Pollan's book is certainly an interesting one. It germinates (pun intended) in Pollan's mind, one day, as he was working in his garden. He thought what if human beings were similar to bumblebees? It is an interesting take on ""coevolution"", which stipulates that two parties can act on each other to advance their individual interests but end up producing a mutually beneficial outcome.What if plants were able to develop traits that would cause other animals to help them in their goal to reproduce? As plants are immobile, they tend to rely on wind and rain to spread their pollen. But with the evolution of angiosperms, plants with flowers and seeds, animals had a new reason to eat those plants and they spread the seeds for the plant, or pollen in the case of the bee.He then stipulates that the four plants he covers have also evolved in such a way as to appeal to the human animal and, by doing so, have been able to spread their seed all across the world. The four plants he looks at are perfect examples of how they have managed to ""attract"" human beings. Pollan also links each of these plants to a specific desire. They are as follows:The apple, which utilizes the sense of sweetness.The Tulip, which utilizes the sense of beauty.The potato, which utilizes the sense of control.The marijuana plant, which utilizes the sense of intoxication.Each of these plants gets a detailed history. You will learn where they came from, how they were modified and how they entered into the human world. The stories are interesting, though I could have done with less of the personal ruminations, it is the history and the science behind these four plants that make this an interesting book to read.It is hardly overly technical and quite easy for a science dunce to comprehend. If you are looking for something more science-heavy, I'd pass on this. This is a book that tells the tale of science through the prism of human desire. Pollan does a good job of explaining things like the Diyonisian concepts and how they melded into how humans view intoxication and their views on marijuana.An interesting book that will make you think and while not science-heavy, this is a book that will interest science and non-science people alike. Interesting anecdotes and some cool history make this a rather unique book."

I mean, I want to know about Michael Pollan, he is huge and important, right? And everybody in Berkeley wants him to be Obama's Secretary of Agriculture. (Though I guess I haven't read Obama's books, so.) I liked it! I was kind of surprised, I think I was expecting something dryer. Mostly it was just this pretty smart guy talking about stuff he likes: natural selection, Johnny Appleseed, weed stories, people, Dionysus, bugs and genetically modified foods. I thought it was pretty great how in the beginning he was like, Here are four things I'm going to talk about, but then he didn't tell you what he was gonna say about 'em- like, you know the last chapter's gonna be about potatoes, but you don't know that it's going to be a conversation about the safety of genetically modified potatoes. And dude loves his plants, which is nice. It felt pretty repetitive at times, just saying the same stuff over and over, and that definitely got boring, but whatever. I was sucked in enough to bust through it between bouts of neck-pain sleep on planes and buses and trains while I was on the east coast for three days, which is more than I can say for bell hooks, who's all writing stuff I have to pay attention to and think critically about. "
284,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,3,"An earlier Pollan book, and a bestseller. Like the later, better, books, Botany explores its thesis, that the plants co-evolve with us, in four sections. There is some fluff here; the best section is easily on the one on intoxication. Doubters should read the introduction and skip to section 3.Pollan's best stuff always makes me see the world differently, and this passage changed the way I conceived of gardens, what they are, and what they could be:""I sometimes think we've allowed our gardens to be bowdlerized, that the full range of their powers and possibilities has been sacrificed to a cult of plant prettiness that obscures more dubious truths about nature, our own included. It hasn't always been this way, and we may someday come to regard the contemporary garden of vegetables and flowers as a place almost Victorian in its repressions and elisions.""He goes on to discuss a witch's garden, which included intoxicants and medicines, rather than just beautiful flowers. He argues that when the church murdered witches, they converted the contents of these gardens from taboo objects to medicines made acceptable by what we'd now call physicians. I'm sure I'm bastardizing the argument, but it was interesting. Great chapter.And here is one on what might be Pollan's greatest weakness as a reporter but what is also his greatest strength as a writer: ""I am literally absentminded, prone to be thinking about something else, something past, when I am ostensibly having a fresh experience.""Of the other chapters, the best is on potatoes, and the other two are about apples and tulips.As for the books, I still rate Omnivore, Cooked, and A Place of My Own ahead of this one, but if you broke it down to chapters, Botany's chapter on intoxication would jump ahead to the top five Pollan chapters, alongside the Omnivore stuff and Cooked's chapter on fermented foods."
285,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Not as good as the Omnivore's Dilemma, but definitely worth a read if you love thinking about plants as much as I do.The first section, on apples, was really dry (to me). Actually, it's less about apples and more about John Chapman (Johnny Appleseed) and I just... don't... care about him. Right, great, he planted lots of apples, we get it, he's a hometown hero. The rest is pretty well done, though. I especially loved the section on cannabis. I harbour a lot of curiosity as to how psychotropic plants and humans have co-evolved, and why exactly certain plants have developed those mechanisms, and how we humans came to have a neurology that happened to respond to those plants' chemicals. So that was extremely engrossing.Tulips also held my interest pretty aggressively, for similar reasons. The subject of why we even like and are drawn to things as seemingly useless (evolutionarily speaking) as flowers is fascinating. It's much easier to know without having to read a book that apples or potatoes and humans have fed off one another in time. Tulips are a little bit more intriguing.I like Pollan's dry humour but also his rich curiosity, but I suspect that when he wrote this book, what was really on his mind was his next book. The section on potatoes is essentially a short verse of the Omnivore's Dilemma. In the Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan seemed more enthusiastic about the material and more concerned with the topic (not that he isn't here, but he really hits his stride there). "

I personally liked the sections on apple and potatoes, while I found the tulip and marijuana chapters less engaging. The last section, that explains the practice and risks of mono-culture and the processes of genetics manipulation employed by large corporations (e.g. Monsanto) were fascinating and scaring at the same time.3.5 stars rounded down because I found the repetition of the Apollo-Dionysus metaphor annoying and pompous in its tone.Fav.

It seems that by the time the singular beauty of a flower in bloom can no longer pierce the veil of black or obsessive thoughts in a person’s mind, that mind’s connection to the sensual world has grown dangerously frayed.

287,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,3,"A very interesting description of the symbiotic relationships that exist between humans and plants -- specifically, apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes.Humans select certain beneficial species of plants, and specific individual plants within that species for culturing and propagation. Those plants then (over generations) alter their genetics to transform themselves into even more desirable individuals of their species. The human benefit is obvious, but the plant also benefits because humans cultivate many times more of that species of plant than would ever occur naturally.The history and the science fascinated me, but I felt that some of the book was a bit repetitive and in a few places difficult to follow the flow and narrative."
288,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2163177-kishor,5,"Mr Pollan uses The Botany of Desire to posit that the nature of our relationship with plants is a lot more nuanced than it seems at first glance. While we may have succeeded in domesticating a large number of photosynthetic species, they in turn are exerting various influences on mankind. In the process of regaling us with stories of four specific plants, he manages to lay a wealth of information on the reader. The four plants are the apple (symbolizing sweetness), the tulip (beauty), marijuana (intoxication), and the potato (control).Here are some interesting things I learnt about each of them:Apple trees grown from seed produce really bitter fruit; grafting allows the cloning of trees with good fruit at the cost of loss of genetic diversity. Produce from the former type of tree was (and is?) primarily used for producing cider and applejack; Johnny ""Appleseed"" Chapman, it turns out, was responsible for keeping the American frontier well lubricated with spirits.The tulip flower is colored by two chemicals; a base layer of pigment and another (anthocyanin) on top. Famous beauties amongst the tulip family (check out the Semper Augustus, it's *amazing*) are patterned due to the activity of a virus that causes the anthocyanin to degrade, allowing the base layer to be seen. The author draws on Apollo and Dionysus heavily in this chapter, contrasting the Apollonian austerity and order of the tulip with the Dionysian seduction of other flowers like the peony and the rose.The marijuana plant diverged at some point in history to grow as two different varieties - the indica strain is much more potent and can withstand frost, while the sativa strain gives the consumer a ""clear, bell-like high"" but requires equatorial climes to grow. Growers have hybridized the two, thereby combining their strengths and downplaying their weaknesses. An interesting point that Michael brings up in this section is that humanity is constantly seeking out ways to alter its state of consciousness; in fact, this is a thing we do even as children, be it by consuming sugary snacks, spinning around fast until dizziness causes visual hallucinations, holding our breath until we spots, and so on. Adults do this too, through the mechanisms of ""meditation, fasting, exercise, amusement park rides, ..., music, eating spicy foods"", etc. The human body has its own cannabinoid system, and produces a THC-like neurotransmitter named ""anandamide"" by the discoverer; the name stems from ""ananda"", the Sanskrit word for bliss.He uses his section on the potato to talk about genetic engineering, again weaving a narrative of Apollonian order vs Dionysian wildness. Mr Pollan planted in his garden the potato known as the NewLeaf, engineered by the Monsanto corporation, producing its own insecticide in its leaves. While this helps fight the evil Colorado potato beetle and saves farmers from having to coat their fields with nasty chemicals, it means that agriculture is moving towards a monoculture and a subsequent loss of biodiversity. The organic farmer who seeds their fields with a variety of crop, however, doesn't care about the susceptibilities of any one plant; the overall crop is always (barring bizarre tornadoes, I mean) guaranteed to do fine.All this plant talk makes me want to take up gardening!"
289,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"This is another time where I've read a book and only come back to write the review many, many, many months later. In this case, I read the book (listened to the Audible, technically) back in March 2017 and now I'm reviewing it in January 2018. The reason it's taken so long is that I flagged several passages for transcription into my notes, and I only just now got around to doing it. (19 notes in an hour is actually pretty good for me.)So I'll just have to leave you with some vague impressions.For one, Michael Pollan can write. I was struck--going through and transcribing some of my notes--once again by the variety and precision of his language. He is a really, really great writer. Quick sample:Imagine a moment when the sensation of honey or sugar on the tongue was an astonishment, a kind of intoxication. The closest I've ever come to recovering such a sense of sweetness was secondhand, though it left a powerful impression on me ever so. I'm thinking of my son's first experience of sugar: the icing on the cake at his first birthday. I have only the testimony of Isaac's face to go by (that, and his fierceness to repeat the experience), but it was plain that his first encounter with sugar had intoxicated him--was in fact an ecstasy, in the literal sense of the word. That is, he was beside himself with the pleasure of it, no longer her with me in space and time in quite the same way he had been just a moment before. Between bites Isaac gazed up at me in amazement (he was on my lap, and I was delivering the ambrosial forkfuls to his gaping mouth) as if to exclaim, ""Your world contains this? From this day forward I shall dedicate my life to it."" (Which he basically has done.) And I remember thinking, this is no minor desire, and then wondered: Could it be that sweetness is the prototype of all desire?I almost feel like this talent is lost on non-fiction. Why isn't Pollan writing novels?(Just went and checked. He hasn't written any. He did get both his BA and MA in English, though. So that goes some distance to explaining his writing chops.)The passage above is also a good example of Pollan's wide-ranging syntheses. He's very good at pulling from pretty disparate sources in surprising and illuminating ways.The most powerful passages of the book for me were the ones about Johnny Appleseed. I was really impressed by how Pollan was able to bring some historical weight along with almost mythic significance to the story, and was surprised again and again by what I learned about apples (along with, later, potatoes and tulips. Cannabis was less impressive.)I can see where critics can find fault with the book. Because it's a broad approach, it is also a little thin and shallow in spots. I'm fine with that. More often than not, the problem with 200-page popular science books is that they have way too little material and far too much padding. Although there are a few patchy spots, in general Pollan never runs out of ideas or material, and the book is satisfyingly compelling from page 1 on to the end."
290,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,4,"After reading The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals, I was determined to read more by Michael Pollan. It took me three years to get around to reading this book, but I'm glad I finally did. It's a bit more metaphysical than the other books I've read by him, but still very informative and interesting. I was fascinated by his exploration of the four different kinds of plants and the human desires sated by each. And I was amused by his continual revisitation of the Dionysus/Apollo metaphor throughout the book. interesting quotes:""So the question arose in my mind that day: Did I choose to plant these potatoes, or did the potato make me do it? In fact, both statements are true...Yet evolution consists of an infinitude of trivial, unconscious events, and in the evolution of the potato my reading of a particular seed catalog on a particular January evening counts as one of them."" (p. xv)""Domesticated species don't command our respect the way their wild cousins often do. Evolution may reward interdependence, but our thinking selves continue to prize self-reliance. The wolf is somehow more impressive than the dog. Yet there are fifty million dogs in America today, only ten thousand wolves. So what does the dog know about getting along in this world that its wild ancestor doesn't? The big thing the dog knows about-the subject matter it has mastered in the ten thousand years it has been evolving at our side-is us: our needs and desires, our emotions and values, all of which it has folded into its genes as part of a sophisticated strategy for survival."" (pp. xvi-xvii)""The four desires I explore here are sweetness, broadly defined, in the story of the apple;beauty in the tulip's;intoxication in the story of cannibis; and control in the story of the potato-specifically, in the story of a genetically altered potato I grew in my garden to see where the ancient arts of domestication may now be headed. (p. xviii)""Every wild apple shrub excites our expectations thus,"" Thoreau wrote, ""somewhat as every wild child. It is, perhaps, a prince in disguise. What a lesson to man!...Poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures, and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men."" (p. 45)""Symmetry is an unmistakable sign that there's relevant information in a place. That's because symmetry is a property shared by a relatively small number of things in the landscape, all of them of keen interest to us. The shortlist of nature's symmetricals includes other creatures, other people (most notably the faces of other people), human artifacts, and plants--but especially flowers. Symmetry is also a sign of health in a creature, since mutations and environmental stresses can easily disturb it. So paying attention to symmetrical things makes good sense: symmetry is usually significant."" (p. 76)""Though we self-importantly regard domestication as something people have done to plants, it is at the same time a strategy by which the plants have exploited us and our desires--even our most idiosyncratic notions of beauty--to advance their own interests. Depending on the environment in which a species finds itself, different adaptations will avail. Mutations that nature would have rejected out of hand in the wild sometimes prove to be brilliant adaptations in an environment that's been shaped by human desire."" (p. 81)""Although by any conventional measure it is folly to pay thousands for a tulip bulb (or for that matter an Internet stock), as long as there is an even greater fool out there willing to pay even more, doing so is the most logical thing in the world."" (p. 103)""Yet this new biotechnology has overthrown the old rules governing the relationship of nature and culture in a plant. Domestication has never been a simple one-way process in which our species has controlled others; other species participate only so far as their interests are served, and many plants (such as the oak) simply sit the whole game out. That game is the one Darwin called 'artificial selection,' and its rules have never been any different from the ones that govern natural selection. The plant in its wildness proposes new qualities, and then man (or, in the case of natural selection, nature) selects which of those qualities will survive and prosper. But about one rule Darwin was emphatic; as he wrote in The Origin of Species, 'Man does not actually produce variability.' Now he does."" (p. 196)""Yet for reasons we don't completely understand, distinct species do exist in nature, and they exhibit a certain genetic integrity--sex between them, when it does occur, doesn't produce fertile offspring. Nature presumably has some reason for erecting these walls, even if they are permeable on occasion. Perhaps, as some biologists believe, the purpose of keeping species separate is to put barriers in the path of pathogens, to contain their damage so that a single germ can't wipe out life on Earth at a stroke."" (pp. 196-197)""This is, of course, how chemical companies have always handled the problem of pest resistance: by simply introducing a new and improved pesticide every few years. With any luck, the effectiveness of the last one will expire around the same time its patent does."" (p. 215)""As much as I love the firm grasp and cerebral order of spring, there's a ripe, almost sensual pleasure in its August abandonment, too.""

292,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6879819-susan-defreitas,5,This book changed how I see plants and our relationship with them. I also now have an irrational desire to grow apple trees from seed and plant them everywhere. =)
293,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67444659-katie-hamilton,4,"Reading Pollan’s work feels like a conversation with him in the most casual setting, discussing science, while also chuckling every so often at his comments strategically placed in parentheses. He is an incredibly gifted non-fiction writer whose first-person style makes his work as readable as it is educational. This book personifies the foods described and paints them as our partners in consumption and in life."
294,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4110877-chrissy,5,"Michael Pollan is swiftly solidifying his position as ""somebody I want to know."" He's a clever writer, an inquisitive journalist, and a creative storyteller, as well as a shining light of simple food consciousness in an era of either not asking at all or asking far too much.This book is equal parts natural history, social history, regular history, botanical musing, plant biology, evolutionary theory, and psychology, with a smattering of classical mythology, memoir, neuroscience, and investigative journalism to hold the threads together. Pollan sets out with the aim of tracking four plants along their coevolution with society, tying each to a human desire that shaped it into what it is today: the apple and sweetness, the tulip and beauty, marijuana and intoxication, and potatoes and control. What he ends up writing from this neat little package of a thesis is something much greater than the sum of its parts, a veritable exploration (I use the word a lot but I think it really applies here) of what it means to be human in a determinedly natural world. One of the ideas he returns to often is that our relationship to the natural world is a balancing of Apollonian (controlled, geometric, structured, artificial) and Dionysian (frenetic, shifting, chaotic, and natural) forces, and I think he really hit the nail on the head with the notion as much as with the conclusion that it's a much more complicated relationship than it first appears. The complexity of the question is due in part to the many human urges (such as morality) that don't fit cleanly in either camp, and in part to the ambiguity of the agent in control within the framework of nature's chaos. It's an impressively thoughtful approach, and the broad reach allowed by a philosophical, as opposed to purely scientific, foundation means the reader gets to learn a little about a lot along the way.I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by divulging details of HOW each plant and desire is examined, but I will assure you that the how is not as straightforward and easy as you'd expect. This is becoming a mark of Pollan's writing as much as it always has been a hallmark of great writing: a clear and simple idea considered with breadth and depth in a manner so well-organized that you don't realize how much you're learning until you're done. I cannot wait to read more of his work."
295,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196103-jenn,3,"I thought this was an interesting but long winded book. The author discusses 4 different plants and how they have 'coevolved' with humans to reap the benefits of human interaction. It is best summed up in one of the first chapters of the book as the author ponders if he planted potatoes in his garden out of his own accord of did the potatoes, by virtue of their deliciousness, pursuade him to plant them?One of the main things I learned from this book is the value of diversity. From the loss of heritage apple varieties due to the desire for sickly sweet varieties to the monsanto NewLeaf potatoes that are themselves registered with the EPA as a pesticide i was introduced to this monoculture idea that I didnt know existed. I was shocked to learn about the stringent potato requirements of the fast food industry - only 1 type of potato without blemish is acceptable for french fry production. With the razor slim profit margins of farming a farmer selling to these companies nearly HAS to use GMO crops and/or huge amounts of pesticides to make ends meet.This definitely changed the way I think about organic vs non organic foods. I used to think buying non-organic potatoes was alright, but faced with the fact of what could potentially be in them (one of the potato farmers wouldnt even eat the potatoes he grew) i now feel that i really need to buy local and or organic for the sake of my health."
296,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914674-isis,5,"I liked this book even better than The Omnivore's Dilemma. When you strip aside the somewhat heavy-handed Apollo vs. Dionysus metaphor and the provocative subtitle that suggests that it's plants, not people, who invented agriculture -- that we're essentially only sophisticated bees -- you get a fascinating set of histories of four very interesting plants: apples, tulips, cannabis, and potatoes. And yes, they co-evolved with people, but that's really nothing surprising or shocking. But it is both entertaining and educational, written well and read (in the audio edition I listened to) superbly.Pollan takes a vast road-trip through history, and although it seems like a pleasantly meandering journey, it's actually quite focused and organized. In the chapter on apples we learn of the real Johnny Appleseed, and of the concept of sweetness, and of how Prohibition changed apple marketing for good. The tulip chapter touches on not only the (obvious) tulip mania speculative bubble, but also on the genetics of tulips and the virus that affected them, and on the idea of floral beauty in different cultures. And so on. There is a bit of moralizing: the drug war comes in for some criticism, and monoculture is reviled as the root of all of industrial agriculture's evil. But I don't disagree with these points!"
297,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1431129-brian,4,"By the end of this book, I really wanted to have Michael Pollan's life, more or less. Though I'd settle for a nice house somewhere where I can have a big garden with all types of plants like his; that was the main attraction, along with the requisite knowledge and experience of nature itself and the nature of how things grow, in a word. As noble as it sounds in theory for man to be in harmony with nature, it becomes clear by his summation in the epilogue that it's nothing less than quite practical. But most of all, it's rewarding.Part of why I must feel this even stronger pull towards plants after finishing was that I think the order of the chapters was well-chosen. The themes on which he hit were introduced best with the apple and finished best with the potato, though I would have to call cannabis and potato my two favorite chapters. Loading up on everything else before you see the contrast of commercial Monsanto-controlled potato farming in Idaho with Michael Pollan's own backyard, you're smart and informed enough on the subject to feel passionate about cultivating a more symbiotic relationship with your environment. Again, which is why I want a nice house with a big garden even more now. "
298,0375760393,http://goodreads.com/user/show/249241-meg,5,"The author adds a wrinkle to our thoughts about domestication by arguing that plants have selected for a preference for their qualities in humans, leading to their cultivation, ensuring their survival. Rather than us manipulating the traits of our crops, we've been manipulated by them!Though I disagree with this premise (you can never determine an evolutionary reason for something, and it's hardly parsimonious to think of organisms acting as agents of selection on our perceptions of them (and how does this translate to fitness?), leading to us selecting for desirable traits in those organisms), I loved tracing the history of 4 important plants (apple, potato, tulip, marijuana) and their interactions with humans."
