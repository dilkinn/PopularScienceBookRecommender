0,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14824621-elenabot,4,"A more accurate title here would be “Consciousness Explained Away,” as greater wits than I have pointed out. This re-titling itself gives the gist of the work's true project, which is to see just how far the explaining-away of our first-person starting point as conscious existents can proceed before self-contradiction ensues. A big part of the problem is Dennett's disingenuous attempt to masquerade explaining-away for explanation which makes it difficult to assess the true value of his contribution to the problem. A more minor annoyance was Dennett's penchant for rhetorical pyrotechnic displays, through which he expresses his sustained assurance that, should the reader fail to accept the terms of his reductive mode of explanation, it must simply be because s/he is a rank, blinkered dogmatist given to retrograde mythifying! Yet it turns out that, like a photo negative, even an attempt to explain-away can indirectly illumine the object. When Dennett's angle of approach leads him to self-contradiction, or else to smuggle in ever subtler computational and mechanomorphic anthropomorphisms in order to fill the explanatory gaps that are (inevitably) left over, we can discern the areas in which his eliminative materialist starting point fails us and where we need to pay the phenomenology of lived experience its dues. Introspection reveals a distinction between two ways that a thing can be a locus in the world: perspective and physical location. Whereas the latter can be defined geometrically, as a point held in a web of relations in space and time, the latter, as a qualitative locus, seems to leave us with an unexplained phenomenal remainder when we consider it from a purely physicalist framework. The criteria by which we conceive the identity of our first-person being and those that we use to conceive the identity of physical objects thus seem to diverge at this point, hence the so-called hard-problem of consciousness. Dennett's is an effort to explain in purely third-person terms the most characteristic features of our conscious life, most notably, the persistent conviction we have of being selves, loci of perspective, and unitary ontic centers in our own right. This is the persisting intuition we have of the irreducibility of our first-person stance, which discloses the world as experience. Unfortunately, explanation by third-person principles falls short of describing the integrity and consistency of the phenomenal domain, and Dennett is left throughout trying to (rather awkwardly) explain away all the phenomena that can't fit on the procrustean bed of his eliminativist methodology. In the process, reified computational metaphors are smuggled in to fill the explanatory void left once reference to the phenomena themselves has been suppressed. The central thesis in Dennett's work is that the self, far from being some ultimate ontological reference point, as it has been since at least the Cogito, is an epiphenomenal construct. To understand the significance of this move, you have to consider the foundational function the notion of the substantival self has played in philosophy. Now, we infer a substantial, ontic center to the psyche, much as we once inferred an ontic center to the natural order, via the concept of God. The reasoning in both cases is the same: if there's an orderly web (to borrow Dennett's own image) to be seen, there must be a center to the web, whether that web be experience or the cosmos itself. Losing reference to that center, we lose our last basis for grounding explanation itself in some kind of reality, even the restricted reality of the self, to which Kant clung for rational grounding.The placeholder for the center in an ontology is the sign of signs, because it is the organizer of all other signs. The self is perhaps the last refuge of substance ontology in the post-Kantian worldview. Phenomenology has since replaced ontology as rational grounding, and as substance was evacuated from the cosmos, it was pushed inwards, into the domain of “lived experience.” Now we find the last remainder of substance ontology in the notion of the supposed irreduibility of the “qualia” characterizing the first person stance. Kant posited the empirically unknowable central subject as a necessary presupposition for explaining the order and regularity that emerge in our otherwise scattered stream of experience. The Kantian transcendental argument for postulating a unitary subject that underlies and grounds the systematicity of experience can be summed up as follows: “If there is no central self, then there can be no regularity in experience. If there is no regularity in experience, then no explanation is possible, scientific or otherwise. But scientific explanation is, manifestly, possible. So there must be a unitary self grounding the experience from which scientific explanations are gleaned.” Dennett's radical claim, against Kant, is that we can have regularity, and therefore explanation, without postulating a substantial, central self stocked with qualia. Such a postulate, to him, is merely a reified abstraction from underlying, neural-computational processes. Dennett clearly takes an impish delight in his self-promotion as myth-buster extraordinaire. He takes great pains to show how the higher order unities of aesthetic enjoyment, responsible ethical agency and rational understanding that structure our experience at its highest are nothing more than the by-products of the collective behaviour of “stupid machines” in the brain. According to his multiple-drafts theory of consciousness, the sense of our being grounded in a unitary center of subjectivity at any given time – that feeling that underlies all experience, that we can give words to and call “I here, now” - is a mere abstraction edited out of a confluence of “parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration” that are inaccessible to introspection. The “I” that seems attached to every datum of my experience, making it “mine,” turns out to be a linguistically reified narrative construct. It represents the draft that momentarily trumps all others, the one that best streamlines the cacophony of parallel inner processes of endless revision into some kind of provisionally coordinated, working whole. There is no “central meaner” that corresponds to the linguistic sign, “I,” nor anything remotely akin to a causal agent in the brain. Unitary, centralized consciousness is a pragmatic “user illusion.” “Consciousness Imagined,” indeed. If anybody thought that the last vestige of Substance ontology that we find in the Kantian Transcendental Subject could hide here, in the fictive “Cartesian Theater” of phenomenology, Dennett would disabuse us of this notion.In his chapter, “The Reality of Selves,” he describes the self as a narrative and pragmatic “principle of organization.” It is not much of a stretch to say that, according to his theory, we story ourselves into existence, much as we are storied by others. “Our fundamental tactic of self-protection, self-control, and self-definition is not spinning webs or building dams, but telling stories, and more particularly connecting and controlling the story we tell others - and ourselves - about who we are.”He describes how making a self has to do with boundary creation, first via biological, then via cultural means. Boundary production starts with fencing off one's turf in physical space, as a cell forms a semi-permeable lipid membrane around itself. It culminates with fencing off one's turf in symbolic-linguistic space via the narrative identity-kits with which we shape our experience into a whole that bears the mark of our historic, cultural, and social backgrounds. Our narratives are thus our most powerful tools, as a species. The way that a spider spins webs to gain power over its environment in shaping it, so do humans gain control by reshaping their cultural environment via their posited narratives. Remember, consciousness to Dennett -just is- the epiphenomenal glow that attends a powerful, winning narrative structure. Persistent identity is persistent narrative. The boundaries of consciousness are the boundaries supplied by given patterns of narrative formation. Enter Foucault's analysis of the relation between narrative patterns and entrenched power structures. “And where is the thing your self-representation is about? It is wherever you are. And what is this thing? It is nothing more than, and nothing less than, your center of narrative gravity.” Far from being a necessary ontological postulate of reason, a “thing” or a “place” where you find your standing in the world, consciousness turns out to be a fiction that is successively neurally re-instantiated according to variable cultural patterns of stimulus-selection. The only “center” that we in fact have is an imaginative construct, a “center of narrative gravity.” There is no agency, no you, involved in this ceaseless editorial process. “You” are quite simply storied into being by your brain's underlying computational processes. The core schema of “you” emerges as a means of simplifying the discordant mess of neural processes so as to produce a coherent map of reality that your brain can use to orient itself in the world.So how do you get rational integration and unified conscious experience out of the collective behaviour of irreducibly plural interpretive strands of neuro-computation? To explain that, Dennett introduces the metaphorical device of a piece of neural “software” that, much like a serial computer, creates a step-by-step narrative thread out of the multiplex cacophony of conflicting reality-takes. Whether and how reason can mysteriously emerge from such a clamour of “stupid” computational “processes” is unclear. The metaphor does all the argumentative work here by painting a picture, and assures us that somehow, it just all hangs together like-so. Mental imagery is where we'd be most tempted to posit some kind of substance to experience, in the form of qualia. It is precisely this domain that he surveys at some length, although from what I've read elsewhere (Evan Thompson's Mind in Life has a great chapter surveying the current state of imagery research), the imagery research so critical to his philosophical argument is far from being conclusive. Mental images, he argues, are what most supply us with the illusion that there is what he calls “figment” or “plenitude” to experience. Above all, it is images that give the feeling of continuity. But it's computation all the way down, if you look at experience (of colour, for instance) from a neural processing perspective. Because he characterizes experience as a “theoretical, narrative construct,” there is no “hard problem of consciousness” for him to contend with. The problem, he hopes, vanishes through redescription via the reigning computational metaphor.And what about our nagging sense that experience comes as a sort of system, a perceptibly integrated whole, in short? “What we actually experience is the product of many processes of interpretation – editorial processes in effect.” In Dennett's view, it is this ongoing selectivity, simplification and editing out of surplus information so that it comes to fit a manageable pattern that can guide the organism's responses at the time. Moreover, “paradoxically, our sense of continuity comes from our marvelous insensitivity to most kinds of changes rather than from any genuine perceptiveness.” The “unity” that we take to be the measure of conscious realization is thus, ironically, a measure of blindness. This abstractive process of simplification that gives the semblance of consistency, integrity and texture to our stream of consciousness exists because of its great adaptive value, helping reduce noise in favour of survival-relevant information. Underlying the official editorial revision that glosses unity, our experience is, in fact, a cacophonous din. Nor is there any canonical version of experience that you could poke a stick at and claim to be the real, true, “authentic” version of your experience. There is only an endless proliferation of versions, of drafts, of angles and perspectival takes. This is not only too bad for the poor self striving for autonomy, but also for the whole endeavour of philosophy and science to produce a complete explanation of anything. A Kantian quest for monolithic, universal principles of perspective-taking (which could provide the basis for explanation) was a neurally unrealizable fantasy. There just is no rationally unified perspective in the brain.Since the interpretive pattern that constitutes “consciousness” is configured according to parameters learnt via cultural indoctrination, “pure” phenomenology turns out to be an exercise in cultural description. Far from offering any privileged access to my mind, it turns out to offer no access at all, since all that swims up to the top from this preconscious swarm is cultural script. Dennett's ontological commitment to a mechanistic-computational metaphor ultimately compels him to devalue first person evidence by claiming its reducibility to a “heterophenomenological” approach that a priori assumes that verbal reports give us sufficient purchase on lived experience. Every dimension of experience that doesn't fit into the constraints of his methodological presuppositions falls through the cracks as so much fictive dross. That experience is to a large extent a formal construct is an insight at least as old as Kant. However, what Kant and most of his successors had and what Dennett wants to do away with is the residual ontic substrate that was held to necessarily underlie the construct. Dennet would slice away even this and in its place substitute a free-floating tissue of narrative monologue, supported only by distributed parallel processing. Dennett's overriding motive is, I think, at bottom noble. He is troubled by the proliferation, in past attempts to explain mind, of homuncular, anthropomorphic, perpetually-unopenable, and intuitively-pleasing black-boxes which are supposed to designate the terminus of explanation. Where scientific analysis fails, a suitable homuncular resting point – a pseudo-explanatory myth or fiction – can be inserted. However, his solution to the problem substitutes one mode of pseudo-explanation for another. Terrence Deacon, in his “Incomplete Nature,” called the eliminativist pattern of pseudo-explanation a species of explanation by “golems.” “Golem” accounts are attempts to describe the phenomenon of mind by dissecting it into mechanistic/computational parts. Dennett's view of mind as an information-processing device constituted by the joint functioning of myriad mini “stupid machines” in the brain is clearly a golem. Deacon shows how attempts such as Dennett's to purge anthropomorphic black-boxes, or homunculi, out of scientific explanation only end up being forced to pay their dues to the qualitative loci for which homunculi are “place-holders” by bringing ever-more “cryptic homunculi” into the picture, usually in the form of “golems,” which are “fractionated homunculi.” Deacon offered an elegant argument showing that explanation by golems is a cure worse than the homunculus disease, because it proceeds by presupposing ever subtler homuncular properties (such as informational, representational, and functional properties) at lower levels, without explaining them. Thus, the impersonal computational machines projected into the brain are treated by Dennett as ultimate loci of representation and information, without explaining how these representational and informational relations emerge. Deacon showed how such a view takes informational relations out of the larger dynamic context which makes them possible and which grounds their real-world reference. It relies on an abstract, engineering definition of information which presupposes extrinsically-imposed reference – a human interpreter who can fix the representational relationship, or specify what the information is about. In contrast, he shows how information in living organisms is intrinsically interpreted, by virtue of the role it plays in the self-organizing dynamics of life. Thus, Dennett's reductionist approach cannot explain end-directed phenomena such as information, and representation, even as it presupposes these by inserting them, as “cryptic computational homunculi,”to make its eliminativist explanation work. I would agree with Deacon that Dennett's hand-waving pseudo-explanatory insertions, at crucial parts of his argument, of golem metaphors can't be seen, as Dennett claims, as just descriptive glosses to be replaced by the more complex neuro-computational explanation that is supposed to be forthcoming. Rather, they must be seen as the places at which efforts to explain away phenomenology break down.Lastly, the Kantian challenge of grounding explanation without the postulate of a unitary self remains. What is the epistemic status of Dennett's theory, if correct? If correct, and multiple drafts are all there are, then Dennett undercuts his own theory's rational basis. The whole truth of the theory is predicated on Dennett's (and our) capacity to hold together a synoptic, rational perspective on our minds that is more than just a momentary coalescence of distributive parallelism and interpretive pluralism. Otherwise, truth claims – even Dennett's – would be merely pragmatic fictional simplifications which are also inescapably distortions of the facts. An empirical theory that “explains away” the unity of conscious experience as an epiphenomenon undercuts its own rational basis. The theory, as such, can't even be coherently articulated. In articulating it, you refute it, because you presuppose the first-person unitary subject that you attempt to explain away. More troubling still, it doesn't seem to be capable of informing any possible perspective that we can take on the world.An empirical, homunculus-free explanation of consciousness need not be a reductive golem. Such an account is provided by such thinkers as Damasio, Deacon, Thompson, and Lakoff, whose physicalist theories of mind are nonetheless developed in dialogue with first-person accounts of lived experience. Ultimately, as Thompson points out, experience is, inescapably, our original guide, since the content of any of the concepts that frame a theory of mind can only come from our intuitive, first-person experience of our own minds:“To deny the truth of our own experience in the scientific study of ourselves is not only unsatisfactory; it is to render the scientific study of ourselves without a subject matter. But to suppose that science cannot contribute to an understanding of our experience may be to abandon, within the modern context, the task of self-understanding. Experience and scientific understanding are like two legs without which we cannot walk. We can phrase this very same idea in positive terms: it is only by having a sense of common ground between cognitive science and human experience that our understanding of cognition can be more complete and reach a satisfying level. We thus propose a constructive task: to enlarge the horizon of cognitive science to include the broader panorama of human, lived experience in a disciplined, transformative analysis.” This is, IMO, the path that philosophy of mind must take if it is to explain, rather than explain away, consciousness. Ramachandran states the challenge as it confronts us today: ""to reconcile the first person and third person accounts of the universe... (is) the single most important problem in science."" In the mean time, recovering the more comprehensive understanding of empiricism, defined as the clarification of experience, would in itself pave the way to a paradigm much more true to where we stand, and cannot help but stand."
1,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,2,"A friend urged me to read this book. I got a couple of chapters into it, and found the author was telling me that ""we are all novelists"", and that a large part of consciousness was going to be explained in terms of the ongoing narrative we spin in our interior monologues. Shortly before, another friend had persuaded me to read some Derrida, and Dennett's arguments sounded a bit familiar. (Oddly enough, the two people in question had been dating at one point). I looked around in Dennett's book, and, as far as I could gather, he had developed his arguments without looking at Derrida at all, though at some point he had been told that he ought to do so; there was a grumpy acknowledgment that there might be a connection. It is of course notorious that the analytical and Continental schools of philosophy don't get on very well.I read the whole book, but with misgivings about the basic approach. Even leaving aside the question of whether or not Dennett's work is related to Derrida's, I felt that this ""novelist"" idea oversimplifies the question. OK, let's agree that everyone does have an interior monologue proceeding in their heads, and that it has something to do with consciousness. But calling it a ""monologue"" is surely not quite right, since there must be more to it than just language. There's an episode in one of the Feynman books where someone asks him to visualize a complex piece of machinery. He does so. ""You see,"" his friend says, ""consciousness isn't just an interior monologue."" Or words to that effect. So the ""monologue"" has components of visual images as well, and most likely other things too. None the less, if Dennett had fully delivered on his promise to explain how the interior monologue part worked, and how it related to consciousness, I would in no way have felt cheated. I never really thought he did, though. He got to the point where I was expecting to get the explanation, and it degenerated into hand-waving and unconvincing examples. Well, philosophy is very often like that - perhaps it's enough that he made me think about the issues."

Dennett(Original Review, 1992-10-25)I feel uncoupled.Who knows for certain: their inner experience of sights, smells, emotions, and the rest?And this is why I often find the discussion frustrating; from my reading of his work, Dennett has never denied the experience of being conscious. What he is saying is that if you create a zombie doppelganger that resembles you in every way then the ""zombie"" will by necessity be of such complexity that it gives rise to consciousness. And it will do so from normal, physics-obeying, materialistic processes. It is in this way that we are all the zombies of the thought experiment - not that we are all empty machines that experience nothing."

Yes, the subject is extremely complex and really smart people fight about it in prestigious journals, etc.But Dennett has some fine ideas nonetheless. I go through periods of swinging in one direction and back again when it comes to what I'll just call the ""consciousness wars."" But lately Dennett's ideas are striking me as more and more correct (and I've always leaned in his and the Churchland's direction since I first began looking into these issues, maybe about two years ago). For some extremely brief, but exciting (probably more so to people already immersed in the field and the debate) overviews of his position(s) check these short videos out:1. What is the Mind-Body Problem?2. Can Brain Explain Mind?3. Why is Consciousness So Mysterious?4. How Do Persons Maintain Their Identity?"
6,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4377693-pvw,1,"A hard book to plough through and one that is so careful and meticulous that it never reaches an interesting or clear-cut conlusion. Dennett takes hundreds of pages to refute the idea of consciousness as a sentient observer sitting inside man's brain (a concept known as ""the Cartesian Theatre""). I could have agreed about that being untrue in half a page. When Dennett has finally finished explaining what consciousness is not, he disappointingly admits that he does not have a good alternative either. Ok, he tentatively puts forward an image of primitive man starting to utter noises to himself as a possible early start of conscious reflection. But that theory is hardly more impressive then the Cartesian Theatre that the rest of the book wanted to prove wrong. ""Consciousness Explained"" is an academical book that is totally useless, since it doesn't deliver any of the promises contained in the title."
7,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,5,"There were parts of this book that were quite difficult and that I would probably have to reread a few times to fully appreciate, but overall it was a lot easier to read than most works of philosophy and/or science that deal with the same subject matter. There was a lot to think about here. Dennett may not be correct in his several models of how consciousness works, which he labels with colorful names, such as ""multiple drafts"" and ""pandemonium,"" but he is honest enough to admit that they are just models. He gives solid reasons why his models or something very much like them could be correct, and he offers ideas for how his models could be tested in controlled experiments. And in any event, I was completely convinced that the intuitive ideas that most of us have about how the mind works, which Dennett labels as the Cartesian Theater, are completely wrong. Our comprehension of the world is not a visual story that plays out in our heads, even though it may sometimes seem that way. And it takes very careful thinking to avoid falling back into that intuitive trap again and again in new and different ways. I avoided reading Dennett for years, but that was a mistake. I'm looking forward to exploring more of his works."
8,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10588046-paul-johnston,1,"It is hard to know what to say about this book. It contains a lot of interesting information and is very readable but it is also deeply confused. Dennett is clearly fascinated by the brain and keen to find a theory to explain how it works. As I am not an expert in this area, it is hard for me to assess whether what he puts forward is either new or interesting. What is most striking (and annoying) for me, however, is Dennett's philosophical naivety and lack of sensitivity to philosophical issues. Much of the book is driven by the attempt to locate consciousness and he often writes as if we might actually have found this in the brain. Rather than recognising that the question ""where is consciousness located in the brain?"" is confused, he suggests that we need to give up our naive view of consciousness and recognise that all there is are the things he can actually find in the brain. I imagine that if Dennett were interested in mathematics, he would be in favour of ambitious rocket missions to discover the Platonic realm in which there are shapes that perfectly obey the rules of geometry and that if these missions fail, he would argue that we have to give up geometry or adapt it to the realities of the shapes we actually enter in the physical world. Dennett claims to have learnt a lot from Wittgenstein but he persists in seeing introspection as consisting of accurate or inaccurate reports on inner events. He then thinks that scientific research can give us a fuller and more accurate account than introspection. But this is confused. Take the example of dreams. When I tell you my dream, what is interesting for me (and possibly for you) is my account of my dream. If scientists could strap something to my head and give a totally different narrative account of what went on in my head during REM sleep that might also be interesting, but the accounts are different rather than in competition. If I am puzzled as to why I saw you in my dream, the scientist's claim that actually I saw my father may raise new puzzles but it does not help me with my initial puzzlement or necessarily eliminate my wish to reflect on why I dreamed of you. If someone gives the scientist the power to forbid me to use the word ""dreamed"" in relation to my account, then I will have to say ""I quasi-dreamed of you"" and when I wake in the morning I will have to try to remember to say: ""I had a strange quasi-dream last night"", so that the confusion between the language-game I am playing and the language-game the scientist is playing is harder to fall into. Another general confusion that pervades Dennetts' book is the failure to recognise the difference between conceptual issues and empirical issues. Faced with a philosophical problem, Dennett hopes that a mass of empirical research can resolve the issue, but if we don't know our way around our concepts, then trying to apply the concepts in all sorts of unusual situations is only likely to make matters worse. If you are lost, the solution is not to try to move more quickly, but to stop and try to make sense of where you are and where you came from. So perhaps Dennett has produced an interesting theory of the brain, but he is certainly deeply confused about consciousness and all the related issues he mentions (such as the nature of the self). He may be a good purveyor of scientific research, but he has little to contribute on philosophical or conceptual issues where he seems to lack both aptitude and interest."
9,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/173343-joshua,5,"Consciousness explained? Well, no, not exactly. But a brilliant book nonetheless, despite the audaciousness of the title (though I must admit that Dennett concedes that his ""explanation"" is far from complete and that cognitive theory is really still in its infancy--or at least it was when this book was written). I only read it recently, and perhaps it is a bit outdated for a book about the ever-changing fields of cognitive theory, neuroscience, and psychology, but, if anything, this book does a really good job of refuting the farcical traditional theories of consciousness (goodbye Dualism, Cartesian Theater, Ghost in the Machine) and presents a workable alternative theory: the Multiple Drafts Model. I won't attempt to explain this model here in just a few short sentences; you'll have to read it for yourself. Suffice it to say that not only does this book illuminate some of the darker aspects of our conception of the mind/self/consciousness, it is also well-written, entertaining, and really not that difficult a read for such an esoteric, slippery thing as consciousness."

Instead I faced with explanations of phenomena that could have been explained much clearer. And the lack of answer to my question being: How neurons give rise to consciousness.

There is no reason to have to appeal to fantasy to explain consciousness. This book gives a complete story and forevermore I'll be able to not be sucked into false thought processes concerning the topics about the mind.Metaphysics, when it's at is best is to fill in the parts that physics (or science) is having a hard time explaining because they don't really understand the object and the terms that describe the object under investigation. Dennett fills in these gaps better than any scientist can. For those who need make-believe and should be sitting at the children's table instead of the adult's table they need to read this book and they can move ahead as I have because of this book.The best way to think about our self is by realizing we are not an analytical point. Euclid's first definition in his ""Elements"" is that a point is that which has no breadth. The book doesn't make this analogy, but I do, and state that ""the I is that which has breadth"", and you know you are listening to a remarkable book when you can go beyond the points the author is making because he educates you so fully.The author defends this by showing why the self is ""a center of narrative gravity"", by showing how the mind is not like a Cartesian theater with a homunculus (little human) watching the play as the film unwinds. ""There is not anything outside of the text"", the text is just the final draft we think out loud. But to get there we first go through Orwellian rewrites and Stalinesque theater before we get the final draft from many rewrites. (Don't worry. The author explains this much better than I can. I'm just trying to whet your appetite in order for you to listen to this book.)The author steps me through the black box of the mind by first discussing the outputs we measure from our responses to the environment. That was the first eight hours of the book. He called that the analytical approach. That part confused me. I'm not a scientist. The next part he called the synthetic part. How we would build that black box step by step. That's the part where I started listening to every word because it just excited me.Understanding qualia, our emotional experiences, or what Locke would call our secondary experiences, which lead to things being our 'beliefs' or ""seems to"", is not how to think about how our mind works. When you can change a ""seems to"" to the 'is' with no lost of understanding just drop 'seems to' and the phoniness of qualia.The author uses computers, software, and universal Turing machines and Von Neumann in explaining his thesis. You will walk away with consciousness demystified. You'll be on guard against those who use make-believe arguments to defend a world that doesn't exist.This book is over 20 years old. I only wished I had discovered it when it first came out. It would have stopped me from wasting my time with people who don't understand that we have ways of thinking about the world that is not dualistic and doesn't need specialmake-believe explanations to explain who we are as thinking machines.I almost never change the speed of the audio.

As in his other books, Dennett is adept at weaving the ""soft"" thought experiments of philosophy with the ""harder"" experiments of the scientific community. Some of his most triumphant points don't have the impact they may once have carried, as much of his material has been accepted (or disproved) in the last two decades of the rapidly evolving field of neuroscience. Despite its age, this book is a stellar introduction to anyone trying to approach consciousness.Dennett's thought experiments and suggested activities for readers shed light on some fascinating phenomena of consciousness, including sensory dislocation & extension of self to tools and blind spots & the overly assuming nature of vision. This second investigation I found to be a powerful metaphor for much of the simulation that the brain performs in crafting our sensory experience. The discontinuity of consciousness is so striking particularly because of its apparent continuity. The brain doesn't so much ""fill in"" the blanks as it ignores their presence. Dennett makes the important point that this absence of representation (ignorance) is not the same as the representation of absence (""filling in"").The three themes of Dennett's that resonated most with me were the relationship between time & consciousness, information sharing and information barriers in the brain, and consciousness as cultural software.1) Noticing the varying speeds of sensory signal propagation outside of the body (light vs. sound vs. chemicals) and the varying speeds of neural signal propagation in the brain, Dennett points out that the ""present"" for us is really more of a ""smear"" in time rather than a ""point"". He presents his Multiple Drafts Theory of Consciousness to show that in such a situation, different parts of the brain must act on different sets of information and, therefore, there is no single conscious experience. This is perhaps one of the most profound points that Dennett explores and he does so frequently throughout the book. Dennett also points out that temporal order outside the mind need not coincide exactly with temporal order as represented in the mind, though the two are correlated.2) With so many specialized areas developing at different periods in human evolution, information sharing in the brain can be quite haphazard and arbitrary. The recognition that information may be present in one area of the brain but entirely unaccessible to another area is essential to understanding many functions and quirks of the brain. This is evident in many popular accounts of language disorders but Dennett also explores what this suggests for the evolution of consciousness. He imagines that early man armed with protospeech might have used ""vocal autostimulation"" (thinking out loud) as a means of bridging missing connections in his thought processes. In other words, if there's no path from A to B in the brain, there might have been one from A to speech to hearing to B! This clever circuit could then have evolved into silent thought for more privacy and eventually developed into the ""mind's eye"" visual experience of modern man. Even within the brain, there are likely many inefficient intermediary representations developed to bridge the internal ""communication problem."" Beyond evolutionary explanations, this idea is also highly suggestive of neuroscientific approaches to creativity. Speaking out loud, doodling, and gesturing to oneself may be more than just nervous ticks or distracting habits; they may instead be integral yet inefficient attempts to circumvent the missing information pathways in the brain!Dennett also includes a list of ""primordial facts"" that he claims any theory on the evolution of consciousness must explain. I found them insightful and important enough for any neuroscientist that I've included them here verbatim:

   There are reasons to recognize. 
   Where there are reasons, there are points of view from which to recognize or evaluate them. 
   Any agent must distinguish ""here inside"" from ""the external world."" 
   All recognition must ultimately be accomplished by myriad ""blind, mechanical"" routines. 
   Inside the defended boundary, there need not always be a Higher Executive or General Headquarters. 
   In nature, handsome is as handsome does; origins don't matter. 
   In nature, elements often play multiple functions within the economy of a single organism.
3) As for the development of consciousness, Dennett proposes that viewing consciousness as cultural software provides an instructive and productive framework. His evidence includes the relatively recent development of consciousness (and therefore the reduced possibility that it is hard-coded). So why does consciousness still seem to be similar across cultures? Hardware biasing - we're all still working with roughly the same base. Some interesting results of this hypothesis are that some humans may not experience consciousness, particularly babies and special cases of children who developed with very little social contact.Just as evolution is a difficult topic to write on given that our language is peppered with words conveying ""intent"", consciousness often has Dennett tripping over his own words. He fares far better than most, but be forewarned - books on consciousness can't help but be clumsy. In addition to being an excellent introduction for me to many theories on consciousness, this book has piqued my interest in the consciousness and cognitive development of children and the general AI framework known as SOAR."

14,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1938805-brian,5,"It wasn't easy, and many times I felt like Homer Simpson trying to learn how to market a bowling alley (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEqxer...), but getting through this book and tackling the weighty subject matter was well worth the investment. And I'm not kidding about the Homer reference: Dennett posits so many amazing points based upon areas of thought of which I was hopelessly clueless. I would have to set this book down and do some research to just get a baseline to follow his explanations.For any of my Goodreads friends that want to really explore the big ""I"", and delve into the what of our conscious selves, I couldn't recommend this more. But the recommendation comes with a warning: if you give the book its due, don't skim passages / sections and really work yourself to understand what Dennett is trying to say, you could come away from this book with a changed view on yourself, your fellow humans and this wonderful, crazy brain of ours."
15,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12856123-sam,1,"The thing that really irritates me about philosophers is their lack of empirical evidence to support their theories; they just borrow whatever suits them from whatever discipline, with scant regard for critical evaluation of the data. Dennett makes suggestions that can be easily countered and writes in a way that he is convinced of the truth but yet has nothing to substantiate it; his theories are built on a lot of assumptions, contradict these and his approach withers away. His rudimentary discussion of psychology was offensive; particularly in reference to ethics in his stating of ‘subjects’ and of false problems with transcripts. Further to this Dennett presented the argument that when information perceived goes into the visual and auditory store ‘does it get rapidly forgotten or was it not even consciously experienced in the first place?’; clear evidence shows that these stores have limited capacity and duration and therefore all were consciously perceived but rapidly forgotten; again another useless argument. I feel like I’ve been lied to. The book title promises ‘Consciousness Explained’ and for the first 200 pages there is no explanation at all; then there are only a few pages of vague description of Dennett’s ‘Multiple Drafts’ theory. Dennett spends an awful lot time trying to disprove the ‘Cartesian theatre’ as if he’s the only person wise enough to understand the fallacy of having a homunculus inside your mind; it begets the question who then is in their mind? I suppose I should have done my research and understood that this book was written in the early 90’s when perhaps people did believe in this and they needed some convincing. I felt I’d been transported back to reading Darwin’s Origin of Species where I was being circuitously persuaded about the truth of evolution; it was completely unnecessary. Dennett writes as if he’s telling a convoluted story and I felt like Dickens’ Gradgrind as I kept shouting in my head to myself ‘Facts, give me facts!’ It also amused me greatly that Dennett seemed to think that the concept of parallel processing was difficult to understand and accept, as oppose to serial processing. I don’t know if it’s because I did A-level computing, or if because modern psychology understands that the brain works like this, but I found myself aghast at his patronising. Is it really that difficult to imagine multiple processes happening in the brain at once and none having central authority in much the same way a computer time shares processing speed?I think one issue Dennett has is that he has made the assumption that perception is consciousness; which I doubt to be true. He spends a lot of time discussing the processing of external stimuli and how this broaches consciousness yet he fails to acknowledge until his final pages that a blind person is still conscious, so vision has nothing to do with it. He seems to reject any idea of a preconscious or unconscious which is quite clear when he’s describing the dorsal and ventral streams and the research by Gazzaniga on split-brain patients; it is obvious from this that consciousness is in our left hemisphere and tied to language in some way and our preconscious is in our right hemisphere. He also neglects discussion of different speeds of processing within the brain and seems to think that they all occur at the same time and there are delays for things travelling at greater distances; perhaps one is just faster and they appear at the same time. Dennett is also misguided in his discussions on judgement as there has been recent empirical research that we intuit a lot of our decisions from bias due to our hardwiring before any evidence is actually logicised. It further amused me when Dennett proposes that our brain sizes increased so fast at the dawn of the Ice Age but yet neglects that the fossil records are incomplete; most human fossils have been located in hot countries, where there is no ice to preserve fossils until discovery, so therefore there were no fossils being made during the Ice Age that have subsequently been found; it could very likely have been a slow process. Dennett also made a statement that ‘the way a brain represents hunger must differ, physically, from how it represents thirst’ and I found myself questioning then why do we sometimes eat when we’re actually thirsty? He seems to believe our brain is a touch more sophisticated than I would give it credit for. At one point Dennett quotes Marx who stated that ‘Language, like consciousness, only arises from the need, the necessity, of intercourse with others’ but yet this does not explain why feral children like ‘Genie’ did not develop language but was still conscious. Dennett suggests that people with schizophrenia when hearing voices are actually just hearing their own voice talking to them but not realising it is them, but I find this quite a naïve explanation as it fails to accommodate that there are often multiple voices of different genders. So overall he talks a lot of rubbish. All that said, I did like the idea of parallel pandemoniums and that your brain is coming up with multiple streams of responses at once and the best fit is selected; perhaps I’m more aware of my brain working like this and so explains why I find it difficult at times to say the right thing as I’m somehow thinking of several at once. Yet Dennett rejects the idea of a ‘stream of consciousness’ and I believe that it could be feasible that consciousness is just the observation of processes in the brain which actually supports his idea of a feedback loop and translator between different coded inputs. A large problem with consciousness is that it is but a small part of a much larger operation and our brains do things all the time that we have no awareness of. ‘We’, whoever ‘we’ are, are just a grain of sand in a desert of intentions. I’d like to think I control myself and make rational decisions as much as possible but there is a deeper part of me that is in far greater control and conflict with ‘we’, with ‘I’ and with ‘me’. The only fascinating passage I read was about the self on page 416: “But the strangest and most wonderful constructions in the whole animal world are the amazing, intricate constructions made by primate, Homo sapiens. Each normal individual of this species makes a self. Out of its brain it spins a web of words and deeds, and, like the other creatures, it doesn’t have to know what it is doing; it just does it. This web protects it, just like the snail’s shell, and provides it a livelihood, just like the spider’s web, and advances its prospects for sex, just like the bowerbird’s bower. Unlike the spider, an individual human doesn’t exude its web; more like a beaver, it works hard to gather materials out of which it builds its protective fortress. Like a bowerbird, it appropriates many found objects which happen to delight it – or its mate – including many that have been designed by others for other purposes.” Yet there is no explanation of how we intuit a thought, where it comes from and how it starts, but yet we never know how anything starts; the Big Bang, a heartbeat for the first time, the very first gene. Odd that, isn’t it; we can’t explain how something occurs out of nothing and I don’t think looking at consciousness is ever really going to answer that existential question for us. Whilst this book was awful in the delivery of its nonsense it did create much opposition in my mind and so I was grateful for the stimulation it provided to think a bit deeper about a concept I don’t yet fully understand."
16,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41953148-muhip-tezcan,5,"Solid foundation for thinking on consciousness This brilliant book by Dennett, one of the best philosophers of our age, will recreate the way you think about consciousness and build a strong foundation for a scientific, rational explanation of it, inspired by a perfect blend of neuroscience, computer science, psychology and linguistics. Most of us think of the conscious-self as a decision-maker, a driver of the train of thought. This image is shattered by convincing the reader that there is not a single line of continuous ""train"" of thought and there is no central point where ""it all comes together"" . There are multiple inputs, little particles of quasi-narratives, coming from different parts of the brain with different agendas and competing with each other to make their agenda ""win"", being written and rewritten over and over again in the process.This theory (hastily summarized here by me) may seem counter-intuitive and maybe even outrageous at first, but the author does his best in slowly chipping away at the established beliefs about consciousness such as the Cartesian Theater and convincing the reader at least to have a new, more rational perspective.I was also delighted to see that my own recent theories on consciousness are endorsed here. So I may actually be a bit biased in giving this book a perfect 5-star rating. But it deserves absolutely nothing less than a 4 out of 5 for anyone interested in explaining consciousness."
17,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81791013-michael-kress,3,"I'm fascinated by the topic of consciousness, and this book appealed to me because I thought it was going to give me a better understanding of what consciousness really is at its core. Well, it doesn't. Unfortunately, it doesn't explain consciousness like the title claims. That's fine though, because I'm pretty sure it's something nobody's ever explained or understood. What sets this apart from Descartes and the 19th century books I've read about this topic is that it brings modern science into the equation (or at least, 1991 science). He refutes Cartesian Dualism and uses Darwinism and neuroscience to try to explain what consciousness is. Science is great, but it doesn't explain consciousness. He claims consciousness comes from the brain, and I think that's probably true, but he far from proves it. And nobody has ever disproved Dualism to my satisfaction. I'd suggest you check out Nietzsche's and Schopenhauer's theories of consciousness because although they aren't as scientific, they're very substantive. This review sounds like I'm bashing Dennett and I'm really not. I respect him as a philosopher and liked the book. It just doesn't explain consciousness. Perhaps From Bacteria to Bach and Back will come closer to explaining it."
18,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3106051-leo-horovitz,5,"Dennett has conducted a wonderful investigation into the nature of consciousness. Not being satisfied to treat consciousness as something ontologically and fundamentally ""special"", he dismisses some misguided notions of the workings of consciousness which makes it seem as though there has to be some sort of ""center or awareness"" in which it all comes together along with the related notion of conscious experience as something which has further unexplainable phenomena, qualia, as its building blocks. Dennett insist on treating consciousness as just another biological phenomenon, needing an explanation in terms of more fundamental, unconscious, building blocks thereby dismissing the idea of qualia as ungrounded (unless understood as something further analyzable in terms of phenomena that do not exhibit qualia. These two intellectually unmotivated notions are related in that they both suppose that in order to explain consciousness, we need to find something fundamental which is itself like that which it is there to explain. Need to understand conscious experiences? Postulate the existence of basic states of conscious awareness which can not be ""explained away"": qualia. Need to understand the nature of a conscious person experiencing the world? Postulate the ""Cartesian theater"" at ""the center of the mind"" in which all the processing of the brain comes together to yield the final experience. Both these approaches to these questions are highly misguided: to explain the nature of conscious states, we need an explanation of their constituent parts in the brain, how the processes of the brain amount to experiential states, we do not need there to be, in addition to the purely physical processes of the brain, an accompanying unanalyzable state of conscious experience of the processing; to explain the nature of the conscious agent having these experiences, we do not need to find a further, smaller agent inside the mind, taking in all the results of the processes and experiencing their end result. Being predisposed to naturalistic explanation, as any thinking person should be, Dennett rightly concludes that these other explanations, being grounded in myths and mystery, will not do to explain what consciousness is and are often at odds with experimental results (which is, of course, enough to dispel them). Dennett does not have a detailed account of exactly how the processes of the brain amount to conscious experience (and it would be too early to attempt such an explanation), but goes a long way towards showing how scientific discoveries show us the way to asking the right questions. This is, it seems to me, both his usual approach and the right one. Upon suggesting that the mind and consciousness works a certain way, he accompanies the claim with scientific sources conducting experiments on the issue and sometimes suggest future experiments of his own that would test his thesis.In the end, Dennett is unclear about exactly it means for someone to be conscious of something other than that it consists in the person being in a state where his or her brain currently processes information regarding the thing of which he or she is currently conscious. This might seem unsatisfactory, and this is perhaps necessarily so considering the current state of our scientific understanding of the mind. In any case, he does not dismiss consciousness, is not a complete eliminativist regarding it (as some seem to think he is), but rather seeks to demystify it, explain how it is that we are conscious beings and trying to convince the readers that we can keep our conscious minds without clinging on to unwarranted convictions of the special nature of the conscious mind. It's all very clear headed and Dennett seems to say almost exactly as much as should be said about the subject: there is no center of the mind in which experience and intentions arise (no Cartesian theater, no central meaner), there are no basic building blocks of conscious experience such that they can not be further explained in naturalistic terms (no qualia), there is no serious possibility of there coming into being creatures with all the behavioral complexity of conscious human beings who are nonetheless not conscious (no zombies) and the mind and all its workings, consciousness included, needs to be analyzed as a naturalistic phenomenon with no prejudices concerning the ""special nature"" of subjective experience (phenomenology) that is not explained in terms of objective phenomena (the scientific method)."

20,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3748375-jesse,2,"This book attempts a third-person, analytic approach to the investigation of the mind/body problem, as opposed to the traditional first-person, inductive approach found in Descartes and Searle. For the first few hundred pages, Dennett relates a series of rational errors that plague the subject of consciousness; undeniably universal errors such as the phi phenomenon, wherein one posits flashes as movement, and the subject's tendency to say two related but distinct words at the same time. This leads to Dennett asserting consciousness to be not a point where one thinks but a desk where one composes ""multiple drafts."" This seems contradictory from an analytical viewpoint. Kant, in the Critique of Pure Reason, denotes apagogic (indirect) reasoning as being unable to lead to any sort of truth because it breaks Aristotle's Law of Non-Contradiction; yet Dennett seems to think that he can posit the subject as knowing and not knowing at the same time (as if he were an Hegelian!), while giving examples of what consciousness isn't in an attempt to arrive at what it is. But even here his pretensions to discovery fail him when he asserts that consciousness is not continuous enough to present a coherent whole, or arrive at a rational point, and he gives the inability to detect typos as an example; yet, rationalists have always noted the deficiences of consciousness: Seneca, in Letters from a Stoic, cautions his pen-pal not to speak of a book one has only read once because the mind is sure to have missed something, and stoics were cosmic monists, but epistemological dualists!  Dennett endlessly labours the point that the Cartesian Theater is magical and anti-scientific, but Chomsky points out that Cartesian dualism was quite scientific at the time it originated and compares it to Newton's ""objects at a distance"" in that scientists thought, ""One cannot measure this, but it is no doubt there."" Dennett never tires of attacking this point as if it were positing ""imaginary gremlins."" As a sort of climax to the book, the author attacks Searle's ""Chinese Room"" thought experiment as an ""intuition pump"" and asserts that human consciousness can be mechanically programmed. But Searle in The Mystery of Consciousness points out that, no matter how much information you have on someone, you will not be able to accurately predict, without any chance for error, how that someone will vote in the next election; this is because of the ""intrinsic intentionality"" that is an aspect of organic life, and which is not mechanically reproducable. How one views consciousness, as something rational or irrational, and Dennett is certainly of the latter perspective, is to a large extent determined by historical and cultural shifts. Bertrand Russell notes how European history seems to follow Hegelian principles - every 200 years, a rational age ushers in an irrational one, which later gives way to an enlightenment, followed by a romanticism. Isn't it romantic that Dennett concludes this book by saying we're all novelists writing fiction (as if he were Derrida)? I do not see how this isn't a dispositional problem (and if you've read Dennett, you may note his incessant deployment of childish phrases and cheap anecdotal whimsy as evidence). According to his theory, I did not compose this review in my head before setting down, but I am quite sure that I did. Russell says, ""I believe the whole mind/matter problem contains a lot less mind, and a lot less matter than many would have you think."" After reading Dennett's empty results, I cannot help but insist on this viewpoint."
21,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10380735-simon-hohenadl,5,"I really enjoyed this book for these reasons:- It is long, yet almost always engaging. The author only rarely trailed off in discussions that were meaningless for me.- It is well structured and well-worded- I encountered many concepts that I already had in my mind, but would have been unable to put into words, especially so succinctly- I found a great mix of reasoning, research and anecdotes.- It has philosophical and scientific depth, but a lot of examples from everyday life.I feel like a gap in my knowledge has been filled and I am better equipped for philosophical reasoning and discussions."
22,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2206973-rick-harrington,5,"Yet another book which magically escaped my attention, though reading it would have promoted my understanding of so much. Better late than never, eh? And as always, there was no program to my finding it. An old re-met friend rather, who must have been remembering me as I once was well over 30 years ago, lent it to me. He thought the book had my name written all over it. Indeed! Nor do I wish to lay claim to that identity I would name for myself, acknowledging readily that most of what I call myself is at best character-based response to happenstance. As to the enactor of my conjectured character, we may forget him as readily as that creature which eats its brains once they've served the purpose of lodging it.I can find nothing with which to disagree here. Astonishingly to me, I also find that consciousness has indeed been explained. I have no further questions, or rather the questions can be left aside and the work turned to more interesting matters.Such as, for a quick instance, how is it that we can rid our minds of those harmful parasitic memes which would harness our apparently hard-wired self-aggrandizement compulsions. What political arrangements might make us act otherwise than to incorporate any and all techniques for manipulation of the symbolic discourse of money toward our maximal individual corporeal advantage at the expense of any cultured ground? For so long as the Big Questions remain unanswered, there will always be some convenient jog to excuse whatever local pleasure or convenience we can buy at some discount from ever-attenuating meanings for value. Profit extensible to infinity on misdirection alone such as would cause P.T. Barnum to blush. Let me sell you self-confidence with that logo.Quite simply, whatever consciousness is, it will not outlast our physical implicated being which is continuous with the Earth together with whom we have evolved to this point. My mind extends - there are no bounds - into all of that stuff which can be understood in principle, but also into that which cannot be comprehended. Chance will forever exceed my grasp, else what's a meta for?It is the stuff of chance we will destroy for so long as answers remain deferred. There will be no end to our manipulations of words, of money, of tools of every sort because, as with a siren pitching ever higher, we will not stop. There is no ending, and so enthusiasm for ever-more is the only forever.Enough! I mean honestly. Just as it sets out to do, this book defines the question and along the way discards those questions which still compel so many among us to defer our very responsibility because it is so pleasurable to imagine more perfect unions.If, in other words, there were to come about some critical mass of readers who have mastered this work, we could finally begin engagement in those discourses which might wrest humanity from the degeneration which is attendant upon inhabitation by those memes in whose thrall our brains now labor.And in that sense, this must be the most important book I, for one, have ever read. By limiting the field for proper questioning it has in fact already answered that which by its end remains, its author claims, conjecture. Will enough of us learn to read it before it's become too late? It makes a nice dream that enough of us shall, which finally will not only explain consciousness but create it. Nice work!!"
23,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360306-joshua-stein,3,"I was trying out a new reading methodology for Consciousness Explained, reading the critiques of articles entered in journals alongside the actual text, which allowed me to see both the illegitimacy of some of the criticisms and the serious problems with some of the text. I strongly recommend that methodology. I'll be trying it again at some point soon.Dennett's text is considered one of the most significant texts in modern philosophy of consciousness, which is odd since there are some major criticisms of it that seem very strong. I strongly recommend the critiques by Ned Block (Journal of Philosophy, 1993) and Colin McGinn (Philosophical Perspectives, 1995), which point out that Dennett actually doesn't construct a theory of consciousness.The most powerful part of the text, which has largely been accepted and adopted even by many of Dennett's dissenters, is the discussion of the Cartesian Theater.That said, the rest of the text is kind of hard to read, since it seems fairly weak. Dennett himself is constantly hedging his bets, acting as a pragmatist. He does this extensively in his discussions of heterophenomenology and the Multiple Drafts Model. The problem, though, is that the MDS is not a model of consciousness, but a model of content and the way in which content relates to consciousness.There are a lot of reviews on here that are critical of Dennett but admit to not having read the entire book. I'm not one of those people. I'm also not going to say that ""Dennett reads like Derrida"" or something silly like that. The fact is, Dennett has a very unique and engaging writing style, but I think it's worthwhile to remain skeptical of many of his claims, and to try to follow whether the arguments that he paints as in contrast to his own are actually being addressed by the content that follows. It's a worthwhile read for those who are interested in consciousness, and content, but I definitely don't recommend this as a first read. Despite its accessible writing style, the actual content may lead to later confusion, as much of the debate has changed since the writing of the book."
24,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"Dennett uses some fascinating case studies from neuropsychology to debunk what he calls the Cartesian Theatre. He means the gut instinct we have that what goes on inside the brain is like a little multimedia presentation on a screen, in front of the audience of the soul. First off, he rightfully dismisses dualism. He then shows how there is no need for, or evidence for, a Cartesian Theatre. He introduces the temporal and spacial distribution of the mind in the brain. He shows how simple experiments show that our minds misremember by one of two means.1. Orwellian cognitive theory says that the subject of a false time perception perceives the stimulus correctly, but constructs the memory of it incorrectly. The new memory overwrites the old memory so fast that verbal reports are always of the false memory.2. Stalinesque cognitive theory says that your brain has a time-delay (like a tape delay in live TV shows) in what you are conscious of. Consciousness is delayed long enough for the perception-editor to fill in facts that were not in the stimulus itself. So your memory is correct, but the original consciousness was mistaken (like Stalin’s show trials).He shows that these cannot in fact be distinguished. He proposes instead a Multiple Drafts hypothesis, that the brain is constantly making up new theories and discarding old ones."

Now imagine if the bat only seemed to be a bat, and the zombie movies that it didn’t watch were of zombies acting like humans would act if they were acting like zombies acting like humans. How could we say, or at least acknowledge precognitively to appear to say, that the qualia of the unbattiness of the room coadaptively represented the epiphenomenological non-Chineseness of all anti-food experiences? We couldn’t! But here's the trick; it only seemed to you that you were really imagining this, but you are in fact the zombie that the human-acted-zombie is acting like, and your neuronal excitations are by definition unbatty because you are in the state of acting like a human. It therefore becomes clear that this is the position we must take if we are going to review Consciousness Explained, and yet when you look closely, there is no reviewer, and therefore, there is no review.

26,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"While Dennett is probably better known to most readers as a grumbly professional atheist, I really don't need any help in that regard, so I went straight to his book on philosophy of mind. I can see why he's a public figure-- he's downright chatty and personable for a chilly analytic philosopher, and at the same time clear and rigorous in his presentation of ideas.As for the ideas themselves... OK, the multiple-drafts notion of consciousness is something I can certainly get behind, and his attack on the ""Cartesian theater"" notion, while it seems obvious, is something that really needs to be done every once in a while to clean philosophical house.But as to how we arrive at that multiple-drafts state, he relies on an excessively inductive understanding of evolution and the brain-as-computer metaphor that seems to cripple cognitive research. I tend to agree far more with people like Searle, Dreyfus, Putnam, and Merleau-Ponty, whom Dennett explicitly rejects."

30,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32793196-ivan-herrejon,3,"Does this book explain consciousness? No.What I expected was an ontological exploration of consciousness. What IS consciousness? However, Dennett wrote rather an ontic one. In other words, a statement not about the entity in itself, but of the characteristics of the thing in itself. This is similar to difference stated by Aristotle between substance and attributes. For the former, we are discussing what a being is, which could be differentiated from other beings such animal, plants, etc. The latter explores the characteristics of said being such as how it works, what it is made of, etc. Dennett, however, does not provide positive claims of consciousness (e.g. a cow has four legs), but rather negative ones (e.g. a circle is a shape without corners). For example, he asks why when someone touches our forehead and our leg at the same time, we perceived the touch as occurring at the same time, if the distance from the leg to the brain is larger than the one from the forehead to the brain. And instead of saying it is because of the myelin sheath surrounding the neuron, which is something students learn in intro to psych, he goes on and on about how it is not because the neuron from the forehead to the brain has a spiral shape. Take this paragraph, for example, in page 231:One of the skeletons in the closet of contemporary linguistics is that it has lavished attention on hearing but largely ignored speaking [this is pretty straightforward, we have paid attention on hearing, but ignored speaking], which one might say is roughly half of language, and the most important half at that. Although there are many detailed theories and models of language perception [again, paid attention to hearing], and of the comprehension of heard utterances [again, paid attention to hearing] (the paths from phonology, through syntax, to semantics and pragmatics [again, paid attention to hearing], no one - not Noam Chomsky [that is redundant since he is included in the phrase no one], and not any of his rivals or followers [again, redundant] - has had anything very substantial (right or wrong [this is redundant ]) to say about systems of language production [again, ignored speaking].I hope by now you get the point. It. is. very. redundant. But once you remove the fluff, oh what a good book it is. For example, I love his""Shakey"" thought experiment that he introduces to explain heterophenomenology. Shakey was a robot that was able to distinguish between cubes and pyramids. So Dennett asks us to imagine what if Shakey was able to communicate with us. If this was true, what would be a more real, a more accurate response when we asked him how he was able to differentiate between a pyramid and a cube. One of the three possible answers is in term of binary code (e.g. ""I scan each 10,000 digit-long sequence of 0s and 1s...). The second response would be in terms of how geometric structures (e.g. ""I draw boundaries and look at the vertices, if there is a Y vertex, it is a box...). And the last response in terms of affect (e.g. ""I do not know it just comes to me. It's by intuition...).The importance placed on what the subject perceives as real is as important as what is objectively real, especially in the study of consciousness. People can experience subjectively a purple cow, even though there is objectively no purple cow. However, heterophenomenology does not solve the zombie problem (Zombies do not have consciousness, but they can still operate like a being with consciousness. In other words, it arrives at the same answers when observing Zoe vs Zombie Zoe's behavior). And that's how the whole book goes. A back and forth of an attribute of consciousness, a a problem which that explanation does not solve, and a limited picture of what consciousness is not.No, it does not explain consciousness, but what a great ride. One full of fluff and good ideas."
31,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12153213-kaj-sotala,4,"My feeling of the book is similar to Dennett's own assessment, in the final chapter: My explanation of consciousness is far from complete. One might even say that it was just a beginning, but it is a beginning, because it breaks the spell of the enchanted circle of ideas that made explaining consciousness seem impossible.The book has its flaws: it spends its early chapters claiming that some questions are unanswerable in principle, when later researchers have figured out ways of testing those questions in practice (see Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts for some of such work). At times it also felt like rather dry and wordy reading, even though I generally enjoy reading academic writing for pleasure. It may also be faulted for not always being entirely clear on what exactly it is that it does claim - for all the time that it spends criticizing naive views of consciousness, its offered alternative models often feel sketchy and speculative.But, coming back to the quote at the beginning of my review, these are flaws characteristic of the beginning of an explanation. If people have a mistaken view of a thing, then explaining why that is a mistaken view is a necessary first step to get them to think about alternatives. While many of Dennett's explanations feel sketchy, they are nonetheless useful for starting to sketch out an alternative and more sophisticated way of thinking about consciousness. The naive folk-psychological view of consciousness isn't particularly developed either; Dennett takes us much closer to something like an understanding, even if the distance to a full understanding still remains even longer than the distance traveled."
32,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"This book is a difficult read for various reasons: it is outdated, written for at least semi-professional philosophers and excessively focuses on the negation of a theory few who pick up the book are likely believers of.A large part of the book is about thrashing the mystical Cartesian Dualism. The step by step deconstruction is comprehensive and more but about a theory as arcane as the theory of earth standing on the back of giant turtles. For those who truly believe in an observing self - hidden in some parts of the brain, making sense of all going on and the true decider - are unlikely to ever pick up the book and go through the painstakingly rational refusal. Their first counterattack will begin against the presumed rationality.Materialism has severe limits when one resorts to it as the basis of a complete explanation of any major phenomenon. Let's expand materialism as something that is not simply a “matter” but also inter-relationships between different “matter”. In scientific terms, it would be both fields and particles. As we know well by now that the smallest, complete explanation of almost everything is the stuff itself. If we accept some level of approximation or misspecification, typically we are able to explain a lot of what is going on with much less of everything causing it. Even if a mind is nothing but all the brain material, and relationships between billions of neurons and their continuously changing status because of the interactions with everything in the environment apart from the existing and previous states, no scientific or quantitative explanation of these can completely explain everything going on internally. An iron bar and its properties of tensility, density, magnetism or shape might be explicable through the quarks and fields of all its constituents, but anyone who claims that the world is nothing but the basic constituents is missing the Eiffel Tower, the Sistine Chappel and even galaxies and black holes.In other words, everything is matter++. A bevy of complex relationships - even if each individually identifiable but even the most basic collection testing the limits of comprehensibility and predictability (like in the three body problem) - make utility of any purely materialistic view extremely limited. There may not be any mind beyond all the brain material/interrelationships beneath, like there is no Eiffel Tower below all the particles that constitute it along with their arrangements (ignoring all its history, symbollic values, aesthetic value, economic value etc), but how does this view have any utility?There is more to mind than individual brain components. This could be simply because of the interrelationships of constituents. Any hope that we will be able to unearth all of them is perhaps foolhardy. Brain particles, like every other particles, change every moment and has some unpredictability built in over and above myriads of internal and external influencers like on any quantum particle. For us to make any macro sense of the behaviors they cause, a dualism (and more) are as much needed as macro properties like any matter's density or shape. There is another way to look at Consciousness. Religious philosophers, or creationists, ascribed to the term God whatever could not be explained in the story of creation through the hard knowledge or science at the time. As scientific knowledge evolved, so did the concept of God. God remained available as an explanation of everything science of the times failed to while completing the tale of why/how we are here. The same way, Consciousness is often the term used to explain human mental states that are left unexplained by the brain science of the time (and the brain science still explain precious little precisely!). The author's narrative against Consciousness is also troublesome. Consciousness (or awareness or any mental state that is impossible to explain today with science) is partly explained away, despite the scientific incompleteness, as something that will be explained later with more science progress. And it is partly explained away using the analogies of the real life machines in vogue at the point when the book was written. As the author explains, many in the eighteenth century explained brain using the steam engine analogy. In this book, the unexplained is being explained away using the digital computer architectures of 1980s and 1990s. Explosive progress in how brains (neutrons) work ever since, as well as the more complex types of machinery (particularly networks including internet, social networks but also in hardware and architecture) make the arguments in the book appear quite outmoded. Effectively, what consciousness needs to explain now is different from what it was twenty years ago (to a degree at least). And the tools that could be used are also quite different from the serial/parallel processing analogies and baud rate examples used in the book.Consciousness, and self as a singular entity, have other utilities. Consciousness is not just about infinite regress: I think that I think that I think...Or in self awareness. The holism of consciousness allows us to ascribe intentionality to entities for punishments and rewards. Is a corporate anything more than its assets and stakeholders?There are long stretches where the author goes in extreme details to refute few would zealously argue for in serious circles these days - for example, an immaterial self, sitting in some part of the brain, making decisions and impacting the material world. The author ignores more nuanced arguments favoring consciousness, of the kind even an amateur like this reviewer would put forward as above."
33,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21126957-hind,4,"This book is pretty dense and heavy on the philosophy, for someone who hasn’t read much philosophy. But it’s well worth the read. Dennett covers everything from evolutionary biology to linguistics to computer architecture in a comprehensive attempt to break down the notion that consciousness is ephemeral and hence impossible to understand. He tries to accomplish this by attacking the common notion of how the conscious mind works and replacing his with an idea of his own. Unfortunately I know very little of the field to be able to judge for myself."
34,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74430567-matt,1,"I can't remember that last time I outright disliked a book, but Consciousness Explained was a struggle to get through. A professional academic philosopher, Dennett sets out to sketch a plausible theory of consciousness, providing a framework for experimental psychologists and neuroscientists to flesh out and verify. Both the craftsmanship of the book and the ideas within left me cold. I'll treat each separately.CraftsmanshipFollowing an unfortunate trend in science writing, Consciousness Explained is aimed at both academics and the broader public. Both potential readers suffer as a result. This book is probably far too dense and technical for a layperson to enjoy, unless learning about cognitive science is a serious hobby. Nevertheless, in an attempt to appeal to a larger audience, the ideas in this book are camaflouged in metaphor and lose their precision.This lack of clarity is not helped at all by the book's length. Entire chapters are tangential, and, to paraphrase another reviewer, Dennett will never settle for a 1 paragraph explanation when 5 pages will do. The tone was also, frankly, insufferable. As the title of the book suggests, Dennett is cocksure and a bit in love with his own ideas. This introduces a subtle undercurrent of intellectual intimidation into the book. Dennett frequently reminds us that if his ideas seem strange, that it is because they are revolutionary and he is introducing us into an entirely new way of thinking. The implication is that if you disagree with Dennett, it is not because he is wrong, it is because you lack imagination! IdeasConsciousness Explained suffers from a severe lack of focus, stemming from the fact that 'consciousness' is never clearly and explicitly defined. Dennett presents four ideas that each take turns being a major point of argument:1. There is no brain region or regions where information 'crosses' a threshold into consciousness. As such, there is no definitive stream of consciousness. 2. There is no 'central meaner' in the brain who reviews sensory inputs and authorizes behavioral outputs. Rather, parallel neural circuits throughout the brain discriminate sensory information and prepare responses, creating a 'self' as an emergent phenomenon, much in the same way as colony of thousands of ants can demonstrate complex behavior. 3. Consciousness is a virtual turing machine running on the parallel hardware of the human brain. 4. Qualia (e.g. the subjective experience of the color red) are an illusion, and simply correspond to 'reactive dispositions'). I should preface the following comments with the caveat that this book was written over 20 years ago. We've learned an incredible amount about the brain since then, and this book had been written today undoubtedly it would be more sophisticated. But I must review the book I read. I'll take each point in turn. 1. Dennett's adversary is the 'Cartesian Theatre', the notion that brain activity must be presented on a stage in the brain somewhere for the benefit of an observer in order to become conscious. This idea obviously runs into the problem of infinite regress, and Dennett rightly draws our attention to its dangers. However, Dennett goes to far in throwing out the stage along with the internal audience. If we assume that consciousness is real and produced by the brain, it doesn't seem so radical for their to be moment-to-moment correlates of subjective experience in the brain. We can keep the stage while still throwing out the observer.2. The idea that there is no 'central meaner' in the brain is now a cornerstone of cognitive neuroscience, and one of the most laudable aspects of this book is that Dennett argued forcibly for this view over 20 years ago. However, this issue is tangentially related to consciousness. This framework describes how the brain processes inputs and outputs, and not how the brain could produce subjective experience. The issue is ultimately that Dennett doesn't believe in subjective experience, so his theory of consciousness ultimately devolves into a more general theory of 'how the brain works'.3. One of the most intriguing ideas ideas in the book, but fleshed out in relatively little detail.4. The notion that qualia simply correspond to 'reactive dispositions' is the most polarizing claim in the book, and the most difficult to interpret. At times it seems that Dennett is outright denying that individuals have conscious experience. At other times, it seems that he is simply claiming that we don't have as accurate an impression of our own conscious experience as we think we do; as a result, trying to study the correlates of the contents of consciousness that we identify (based on our own erroneous impression of our experience) is a fool's errand. Wrap upA book only for individuals seriously interested in the scientific study consciousness, and even then it is a struggle. For those looking for a good philosophy of science book, I highly recommend Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (read too long ago for me to review properly). It provides a striking contrast to Consciousness Explained: Kuhn proposes one clearly delineated, intriguing theory and earnestly spends the rest book providing copious evidence for his idea and exploring its implications in clearly organized chapters. And he writes with an earnest style of an academic who is seeking to prove an idea to himself as well as others."

For similar reasons, I was less than satisfied with the final summary of his theory of consciousness. But, I'll concede that the failure may be on the part of my understanding.Despite all that, I found a great deal within this book and the author's theory that was well worth reading and pondering and ultimately I believe that if you are really interested in exploring the mystery of consciousness it will be well worth your time to read this book."
36,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1378061-lyle,3,"""Visual stimuli evoke trains of events in the cortex that gradually yield discriminations of greater and greater specificity. At different times and different places, various 'decisions' or 'judgments' are made; more literally, parts of the brain are caused to go into states that discriminate different features, e.g., first mere onset of stimulus, then location, then shape, later color (in a different pathway), later still (apparent) Others do leave traces, on subsequent verbal reports of experience and memory, on 'semantic readiness' and other varieties of perceptual set, on emotional state, behavioral proclivities, and so forth. Some of these effects — for instance, influences on subsequent verbal reports — are at least symptomatic of consciousness. But there is no one place in the brain through which all these causal trains must pass in order to deposit their content 'in consciousness.'""""You have probably experienced the phenomenon of driving for miles while engrossed in conversation (or in silent soliloquy) and then discovering that you have utterly no memory of the road, the traffic, your car-driving activities. It is as if someone else had been driving. Many theorists (myself included, I admit — Dennett, 1969, p. 116ff) have cherished this as a favorite case of 'unconscious perception and intelligent action.' But were you really unconscious of all those passing cars, stop lights, bends in the road at the time? You were paying attention to other things, but surely if you had been probed about what you had just seen at various moments on the drive, you would have had at least some sketchy details to report. The 'unconscious driving' phenomenon is better seen as a case of rolling consciousness with swift memory loss.""""Do you like beer? Many people who like beer will acknowledge that beer is an acquired taste. One gradually trains oneself — or just comes — to enjoy that flavor. What flavor? The flavor of the first sip? No one could like that flavor [an experienced beer drinker might retort]. Beer tastes different to the experienced beer drinker. If beer went on tasting to me the way the first sip tasted, I would never have gone on drinking beer! Or, to put the same point the other way around, if my first sip of beer had tasted to me the way my most recent sip just tasted, I would never have had to acquire the taste in the first place! I would have loved the first sip as much as the one I just enjoyed. If this beer drinker is right, then beer is not an acquired taste. No one comes to enjoy the way the first sip tasted . Instead, the way beer tastes to them gradually changes. Other beer drinkers might insist that, no, beer did taste to them now the way it always did, only now they like that very taste . Is there a real difference? There is a difference in heterophenomenology, certainly, and the difference needs to be explained. It could be that the different convictions spring from genuine differences in discriminative capacity of the following sort: in the first sort of beer drinker the 'training' has changed the 'shape' of the quality space for tasting, while in the second sort the quality space remains roughly the same, but the 'evaluation function' over that space has been revised. Or it could be that some or even all of the beer drinkers are kidding themselves. . . . We have to look beyond the heterophenomenological worlds to the actual happenings in the head to see whether there is a truth-preserving (if 'strained') interpretation of the beer drinkers’ claims, and if there is, it will only be because we decide to reduce 'the way it tastes' to one complex of reactive dispositions or another (Dennett, 1988a). We would have to 'destroy' qualia in order to 'save' them. So if a beer drinker furrows his brow and gets a deadly serious expression on his face and says that what he is referring to is 'the way the beer tastes to me right now,' he is definitely kidding himself if he thinks he can thereby refer to a quale of his acquaintance, a subjective state that is independent of his changing reactive attitudes. It may seem to him that he can, but he can’t.""""There is another way to address the possibility of zombies, and in some regards I think it is more satisfying. Are zombies possible? They’re not just possible, they’re actual. We’re all zombies. 6 Nobody is conscious — not in the systematically mysterious way that supports such doctrines as epiphenomenalism! I can’t prove that no such sort of consciousness exists. I also cannot prove that gremlins don’t exist. The best I can do is show that there is no respectable motivation for believing in it.""""But the strangest and most wonderful constructions in the whole animal world are the amazing, intricate constructions made by the primate, Homo sapiens . Each normal individual of this species makes a self . Out of its brain it spins a web of words and deeds, and, like the other creatures, it doesn’t have to know what it’s doing; it just does it. This web protects it, just like the snail’s shell, and provides it a livelihood, just like the spider’s web, and advances its prospects for sex, just biological product as any of the other constructions to be found in the animal world. Stripped of it, an individual human being is as incomplete as a bird without its feathers, a turtle without its shell. (Clothes, too, are part of the extended phenotype of Homo sapiens in almost every niche inhabited by that species. An illustrated encyclopedia of zoology should no more picture Homo sapiens naked than it should picture Ursus arctus — the black bear — wearing a clown suit and riding a bicycle.)""""Our fundamental tactic of self-protection, self-control, and self-definition is not spinning webs or building dams, but telling stories, and more particularly concocting and controlling the story we tell others — and ourselves — about who we are. And just as spiders don’t have to think, consciously and deliberately, about how to spin their webs, and just as beavers, unlike professional human engineers, do not consciously and deliberately plan the structures they build, we (unlike professional human storytellers) do not consciously and deliberately figure out what narratives to tell and how to tell them. Our tales are spun, but for the most part we don’t spin them; they spin us. Our human consciousness, and our narrative selfhood, is their product, not their source. These strings or streams of narrative issue forth as if from a single source — not just in the obvious physical sense of flowing from just one mouth, or one pencil or pen, but in a more subtle sense: their effect on any audience is to encourage them to (try to) posit a unified agent whose words they are, about whom they are: in short, to posit a center of narrative gravity.""""If we could see what it would be like for two (or more) selves to vie for control of a single body, we could see better what a single self really is. As scientists of the self, we would like to conduct controlled experiments, in which, by varying the initial conditions, we could see just what has to happen, in what order and requiring what resources, for such a talking self to emerge. Are there conditions under which life goes on but no self emerges? Are there conditions under which more than one self emerges? We can’t ethically conduct such experiments, but, as so often before, we can avail ourselves of the data generated by some of the terrible experiments nature conducts, cautiously drawing conclusions. Such an experiment is Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), in which a single human body typically, with a proper name and an autobiography. The idea of MPD strikes many people as too outlandish and metaphysically bizarre to believe — a 'paranormal' phenomenon to discard along with ESP, close encounters of the third kind, and witches on broomsticks. I suspect that some of these people have made a simple arithmetical mistake: they have failed to notice that two or three or seventeen selves per body is really no more metaphysically extravagant than one self per body. One is bad enough! 'I just saw a car drive by with five selves in it.''What?? The mind reels! What kind of metaphysical nonsense is this?''Well, there were also five bodies in the car.' 'Oh, well, why didn’t you say so? Then everything is okay.' ' — Or maybe only four bodies, or three — but definitely five selves.' 'What??!!” The normal arrangement is one self per body, but if a body can have one, why not more than one under abnormal conditions? I don’t mean to suggest that there is nothing shocking or deeply puzzling about MPD. It is, in fact, a phenomenon of surpassing strangeness, not, I think, because it challenges our presuppositions about what is metaphysically possible, but more because it challenges our presuppositions about what is humanly possible, about the limits of human cruelty and depravity on the one hand, and the limits of human creativity on the other. For the evidence is now voluminous that there are not a handful or a hundred but thousands of cases of MPD diagnosed today, and it almost invariably owes its existence to prolonged early childhood abuse, usually sexual, and of sickening severity.""""[S]elves are not independently existing soul-pearls, but artifacts of the social processes that create us, and, like other such artifacts, subject to sudden shifts in status. The only 'momentum' that accrues to the trajectory of a self, or a club, is the stability imparted to it by the web of beliefs that constitute it, and when those beliefs lapse, it lapses, either permanently or temporarily.""""A self, according to my theory, is not any old mathematical point, but an abstraction defined by the myriads of attributions and interpretations (including self-attributions and self-interpretations) that have composed the biography of the living body whose Center of Narrative Gravity it is. As such, it plays a singularly important role in the ongoing cognitive economy of that living body, because, of all the things in the environment an active body must make mental models of, none is more crucial than the model the agent has of itself. (See, e.g., Johnson-Laird, 1988; Perlis, 1991.)""""If you think of yourself as a center of narrative gravity, on the other hand, your existence depends on the persistence of that narrative (rather like the Thousand and One Arabian Nights, but all a single tale), which could theoretically survive indefinitely many switches of medium , be teleported as readily (in principle) as the evening news, and stored indefinitely as sheer information. If what you are is that organization of information that has structured your body’s control system (or, to put it in its more usual provocative form, if what you are is the program that runs on your brain’s computer), then you could in principle survive the death of your body as intact as a program can survive the destruction of the computer on which it was created and first run. Some thinkers (e.g., Penrose, 1989) find this an appalling and deeply counterintuitive implication of the view I’ve defended here. But if it is potential immortality you hanker for, the alternatives are simply indefensible."""

I'm intrigued by the topic but so much speculation about it does little to inform based on evidence and proper reasoning.

His conclusions seem sound and are given a thorough justification.I note that he doesn't exactly explain consciousness, but he does explain aspects of it. Much of the book gets in to what expectations we have about consciousness are wrong and the rest sort of teases a bit at what consciousness is.

39,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward,3,"A reader's enjoyment of Consciousness Explained will depend to a large degree on his or her existing perspective on these subjects, as well as prior exposure to the ideas presented in this book. I can totally imagine cases where Dennett's long and meandering argument treads the perfect path in just the right mind - firstly by spectacularly collapsing long held notions of dualism and the inviolability of the self, and then in the bare and fertile soil thus created, plants and grows the seeds of a profound, earth-shattering new perspective on the consciousness and the mind. This is a perfectly valid experience, and it explains the five-star reviews.But this was not my own experience. This book is now 25 years old, and having read later works by Dennett as well as others on this subject, the ideas were not ground-breaking for me. A large segment of the book is devoted to dispelling dualism and what Dennett calls the Cartesian Theatre, as well as other commonly held beliefs about the mind. This rather long section I suppose is necessary to lay the groundwork for what comes later, but the attack was so prolonged it felt to me like he was attacking a straw-man, knocking it to the ground and then repeatedly laying into it with a baseball bat.The main thrust of the book is Dennett's ""many drafts"" model of consciousness. This in itself is compelling enough, and I largely agree with the broad strokes of the argument, but the literary metaphor points to what I find so unsatisfying about philosophy in general. There is this pervasive reliance on metaphor, linguistic tricks, semantics, imprecise and loose terms, lack of logically sound and demonstrated arguments, and indeed lack of a strong connection with experimental data. The end product is an interesting and defensible general philosophy, but to what extent can it be said to have explanatory power, as would a scientific model? Dennett loves to coin or co-opt extraneous terms like ""Stalinesque"" or ""intuition pump""- terms that have some explanatory value but whose primary purpose seems to be to add colour to the writing and make it approachable (he seems absolutely desperate to coin a memorable phrase). But my concern is that using these terms also (in a nontrivial way) serves to obfuscate or oversimplify the underlying phenomena. When someone is talking about whether such and such memory recollection is Orwellian or Joycean or Stalinesque, I fear that they have strayed far from the path of scientific analysis and are instead reveling in their aptitude for witty observation, and generalisation at the expense of scientific accuracy. I can't help but think that if there were a comprehensive scientific theory of consciousness, it would sound nothing like this.All that being said, these criticisms may be a little harsh, and Consciousness Explained does contain a lot of food for thought. There is little in here that is too egregious, although there is plenty that one can point to as being a bit of a stretch. It sets out to explain consciousness, but it doesn't really get there, and ends up being a bit of a grab-bag of philosophy, neuroscience and tidbits of trivia and anecdotes thrown in. Flawed, but interesting nonetheless."
40,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,5,"Dennett makes an audacious claim in the title of this book. I think he delivers. I must agree with the reviewers who suggest that he does so with more packaging than necessary - the book could have made its case in about half the volume. Nevertheless, of the books on consciousness by philosophers that I have read recently, this one comes closest to making me think that the ""hard problem"" has now been reduced to a series of engineering problems.The author almost lost me in the opening passages. Dennett seeks to establish that we cannot be that favourite thought-experiment, the brain in a vat. His dismissal does not, to me, hold water, and he rapidly starts providing evidence that he already knows why. Consciousness does not require nearly as much bandwidth as alleged, the impression of continuity being illusory. Dennett leans on this fairly heavily, so the judgement that we could not possibly feed a bottled brain what we can feed the eye with an eye-tracker is somehow anomalous.After that, it's all uphill. Drawing on evidence from information technology, evolutionary biology, neurology and philosophy, Dennett shows that consciousness is not an all-or-nothing proposition; that consciousness is not a unitary phenomenon, continuum or plenum; that its illusion of continuousness is just that; that it cannot be a philosopher's epiphenomenon; that qualia are not the hurdle philosophers like to think and may not even exist as they think, being instead merely the associations that accompany commonalities in experience; that robots almost certainly can and soon will dream of electric sheep; that consciousness most certainly does supervene on physical brain states; and that, ultimately, ""you"" as such don't really exist. This latter will disappoint both religious fundamentalists and many materialist rationalists, but it's not really arguable when you set Dennett's case in the context of Oliver Sacks' neurology. We are a committee of daemons that only on average talk and communicate with one another.The central drive of this book is aimed at crushing the Cartesian Theatre beneath his wheels, and a lot of space and effort goes into shattering the illusions that it creates. He uses the neat term of a ""virtus dormitiva"" to show why the idea is neither sustainable nor philosophically coherent. A man is not a conscious man because he a has a conscious homunculus in his head looking at the projection screen of the brain. This leads to instant infinite regress; it solves nothing.No, the homunculi of the mind are subsystems etching drafts of fragments of selective glimpses of the phenomenal and ideal. ""You"" arise out of the chatter between them as drafts are pulled up, stitched together and discarded; a mnemonic habit of talking to oneself that one day became a mental voice instead of a real one. In this way, the conscious can be reduced to components of the unconscious. And that, as Dennett says in closing, is what it means to explain something. "
41,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/504424-bup,5,"I have not fully accepted the author's claim (that he has explained consciousness), nor, obviously, his model for consciousness, but there is so much fascinating mind food in here that it's well worth five stars.I guess this book has become a de rigeur foundational piece for anybody interested in what consciousness is, because he sets up a groundwork for discussing it, and he covers lots of things (like Descartes' consideration of the question), and the thought experiments provide wonderful fodder for at least making me consider what counts, and what doesn't, as consciousness.Ultimately, I disagree with him. From a scientist's point of view, of course, a model of dualism is wrong - that is, the idea that there is a 'mind' separate from 'the brain' which is unmeasurable in any way - because the mind there is by definition set up to be unmeasurable. Why should some bit of food I eat, which is clearly not conscious, and has no 'mind' - suddenly get this property if it becomes digested and becomes some of the material in my brain?Yes, there are plenty of real problems with dualism. That, however, doesn't mean his model is right. His model is what he calls 'the multiple draft model' and it's interesting. But after a few hundred pages of not saying consciousness is an illusion, he more or less says, yes, it's an illusion, alright, and we're all 'zombies' and there's nothing different between us and a (hypothetical) computer that had many layers of self-investigation.But it seems to me the 'illusion' premise is easily struck down - by definition. An illusion is a misperception. Unlike the proverbial 'tree in the forest,' an illusion truly does not exist without an observer. An illusion requires an observer to misperceive something. So if consciousness is an illusion, who's it fooling? Whatever that is, is consciousness, even if it's a small thing.Incidentally, The only place I noticed the age of this book is in his talking about how language is crucial in advanced 'consciousness' - and that therefore, non-humans cannot be said to be conscious. However, many animals are capable of rudimentary language. Incidentally to the incidentally, a section about language early in the book - and how memes live and mutate and spread and therefore evolve in the Darwinian sense - is fascinating, and made me a little smarter, I think, than I was before.Anyway. This is a necessary read for anyone considering the nature of consciousness, and the puzzle of how millions of cells which act as a confederacy can achieve something so unified as conscious experience."
42,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1026842-kathleen-brugger,4,"I thought I was going to hate this book, because of some reviews I had read, but I found a lot of it very interesting and compelling. The first thing I liked was that he really got me thinking about what it is to be conscious. Is there a projection room up there in the brain somewhere screening the contents of our consciousness? I have to admit I saw it that way. He calls this the Cartesian Theater, because Descartes had proposed a place in the brain (the pineal gland) where the physical brain processes turned into mental thoughts. Dennett proposes instead a Multiple Drafts model, in which streams of perceptions flow from our sensory processors, and these continually rewrite a flow of narrative. There isn’t some central clearinghouse that waits until all the various streams show up and then “makes up the mind.” Instead we’re constantly rewriting the story of our life. That’s why it’s sometimes hard to remember our first impressions of things and how we can “be of two minds.”I found the ending fascinating: he postulates that there is no self really, it's just a narrative that we use as a survival tool, similar to the shell a hermit crab inhabits, the dams a beaver builds, or the web a spider spins. ""Our fundamental tactic of self-protection, self-control, and self-definition is not spinning webs or building dams, but telling stories, and more particularly concocting and controlling the story we tell others--and ourselves--about who we are."" What would this mean if our sense of self was literally nothing more than a protective shell to help us survive in a human-created world of words and memes? Dennett is a materialist so of course his conclusion is there really is no such thing as consciousness in the way most people think of it. There is no Witness, no Awareness underlying form. I cannot agree with him on this.Some of the reviews criticized Dennett for his wordiness. I disagree with that appraisal: Dennett is a philosopher and in order to make his point crystal clear he has to ensure there are no loose ends or ambiguities. This book is written for a non-professional audience, and I appreciate the fact that he didn't dumb it down. "
43,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2382872-boris,3,"This book is as revolutionary as it is short-sighted. Dennett tries to find an empirical basis of consciousness. For this purpose he digs deep into the neuroscientific literature, questioning everything he finds from a theoretical point of view. This is interesting, and exceptional. Most scientist spend little time doubting the concepts they use, or what their findings mean in a broader theoretical sense. Dennett does takes this time and comes to unsettling conclusions.The best, and most necessary part of the book is Dennett's attack on the Cartesian Theater view on consciousness. Dennett explains that due to theoretical difficulties a single brain area of consciousness is impossible. Rather, consciousness is spread out over time and space (in the brain). He comes up with great and memorable analogies, which give great insight into the functioning of the brain.But as I have said, on the other hand, this book is also short-sighted. Dennett, in the end, comes to deny the existence of 'qualia' (personal, conscious experience). Why does he reach this conclusion? It is because he starts bottom-up. His whole quest is data-driven. His use of the Pandemonium model illustrates this: this model has been criticized in the Psychology for not being able to account for top-down (higher cognitive) influences.What Dennett ignores is the metaphysical side of the matter. Scientists hate metaphysics, and perhaps for a good reason: it is very hard to make metaphysics sound plausible. However, without metaphysics it is impossible to understand our Dasein, our way of being constituted inside this world. What Dennett has proven is not that there is no consciousness, but rather that consciousness cannot be found by the empirical method. Consciousness seems to be more than matter. This is the conclusion we have to accept, or else we will have to deny the existence of our consciousness. Dennett did not came up with arguments to convince me from this hypothesis."
44,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70163959-lalu-zam,4,"The book is good, well explained but too many detours. The point can be explained simpler but it took several pages to get to it. The main theory argued by the writer is interesting, challenging the status quo about the consciousness. It is designed to be read by public so don't expect a well thorough scientific explanation. The methapors are easy to understand but in some cases may misleadingly reduced the scientific content/point of the explanation."
45,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1496686-jacob,3,"The trick to solving many philosophical problems often comes down to figuring out how to unask bad questions and Dennett mostly succeeds in that aim by offering hypotheses that arguably deal with all the pertinent phenomena without appealing to outdated beliefs (the cartesian theater, dualism and central processing among others which have led to many a bad question). But this was certainly an oversized mixed bag. One problem I had with CE was that in a number of places Dennett ambiguously fluctuates between simply demonstrating that their are other workable hypotheses which don't appeal to folk psych and providing purportedly veridical explanations. This is quite tricky because if you are not very clear on what he's trying to do in certain places he can be read as question-begging. Yet if you take this into account his arguments can come across as superfluous to the functionalist choir. Despite this bit of trickiness, I really enjoyed the exposure to outside research that's provided here and even some of the novel takes on old case studies and thought experiments (blindsight for instance). Much has happened in phil mind since this was published and perhaps that should be taken into account. But to avoid hand-waving where good empirical support is available I would recommend mostly avoiding the chapter on qualia and reading the article, a sensorimotor account of vision instead. And not to be cheeky, but one can find a better argued and articulated theory of self that brings together functionalism and something very close to the multiple drafts and pandemonium models in Nietzsche's work. "
46,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4141235-ben,3,"At times I enjoyed this, but other times it was so frustrating! It's not clear at all, and is pretty much a jumble of ideas, with some good ones thrown in. Dennet says its on purpose though, because if he was clear then people would nitpick unimportant points. Ok. That's actually kind of cool. It's still pretty hard to understand what he's talking about. Another problem is that I constantly felt like I'm way ahead of the author in terms of having a sharper understanding of what feelings I'm having, and what my brain misses, ignores, and rationalizes. It might be a product of the book being 25 years old now, and me reading lots of psychology and Less Wrong.I found myself being like ""NO AGG, understanding is the emotional feeling of satisfaction you get when you can generate coherent responses that don't raise any inconsistency flags!""I didn't understand the no-qualia part. Sure I can buy that qualia are of smaller size than people expect, but not existing? Uh.... no. I don't buy that.The best part was the discussion of the self and other people as centers of narratives.I wish the book was clearer about when it was talking about actual consciousness stuff, and when it was talking about the things that make up our consciousness. (It's not a known thing. But it is worthwhile to categorize things better)Enjoyable, but I feel like most of what I got out from it was my own imaginings about consciousness and attention and stories, rather than understanding anything that the author said."
47,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110610415-richard-seltzer,4,"In Consciousness Explained, Daniel Dennett provides an excellent explanation of hallucinations. Normally, the mind anticipates and sensory input either confirms or denies. If sensory input is shut off or becomes random, then the confirmations and denials take the mind down false tracks, leading to the generation of wild and vivid images that bear no relationship to immediate reality.In normal mode, anticipation of this kind means that we are ready to respond to threats and opportunities very quickly -- often acting before the related sense data has arrived at the brain, much less been analyzed and understood. That could be an enormous survival advantage (from the perspective of evolution). It's a bit like ""cache"" memory in computers, being ready with answers to familiar questions in RAM, without having to go through the whole process of retrieving information from the hard drive.This works very well when change is predictable. When what happens next fits neatly into the pre-existing context. But when change is discontinuous, when something significantly new occurs, this process can get in the way of our recognizing it. Anticipation in this sense is a habit of perception -- we see what we expect to see, and it takes a major shift, a major perceptual denial of what we anticipated for us to take a good hard look at what is actually happening and make sense of it, and change our judgments and our actions and our plans.

49,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1603626-gabriel,5,"This is exactly the kind of philosophy book I wish I had read in college. I had always felt philosophers spent so much time imagining what might be happening in the world and almost no time at all testing those theories. I always wanted to say ""Just because you imagine it, doesn't mean it's true"". And there are plenty of theories (De Carte's Devil, zombies, etc) that have no effect on the observable world. I can appreciate these theories for being a kind of mental exercise, but by focusing on them so completely it gave me the impression that philosophy could have no real impact on our understanding of the world.Dennett applies some rigor to the philosophy of the mind, casting aside things like dualism and the Cartesian theater which simply can not exist physically. He offers new theories (multiple drafts) and subjects them to testing, even if that testing is somewhat indirect. I suppose people with a dread of science will feel offending by the intrusion of objective verification onto the world of pure reason. I was overjoyed."
50,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821338-jake,3,"A better title for this book would be ""Consciousness Provisionally Explained, At Great Length"", but that probably wouldn't have fit on the book jacket. In five-hundred or so pages, Dennett outlines most of his complete theory of the mind. The big idea is straightforward: there is no ""Cartesian theater"" where sense-data or memories or anything else is played for an internal observer or decision maker. Instead, consciousness is a stream produced by the activities of countless loosely joined agents in the brain. But the details can be difficult to understand, even if you have done some reading in this area before (I'd read Dennett and Hofstadter's Mind's I.) Dennett loves to digress, focus on details, and use a lot of five-dollar words. And he builds his theory up very slowly, and it's not until three or four hundred pages in that he's even able to articulate it fully- the subject may demand that much caution, but it also demands a lot from the reader. Overall judgment: you'll learn a lot about the subject, but you'll also end up with a headache. "

Parts of it were explicable to me, and I found them to be incredibly interesting. I just don't have enough grasp of philosophical basics to take on a work like this. I read the entire thing, diligently, but much of it was inexplicable to me. Not because it made no sense-Dennett is a very sharp thinker and a clear writer. It was simply because I, having enjoyed prior works by Dennett, jumped into this masterful, all-encompassing work of advanced philosophy without really knowing what I was getting myself into.I found it to be very thought-provoking, and as I say many of the segments dealt with things like neuroscience and the like which made more sense to me. I look forward to re-reading this one day when I have the proper background in less advanced works on this topic to fully appreciate the thought Dennett put into this masterful work."

It's truly amazing how you can write a book of 500+ pages, use a pompous (and misleading) title, and present it as the philosophical magnum opus that will enlighten every curious soul (pun intended).....only to come up with THIS.Granted, the subject matter is tough to grapple with. Granted, this is a book written more than 25 years ago. Granted, he's a philosopher. But come on... Dennett tries to develop his case by first breaking the dualistic misconceptions of consciousness, and after this by slowly building up his own theory of consciousness (the 'multiple drafts' model). But he explains every step along the way in such redundant way, that by the time you get to page 200 you feel like you have already read 200 volumes (just 300 more to go!). In no way does he present his case in a concise and accessible way, which is really a flaw.Bottom line: if you need 500+ pages to present your theory and even after this it didn't come across in an intelligible way, the only conclusion can be you've written a bad book. Period."
53,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944-aj,4,"More of a philosophical approach to handling the question of consciousness. Dennett uses this book to suggest an alternative way to see the mind, a way to join the subjective experience of consciousness with the meat and neurons in the brain. His argument is really to show that old ways of thinking are not necessarily the only ways to think about the mind. He proposes his own model of consciousness, but admits it is not necessarily correct, only that the approach is more justified, and that old approaches need to be reevaluated (and in many cases abandoned). Some really great metaphysical discussion comes out of this, but is handled in some of his other texts (Freedom Evolves and Darwin's Dangerous Idea)"

Regardless, I trudged on and even though I left about 20% of the book uncovered, I don't feel entirely uncomfortable in writing that Dennett has a knack for obfuscation. Searle would call it obscurantism (as he did of Derrida's work). Dennett introduces the term heterophenomenology (he's a fanatic neologist) as a means of standardizing a subject's phenomenology and promises to show how this solves all our qualia problems. Similar to his arguments about why the Hard Problem of Consciousness is not hard, I remain unconvinced of the simplicity he imposes on both topics. I really like reading continental philosophy, but not the kind that pretends its analytic. "

I'm not sure I understood his Multiple Drafts model of consciousness well, but Dennett did make a well-argued point that consciousness does not necessarily need to be forever beyond our grasp, nor is it a given that the conscious self must itself be formed of ""conscious"" constituents or some immaterial, metaphysical entities. After all, liquids and gases are themselves not made of ""liquid"" or ""gaseous"" particles, why should consciousness be any different? The title of the book is a bit misleading though. Dennett himself confessed at the end of the book that this is just the beginning of the explanation, not *the* explanation. "

Does Dennett succeed? In my opinion not, but he is in good company of other thinkers who tried.Dennett's main thesis is that there is little viewer in our head who processes all the information linearly (the so-called an appalled 'Cartesian theatre'). Instead Dennett argues for a multiple draft model which states that there is no stream of conscious experience. Like Hofstadter consciousness is assumed to be an emergent property of a system being able to be introspective.This is a heavy book, crammed with a lot of ideas (some of them not easy to follow).

Secondly, there might seem to be contradiction in the book which you’ll unravel especially when you reach the core purpose of it (chapter 5) but remember the ‘’psychoanalysis Party Game’’ when Dennett talked about in the early chapters concluding at the end: ‘’ In such a cycle, one’s current expectations and interests shape hypotheses for one’s perceptual systems to confirm or disconfirm, and a rapid sequence of such hypothesis generations and confirmations produces the ultimate product, the ongoing, updated ‘’model’’ of the world of perceived ….All we suppose is that the illusionist goes into an arbitrary confirmation mode and the victim provides the content by asking the questions’’. This is very much applied to every concept introduced in the book, for instance when Dennett mentions the thought experiment ‘’Mary the Colour Scientist’’ he presumes that your brain has made the assumption that knowing every physical fact about a colour is the same as knowing a lot about the colour. Now Dennett concludes that if Mary really did know every physical fact about a colour yellow, she will be to know what yellow is like by entirely anticipating her entire cognitive simulation and response to the stimulus.Now Dennett introduces a model for the mental processes that we call consciousness where he claims ‘’some of the most perplexing paradoxes of consciousness arise because we cling too long to a good habit of thought, a habit that usually keeps us out of trouble’’ he starts of by laying down what we need to establish to build a model he revisits Descartes Cartesian Theatre-where all the aspects of a profound experience come together to provide a unified phenomenal world- he discusses why this model cannot work by maintaining that there is no single point for which it all has to come together for central processing so he then introduces ‘’The Multiple Drafts Model’’ where According it, ‘’all varieties of perception- indeed, all varieties of thought or mental activity- are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous "" here Dennett then emphasis that this model makes the discrimination that ‘’ the brain just adjusts to the conclusion that is drawn, making the new interpretation of the information available for the modulation of subsequent behaviour’’.In conclusion, Dennett believes that instead for the consciousness to be at a single point he imagines it described as a virtual machine like a computer that is built on top of a different system, it is a linear, sequential machine that is built on top of a massively parallel structure which in this case is the brain.Now this is a very short summary of the book, of course the book is so rich with information, starting from Descartes’ Dualism and the Cartesian Theatre then explaining that there’s no Theatre in the first place to introducing many thoughts experiments to get you ready to absorb the new way of thinking about consciousness, getting a grasp on how your inner mental life might have come. It is subtly profound and valuable. It’s like Dennett looks at consciousness as the brain’s way of making sense of the world around us. For me personally it was an astonishing whole new worldview to form and just like any other worldview, it does have its complexities and assumptions but that doesn’t mean that it is not logical to consider, I suppose when I’m having this worldview of the denial of consciousness and the experience (According to Dennett) I become more of a depressed person who doesn’t seem to find meaning of anything around, having the idea that what we perceive as reality is subjective and what we think is the objective reality is only hypothetical since or senses are flawed and limited is an unescapable truth.At the end I’m only an amature philosopher, a curious human mind that like to share her views assertively yet tactfully.

68,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37283541-fran-cavanagh,4,"This is a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain. At least, it's a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain as was understood to be the case nearly 30 years ago. Honestly, I felt Dennett's summary of the cognitive science behind perception, attention, memory and language stood up very well despite the book's age, so that isn't much of a criticism. While there have obviously been many developments in these fields since Dennett was writing, much of the same base material has been covered in my 2020-era Psychology Masters programme. This is also a great introduction to some of the key philosophical debates regarding consciousness, human and otherwise (although, as very much a non-philosopher, I'm not sure I'd be able to identify if it wasn't). I'm not sure Dennett fully marries these two strands together to put forward a fully satisfying view on the nature of human consciousness.I can get on board with Dennett's ""Multiple Drafts"" view of human perception, as far as I understand it. It's backed up by a significant body of literature in Psychology and Neuroscience that suggests that our experience of reality is a lot choppier and less constant or consistent than it appears. I can also agree, as a result, that the ""Cartesian Theatre"" and the idea of one centralised observer self doesn't make a whole lot of scientific sense. But none of this, for me, touches on the question of what the consciousness that we experience in ourselves and others actually is, or how it appears. Dennett again makes a very convincing case that our brains can be seen as effectively very complicated supercomputers, and that a non-biological supercomputer that worked exactly like the brain would be functionally indistinguishable from the brain. Dennett also puts forward fascinating points, building principally on the work of Dawkins and Levelt, about language and ideas and how these grow and propagate between our brains and across societies. There's truly a lot of fascinating and valid discussion here, and Dennett is clearly much more knowledgeable and generally intelligent than I could ever hope to be. I appreciated hearing his synthesised perspective on all of these topics. Again, though, I was still left feeling that he didn't fully explore or explain how consciousness emerges from this biological supercomputer we call the brain. The book also doesn't really directly discuss in any depth what consciousness is, how it functions, or why. This book is apparently often re-titled by its critics as ""Consciousness Explained Away"". This seems a little unfair. Dennett makes it very clear in his closing remarks that he believes that consciousness is a ""thing"". I'm just still not convinced that I understand how the mechanisms and functions and processes he describes in great detail in this book add up to the consciousness that he stresses he believes exists.The entry for Consciousness in the 1989 Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology offers a succinctly damning description: “The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings: awareness… Nothing worth reading has been written about it.” I'm not sure this book provided a counterexample to that definition, but I'm also of half a mind to believe that it's impossible for us to truly understand the nature of consciousness, at least with the scientific tools currently at our disposal. I suspect that Dennett would feel very differently about that proposition, and that there may be some fundamental definitional disconnects at play between whatever school of philosophy I fall into and the largely functionalist worldview inhabited by Dennett. An impasse I'm honestly under-equipped to fully describe. Philosophical disagreements about the nature of the subject matter aside, then, this was a really well put-together, intelligent and enjoyable read. One I expect I'll return to a lot."
69,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,3,"Following my readings on history and future of humanity, I wanted to explore the question of “what is humanity”? and why super intelligent machines lack “humanity” despite their superior intelligence? If it's not intelligence that makes us human then it must be “consciousness”, or that continuous stream of subjective experiences, feelings and emotions that flow through our brain every second of our waking hours. What exactly is it? and how does it happen is an unsolved mystery despite significant advances in neurosciences, biology, psychology and computing. Therefore, a book titled “Consciousness Explained” seemed like exactly the right book I need.This book is not my first reading on intelligence but it is the first on consciousness and I have to say it was a disappointing start, the book is overly academic and lacks the story telling convenience I got so used to that I now expect from any writer who respects their audience. It’s not my job to clean up an author’s mess and order it into concise narrative. It should be the job of the one who got paid to write in the first place. Anyway, back to consciousness. The book tries to replace the traditional view with a different view that is better supported by evidence from experimental neuroscience. The Traditional view is called the “Cartesian theater” where basically all sensory information is projected in a theater-like area of the brain that is continuously monitored by “the mind” or “the conscious soul” that is continuously issuing commands to different body parts in response to the information presented to it. This view is obviously wrong for multiple reasons, first because neuroscience can not find such area in the brain and more importantly, because this creates an infinite recursive loop of ""what, then, is the mind of that mind, ... etc?""The alternative model is the “multiple drafts” model where different but connected brain regions unconsciously and simultaneously develop several subjective experience narratives, each has a partial draft of the story and some even have a plan for action, however, these competing experiences get filtered by higher level brain areas (probably in the frontal cortex) that decide which narrative/plan of action should get the highest priority based on millions of years of natural selection design followed by several years of cultural training in the surrounding environment. This explains why conscious experience of all humans is genetically sensitive to snakes, the color red, and vertical symmetry (faces) while each human culture is sensitive to specific environmental memes like jokes, beliefs and local common sense.The evidence for this model comes in two variants: (1) logical: because a virtual machine of consciousness that is made up of several subconscious components escapes the recursive flaw of the Cartesian theater model. (2) It has been proven recently by neuroscience that decisions are made in the brain a few milliseconds BEFORE we become “conscious” of making them, and not the other way around.At the end, I don't think I have a satisfactory understanding of consciousness, but to have my consciousness explained in just one book was an audacious goal in the first place. The book, although useful, could have been written in a much better way and could have left out so many useless details. So, if interested in consciousness, wait till I find you a better book to read."
70,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060524-robert-fischer,4,"Rhetorically, this book is a masterpiece. Without a doubt, Dennett is a master of the persuasive argument, and he pulls out all the stops here: see the gradual shifts in word choice (""the familiar Cartesian Theater"" at the beginning morphs by the end into ""our old nemesis, the Cartesian Theater""), very carefully chosen metaphorical models in order to pull in all kinds of technological magic, the way he performs a mea culpa without actually admitting guilt near the end of the book, and prevalent rhetorical questions and blanket declarations to mask over the places where things are most awkward. It's really well done. If it weren't for the theoretical issues (really, one major theoretical issue), this would easily be a 5 star book. It is both rigorous yet accessible, and it is a wonderfully enjoyable exploration of consciousness and its limitations. The book has a lot to teach people about their own self-experience, even (and especially!) those who aren't prone to agree with him (such as me). To borrow a term Dennett uses to describe a fellow philosopher's work, this book is an ""instructive failure"". It's definitely worth your time to read.I read this book, however, with a particular question in mind: when I see something in my mind's eye, where does that image reside? (Note that I have a vivid mind's eye — some people don't even have a mind's eye at all, and don't even know they're missing one! See this Discover article for more.) This book was referred to me because it was apparently a solid materialist argument and explanation. Unfortunately, Dennett simply doesn't have an answer for that question. His rhetoric obscures that fact very well (although he cops to side-stepping questions of ""the nature of things"" in Appendix A), but ultimately he takes a functionalist approach, and that handily does away with the very evidence which I was looking for him to explain.To see how this happens, it is first necessary to realize that we can't actually prove anyone else is conscious in the same sense we are. As was popularized in The Matrix, we could be dreaming and not realizing it, and everyone else could be projections of our own consciousness. Like in A Beautiful Mind (SPOILER ALERT), we could be populating our experience with non-existent people. No test proves anything more than the fact that it is a very clever illusion or bit of calculation going on — but, ultimately, our own consciousness is uniquely experienced by us. Everyone else could be a zombie (in the philosophical sense), and we have no way to know differently. This is not the point Dennett starts with, but it's implicit within Dennett's functionalist approach. The move Dennett makes is to then project that back on to us, and say that we, too, have no consciousness in any real sense. How could you prove differently to anyone else? What objectively accessible function can you perform as a conscious entity which these potentially unconscious entities could not?The problem is that the experience of having consciousness — not just computational complexity or a narrative world, but some ""audience in a Cartesian Theater"" — is not simply a ""doctrine"" (that word choice is a great example of Dennett's excellent and subtle rhetorical moves), but stems from evidence. It's not functional-objective evidence, but it is evidence none the less. That evidence is the experience of having consciousness. As much as you chip away at what the consciousness is and does (and Dennett does that excellently), there is always still an ""I"" which is having the experience. That's the whole point of Descartes, and Dennett simply does not feel the need to account for it, instead presenting the epistemological limitations of his ""heterophenomonology"" as ontological statements. But a map is not the territory, and a scientific model is not the thing itself. Simply because heterophenomonology cannot take with subjective evidence seriously does not mean that subjective evidence should not be taken seriously. This point is very poetically (and popularly) driven home in Nature, Man and Woman, and Dennett is aware of it, but simply dismisses it as not relevant. If you read through my progress in this book, you'll see lots of places where those dismissals are explicitly identified, because they drove me nuts. (Here's an example.)To a certain extent, though, he is right: phenomonology is not relevant within the context of science, where heterophenomenology is sufficient. As a text in cognitive science, Dennett's approach is really insightful and makes many challenging points. In the world of philosophy, though, the phenomonology needs to be accounted for. It's not philosophically sufficient to assume an air of ""anthropological"" condescension towards at least our own phenomonology — that's discounting a vital piece of evidence without basis, and if it cannot be accounted for, then consciousness (at least our own consciousness) is insufficiently explained. Dennett claims that consciousness is just an illusion — but who is perceiving the illusion? If it is a deception, who is being deceived? That claim is actually begging the question, and Dennett responds by retreating to functionalism, and saying it is our memories that are being deceived. But I do not simply remember being conscious — I am conscious of being conscious! But that sentence doesn't even make sense in the functionalist conception. But Dennett seems to be paraphrasing Groucho Marx: ""Who are you going to believe? Me or your own mind's eye?""It is notable at this point, though, to mention that the kind of ""anthropological"" condescension Dennett advocates has actually come under an extreme kind of fire as a Eurocentric and fundamentally racist pattern of thought which results not in real knowledge, but more in generating a hybrid of European presumptions and European interpretative ""data"". For more on this point, see Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference. I bring this up because so much of the argumentation feels like 19th century thinking, not 21st century thinking, and the model Dennett proposes reads more like an artifact of philosophy's own artifices and methodologies than an account of reality. Appeals to the specialness of language (strictly conceived), to Newtonian physics, and conflations between non-materialism and dualism really reinforce that sense.On top of all of this, Dennett builds heavily upon ideas of evolutionary psychology and memes, which are roundly destroyed as non-scientific materialistic doctrines in The Spiritual Brain: A Neuroscientist's Case for the Existence of the Soul. There is also some significant ethological (""animal-psychological"") claims about the communication and cognition of animals which are simply empirically wrong given research done by people like Marc Bekoff. And the idea that we could have immortality by ""copying our brain's software"" is not very comforting to this particular copy (a point made well in The Prestige). There is no serious engagement with psi or spirituality, as though they are self-evidently irrelevant to discussions of consciousness.With all these complaints, however, the book still gets 4 stars. It's definitely worth a read, and it is really an eye-opening revelation of just how complicated the apparently simple idea of ""the conscious mind"" really is. Highly suggested."
71,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260292-erik,2,"2091: one hundred years ago philosophers wrote books using words like ""consciousness,"" ""qualia,"" ""functionalism,"" ""materialism,"" and ""zombie,"" words which have since been banned for the sake of the public good. You see philosophers, without actually asking themselves what these words meant, used to debate with each other by filling the blanks in arguments with these words and moving them around like rebus tiles, inventing more and more recondite scenarios for their use and claiming to refute their opponents with sheer tour de force applications of logic. I think you can see why someone had to put a stop to this.More seriously, it does seem uncontroversial to me that the neurons underlying color perception and other sensations can be affected by further causal relations to judgments and object perceptions (it has been known for more than 100 years!). Does this mean sensations are simply a network of discriminatory judgments and their concreteness an illusion of being embedded in a network of such judgments? No because they are realized by the effective physical powers expressed in the sensations. It is probably true that a space of colors could be simulated in a machine or even a computer program. For example if a machine were charged with navigating a space of numbered points and could carry out rotations, translations etc. on these points and if the machine had a way of specifying its own position in the manifold and representations of the other points and distances and directions, it would make sense to say the machine carries an internal representation that would ""seem to it like living in a space."" Why not? But the physical realization would matter too. It isn't just the structure that matters but the stuff too. If the color space were navigated by a color observer then certainly I could buy the idea that the representation would seem to it like sensing (its own) colors. But the same colors as those expressed by the physics of the human brain? Doubtful, unless the relevant physical realization was exactly duplicated, by electrical -chemical signals for example. The idea that the sensations are nothing but an artifact of being in a certain representation regardless of how it is realized, this seems to ignore the fact that the physical realization must matter too. Proof: take two such realizations and let them interact in one big representation. Because the causal roles of the materials are different those differences also have further causal roles in relation to each other and would be manifested as such, so the non-identity would be revealed immediately. Dennett claims that if discriminatory judgments are divorced from their qualitative appearance this leads to absurdity, but how can these roles be separated at all if sensations are also physical and if their qualitative appearance is a result of their configured causal powers? By separating them you are leaving out some of their causal roles and the thought experiment is impossible. He doesn't even consider any of this. I'm not impartial to this discussion (see my Realistic Empiricism) but the concrete physical reality of sensation seems hard to deny if it is there in the cells."
72,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,4,"I saw a quote somewhere (in a David Chalmers book but not by Chalmers himself) that basically pointed out that the fact that we are conscious beings means that we've never really said anything of interest about consciousness. It's both so obvious as to be self-evident, and yet so ineffable that it can't be spoken about clearly. This double-edged sword is what Dennett tackles. He wants to challenge the view that conscious is this thing that we known intrinsically from a first-person perspective, whilst also undermining any claim that it cannot be spoken about clearly. What is required is a rethinking of the very assumptions we make about our conscious minds in light of what we discover from everything from neuroscience to AI, from anthropology to zoology, and start to shut down the Cartesian Theatre once and for all.The results are a mixed bag. Dennett's eye for detail, need to make sure you've fully understood every nuance of his point and dedication to defending himself against any predicted counter-argument mean that the book is immense, long and quite a slog. This is partly where my criticism of the text emerges. For a book of popular philosophy combined with popular science, this is dense and detailed. It isn't a simple overview of his key ideas that any engrossed reader can follow up afterwards. He covers every angle, every philosophical nook and cranny, until he feels he has exhausted the discussion. On the other hand, the book is so filled with simplifications, metaphors, ""intuition pumps"" and reader-friendly summaries that any one who is reading it for academic reasons may feel a little undernourished. The big question is: who is this book for? With that aside, I found the book entertaining and engaging. The sheer volume of the text means it takes quite a while to get through it all, and one chapter at a time is more than enough. There's little chance of readers ploughing through this at speed because they can't wait to see what happens next. However, there is a payoff. In later chapters, the painfully long analysis of the early sections start to reappear and the relevance of everything starts to look more like a coherent theory than a series of musings on what things might be like if we take the time to think about them differently. This is rewarding due to the effort that has to be put in during the early stages of the book. It took me nearly 3 months to read it because it wasn't the book I thought it would be. I thought this was a handy overview of his ideas in a digestible form. It wasn't. Or rather it was, but in such gargantuan amounts of prose that it took me a while to churn through it, and bedtime reading became a non-starter. I still enjoyed it. It was still worth the effort, but had I not been in the mood to tackle it, I would have given up sooner. "
73,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99056689-katyen,4,"Daniel Dennett's book ""Consciousness Explained"" is currently one of the classic books on consciousness. In addition, it is one of the most important Dennett books he has ever written. I can also consider Daniel Dennett to be one of the most important representatives of contemporary philosophy of mind. The views he presents in the book are in many cases conservative and provocative, which was part of Dennett's goal, and this book has provoked much discussion, criticism, indignation, but also appreciation.Most critics accused Dennett of either not explaining consciousness in the book at all or rejecting it altogether. None of these views is true, on the contrary, Dennett tries to explain consciousness, but in a completely different way. Dennett does not try to say directly what consciousness is, but rather what consciousness does. Related to this is his rejection of the famous ""hard problem of consciousness"" and his replacement by the ""hard question"", which reads: And then what happens? (Dennett 1991, p. 255). In the book, he tries to explain and to some extent also summarize the knowledge about the brain from the cognitive sciences and neurosciences so far. Dennett himself is not only a philosopher but also a cognitive scientist, and even today he is actively involved in discussions of consciousness. The aim of the book is not so much to explain consciousness as to demystify it. That is, to point out that consciousness is a natural phenomenon in nature that arose during an evolutionary process that lasted millions of years. The fact that most authors consider consciousness to be mysterious and exceptional is more related to moral views on the uniqueness of human beings. This is exactly what Dennett tries to prove in the book and to point out that even if we remove the mysticism, there will still be beauty and space for new questions. As he claims:When we understand consciousness - when there is no more mystery - consciousness will be different, but there will still be beauty, and more room than ever for awe (Dennett 1991, pp. 25).Overall, I especially liked the book because of its new concept of consciousness, which was unconventional for the 90s of the 20th century. A possible downside to the book is that in some parts of the book, Dennett vaguely expresses his views, which may ultimately lead to Dennett's rejection of consciousness."
74,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"I was already aware of the bad fame of this book, and every time I saw it being referenced, I saw it as being referenced as a failure. As the typical saying goes ""consciousness explained away"". Nevertheless, I decided to give it a shot. I figured the bad reputation of the book was because it failed its goal and stated purpose, which was way too ambitious. But I figured I could still have a lot of value and insight into consciousness. But I was wrong. While it explained some characteristics of thought and consciousness, it didn't explain consciousness as such. I gave up and stopped reading briefly before halfway. I very rarely leave books unfinished, but I truly felt like it was a waste of time. Not only it didn't explain very much, but the writing itself is rather boring, and Dennett often shifts too laterally. While I usually appreciate this, I found it pointless and dull. I felt he often confused the validity of the experience of consciousness as phenomenology itself. The fact that your phenomenology leads you to a flawed assumption and you don't quite understand the mechanisms, doesn't in any way solve the actual problem of experiencing it, which is exactly the point. Coming up with heterophenomenology to make it more ""objective"" doesn't help very much. If it's accurate or not is almost irrelevant. Calling it a simple projection feels an equal cheap escape. This is my 2nd book from Dennett, the first being Breaking the Spell, which was similarly disappointing. I had a good impression of Dennet from a few his lectures that I watched, and after the disappointment of the first book I figured I'd give it another try, but looks like I'm fighting for a lost cause.I'm sure there are some good arguments and ideas in the book, I found the categorization of consciousness as being Orwelling or Stalinesque quite witty and useful for example, and the refutation of the Cartesian Theatre is solid, although it was beaten to death. But overall, I personally felt it wasn't worth the grinding."
75,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59307958-katy-koivastik,5,"References to consciousness in Sam Harris’ “Waking Up” reminded me of “Consciousness Explained” sitting unread in my library probably since it was first published in 1991. I decided to finally open it to see whether it would hold my interest all these years later.I earnestly powered through the first third of the book, and then pick and chose my way through the rest. There is a reason I am not a scientist, as I found the descriptions of the experiments boring, despite being written for the layman. The author does discuss the nature of memory and of the human tendency toward false and embellished memory, a topic I find unendingly fascinating. The book is peppered with quotations, and this one from novelist Ariel Dorfman on memory resonated: “I’m really not sure if others fail to perceive me or if, one fraction of a second after my face interferes with their horizon, a millionth of a second after they have cast their gaze on me, they already begin to wash me from their memory: forgotten before arriving at the scant, sad archangel of a remembrance.”I gave the book 5 stars because it is well written, includes wry cartoons, and can be understood by non-scientists. One quote from the author sums up the topic for me: “We, in contrast (to animals), are almost constantly engaged in presenting ourselves to others, and to ourselves, and hence representing ourselves — in language and gesture, external and internal. The most obvious difference in our environment that would explain this difference in our behavior is the behavior itself. Our human environment contains not just food and shelter, enemies to fight or flee, and conspecifics with whom to mate, but words, words, words. These words are potent elements of our environment that we readily incorporate, ingesting and extruding them, weaving them like spiderwebs into self-protective strings of narrative. ....when we let in these words, these meme-vehicles, they tend to take over, creating us out of the raw materials they find in our brains.”"
76,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7804740-paul,4,"Dennett's intention in this book is to defend and advance materialism, which is the idea that only matter exists, and that there are no other special things, like 'mind stuff' or the soul. The challenge which he addresses is to explain how something as complex, varied and wonderful as human consciousness could possibly originate 100% from the human brain. The subtext really should be 'Dualism Demolished', as he spends quite some time dismantling the idea that there must be some other medium or entity in which consciousness happens. As well the related idea of the 'Cartesian centre of consciousness', the idea that there is a central point in the brain where all of the senses, inputs and thinking comes together to become our consciousness.I'm a materialist myself, and as I work with computers, I don't have any objection to the idea that consciousness is some kind of 'virtual machine' that runs in the brain in a massively parallel way, which is an idea he presents. However, I must say that at times I found the book heavy going. Perhaps it's my fault that I thought the book belonged in the 'popular philosophy' category, which it certainly does not. This is a Serious Philosophical Work, and it's intended to make a Real Contribution to the science and philosophy of mind. It's chock full of references, annotations and asides. Dennett tries in every page to be as rational and scientific as possible. That's fine, but at times I found it wearing. While I agree with the broad thrust of what he's saying, there's plenty you could object to (such as the idea that you don't really experience sensory input, you only 'seem to'. Although it was published in 1991, it still felt relevant to me, due to timeless nature of the issues he addresses. Although I have no doubt that the argument has moved on a great deal since that time. Overall a great read, but not for the faint of heart."
77,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54462119-mohammadhossein-haqiqatkhah,4,"Daniel C. Dennett tends to prolixity when explaining the stuff. Although it's mainly focused on challenging Cartesian dualism, he introduces very interesting perspectives toward consciousness.All he tries to do in this book (and I believe he succeeds in it) is to suggest new metaphors to substitute the more intuitive metaphors the dualist theories provide. He digs very deeply into qualia and challenges almost every aspect of it. As he puts it:My explanation of consciousness is far from complete. One might even say that it was just a beginning, but it is a beginning, because it breaks the spell of the enchanted circle of ideas that made explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t replaced a metaphorical theory, the Cartesian Theater, with a nonmetaphorical (“literal, scientific”) theory. All I have done, really, is to replace one family of metaphors and images with another, trading in the Theater, the Witness, the Central Meaner, the Figment, for Software, Virtual Machines, Multiple Drafts, a Pandemonium of Homunculi. It’s just a war of metaphors, you say — but metaphors are not “just” metaphors; metaphors are the tools of thought. No one can think about consciousness without them, so it is important to equip yourself with the best set of tools available. Look what we have built with our tools. Could you have imagined it without them?He ends up, quite quickly, with a narrative theory of self and individual identity. It's an exotic view (let's say, journey) into the philosophy of consciousness, but it leaves many questions unaddressed. However, indeed, Consciousness Explained is a no-return point in your philosophical relationship with consciousness."
78,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"In a way Dennett feels like a curmudgeon about how the roots of the consciousness and the mind works in much the same way Richard Dawkins feels to me a curmudgeon about the roots of our biology. And just like Dawkins, I find him very convincing. Dennett is very much in line with other thinkers I've been reading like Douglas Hofstadter (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) and Michael S.A. Graziano (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) who see consciousness as an emergent property of the whole system of our brain rather than something that emerges from a single point or theater in the mind. His dialogues on the chinese room thought experiment and philosophical zombies were great on this point. There can be unconscious zombies or operators in the chinese rooms only if we propose a single theater that consciousness arises from. If we look at the larger system, it's clear that any philosophical zombie will all of the skills and insights of a human would indeed be a conscious system.This counterintuitive conclusion is something that we all seem to naturally battle because it strikes at the very nature of the self that is doing the intuiting. As Dennett wrote: ""Many people are afraid to see consciousness explained because they fear that if we succeed in explaining it, we will lose our moral bearings."" I suppose I can partially excuse some of my favorite thinkers like Yuval Noah Harari and Sam Harris for continuing to make claims that consciousness is still a fundamental mystery. I think what they mean is that we still haven't found the metaphors that allow us collectively to think about our minds in the way we think about our biology and the world around us. Dennett, in spite of his best attempt to reach a broad audience, is far too academic for my mother or my dentist and probably for me, but I'm hoping work from someone is on the way to help carry this torch."

Maybe I've just been spoiled by other, more mainstream styles of discussion regarding issues of science and morality, from authors like Harris and Pinker. The fact that Dennett's central thesis of this book -- deconstructing our ""intuitive"" but incorrect understanding of our conscious selves as a Cartesian witness sitting inside our brains, and replacing it with a Multiple Drafts Model of cognition that supports the way our minds truly process, adapt, & repeat in order to make conscious choices and actions -- is written in an extremely self-referential and conceited style, to the point that it distracts from the thesis itself, and weighs down a lot of Dennett's brilliant observations and theories with nods to his own superiority over his colleagues, including at least one citation to the author's other works on every other page. Basically, I wish he had just shared his ideas in a more neutral and simplistic way. The theories themselves are not hard to understand, although do require commitment to what Dennett is asking of the reader -- to put aside everything they think they understand about what consciousness is and how our minds operate. After this, it's just Dennett's world and we're living in it: in showing how our brains evolved to their current levels of complexity through a complicated process of trial and error, shaping and reshaping, layering new information on top of old, Dennett illuminates many processes of cognition that provide new and consequential insights into why we tell stories, how identities are formed, and what these narratives mean for our continuing evolution -- the least of which is that no such thing as a SELF really exists, or has ever existed. I just wish he had cut back on the running side commentary. "

Dennett tackles a very difficult problem in a beautifully written work of philosophy (+a bit of cognitive science).Slowly, the author dismantles the myth of the ""Cartesian theater"", or the idea that past perception, and the parallel neural processes going on in the brain, content is ""presented"" to a fictitious viewer. There is no such ""Audience"". Thinking is thought. There is no ""central hub"" where everything ""comes together"", and Dennett introduces ""Multiple Drafts"" to give consciousness an elementary stab.Then Dennett compares consciousness as a sort of serial (illusory) program running on the parallel brain. This part I'm not super convinced about, thinking of a computer as subsystems of information processing is useful in some ways but maybe we need more models and analogies besides the Von Neumann architecture.What about the ""language"" that we think in? Dennett refutes a ""Central Meaner"", and instead replaces it with a ""Pandemonium"", multiple neural pathways in our head all having something to say.Dennett also discusses the evolution of consciousness, problems with folk psychology, Libet's experiments and temporal inference, and philosophical problems like ""In the Mind's eye"", ""Mary the scientist"", Searle's ""Chinese Room"", ""What is it like to be a bat""...There was a lot of thought provoking content in this book. The idea of the self as a ""center of narrative gravity"", an abstract concept, instead of some dualistic ""brain pearl"" was illuminating for me. Book is kinda old, probably there are more up-to-date ones, but I'd say this is still extremely well worth the time for anyone curious in the nature of the mind."

The book’s author explained, in excessive detail, what was known or believed in 1991, namely a confusion of ideas from the disciplines of psychology, philosophy and science. No real progress! No advanced ideas beyond Descartes’ description since then. More theses, no consensus! It does seem that each persons consciousness is unique to them! Each of us has sole awareness of our self! Our soul?? There is an underlying belief that our human consciousness is an evolved state resulting from the creative processes of evolution. Now the question is: Can Artificial Intelligence develop consciousness through a similar creative process, to become unique, super smart “silicone individuals,” competing with humans? Wow! The question is: how can we use and manage Artificial Intelligece without it surpassing us? I need to read more updated studies to understand this more! I will if they exist, most books on the subject date to the 1980-90’s! This book provides the questions, no answers, and only speculations.

82,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914286-sarah,2,"I was really interested in this work for about the first 200 pages. One of the biggest drawbacks is that this text was published in 1991 (almost 30 years ago); and the author uses a lot of illustrations and arguments from the science and philosophy of artificial intelligence. That science has changed so much in the last 30 years. Also, I have no real science or philosophy background, so I found parts of this a tough go. The early chapters, when the author was trying to define consciousness were the best for me - he raised a number of ideas and issues that I found fascinating. Not only about how speech developed, but when did we start talking to ourselves? And the importance of that action. You have to think of yourself as a self to bother speaking. Not to mention, how do we hear our own voices (or our parents voices, etc) in our heads? No sound is actually being generated; yet our brain gives it to us as if playing a recording. How do you ""hear"" when you are 100 percent by passing your auditory system? Same thing with ""seeing"" things in your head. But as the book dragged on, I lost interest and felt more and more lost in his endless responses to others ideas of consciousness. In the end, he never did explain consciousness to me. I just kept falling asleep whenever I picked up this book - so I very lightly skimmed the last 200 pages and called it a day."

Dennett undoubtedly makes a thought provoking case for how we ought to look at consciousness, perhaps shaking a fair few my previously held ideas regarding the soundness of epiphenomenalism and philosophical zombies. The examples regarding tastes, and the experience of an acquired taste, as a phenomenon that changes over time versus your conscious experience of the taste of said phenomenon changing, seems quite crucial in considering the relevance of consciousness as explained via external objective measures. His last section addressing the issue of 'explaining' a phenomenon versus 'explaining away' said phenomenon was also a nice touch. I agree with his conclusion that he has at the very least started the explanation; perhaps he wouldn't have gotten so much heat for this book if he reconsidered the tense of his verbiage when drawing up a title. A simple gerund could likely have made others' perception of him and his work much more palatable, though with some further pressure, their conscious experience of his work could perhaps become acquired as well :)"
84,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21625655-chase-mcclendon,4,"I was between 3 and 4 stars on this book. On the one hand, it’s impressive to view Dennett attempt to topple (and replace) what he views as a misinformed view of what consciousness is. Naturally, something as familiar to us as our own consciousness will carry with it a certain obviousness about the mechanisms and features of that consciousness. Dennett’s task is to show you that although you may be the observer, you don’t have a claim to infallibility over the mechanisms that produce your experience, only the effects of those mechanisms. My problem with the book was that oftentimes Dennett‘s writing seems filled with unnecessary jargon. While I understand that in a book that tries to do no less than explain consciousness there will be some requisite wordiness, I was left with the feeling that if only Dennett was a more pithy writer, his points would’ve landed with more force. Many times throughout the book I would finish a section and feel that I had missed an aspect of an argument that Dennett supposed would win me over in dramatic fashion.All this said, I enjoyed Dennett’s method and although I may still have subtle bonds to my old ways of thinking about consciousness, Dennett has done much to weaken and replace them."
85,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79330012-arthur-ryman,4,"Definitely worth the read, but not exactly what I was hoping for or what is advertised in the title. A more accurate title would be ""Consciousness Explained Away"". I am in full agreement with Dennett's basic position, namely that the brain is a computing device. However, Dennett does not explain the basic phenomenon of awareness. Rather, he substitutes the term ""dispositional state"". Disappointing. I decided to read this, and similar works, because I felt that physics lacked the conceptual vocabulary to talk about awareness, that abundantly obvious feeling that we are observers. Coincidentally, quantum mechanics, although spectacularly successful, relies on the injection of an observer to collapse superpositions of states into an actual observation. In the absence of a better explanation from Dennett and his colleagues, I'll simply tell myself that awareness is what collapsing wave functions feel like. :-)"

(the quotes are not actual quotes but my paraphrasing).It was like a constant tease, I guess to keep you hooked, while he rambled on with his filler.

Then from a negative direction cut up phenomenology and then remove qualia, which for some reason was so important for him to do, and then say we've landed somewhere in the middle, along with the robots he's described.It is a fun read with plenty of interesting pop psychology experiments.Overall, an account of what it might look like to explain consciousness away.

97,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71339698-nour-elhuda-zuraiki,3,"When I finally finished reading this book all I was thinking about is: ‘’ I wish I could have a chance of smoking pot with Dennett watching Westworld’’Here is my advice if you want to read this book and really enjoy it: first, have an open mind, yes don’t disagree from the first thing you encounter, the book is challenging and it subconsciously demands from you to unlink your intuitions about your inner experiences to wrap your head around other alternatives. Secondly, there might seem to be contradiction in the book which you’ll unravel especially when you reach the core purpose of it (chapter 5) but remember the ‘’psychoanalysis Party Game’’ when Dennett talked about in the early chapters concluding at the end: ‘’ In such a cycle, one’s current expectations and interests shape hypotheses for one’s perceptual systems to confirm or disconfirm, and a rapid sequence of such hypothesis generations and confirmations produces the ultimate product, the ongoing, updated ‘’model’’ of the world of perceived ….All we suppose is that the illusionist goes into an arbitrary confirmation mode and the victim provides the content by asking the questions’’. This is very much applied to every concept introduced in the book, for instance when Dennett mentions the thought experiment ‘’Mary the Colour Scientist’’ he presumes that your brain has made the assumption that knowing every physical fact about a colour is the same as knowing a lot about the colour. Now Dennett concludes that if Mary really did know every physical fact about a colour yellow, she will be to know what yellow is like by entirely anticipating her entire cognitive simulation and response to the stimulus.Now Dennett introduces a model for the mental processes that we call consciousness where he claims ‘’some of the most perplexing paradoxes of consciousness arise because we cling too long to a good habit of thought, a habit that usually keeps us out of trouble’’ he starts of by laying down what we need to establish to build a model he revisits Descartes Cartesian Theatre-where all the aspects of a profound experience come together to provide a unified phenomenal world- he discusses why this model cannot work by maintaining that there is no single point for which it all has to come together for central processing so he then introduces ‘’The Multiple Drafts Model’’ where According it, ‘’all varieties of perception- indeed, all varieties of thought or mental activity- are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous "" here Dennett then emphasis that this model makes the discrimination that ‘’ the brain just adjusts to the conclusion that is drawn, making the new interpretation of the information available for the modulation of subsequent behaviour’’.In conclusion, Dennett believes that instead for the consciousness to be at a single point he imagines it described as a virtual machine like a computer that is built on top of a different system, it is a linear, sequential machine that is built on top of a massively parallel structure which in this case is the brain.Now this is a very short summary of the book, of course the book is so rich with information, starting from Descartes’ Dualism and the Cartesian Theatre then explaining that there’s no Theatre in the first place to introducing many thoughts experiments to get you ready to absorb the new way of thinking about consciousness, getting a grasp on how your inner mental life might have come. It is subtly profound and valuable. It’s like Dennett looks at consciousness as the brain’s way of making sense of the world around us. For me personally it was an astonishing whole new worldview to form and just like any other worldview, it does have its complexities and assumptions but that doesn’t mean that it is not logical to consider, I suppose when I’m having this worldview of the denial of consciousness and the experience (According to Dennett) I become more of a depressed person who doesn’t seem to find meaning of anything around, having the idea that what we perceive as reality is subjective and what we think is the objective reality is only hypothetical since or senses are flawed and limited is an unescapable truth.At the end I’m only an amature philosopher, a curious human mind that like to share her views assertively yet tactfully. "
98,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37283541-fran-cavanagh,4,"This is a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain. At least, it's a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain as was understood to be the case nearly 30 years ago. Honestly, I felt Dennett's summary of the cognitive science behind perception, attention, memory and language stood up very well despite the book's age, so that isn't much of a criticism. While there have obviously been many developments in these fields since Dennett was writing, much of the same base material has been covered in my 2020-era Psychology Masters programme. This is also a great introduction to some of the key philosophical debates regarding consciousness, human and otherwise (although, as very much a non-philosopher, I'm not sure I'd be able to identify if it wasn't). I'm not sure Dennett fully marries these two strands together to put forward a fully satisfying view on the nature of human consciousness.I can get on board with Dennett's ""Multiple Drafts"" view of human perception, as far as I understand it. It's backed up by a significant body of literature in Psychology and Neuroscience that suggests that our experience of reality is a lot choppier and less constant or consistent than it appears. I can also agree, as a result, that the ""Cartesian Theatre"" and the idea of one centralised observer self doesn't make a whole lot of scientific sense. But none of this, for me, touches on the question of what the consciousness that we experience in ourselves and others actually is, or how it appears. Dennett again makes a very convincing case that our brains can be seen as effectively very complicated supercomputers, and that a non-biological supercomputer that worked exactly like the brain would be functionally indistinguishable from the brain. Dennett also puts forward fascinating points, building principally on the work of Dawkins and Levelt, about language and ideas and how these grow and propagate between our brains and across societies. There's truly a lot of fascinating and valid discussion here, and Dennett is clearly much more knowledgeable and generally intelligent than I could ever hope to be. I appreciated hearing his synthesised perspective on all of these topics. Again, though, I was still left feeling that he didn't fully explore or explain how consciousness emerges from this biological supercomputer we call the brain. The book also doesn't really directly discuss in any depth what consciousness is, how it functions, or why. This book is apparently often re-titled by its critics as ""Consciousness Explained Away"". This seems a little unfair. Dennett makes it very clear in his closing remarks that he believes that consciousness is a ""thing"". I'm just still not convinced that I understand how the mechanisms and functions and processes he describes in great detail in this book add up to the consciousness that he stresses he believes exists.The entry for Consciousness in the 1989 Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology offers a succinctly damning description: “The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings: awareness… Nothing worth reading has been written about it.” I'm not sure this book provided a counterexample to that definition, but I'm also of half a mind to believe that it's impossible for us to truly understand the nature of consciousness, at least with the scientific tools currently at our disposal. I suspect that Dennett would feel very differently about that proposition, and that there may be some fundamental definitional disconnects at play between whatever school of philosophy I fall into and the largely functionalist worldview inhabited by Dennett. An impasse I'm honestly under-equipped to fully describe. Philosophical disagreements about the nature of the subject matter aside, then, this was a really well put-together, intelligent and enjoyable read. One I expect I'll return to a lot."
99,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,3,"Following my readings on history and future of humanity, I wanted to explore the question of “what is humanity”? and why super intelligent machines lack “humanity” despite their superior intelligence? If it's not intelligence that makes us human then it must be “consciousness”, or that continuous stream of subjective experiences, feelings and emotions that flow through our brain every second of our waking hours. What exactly is it? and how does it happen is an unsolved mystery despite significant advances in neurosciences, biology, psychology and computing. Therefore, a book titled “Consciousness Explained” seemed like exactly the right book I need.This book is not my first reading on intelligence but it is the first on consciousness and I have to say it was a disappointing start, the book is overly academic and lacks the story telling convenience I got so used to that I now expect from any writer who respects their audience. It’s not my job to clean up an author’s mess and order it into concise narrative. It should be the job of the one who got paid to write in the first place. Anyway, back to consciousness. The book tries to replace the traditional view with a different view that is better supported by evidence from experimental neuroscience. The Traditional view is called the “Cartesian theater” where basically all sensory information is projected in a theater-like area of the brain that is continuously monitored by “the mind” or “the conscious soul” that is continuously issuing commands to different body parts in response to the information presented to it. This view is obviously wrong for multiple reasons, first because neuroscience can not find such area in the brain and more importantly, because this creates an infinite recursive loop of ""what, then, is the mind of that mind, ... etc?""The alternative model is the “multiple drafts” model where different but connected brain regions unconsciously and simultaneously develop several subjective experience narratives, each has a partial draft of the story and some even have a plan for action, however, these competing experiences get filtered by higher level brain areas (probably in the frontal cortex) that decide which narrative/plan of action should get the highest priority based on millions of years of natural selection design followed by several years of cultural training in the surrounding environment. This explains why conscious experience of all humans is genetically sensitive to snakes, the color red, and vertical symmetry (faces) while each human culture is sensitive to specific environmental memes like jokes, beliefs and local common sense.The evidence for this model comes in two variants: (1) logical: because a virtual machine of consciousness that is made up of several subconscious components escapes the recursive flaw of the Cartesian theater model. (2) It has been proven recently by neuroscience that decisions are made in the brain a few milliseconds BEFORE we become “conscious” of making them, and not the other way around.At the end, I don't think I have a satisfactory understanding of consciousness, but to have my consciousness explained in just one book was an audacious goal in the first place. The book, although useful, could have been written in a much better way and could have left out so many useless details. So, if interested in consciousness, wait till I find you a better book to read."
100,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060524-robert-fischer,4,"Rhetorically, this book is a masterpiece. Without a doubt, Dennett is a master of the persuasive argument, and he pulls out all the stops here: see the gradual shifts in word choice (""the familiar Cartesian Theater"" at the beginning morphs by the end into ""our old nemesis, the Cartesian Theater""), very carefully chosen metaphorical models in order to pull in all kinds of technological magic, the way he performs a mea culpa without actually admitting guilt near the end of the book, and prevalent rhetorical questions and blanket declarations to mask over the places where things are most awkward. It's really well done. If it weren't for the theoretical issues (really, one major theoretical issue), this would easily be a 5 star book. It is both rigorous yet accessible, and it is a wonderfully enjoyable exploration of consciousness and its limitations. The book has a lot to teach people about their own self-experience, even (and especially!) those who aren't prone to agree with him (such as me). To borrow a term Dennett uses to describe a fellow philosopher's work, this book is an ""instructive failure"". It's definitely worth your time to read.I read this book, however, with a particular question in mind: when I see something in my mind's eye, where does that image reside? (Note that I have a vivid mind's eye — some people don't even have a mind's eye at all, and don't even know they're missing one! See this Discover article for more.) This book was referred to me because it was apparently a solid materialist argument and explanation. Unfortunately, Dennett simply doesn't have an answer for that question. His rhetoric obscures that fact very well (although he cops to side-stepping questions of ""the nature of things"" in Appendix A), but ultimately he takes a functionalist approach, and that handily does away with the very evidence which I was looking for him to explain.To see how this happens, it is first necessary to realize that we can't actually prove anyone else is conscious in the same sense we are. As was popularized in The Matrix, we could be dreaming and not realizing it, and everyone else could be projections of our own consciousness. Like in A Beautiful Mind (SPOILER ALERT), we could be populating our experience with non-existent people. No test proves anything more than the fact that it is a very clever illusion or bit of calculation going on — but, ultimately, our own consciousness is uniquely experienced by us. Everyone else could be a zombie (in the philosophical sense), and we have no way to know differently. This is not the point Dennett starts with, but it's implicit within Dennett's functionalist approach. The move Dennett makes is to then project that back on to us, and say that we, too, have no consciousness in any real sense. How could you prove differently to anyone else? What objectively accessible function can you perform as a conscious entity which these potentially unconscious entities could not?The problem is that the experience of having consciousness — not just computational complexity or a narrative world, but some ""audience in a Cartesian Theater"" — is not simply a ""doctrine"" (that word choice is a great example of Dennett's excellent and subtle rhetorical moves), but stems from evidence. It's not functional-objective evidence, but it is evidence none the less. That evidence is the experience of having consciousness. As much as you chip away at what the consciousness is and does (and Dennett does that excellently), there is always still an ""I"" which is having the experience. That's the whole point of Descartes, and Dennett simply does not feel the need to account for it, instead presenting the epistemological limitations of his ""heterophenomonology"" as ontological statements. But a map is not the territory, and a scientific model is not the thing itself. Simply because heterophenomonology cannot take with subjective evidence seriously does not mean that subjective evidence should not be taken seriously. This point is very poetically (and popularly) driven home in Nature, Man and Woman, and Dennett is aware of it, but simply dismisses it as not relevant. If you read through my progress in this book, you'll see lots of places where those dismissals are explicitly identified, because they drove me nuts. (Here's an example.)To a certain extent, though, he is right: phenomonology is not relevant within the context of science, where heterophenomenology is sufficient. As a text in cognitive science, Dennett's approach is really insightful and makes many challenging points. In the world of philosophy, though, the phenomonology needs to be accounted for. It's not philosophically sufficient to assume an air of ""anthropological"" condescension towards at least our own phenomonology — that's discounting a vital piece of evidence without basis, and if it cannot be accounted for, then consciousness (at least our own consciousness) is insufficiently explained. Dennett claims that consciousness is just an illusion — but who is perceiving the illusion? If it is a deception, who is being deceived? That claim is actually begging the question, and Dennett responds by retreating to functionalism, and saying it is our memories that are being deceived. But I do not simply remember being conscious — I am conscious of being conscious! But that sentence doesn't even make sense in the functionalist conception. But Dennett seems to be paraphrasing Groucho Marx: ""Who are you going to believe? Me or your own mind's eye?""It is notable at this point, though, to mention that the kind of ""anthropological"" condescension Dennett advocates has actually come under an extreme kind of fire as a Eurocentric and fundamentally racist pattern of thought which results not in real knowledge, but more in generating a hybrid of European presumptions and European interpretative ""data"". For more on this point, see Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference. I bring this up because so much of the argumentation feels like 19th century thinking, not 21st century thinking, and the model Dennett proposes reads more like an artifact of philosophy's own artifices and methodologies than an account of reality. Appeals to the specialness of language (strictly conceived), to Newtonian physics, and conflations between non-materialism and dualism really reinforce that sense.On top of all of this, Dennett builds heavily upon ideas of evolutionary psychology and memes, which are roundly destroyed as non-scientific materialistic doctrines in The Spiritual Brain: A Neuroscientist's Case for the Existence of the Soul. There is also some significant ethological (""animal-psychological"") claims about the communication and cognition of animals which are simply empirically wrong given research done by people like Marc Bekoff. And the idea that we could have immortality by ""copying our brain's software"" is not very comforting to this particular copy (a point made well in The Prestige). There is no serious engagement with psi or spirituality, as though they are self-evidently irrelevant to discussions of consciousness.With all these complaints, however, the book still gets 4 stars. It's definitely worth a read, and it is really an eye-opening revelation of just how complicated the apparently simple idea of ""the conscious mind"" really is. Highly suggested."

You see philosophers, without actually asking themselves what these words meant, used to debate with each other by filling the blanks in arguments with these words and moving them around like rebus tiles, inventing more and more recondite scenarios for their use and claiming to refute their opponents with sheer tour de force applications of logic. I think you can see why someone had to put a stop to this.More seriously, it does seem uncontroversial to me that the neurons underlying color perception and other sensations can be affected by further causal relations to judgments and object perceptions (it has been known for more than 100 years!). Does this mean sensations are simply a network of discriminatory judgments and their concreteness an illusion of being embedded in a network of such judgments? No because they are realized by the effective physical powers expressed in the sensations. It is probably true that a space of colors could be simulated in a machine or even a computer program. For example if a machine were charged with navigating a space of numbered points and could carry out rotations, translations etc. on these points and if the machine had a way of specifying its own position in the manifold and representations of the other points and distances and directions, it would make sense to say the machine carries an internal representation that would ""seem to it like living in a space."" Why not? But the physical realization would matter too. It isn't just the structure that matters but the stuff too. If the color space were navigated by a color observer then certainly I could buy the idea that the representation would seem to it like sensing (its own) colors. But the same colors as those expressed by the physics of the human brain? Doubtful, unless the relevant physical realization was exactly duplicated, by electrical -chemical signals for example. The idea that the sensations are nothing but an artifact of being in a certain representation regardless of how it is realized, this seems to ignore the fact that the physical realization must matter too. Proof: take two such realizations and let them interact in one big representation. Because the causal roles of the materials are different those differences also have further causal roles in relation to each other and would be manifested as such, so the non-identity would be revealed immediately. Dennett claims that if discriminatory judgments are divorced from their qualitative appearance this leads to absurdity, but how can these roles be separated at all if sensations are also physical and if their qualitative appearance is a result of their configured causal powers? By separating them you are leaving out some of their causal roles and the thought experiment is impossible. He doesn't even consider any of this. I'm not impartial to this discussion (see my Realistic Empiricism) but the concrete physical reality of sensation seems hard to deny if it is there in the cells."
102,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,4,"I saw a quote somewhere (in a David Chalmers book but not by Chalmers himself) that basically pointed out that the fact that we are conscious beings means that we've never really said anything of interest about consciousness. It's both so obvious as to be self-evident, and yet so ineffable that it can't be spoken about clearly. This double-edged sword is what Dennett tackles. He wants to challenge the view that conscious is this thing that we known intrinsically from a first-person perspective, whilst also undermining any claim that it cannot be spoken about clearly. What is required is a rethinking of the very assumptions we make about our conscious minds in light of what we discover from everything from neuroscience to AI, from anthropology to zoology, and start to shut down the Cartesian Theatre once and for all.The results are a mixed bag. Dennett's eye for detail, need to make sure you've fully understood every nuance of his point and dedication to defending himself against any predicted counter-argument mean that the book is immense, long and quite a slog. This is partly where my criticism of the text emerges. For a book of popular philosophy combined with popular science, this is dense and detailed. It isn't a simple overview of his key ideas that any engrossed reader can follow up afterwards. He covers every angle, every philosophical nook and cranny, until he feels he has exhausted the discussion. On the other hand, the book is so filled with simplifications, metaphors, ""intuition pumps"" and reader-friendly summaries that any one who is reading it for academic reasons may feel a little undernourished. The big question is: who is this book for? With that aside, I found the book entertaining and engaging. The sheer volume of the text means it takes quite a while to get through it all, and one chapter at a time is more than enough. There's little chance of readers ploughing through this at speed because they can't wait to see what happens next. However, there is a payoff. In later chapters, the painfully long analysis of the early sections start to reappear and the relevance of everything starts to look more like a coherent theory than a series of musings on what things might be like if we take the time to think about them differently. This is rewarding due to the effort that has to be put in during the early stages of the book. It took me nearly 3 months to read it because it wasn't the book I thought it would be. I thought this was a handy overview of his ideas in a digestible form. It wasn't. Or rather it was, but in such gargantuan amounts of prose that it took me a while to churn through it, and bedtime reading became a non-starter. I still enjoyed it. It was still worth the effort, but had I not been in the mood to tackle it, I would have given up sooner. "
103,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99056689-katyen,4,"Daniel Dennett's book ""Consciousness Explained"" is currently one of the classic books on consciousness. In addition, it is one of the most important Dennett books he has ever written. I can also consider Daniel Dennett to be one of the most important representatives of contemporary philosophy of mind. The views he presents in the book are in many cases conservative and provocative, which was part of Dennett's goal, and this book has provoked much discussion, criticism, indignation, but also appreciation.Most critics accused Dennett of either not explaining consciousness in the book at all or rejecting it altogether. None of these views is true, on the contrary, Dennett tries to explain consciousness, but in a completely different way. Dennett does not try to say directly what consciousness is, but rather what consciousness does. Related to this is his rejection of the famous ""hard problem of consciousness"" and his replacement by the ""hard question"", which reads: And then what happens? (Dennett 1991, p. 255). In the book, he tries to explain and to some extent also summarize the knowledge about the brain from the cognitive sciences and neurosciences so far. Dennett himself is not only a philosopher but also a cognitive scientist, and even today he is actively involved in discussions of consciousness. The aim of the book is not so much to explain consciousness as to demystify it. That is, to point out that consciousness is a natural phenomenon in nature that arose during an evolutionary process that lasted millions of years. The fact that most authors consider consciousness to be mysterious and exceptional is more related to moral views on the uniqueness of human beings. This is exactly what Dennett tries to prove in the book and to point out that even if we remove the mysticism, there will still be beauty and space for new questions. As he claims:When we understand consciousness - when there is no more mystery - consciousness will be different, but there will still be beauty, and more room than ever for awe (Dennett 1991, pp. 25).Overall, I especially liked the book because of its new concept of consciousness, which was unconventional for the 90s of the 20th century. A possible downside to the book is that in some parts of the book, Dennett vaguely expresses his views, which may ultimately lead to Dennett's rejection of consciousness."
104,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"I was already aware of the bad fame of this book, and every time I saw it being referenced, I saw it as being referenced as a failure. As the typical saying goes ""consciousness explained away"". Nevertheless, I decided to give it a shot. I figured the bad reputation of the book was because it failed its goal and stated purpose, which was way too ambitious. But I figured I could still have a lot of value and insight into consciousness. But I was wrong. While it explained some characteristics of thought and consciousness, it didn't explain consciousness as such. I gave up and stopped reading briefly before halfway. I very rarely leave books unfinished, but I truly felt like it was a waste of time. Not only it didn't explain very much, but the writing itself is rather boring, and Dennett often shifts too laterally. While I usually appreciate this, I found it pointless and dull. I felt he often confused the validity of the experience of consciousness as phenomenology itself. The fact that your phenomenology leads you to a flawed assumption and you don't quite understand the mechanisms, doesn't in any way solve the actual problem of experiencing it, which is exactly the point. Coming up with heterophenomenology to make it more ""objective"" doesn't help very much. If it's accurate or not is almost irrelevant. Calling it a simple projection feels an equal cheap escape. This is my 2nd book from Dennett, the first being Breaking the Spell, which was similarly disappointing. I had a good impression of Dennet from a few his lectures that I watched, and after the disappointment of the first book I figured I'd give it another try, but looks like I'm fighting for a lost cause.I'm sure there are some good arguments and ideas in the book, I found the categorization of consciousness as being Orwelling or Stalinesque quite witty and useful for example, and the refutation of the Cartesian Theatre is solid, although it was beaten to death. But overall, I personally felt it wasn't worth the grinding."
105,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59307958-katy-koivastik,5,"References to consciousness in Sam Harris’ “Waking Up” reminded me of “Consciousness Explained” sitting unread in my library probably since it was first published in 1991. I decided to finally open it to see whether it would hold my interest all these years later.I earnestly powered through the first third of the book, and then pick and chose my way through the rest. There is a reason I am not a scientist, as I found the descriptions of the experiments boring, despite being written for the layman. The author does discuss the nature of memory and of the human tendency toward false and embellished memory, a topic I find unendingly fascinating. The book is peppered with quotations, and this one from novelist Ariel Dorfman on memory resonated: “I’m really not sure if others fail to perceive me or if, one fraction of a second after my face interferes with their horizon, a millionth of a second after they have cast their gaze on me, they already begin to wash me from their memory: forgotten before arriving at the scant, sad archangel of a remembrance.”I gave the book 5 stars because it is well written, includes wry cartoons, and can be understood by non-scientists. One quote from the author sums up the topic for me: “We, in contrast (to animals), are almost constantly engaged in presenting ourselves to others, and to ourselves, and hence representing ourselves — in language and gesture, external and internal. The most obvious difference in our environment that would explain this difference in our behavior is the behavior itself. Our human environment contains not just food and shelter, enemies to fight or flee, and conspecifics with whom to mate, but words, words, words. These words are potent elements of our environment that we readily incorporate, ingesting and extruding them, weaving them like spiderwebs into self-protective strings of narrative. ....when we let in these words, these meme-vehicles, they tend to take over, creating us out of the raw materials they find in our brains.”"
106,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7804740-paul,4,"Dennett's intention in this book is to defend and advance materialism, which is the idea that only matter exists, and that there are no other special things, like 'mind stuff' or the soul. The challenge which he addresses is to explain how something as complex, varied and wonderful as human consciousness could possibly originate 100% from the human brain. The subtext really should be 'Dualism Demolished', as he spends quite some time dismantling the idea that there must be some other medium or entity in which consciousness happens. As well the related idea of the 'Cartesian centre of consciousness', the idea that there is a central point in the brain where all of the senses, inputs and thinking comes together to become our consciousness.I'm a materialist myself, and as I work with computers, I don't have any objection to the idea that consciousness is some kind of 'virtual machine' that runs in the brain in a massively parallel way, which is an idea he presents. However, I must say that at times I found the book heavy going. Perhaps it's my fault that I thought the book belonged in the 'popular philosophy' category, which it certainly does not. This is a Serious Philosophical Work, and it's intended to make a Real Contribution to the science and philosophy of mind. It's chock full of references, annotations and asides. Dennett tries in every page to be as rational and scientific as possible. That's fine, but at times I found it wearing. While I agree with the broad thrust of what he's saying, there's plenty you could object to (such as the idea that you don't really experience sensory input, you only 'seem to'. Although it was published in 1991, it still felt relevant to me, due to timeless nature of the issues he addresses. Although I have no doubt that the argument has moved on a great deal since that time. Overall a great read, but not for the faint of heart."
107,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54462119-mohammadhossein-haqiqatkhah,4,"Daniel C. Dennett tends to prolixity when explaining the stuff. Although it's mainly focused on challenging Cartesian dualism, he introduces very interesting perspectives toward consciousness.All he tries to do in this book (and I believe he succeeds in it) is to suggest new metaphors to substitute the more intuitive metaphors the dualist theories provide. He digs very deeply into qualia and challenges almost every aspect of it. As he puts it:My explanation of consciousness is far from complete. One might even say that it was just a beginning, but it is a beginning, because it breaks the spell of the enchanted circle of ideas that made explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t replaced a metaphorical theory, the Cartesian Theater, with a nonmetaphorical (“literal, scientific”) theory. All I have done, really, is to replace one family of metaphors and images with another, trading in the Theater, the Witness, the Central Meaner, the Figment, for Software, Virtual Machines, Multiple Drafts, a Pandemonium of Homunculi. It’s just a war of metaphors, you say — but metaphors are not “just” metaphors; metaphors are the tools of thought. No one can think about consciousness without them, so it is important to equip yourself with the best set of tools available. Look what we have built with our tools. Could you have imagined it without them?He ends up, quite quickly, with a narrative theory of self and individual identity. It's an exotic view (let's say, journey) into the philosophy of consciousness, but it leaves many questions unaddressed. However, indeed, Consciousness Explained is a no-return point in your philosophical relationship with consciousness."
108,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"In a way Dennett feels like a curmudgeon about how the roots of the consciousness and the mind works in much the same way Richard Dawkins feels to me a curmudgeon about the roots of our biology. And just like Dawkins, I find him very convincing. Dennett is very much in line with other thinkers I've been reading like Douglas Hofstadter (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) and Michael S.A. Graziano (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) who see consciousness as an emergent property of the whole system of our brain rather than something that emerges from a single point or theater in the mind. His dialogues on the chinese room thought experiment and philosophical zombies were great on this point. There can be unconscious zombies or operators in the chinese rooms only if we propose a single theater that consciousness arises from. If we look at the larger system, it's clear that any philosophical zombie will all of the skills and insights of a human would indeed be a conscious system.This counterintuitive conclusion is something that we all seem to naturally battle because it strikes at the very nature of the self that is doing the intuiting. As Dennett wrote: ""Many people are afraid to see consciousness explained because they fear that if we succeed in explaining it, we will lose our moral bearings."" I suppose I can partially excuse some of my favorite thinkers like Yuval Noah Harari and Sam Harris for continuing to make claims that consciousness is still a fundamental mystery. I think what they mean is that we still haven't found the metaphors that allow us collectively to think about our minds in the way we think about our biology and the world around us. Dennett, in spite of his best attempt to reach a broad audience, is far too academic for my mother or my dentist and probably for me, but I'm hoping work from someone is on the way to help carry this torch."
109,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47952052-chloe-noland,3,"I'm not sure which is more convoluted: the topic of consciousness, or the author Dennett himself. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other, more mainstream styles of discussion regarding issues of science and morality, from authors like Harris and Pinker. The fact that Dennett's central thesis of this book -- deconstructing our ""intuitive"" but incorrect understanding of our conscious selves as a Cartesian witness sitting inside our brains, and replacing it with a Multiple Drafts Model of cognition that supports the way our minds truly process, adapt, & repeat in order to make conscious choices and actions -- is written in an extremely self-referential and conceited style, to the point that it distracts from the thesis itself, and weighs down a lot of Dennett's brilliant observations and theories with nods to his own superiority over his colleagues, including at least one citation to the author's other works on every other page. Basically, I wish he had just shared his ideas in a more neutral and simplistic way. The theories themselves are not hard to understand, although do require commitment to what Dennett is asking of the reader -- to put aside everything they think they understand about what consciousness is and how our minds operate. After this, it's just Dennett's world and we're living in it: in showing how our brains evolved to their current levels of complexity through a complicated process of trial and error, shaping and reshaping, layering new information on top of old, Dennett illuminates many processes of cognition that provide new and consequential insights into why we tell stories, how identities are formed, and what these narratives mean for our continuing evolution -- the least of which is that no such thing as a SELF really exists, or has ever existed. I just wish he had cut back on the running side commentary. "
110,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75618360-tien-manh,5,"What is subjective experience? When I imagine a purple cow, the purpleness ""feels"" purple to ""me"". Who is this ""me""? Dennett tackles a very difficult problem in a beautifully written work of philosophy (+a bit of cognitive science).Slowly, the author dismantles the myth of the ""Cartesian theater"", or the idea that past perception, and the parallel neural processes going on in the brain, content is ""presented"" to a fictitious viewer. There is no such ""Audience"". Thinking is thought. There is no ""central hub"" where everything ""comes together"", and Dennett introduces ""Multiple Drafts"" to give consciousness an elementary stab.Then Dennett compares consciousness as a sort of serial (illusory) program running on the parallel brain. This part I'm not super convinced about, thinking of a computer as subsystems of information processing is useful in some ways but maybe we need more models and analogies besides the Von Neumann architecture.What about the ""language"" that we think in? Dennett refutes a ""Central Meaner"", and instead replaces it with a ""Pandemonium"", multiple neural pathways in our head all having something to say.Dennett also discusses the evolution of consciousness, problems with folk psychology, Libet's experiments and temporal inference, and philosophical problems like ""In the Mind's eye"", ""Mary the scientist"", Searle's ""Chinese Room"", ""What is it like to be a bat""...There was a lot of thought provoking content in this book. The idea of the self as a ""center of narrative gravity"", an abstract concept, instead of some dualistic ""brain pearl"" was illuminating for me. Book is kinda old, probably there are more up-to-date ones, but I'd say this is still extremely well worth the time for anyone curious in the nature of the mind."
111,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74862840-cary-giese,3,"Consciousness is the ability of humans to be aware of their own mind. “I think, therefore I am,” per Rene Descartes of the 17th century, is still the prevailing understanding. The book’s author explained, in excessive detail, what was known or believed in 1991, namely a confusion of ideas from the disciplines of psychology, philosophy and science. No real progress! No advanced ideas beyond Descartes’ description since then. More theses, no consensus! It does seem that each persons consciousness is unique to them! Each of us has sole awareness of our self! Our soul?? There is an underlying belief that our human consciousness is an evolved state resulting from the creative processes of evolution. Now the question is: Can Artificial Intelligence develop consciousness through a similar creative process, to become unique, super smart “silicone individuals,” competing with humans? Wow! The question is: how can we use and manage Artificial Intelligece without it surpassing us? I need to read more updated studies to understand this more! I will if they exist, most books on the subject date to the 1980-90’s! This book provides the questions, no answers, and only speculations. Though the book is credited as the landmark start of the discussion! For that, Dennett deserves respect for providing a foundation reading!"
112,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914286-sarah,2,"I was really interested in this work for about the first 200 pages. One of the biggest drawbacks is that this text was published in 1991 (almost 30 years ago); and the author uses a lot of illustrations and arguments from the science and philosophy of artificial intelligence. That science has changed so much in the last 30 years. Also, I have no real science or philosophy background, so I found parts of this a tough go. The early chapters, when the author was trying to define consciousness were the best for me - he raised a number of ideas and issues that I found fascinating. Not only about how speech developed, but when did we start talking to ourselves? And the importance of that action. You have to think of yourself as a self to bother speaking. Not to mention, how do we hear our own voices (or our parents voices, etc) in our heads? No sound is actually being generated; yet our brain gives it to us as if playing a recording. How do you ""hear"" when you are 100 percent by passing your auditory system? Same thing with ""seeing"" things in your head. But as the book dragged on, I lost interest and felt more and more lost in his endless responses to others ideas of consciousness. In the end, he never did explain consciousness to me. I just kept falling asleep whenever I picked up this book - so I very lightly skimmed the last 200 pages and called it a day."
113,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72796908-daniel-hageman,3,"This is a book where my judgment of it could change for the better or worse upon reading more material in the area of Theory of Mind, and then even rereading this work. Dennett undoubtedly makes a thought provoking case for how we ought to look at consciousness, perhaps shaking a fair few my previously held ideas regarding the soundness of epiphenomenalism and philosophical zombies. The examples regarding tastes, and the experience of an acquired taste, as a phenomenon that changes over time versus your conscious experience of the taste of said phenomenon changing, seems quite crucial in considering the relevance of consciousness as explained via external objective measures. His last section addressing the issue of 'explaining' a phenomenon versus 'explaining away' said phenomenon was also a nice touch. I agree with his conclusion that he has at the very least started the explanation; perhaps he wouldn't have gotten so much heat for this book if he reconsidered the tense of his verbiage when drawing up a title. A simple gerund could likely have made others' perception of him and his work much more palatable, though with some further pressure, their conscious experience of his work could perhaps become acquired as well :)"
114,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21625655-chase-mcclendon,4,"I was between 3 and 4 stars on this book. On the one hand, it’s impressive to view Dennett attempt to topple (and replace) what he views as a misinformed view of what consciousness is. Naturally, something as familiar to us as our own consciousness will carry with it a certain obviousness about the mechanisms and features of that consciousness. Dennett’s task is to show you that although you may be the observer, you don’t have a claim to infallibility over the mechanisms that produce your experience, only the effects of those mechanisms. My problem with the book was that oftentimes Dennett‘s writing seems filled with unnecessary jargon. While I understand that in a book that tries to do no less than explain consciousness there will be some requisite wordiness, I was left with the feeling that if only Dennett was a more pithy writer, his points would’ve landed with more force. Many times throughout the book I would finish a section and feel that I had missed an aspect of an argument that Dennett supposed would win me over in dramatic fashion.All this said, I enjoyed Dennett’s method and although I may still have subtle bonds to my old ways of thinking about consciousness, Dennett has done much to weaken and replace them."
115,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79330012-arthur-ryman,4,"Definitely worth the read, but not exactly what I was hoping for or what is advertised in the title. A more accurate title would be ""Consciousness Explained Away"". I am in full agreement with Dennett's basic position, namely that the brain is a computing device. However, Dennett does not explain the basic phenomenon of awareness. Rather, he substitutes the term ""dispositional state"". Disappointing. I decided to read this, and similar works, because I felt that physics lacked the conceptual vocabulary to talk about awareness, that abundantly obvious feeling that we are observers. Coincidentally, quantum mechanics, although spectacularly successful, relies on the injection of an observer to collapse superpositions of states into an actual observation. In the absence of a better explanation from Dennett and his colleagues, I'll simply tell myself that awareness is what collapsing wave functions feel like. :-)"

(the quotes are not actual quotes but my paraphrasing).It was like a constant tease, I guess to keep you hooked, while he rambled on with his filler. But after a while of this not stop filler with teases, I got fed up and put the book down. I did not even bother to skip to the end.

Then from the middle, he seemed to want to clean up for later and remove a central ""meaner"" for consciousness and describe his multiple drafts theory so that he can link up any ol' robot to a zombified human state, since there isn't one ""perfect"" setup for an human mind. Then from a negative direction cut up phenomenology and then remove qualia, which for some reason was so important for him to do, and then say we've landed somewhere in the middle, along with the robots he's described.It is a fun read with plenty of interesting pop psychology experiments.Overall, an account of what it might look like to explain consciousness away.

127,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71339698-nour-elhuda-zuraiki,3,"When I finally finished reading this book all I was thinking about is: ‘’ I wish I could have a chance of smoking pot with Dennett watching Westworld’’Here is my advice if you want to read this book and really enjoy it: first, have an open mind, yes don’t disagree from the first thing you encounter, the book is challenging and it subconsciously demands from you to unlink your intuitions about your inner experiences to wrap your head around other alternatives. Secondly, there might seem to be contradiction in the book which you’ll unravel especially when you reach the core purpose of it (chapter 5) but remember the ‘’psychoanalysis Party Game’’ when Dennett talked about in the early chapters concluding at the end: ‘’ In such a cycle, one’s current expectations and interests shape hypotheses for one’s perceptual systems to confirm or disconfirm, and a rapid sequence of such hypothesis generations and confirmations produces the ultimate product, the ongoing, updated ‘’model’’ of the world of perceived ….All we suppose is that the illusionist goes into an arbitrary confirmation mode and the victim provides the content by asking the questions’’. This is very much applied to every concept introduced in the book, for instance when Dennett mentions the thought experiment ‘’Mary the Colour Scientist’’ he presumes that your brain has made the assumption that knowing every physical fact about a colour is the same as knowing a lot about the colour. Now Dennett concludes that if Mary really did know every physical fact about a colour yellow, she will be to know what yellow is like by entirely anticipating her entire cognitive simulation and response to the stimulus.Now Dennett introduces a model for the mental processes that we call consciousness where he claims ‘’some of the most perplexing paradoxes of consciousness arise because we cling too long to a good habit of thought, a habit that usually keeps us out of trouble’’ he starts of by laying down what we need to establish to build a model he revisits Descartes Cartesian Theatre-where all the aspects of a profound experience come together to provide a unified phenomenal world- he discusses why this model cannot work by maintaining that there is no single point for which it all has to come together for central processing so he then introduces ‘’The Multiple Drafts Model’’ where According it, ‘’all varieties of perception- indeed, all varieties of thought or mental activity- are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous "" here Dennett then emphasis that this model makes the discrimination that ‘’ the brain just adjusts to the conclusion that is drawn, making the new interpretation of the information available for the modulation of subsequent behaviour’’.In conclusion, Dennett believes that instead for the consciousness to be at a single point he imagines it described as a virtual machine like a computer that is built on top of a different system, it is a linear, sequential machine that is built on top of a massively parallel structure which in this case is the brain.Now this is a very short summary of the book, of course the book is so rich with information, starting from Descartes’ Dualism and the Cartesian Theatre then explaining that there’s no Theatre in the first place to introducing many thoughts experiments to get you ready to absorb the new way of thinking about consciousness, getting a grasp on how your inner mental life might have come. It is subtly profound and valuable. It’s like Dennett looks at consciousness as the brain’s way of making sense of the world around us. For me personally it was an astonishing whole new worldview to form and just like any other worldview, it does have its complexities and assumptions but that doesn’t mean that it is not logical to consider, I suppose when I’m having this worldview of the denial of consciousness and the experience (According to Dennett) I become more of a depressed person who doesn’t seem to find meaning of anything around, having the idea that what we perceive as reality is subjective and what we think is the objective reality is only hypothetical since or senses are flawed and limited is an unescapable truth.At the end I’m only an amature philosopher, a curious human mind that like to share her views assertively yet tactfully. "
128,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37283541-fran-cavanagh,4,"This is a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain. At least, it's a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain as was understood to be the case nearly 30 years ago. Honestly, I felt Dennett's summary of the cognitive science behind perception, attention, memory and language stood up very well despite the book's age, so that isn't much of a criticism. While there have obviously been many developments in these fields since Dennett was writing, much of the same base material has been covered in my 2020-era Psychology Masters programme. This is also a great introduction to some of the key philosophical debates regarding consciousness, human and otherwise (although, as very much a non-philosopher, I'm not sure I'd be able to identify if it wasn't). I'm not sure Dennett fully marries these two strands together to put forward a fully satisfying view on the nature of human consciousness.I can get on board with Dennett's ""Multiple Drafts"" view of human perception, as far as I understand it. It's backed up by a significant body of literature in Psychology and Neuroscience that suggests that our experience of reality is a lot choppier and less constant or consistent than it appears. I can also agree, as a result, that the ""Cartesian Theatre"" and the idea of one centralised observer self doesn't make a whole lot of scientific sense. But none of this, for me, touches on the question of what the consciousness that we experience in ourselves and others actually is, or how it appears. Dennett again makes a very convincing case that our brains can be seen as effectively very complicated supercomputers, and that a non-biological supercomputer that worked exactly like the brain would be functionally indistinguishable from the brain. Dennett also puts forward fascinating points, building principally on the work of Dawkins and Levelt, about language and ideas and how these grow and propagate between our brains and across societies. There's truly a lot of fascinating and valid discussion here, and Dennett is clearly much more knowledgeable and generally intelligent than I could ever hope to be. I appreciated hearing his synthesised perspective on all of these topics. Again, though, I was still left feeling that he didn't fully explore or explain how consciousness emerges from this biological supercomputer we call the brain. The book also doesn't really directly discuss in any depth what consciousness is, how it functions, or why. This book is apparently often re-titled by its critics as ""Consciousness Explained Away"". This seems a little unfair. Dennett makes it very clear in his closing remarks that he believes that consciousness is a ""thing"". I'm just still not convinced that I understand how the mechanisms and functions and processes he describes in great detail in this book add up to the consciousness that he stresses he believes exists.The entry for Consciousness in the 1989 Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology offers a succinctly damning description: “The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings: awareness… Nothing worth reading has been written about it.” I'm not sure this book provided a counterexample to that definition, but I'm also of half a mind to believe that it's impossible for us to truly understand the nature of consciousness, at least with the scientific tools currently at our disposal. I suspect that Dennett would feel very differently about that proposition, and that there may be some fundamental definitional disconnects at play between whatever school of philosophy I fall into and the largely functionalist worldview inhabited by Dennett. An impasse I'm honestly under-equipped to fully describe. Philosophical disagreements about the nature of the subject matter aside, then, this was a really well put-together, intelligent and enjoyable read. One I expect I'll return to a lot."
129,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,3,"Following my readings on history and future of humanity, I wanted to explore the question of “what is humanity”? and why super intelligent machines lack “humanity” despite their superior intelligence? If it's not intelligence that makes us human then it must be “consciousness”, or that continuous stream of subjective experiences, feelings and emotions that flow through our brain every second of our waking hours. What exactly is it? and how does it happen is an unsolved mystery despite significant advances in neurosciences, biology, psychology and computing. Therefore, a book titled “Consciousness Explained” seemed like exactly the right book I need.This book is not my first reading on intelligence but it is the first on consciousness and I have to say it was a disappointing start, the book is overly academic and lacks the story telling convenience I got so used to that I now expect from any writer who respects their audience. It’s not my job to clean up an author’s mess and order it into concise narrative. It should be the job of the one who got paid to write in the first place. Anyway, back to consciousness. The book tries to replace the traditional view with a different view that is better supported by evidence from experimental neuroscience. The Traditional view is called the “Cartesian theater” where basically all sensory information is projected in a theater-like area of the brain that is continuously monitored by “the mind” or “the conscious soul” that is continuously issuing commands to different body parts in response to the information presented to it. This view is obviously wrong for multiple reasons, first because neuroscience can not find such area in the brain and more importantly, because this creates an infinite recursive loop of ""what, then, is the mind of that mind, ... etc?""The alternative model is the “multiple drafts” model where different but connected brain regions unconsciously and simultaneously develop several subjective experience narratives, each has a partial draft of the story and some even have a plan for action, however, these competing experiences get filtered by higher level brain areas (probably in the frontal cortex) that decide which narrative/plan of action should get the highest priority based on millions of years of natural selection design followed by several years of cultural training in the surrounding environment. This explains why conscious experience of all humans is genetically sensitive to snakes, the color red, and vertical symmetry (faces) while each human culture is sensitive to specific environmental memes like jokes, beliefs and local common sense.The evidence for this model comes in two variants: (1) logical: because a virtual machine of consciousness that is made up of several subconscious components escapes the recursive flaw of the Cartesian theater model. (2) It has been proven recently by neuroscience that decisions are made in the brain a few milliseconds BEFORE we become “conscious” of making them, and not the other way around.At the end, I don't think I have a satisfactory understanding of consciousness, but to have my consciousness explained in just one book was an audacious goal in the first place. The book, although useful, could have been written in a much better way and could have left out so many useless details. So, if interested in consciousness, wait till I find you a better book to read."
130,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060524-robert-fischer,4,"Rhetorically, this book is a masterpiece. Without a doubt, Dennett is a master of the persuasive argument, and he pulls out all the stops here: see the gradual shifts in word choice (""the familiar Cartesian Theater"" at the beginning morphs by the end into ""our old nemesis, the Cartesian Theater""), very carefully chosen metaphorical models in order to pull in all kinds of technological magic, the way he performs a mea culpa without actually admitting guilt near the end of the book, and prevalent rhetorical questions and blanket declarations to mask over the places where things are most awkward. It's really well done. If it weren't for the theoretical issues (really, one major theoretical issue), this would easily be a 5 star book. It is both rigorous yet accessible, and it is a wonderfully enjoyable exploration of consciousness and its limitations. The book has a lot to teach people about their own self-experience, even (and especially!) those who aren't prone to agree with him (such as me). To borrow a term Dennett uses to describe a fellow philosopher's work, this book is an ""instructive failure"". It's definitely worth your time to read.I read this book, however, with a particular question in mind: when I see something in my mind's eye, where does that image reside? (Note that I have a vivid mind's eye — some people don't even have a mind's eye at all, and don't even know they're missing one! See this Discover article for more.) This book was referred to me because it was apparently a solid materialist argument and explanation. Unfortunately, Dennett simply doesn't have an answer for that question. His rhetoric obscures that fact very well (although he cops to side-stepping questions of ""the nature of things"" in Appendix A), but ultimately he takes a functionalist approach, and that handily does away with the very evidence which I was looking for him to explain.To see how this happens, it is first necessary to realize that we can't actually prove anyone else is conscious in the same sense we are. As was popularized in The Matrix, we could be dreaming and not realizing it, and everyone else could be projections of our own consciousness. Like in A Beautiful Mind (SPOILER ALERT), we could be populating our experience with non-existent people. No test proves anything more than the fact that it is a very clever illusion or bit of calculation going on — but, ultimately, our own consciousness is uniquely experienced by us. Everyone else could be a zombie (in the philosophical sense), and we have no way to know differently. This is not the point Dennett starts with, but it's implicit within Dennett's functionalist approach. The move Dennett makes is to then project that back on to us, and say that we, too, have no consciousness in any real sense. How could you prove differently to anyone else? What objectively accessible function can you perform as a conscious entity which these potentially unconscious entities could not?The problem is that the experience of having consciousness — not just computational complexity or a narrative world, but some ""audience in a Cartesian Theater"" — is not simply a ""doctrine"" (that word choice is a great example of Dennett's excellent and subtle rhetorical moves), but stems from evidence. It's not functional-objective evidence, but it is evidence none the less. That evidence is the experience of having consciousness. As much as you chip away at what the consciousness is and does (and Dennett does that excellently), there is always still an ""I"" which is having the experience. That's the whole point of Descartes, and Dennett simply does not feel the need to account for it, instead presenting the epistemological limitations of his ""heterophenomonology"" as ontological statements. But a map is not the territory, and a scientific model is not the thing itself. Simply because heterophenomonology cannot take with subjective evidence seriously does not mean that subjective evidence should not be taken seriously. This point is very poetically (and popularly) driven home in Nature, Man and Woman, and Dennett is aware of it, but simply dismisses it as not relevant. If you read through my progress in this book, you'll see lots of places where those dismissals are explicitly identified, because they drove me nuts. (Here's an example.)To a certain extent, though, he is right: phenomonology is not relevant within the context of science, where heterophenomenology is sufficient. As a text in cognitive science, Dennett's approach is really insightful and makes many challenging points. In the world of philosophy, though, the phenomonology needs to be accounted for. It's not philosophically sufficient to assume an air of ""anthropological"" condescension towards at least our own phenomonology — that's discounting a vital piece of evidence without basis, and if it cannot be accounted for, then consciousness (at least our own consciousness) is insufficiently explained. Dennett claims that consciousness is just an illusion — but who is perceiving the illusion? If it is a deception, who is being deceived? That claim is actually begging the question, and Dennett responds by retreating to functionalism, and saying it is our memories that are being deceived. But I do not simply remember being conscious — I am conscious of being conscious! But that sentence doesn't even make sense in the functionalist conception. But Dennett seems to be paraphrasing Groucho Marx: ""Who are you going to believe? Me or your own mind's eye?""It is notable at this point, though, to mention that the kind of ""anthropological"" condescension Dennett advocates has actually come under an extreme kind of fire as a Eurocentric and fundamentally racist pattern of thought which results not in real knowledge, but more in generating a hybrid of European presumptions and European interpretative ""data"". For more on this point, see Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference. I bring this up because so much of the argumentation feels like 19th century thinking, not 21st century thinking, and the model Dennett proposes reads more like an artifact of philosophy's own artifices and methodologies than an account of reality. Appeals to the specialness of language (strictly conceived), to Newtonian physics, and conflations between non-materialism and dualism really reinforce that sense.On top of all of this, Dennett builds heavily upon ideas of evolutionary psychology and memes, which are roundly destroyed as non-scientific materialistic doctrines in The Spiritual Brain: A Neuroscientist's Case for the Existence of the Soul. There is also some significant ethological (""animal-psychological"") claims about the communication and cognition of animals which are simply empirically wrong given research done by people like Marc Bekoff. And the idea that we could have immortality by ""copying our brain's software"" is not very comforting to this particular copy (a point made well in The Prestige). There is no serious engagement with psi or spirituality, as though they are self-evidently irrelevant to discussions of consciousness.With all these complaints, however, the book still gets 4 stars. It's definitely worth a read, and it is really an eye-opening revelation of just how complicated the apparently simple idea of ""the conscious mind"" really is. Highly suggested."
131,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260292-erik,2,"2091: one hundred years ago philosophers wrote books using words like ""consciousness,"" ""qualia,"" ""functionalism,"" ""materialism,"" and ""zombie,"" words which have since been banned for the sake of the public good. You see philosophers, without actually asking themselves what these words meant, used to debate with each other by filling the blanks in arguments with these words and moving them around like rebus tiles, inventing more and more recondite scenarios for their use and claiming to refute their opponents with sheer tour de force applications of logic. I think you can see why someone had to put a stop to this.More seriously, it does seem uncontroversial to me that the neurons underlying color perception and other sensations can be affected by further causal relations to judgments and object perceptions (it has been known for more than 100 years!). Does this mean sensations are simply a network of discriminatory judgments and their concreteness an illusion of being embedded in a network of such judgments? No because they are realized by the effective physical powers expressed in the sensations. It is probably true that a space of colors could be simulated in a machine or even a computer program. For example if a machine were charged with navigating a space of numbered points and could carry out rotations, translations etc. on these points and if the machine had a way of specifying its own position in the manifold and representations of the other points and distances and directions, it would make sense to say the machine carries an internal representation that would ""seem to it like living in a space."" Why not? But the physical realization would matter too. It isn't just the structure that matters but the stuff too. If the color space were navigated by a color observer then certainly I could buy the idea that the representation would seem to it like sensing (its own) colors. But the same colors as those expressed by the physics of the human brain? Doubtful, unless the relevant physical realization was exactly duplicated, by electrical -chemical signals for example. The idea that the sensations are nothing but an artifact of being in a certain representation regardless of how it is realized, this seems to ignore the fact that the physical realization must matter too. Proof: take two such realizations and let them interact in one big representation. Because the causal roles of the materials are different those differences also have further causal roles in relation to each other and would be manifested as such, so the non-identity would be revealed immediately. Dennett claims that if discriminatory judgments are divorced from their qualitative appearance this leads to absurdity, but how can these roles be separated at all if sensations are also physical and if their qualitative appearance is a result of their configured causal powers? By separating them you are leaving out some of their causal roles and the thought experiment is impossible. He doesn't even consider any of this. I'm not impartial to this discussion (see my Realistic Empiricism) but the concrete physical reality of sensation seems hard to deny if it is there in the cells."
132,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,4,"I saw a quote somewhere (in a David Chalmers book but not by Chalmers himself) that basically pointed out that the fact that we are conscious beings means that we've never really said anything of interest about consciousness. It's both so obvious as to be self-evident, and yet so ineffable that it can't be spoken about clearly. This double-edged sword is what Dennett tackles. He wants to challenge the view that conscious is this thing that we known intrinsically from a first-person perspective, whilst also undermining any claim that it cannot be spoken about clearly. What is required is a rethinking of the very assumptions we make about our conscious minds in light of what we discover from everything from neuroscience to AI, from anthropology to zoology, and start to shut down the Cartesian Theatre once and for all.The results are a mixed bag. Dennett's eye for detail, need to make sure you've fully understood every nuance of his point and dedication to defending himself against any predicted counter-argument mean that the book is immense, long and quite a slog. This is partly where my criticism of the text emerges. For a book of popular philosophy combined with popular science, this is dense and detailed. It isn't a simple overview of his key ideas that any engrossed reader can follow up afterwards. He covers every angle, every philosophical nook and cranny, until he feels he has exhausted the discussion. On the other hand, the book is so filled with simplifications, metaphors, ""intuition pumps"" and reader-friendly summaries that any one who is reading it for academic reasons may feel a little undernourished. The big question is: who is this book for? With that aside, I found the book entertaining and engaging. The sheer volume of the text means it takes quite a while to get through it all, and one chapter at a time is more than enough. There's little chance of readers ploughing through this at speed because they can't wait to see what happens next. However, there is a payoff. In later chapters, the painfully long analysis of the early sections start to reappear and the relevance of everything starts to look more like a coherent theory than a series of musings on what things might be like if we take the time to think about them differently. This is rewarding due to the effort that has to be put in during the early stages of the book. It took me nearly 3 months to read it because it wasn't the book I thought it would be. I thought this was a handy overview of his ideas in a digestible form. It wasn't. Or rather it was, but in such gargantuan amounts of prose that it took me a while to churn through it, and bedtime reading became a non-starter. I still enjoyed it. It was still worth the effort, but had I not been in the mood to tackle it, I would have given up sooner. "
133,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99056689-katyen,4,"Daniel Dennett's book ""Consciousness Explained"" is currently one of the classic books on consciousness. In addition, it is one of the most important Dennett books he has ever written. I can also consider Daniel Dennett to be one of the most important representatives of contemporary philosophy of mind. The views he presents in the book are in many cases conservative and provocative, which was part of Dennett's goal, and this book has provoked much discussion, criticism, indignation, but also appreciation.Most critics accused Dennett of either not explaining consciousness in the book at all or rejecting it altogether. None of these views is true, on the contrary, Dennett tries to explain consciousness, but in a completely different way. Dennett does not try to say directly what consciousness is, but rather what consciousness does. Related to this is his rejection of the famous ""hard problem of consciousness"" and his replacement by the ""hard question"", which reads: And then what happens? (Dennett 1991, p. 255). In the book, he tries to explain and to some extent also summarize the knowledge about the brain from the cognitive sciences and neurosciences so far. Dennett himself is not only a philosopher but also a cognitive scientist, and even today he is actively involved in discussions of consciousness. The aim of the book is not so much to explain consciousness as to demystify it. That is, to point out that consciousness is a natural phenomenon in nature that arose during an evolutionary process that lasted millions of years. The fact that most authors consider consciousness to be mysterious and exceptional is more related to moral views on the uniqueness of human beings. This is exactly what Dennett tries to prove in the book and to point out that even if we remove the mysticism, there will still be beauty and space for new questions. As he claims:When we understand consciousness - when there is no more mystery - consciousness will be different, but there will still be beauty, and more room than ever for awe (Dennett 1991, pp. 25).Overall, I especially liked the book because of its new concept of consciousness, which was unconventional for the 90s of the 20th century. A possible downside to the book is that in some parts of the book, Dennett vaguely expresses his views, which may ultimately lead to Dennett's rejection of consciousness."
134,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"I was already aware of the bad fame of this book, and every time I saw it being referenced, I saw it as being referenced as a failure. As the typical saying goes ""consciousness explained away"". Nevertheless, I decided to give it a shot. I figured the bad reputation of the book was because it failed its goal and stated purpose, which was way too ambitious. But I figured I could still have a lot of value and insight into consciousness. But I was wrong. While it explained some characteristics of thought and consciousness, it didn't explain consciousness as such. I gave up and stopped reading briefly before halfway. I very rarely leave books unfinished, but I truly felt like it was a waste of time. Not only it didn't explain very much, but the writing itself is rather boring, and Dennett often shifts too laterally. While I usually appreciate this, I found it pointless and dull. I felt he often confused the validity of the experience of consciousness as phenomenology itself. The fact that your phenomenology leads you to a flawed assumption and you don't quite understand the mechanisms, doesn't in any way solve the actual problem of experiencing it, which is exactly the point. Coming up with heterophenomenology to make it more ""objective"" doesn't help very much. If it's accurate or not is almost irrelevant. Calling it a simple projection feels an equal cheap escape. This is my 2nd book from Dennett, the first being Breaking the Spell, which was similarly disappointing. I had a good impression of Dennet from a few his lectures that I watched, and after the disappointment of the first book I figured I'd give it another try, but looks like I'm fighting for a lost cause.I'm sure there are some good arguments and ideas in the book, I found the categorization of consciousness as being Orwelling or Stalinesque quite witty and useful for example, and the refutation of the Cartesian Theatre is solid, although it was beaten to death. But overall, I personally felt it wasn't worth the grinding."
135,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59307958-katy-koivastik,5,"References to consciousness in Sam Harris’ “Waking Up” reminded me of “Consciousness Explained” sitting unread in my library probably since it was first published in 1991. I decided to finally open it to see whether it would hold my interest all these years later.I earnestly powered through the first third of the book, and then pick and chose my way through the rest. There is a reason I am not a scientist, as I found the descriptions of the experiments boring, despite being written for the layman. The author does discuss the nature of memory and of the human tendency toward false and embellished memory, a topic I find unendingly fascinating. The book is peppered with quotations, and this one from novelist Ariel Dorfman on memory resonated: “I’m really not sure if others fail to perceive me or if, one fraction of a second after my face interferes with their horizon, a millionth of a second after they have cast their gaze on me, they already begin to wash me from their memory: forgotten before arriving at the scant, sad archangel of a remembrance.”I gave the book 5 stars because it is well written, includes wry cartoons, and can be understood by non-scientists. One quote from the author sums up the topic for me: “We, in contrast (to animals), are almost constantly engaged in presenting ourselves to others, and to ourselves, and hence representing ourselves — in language and gesture, external and internal. The most obvious difference in our environment that would explain this difference in our behavior is the behavior itself. Our human environment contains not just food and shelter, enemies to fight or flee, and conspecifics with whom to mate, but words, words, words. These words are potent elements of our environment that we readily incorporate, ingesting and extruding them, weaving them like spiderwebs into self-protective strings of narrative. ....when we let in these words, these meme-vehicles, they tend to take over, creating us out of the raw materials they find in our brains.”"
136,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7804740-paul,4,"Dennett's intention in this book is to defend and advance materialism, which is the idea that only matter exists, and that there are no other special things, like 'mind stuff' or the soul. The challenge which he addresses is to explain how something as complex, varied and wonderful as human consciousness could possibly originate 100% from the human brain. The subtext really should be 'Dualism Demolished', as he spends quite some time dismantling the idea that there must be some other medium or entity in which consciousness happens. As well the related idea of the 'Cartesian centre of consciousness', the idea that there is a central point in the brain where all of the senses, inputs and thinking comes together to become our consciousness.I'm a materialist myself, and as I work with computers, I don't have any objection to the idea that consciousness is some kind of 'virtual machine' that runs in the brain in a massively parallel way, which is an idea he presents. However, I must say that at times I found the book heavy going. Perhaps it's my fault that I thought the book belonged in the 'popular philosophy' category, which it certainly does not. This is a Serious Philosophical Work, and it's intended to make a Real Contribution to the science and philosophy of mind. It's chock full of references, annotations and asides. Dennett tries in every page to be as rational and scientific as possible. That's fine, but at times I found it wearing. While I agree with the broad thrust of what he's saying, there's plenty you could object to (such as the idea that you don't really experience sensory input, you only 'seem to'. Although it was published in 1991, it still felt relevant to me, due to timeless nature of the issues he addresses. Although I have no doubt that the argument has moved on a great deal since that time. Overall a great read, but not for the faint of heart."
137,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54462119-mohammadhossein-haqiqatkhah,4,"Daniel C. Dennett tends to prolixity when explaining the stuff. Although it's mainly focused on challenging Cartesian dualism, he introduces very interesting perspectives toward consciousness.All he tries to do in this book (and I believe he succeeds in it) is to suggest new metaphors to substitute the more intuitive metaphors the dualist theories provide. He digs very deeply into qualia and challenges almost every aspect of it. As he puts it:My explanation of consciousness is far from complete. One might even say that it was just a beginning, but it is a beginning, because it breaks the spell of the enchanted circle of ideas that made explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t replaced a metaphorical theory, the Cartesian Theater, with a nonmetaphorical (“literal, scientific”) theory. All I have done, really, is to replace one family of metaphors and images with another, trading in the Theater, the Witness, the Central Meaner, the Figment, for Software, Virtual Machines, Multiple Drafts, a Pandemonium of Homunculi. It’s just a war of metaphors, you say — but metaphors are not “just” metaphors; metaphors are the tools of thought. No one can think about consciousness without them, so it is important to equip yourself with the best set of tools available. Look what we have built with our tools. Could you have imagined it without them?He ends up, quite quickly, with a narrative theory of self and individual identity. It's an exotic view (let's say, journey) into the philosophy of consciousness, but it leaves many questions unaddressed. However, indeed, Consciousness Explained is a no-return point in your philosophical relationship with consciousness."
138,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"In a way Dennett feels like a curmudgeon about how the roots of the consciousness and the mind works in much the same way Richard Dawkins feels to me a curmudgeon about the roots of our biology. And just like Dawkins, I find him very convincing. Dennett is very much in line with other thinkers I've been reading like Douglas Hofstadter (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) and Michael S.A. Graziano (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) who see consciousness as an emergent property of the whole system of our brain rather than something that emerges from a single point or theater in the mind. His dialogues on the chinese room thought experiment and philosophical zombies were great on this point. There can be unconscious zombies or operators in the chinese rooms only if we propose a single theater that consciousness arises from. If we look at the larger system, it's clear that any philosophical zombie will all of the skills and insights of a human would indeed be a conscious system.This counterintuitive conclusion is something that we all seem to naturally battle because it strikes at the very nature of the self that is doing the intuiting. As Dennett wrote: ""Many people are afraid to see consciousness explained because they fear that if we succeed in explaining it, we will lose our moral bearings."" I suppose I can partially excuse some of my favorite thinkers like Yuval Noah Harari and Sam Harris for continuing to make claims that consciousness is still a fundamental mystery. I think what they mean is that we still haven't found the metaphors that allow us collectively to think about our minds in the way we think about our biology and the world around us. Dennett, in spite of his best attempt to reach a broad audience, is far too academic for my mother or my dentist and probably for me, but I'm hoping work from someone is on the way to help carry this torch."
139,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47952052-chloe-noland,3,"I'm not sure which is more convoluted: the topic of consciousness, or the author Dennett himself. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other, more mainstream styles of discussion regarding issues of science and morality, from authors like Harris and Pinker. The fact that Dennett's central thesis of this book -- deconstructing our ""intuitive"" but incorrect understanding of our conscious selves as a Cartesian witness sitting inside our brains, and replacing it with a Multiple Drafts Model of cognition that supports the way our minds truly process, adapt, & repeat in order to make conscious choices and actions -- is written in an extremely self-referential and conceited style, to the point that it distracts from the thesis itself, and weighs down a lot of Dennett's brilliant observations and theories with nods to his own superiority over his colleagues, including at least one citation to the author's other works on every other page. Basically, I wish he had just shared his ideas in a more neutral and simplistic way. The theories themselves are not hard to understand, although do require commitment to what Dennett is asking of the reader -- to put aside everything they think they understand about what consciousness is and how our minds operate. After this, it's just Dennett's world and we're living in it: in showing how our brains evolved to their current levels of complexity through a complicated process of trial and error, shaping and reshaping, layering new information on top of old, Dennett illuminates many processes of cognition that provide new and consequential insights into why we tell stories, how identities are formed, and what these narratives mean for our continuing evolution -- the least of which is that no such thing as a SELF really exists, or has ever existed. I just wish he had cut back on the running side commentary. "

Dennett tackles a very difficult problem in a beautifully written work of philosophy (+a bit of cognitive science).Slowly, the author dismantles the myth of the ""Cartesian theater"", or the idea that past perception, and the parallel neural processes going on in the brain, content is ""presented"" to a fictitious viewer. There is no such ""Audience"". Thinking is thought. There is no ""central hub"" where everything ""comes together"", and Dennett introduces ""Multiple Drafts"" to give consciousness an elementary stab.Then Dennett compares consciousness as a sort of serial (illusory) program running on the parallel brain. This part I'm not super convinced about, thinking of a computer as subsystems of information processing is useful in some ways but maybe we need more models and analogies besides the Von Neumann architecture.What about the ""language"" that we think in? Dennett refutes a ""Central Meaner"", and instead replaces it with a ""Pandemonium"", multiple neural pathways in our head all having something to say.Dennett also discusses the evolution of consciousness, problems with folk psychology, Libet's experiments and temporal inference, and philosophical problems like ""In the Mind's eye"", ""Mary the scientist"", Searle's ""Chinese Room"", ""What is it like to be a bat""...There was a lot of thought provoking content in this book. The idea of the self as a ""center of narrative gravity"", an abstract concept, instead of some dualistic ""brain pearl"" was illuminating for me. Book is kinda old, probably there are more up-to-date ones, but I'd say this is still extremely well worth the time for anyone curious in the nature of the mind."
141,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74862840-cary-giese,3,"Consciousness is the ability of humans to be aware of their own mind. “I think, therefore I am,” per Rene Descartes of the 17th century, is still the prevailing understanding. The book’s author explained, in excessive detail, what was known or believed in 1991, namely a confusion of ideas from the disciplines of psychology, philosophy and science. No real progress! No advanced ideas beyond Descartes’ description since then. More theses, no consensus! It does seem that each persons consciousness is unique to them! Each of us has sole awareness of our self! Our soul?? There is an underlying belief that our human consciousness is an evolved state resulting from the creative processes of evolution. Now the question is: Can Artificial Intelligence develop consciousness through a similar creative process, to become unique, super smart “silicone individuals,” competing with humans? Wow! The question is: how can we use and manage Artificial Intelligece without it surpassing us? I need to read more updated studies to understand this more! I will if they exist, most books on the subject date to the 1980-90’s! This book provides the questions, no answers, and only speculations. Though the book is credited as the landmark start of the discussion! For that, Dennett deserves respect for providing a foundation reading!"
142,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914286-sarah,2,"I was really interested in this work for about the first 200 pages. One of the biggest drawbacks is that this text was published in 1991 (almost 30 years ago); and the author uses a lot of illustrations and arguments from the science and philosophy of artificial intelligence. That science has changed so much in the last 30 years. Also, I have no real science or philosophy background, so I found parts of this a tough go. The early chapters, when the author was trying to define consciousness were the best for me - he raised a number of ideas and issues that I found fascinating. Not only about how speech developed, but when did we start talking to ourselves? And the importance of that action. You have to think of yourself as a self to bother speaking. Not to mention, how do we hear our own voices (or our parents voices, etc) in our heads? No sound is actually being generated; yet our brain gives it to us as if playing a recording. How do you ""hear"" when you are 100 percent by passing your auditory system? Same thing with ""seeing"" things in your head. But as the book dragged on, I lost interest and felt more and more lost in his endless responses to others ideas of consciousness. In the end, he never did explain consciousness to me. I just kept falling asleep whenever I picked up this book - so I very lightly skimmed the last 200 pages and called it a day."

Dennett undoubtedly makes a thought provoking case for how we ought to look at consciousness, perhaps shaking a fair few my previously held ideas regarding the soundness of epiphenomenalism and philosophical zombies. The examples regarding tastes, and the experience of an acquired taste, as a phenomenon that changes over time versus your conscious experience of the taste of said phenomenon changing, seems quite crucial in considering the relevance of consciousness as explained via external objective measures. His last section addressing the issue of 'explaining' a phenomenon versus 'explaining away' said phenomenon was also a nice touch. I agree with his conclusion that he has at the very least started the explanation; perhaps he wouldn't have gotten so much heat for this book if he reconsidered the tense of his verbiage when drawing up a title. A simple gerund could likely have made others' perception of him and his work much more palatable, though with some further pressure, their conscious experience of his work could perhaps become acquired as well :)"
144,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21625655-chase-mcclendon,4,"I was between 3 and 4 stars on this book. On the one hand, it’s impressive to view Dennett attempt to topple (and replace) what he views as a misinformed view of what consciousness is. Naturally, something as familiar to us as our own consciousness will carry with it a certain obviousness about the mechanisms and features of that consciousness. Dennett’s task is to show you that although you may be the observer, you don’t have a claim to infallibility over the mechanisms that produce your experience, only the effects of those mechanisms. My problem with the book was that oftentimes Dennett‘s writing seems filled with unnecessary jargon. While I understand that in a book that tries to do no less than explain consciousness there will be some requisite wordiness, I was left with the feeling that if only Dennett was a more pithy writer, his points would’ve landed with more force. Many times throughout the book I would finish a section and feel that I had missed an aspect of an argument that Dennett supposed would win me over in dramatic fashion.All this said, I enjoyed Dennett’s method and although I may still have subtle bonds to my old ways of thinking about consciousness, Dennett has done much to weaken and replace them."
145,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79330012-arthur-ryman,4,"Definitely worth the read, but not exactly what I was hoping for or what is advertised in the title. A more accurate title would be ""Consciousness Explained Away"". I am in full agreement with Dennett's basic position, namely that the brain is a computing device. However, Dennett does not explain the basic phenomenon of awareness. Rather, he substitutes the term ""dispositional state"". Disappointing. I decided to read this, and similar works, because I felt that physics lacked the conceptual vocabulary to talk about awareness, that abundantly obvious feeling that we are observers. Coincidentally, quantum mechanics, although spectacularly successful, relies on the injection of an observer to collapse superpositions of states into an actual observation. In the absence of a better explanation from Dennett and his colleagues, I'll simply tell myself that awareness is what collapsing wave functions feel like. :-)"

(the quotes are not actual quotes but my paraphrasing).It was like a constant tease, I guess to keep you hooked, while he rambled on with his filler.

Then from the middle, he seemed to want to clean up for later and remove a central ""meaner"" for consciousness and describe his multiple drafts theory so that he can link up any ol' robot to a zombified human state, since there isn't one ""perfect"" setup for an human mind. Then from a negative direction cut up phenomenology and then remove qualia, which for some reason was so important for him to do, and then say we've landed somewhere in the middle, along with the robots he's described.It is a fun read with plenty of interesting pop psychology experiments.Overall, an account of what it might look like to explain consciousness away.

It's hard to argue with someone as smart as Dennett, he sets traps, finds the perfect arguments, and is just so undeniably smarter and prepared than any of us, which is one of the reasons why I have to remain slightly skeptical about his final premise.He has succeeded in making me see his argument, and though it still remains closer to a philosophical one than a scientific one, it's the best one I've heard so far and the one that explains consciousness the best while not falling for metaphysical interpretations at all.Great book.

157,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71339698-nour-elhuda-zuraiki,3,"When I finally finished reading this book all I was thinking about is: ‘’ I wish I could have a chance of smoking pot with Dennett watching Westworld’’Here is my advice if you want to read this book and really enjoy it: first, have an open mind, yes don’t disagree from the first thing you encounter, the book is challenging and it subconsciously demands from you to unlink your intuitions about your inner experiences to wrap your head around other alternatives. Secondly, there might seem to be contradiction in the book which you’ll unravel especially when you reach the core purpose of it (chapter 5) but remember the ‘’psychoanalysis Party Game’’ when Dennett talked about in the early chapters concluding at the end: ‘’ In such a cycle, one’s current expectations and interests shape hypotheses for one’s perceptual systems to confirm or disconfirm, and a rapid sequence of such hypothesis generations and confirmations produces the ultimate product, the ongoing, updated ‘’model’’ of the world of perceived ….All we suppose is that the illusionist goes into an arbitrary confirmation mode and the victim provides the content by asking the questions’’. This is very much applied to every concept introduced in the book, for instance when Dennett mentions the thought experiment ‘’Mary the Colour Scientist’’ he presumes that your brain has made the assumption that knowing every physical fact about a colour is the same as knowing a lot about the colour. Now Dennett concludes that if Mary really did know every physical fact about a colour yellow, she will be to know what yellow is like by entirely anticipating her entire cognitive simulation and response to the stimulus.Now Dennett introduces a model for the mental processes that we call consciousness where he claims ‘’some of the most perplexing paradoxes of consciousness arise because we cling too long to a good habit of thought, a habit that usually keeps us out of trouble’’ he starts of by laying down what we need to establish to build a model he revisits Descartes Cartesian Theatre-where all the aspects of a profound experience come together to provide a unified phenomenal world- he discusses why this model cannot work by maintaining that there is no single point for which it all has to come together for central processing so he then introduces ‘’The Multiple Drafts Model’’ where According it, ‘’all varieties of perception- indeed, all varieties of thought or mental activity- are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous "" here Dennett then emphasis that this model makes the discrimination that ‘’ the brain just adjusts to the conclusion that is drawn, making the new interpretation of the information available for the modulation of subsequent behaviour’’.In conclusion, Dennett believes that instead for the consciousness to be at a single point he imagines it described as a virtual machine like a computer that is built on top of a different system, it is a linear, sequential machine that is built on top of a massively parallel structure which in this case is the brain.Now this is a very short summary of the book, of course the book is so rich with information, starting from Descartes’ Dualism and the Cartesian Theatre then explaining that there’s no Theatre in the first place to introducing many thoughts experiments to get you ready to absorb the new way of thinking about consciousness, getting a grasp on how your inner mental life might have come. It is subtly profound and valuable. It’s like Dennett looks at consciousness as the brain’s way of making sense of the world around us. For me personally it was an astonishing whole new worldview to form and just like any other worldview, it does have its complexities and assumptions but that doesn’t mean that it is not logical to consider, I suppose when I’m having this worldview of the denial of consciousness and the experience (According to Dennett) I become more of a depressed person who doesn’t seem to find meaning of anything around, having the idea that what we perceive as reality is subjective and what we think is the objective reality is only hypothetical since or senses are flawed and limited is an unescapable truth.At the end I’m only an amature philosopher, a curious human mind that like to share her views assertively yet tactfully. "
158,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37283541-fran-cavanagh,4,"This is a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain. At least, it's a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain as was understood to be the case nearly 30 years ago. Honestly, I felt Dennett's summary of the cognitive science behind perception, attention, memory and language stood up very well despite the book's age, so that isn't much of a criticism. While there have obviously been many developments in these fields since Dennett was writing, much of the same base material has been covered in my 2020-era Psychology Masters programme. This is also a great introduction to some of the key philosophical debates regarding consciousness, human and otherwise (although, as very much a non-philosopher, I'm not sure I'd be able to identify if it wasn't). I'm not sure Dennett fully marries these two strands together to put forward a fully satisfying view on the nature of human consciousness.I can get on board with Dennett's ""Multiple Drafts"" view of human perception, as far as I understand it. It's backed up by a significant body of literature in Psychology and Neuroscience that suggests that our experience of reality is a lot choppier and less constant or consistent than it appears. I can also agree, as a result, that the ""Cartesian Theatre"" and the idea of one centralised observer self doesn't make a whole lot of scientific sense. But none of this, for me, touches on the question of what the consciousness that we experience in ourselves and others actually is, or how it appears. Dennett again makes a very convincing case that our brains can be seen as effectively very complicated supercomputers, and that a non-biological supercomputer that worked exactly like the brain would be functionally indistinguishable from the brain. Dennett also puts forward fascinating points, building principally on the work of Dawkins and Levelt, about language and ideas and how these grow and propagate between our brains and across societies. There's truly a lot of fascinating and valid discussion here, and Dennett is clearly much more knowledgeable and generally intelligent than I could ever hope to be. I appreciated hearing his synthesised perspective on all of these topics. Again, though, I was still left feeling that he didn't fully explore or explain how consciousness emerges from this biological supercomputer we call the brain. The book also doesn't really directly discuss in any depth what consciousness is, how it functions, or why. This book is apparently often re-titled by its critics as ""Consciousness Explained Away"". This seems a little unfair. Dennett makes it very clear in his closing remarks that he believes that consciousness is a ""thing"". I'm just still not convinced that I understand how the mechanisms and functions and processes he describes in great detail in this book add up to the consciousness that he stresses he believes exists.The entry for Consciousness in the 1989 Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology offers a succinctly damning description: “The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings: awareness… Nothing worth reading has been written about it.” I'm not sure this book provided a counterexample to that definition, but I'm also of half a mind to believe that it's impossible for us to truly understand the nature of consciousness, at least with the scientific tools currently at our disposal. I suspect that Dennett would feel very differently about that proposition, and that there may be some fundamental definitional disconnects at play between whatever school of philosophy I fall into and the largely functionalist worldview inhabited by Dennett. An impasse I'm honestly under-equipped to fully describe. Philosophical disagreements about the nature of the subject matter aside, then, this was a really well put-together, intelligent and enjoyable read. One I expect I'll return to a lot."
159,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,3,"Following my readings on history and future of humanity, I wanted to explore the question of “what is humanity”? and why super intelligent machines lack “humanity” despite their superior intelligence? If it's not intelligence that makes us human then it must be “consciousness”, or that continuous stream of subjective experiences, feelings and emotions that flow through our brain every second of our waking hours. What exactly is it? and how does it happen is an unsolved mystery despite significant advances in neurosciences, biology, psychology and computing. Therefore, a book titled “Consciousness Explained” seemed like exactly the right book I need.This book is not my first reading on intelligence but it is the first on consciousness and I have to say it was a disappointing start, the book is overly academic and lacks the story telling convenience I got so used to that I now expect from any writer who respects their audience. It’s not my job to clean up an author’s mess and order it into concise narrative. It should be the job of the one who got paid to write in the first place. Anyway, back to consciousness. The book tries to replace the traditional view with a different view that is better supported by evidence from experimental neuroscience. The Traditional view is called the “Cartesian theater” where basically all sensory information is projected in a theater-like area of the brain that is continuously monitored by “the mind” or “the conscious soul” that is continuously issuing commands to different body parts in response to the information presented to it. This view is obviously wrong for multiple reasons, first because neuroscience can not find such area in the brain and more importantly, because this creates an infinite recursive loop of ""what, then, is the mind of that mind, ... etc?""The alternative model is the “multiple drafts” model where different but connected brain regions unconsciously and simultaneously develop several subjective experience narratives, each has a partial draft of the story and some even have a plan for action, however, these competing experiences get filtered by higher level brain areas (probably in the frontal cortex) that decide which narrative/plan of action should get the highest priority based on millions of years of natural selection design followed by several years of cultural training in the surrounding environment. This explains why conscious experience of all humans is genetically sensitive to snakes, the color red, and vertical symmetry (faces) while each human culture is sensitive to specific environmental memes like jokes, beliefs and local common sense.The evidence for this model comes in two variants: (1) logical: because a virtual machine of consciousness that is made up of several subconscious components escapes the recursive flaw of the Cartesian theater model. (2) It has been proven recently by neuroscience that decisions are made in the brain a few milliseconds BEFORE we become “conscious” of making them, and not the other way around.At the end, I don't think I have a satisfactory understanding of consciousness, but to have my consciousness explained in just one book was an audacious goal in the first place. The book, although useful, could have been written in a much better way and could have left out so many useless details. So, if interested in consciousness, wait till I find you a better book to read."
160,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060524-robert-fischer,4,"Rhetorically, this book is a masterpiece. Without a doubt, Dennett is a master of the persuasive argument, and he pulls out all the stops here: see the gradual shifts in word choice (""the familiar Cartesian Theater"" at the beginning morphs by the end into ""our old nemesis, the Cartesian Theater""), very carefully chosen metaphorical models in order to pull in all kinds of technological magic, the way he performs a mea culpa without actually admitting guilt near the end of the book, and prevalent rhetorical questions and blanket declarations to mask over the places where things are most awkward. It's really well done. If it weren't for the theoretical issues (really, one major theoretical issue), this would easily be a 5 star book. It is both rigorous yet accessible, and it is a wonderfully enjoyable exploration of consciousness and its limitations. The book has a lot to teach people about their own self-experience, even (and especially!) those who aren't prone to agree with him (such as me). To borrow a term Dennett uses to describe a fellow philosopher's work, this book is an ""instructive failure"". It's definitely worth your time to read.I read this book, however, with a particular question in mind: when I see something in my mind's eye, where does that image reside? (Note that I have a vivid mind's eye — some people don't even have a mind's eye at all, and don't even know they're missing one! See this Discover article for more.) This book was referred to me because it was apparently a solid materialist argument and explanation. Unfortunately, Dennett simply doesn't have an answer for that question. His rhetoric obscures that fact very well (although he cops to side-stepping questions of ""the nature of things"" in Appendix A), but ultimately he takes a functionalist approach, and that handily does away with the very evidence which I was looking for him to explain.To see how this happens, it is first necessary to realize that we can't actually prove anyone else is conscious in the same sense we are. As was popularized in The Matrix, we could be dreaming and not realizing it, and everyone else could be projections of our own consciousness. Like in A Beautiful Mind (SPOILER ALERT), we could be populating our experience with non-existent people. No test proves anything more than the fact that it is a very clever illusion or bit of calculation going on — but, ultimately, our own consciousness is uniquely experienced by us. Everyone else could be a zombie (in the philosophical sense), and we have no way to know differently. This is not the point Dennett starts with, but it's implicit within Dennett's functionalist approach. The move Dennett makes is to then project that back on to us, and say that we, too, have no consciousness in any real sense. How could you prove differently to anyone else? What objectively accessible function can you perform as a conscious entity which these potentially unconscious entities could not?The problem is that the experience of having consciousness — not just computational complexity or a narrative world, but some ""audience in a Cartesian Theater"" — is not simply a ""doctrine"" (that word choice is a great example of Dennett's excellent and subtle rhetorical moves), but stems from evidence. It's not functional-objective evidence, but it is evidence none the less. That evidence is the experience of having consciousness. As much as you chip away at what the consciousness is and does (and Dennett does that excellently), there is always still an ""I"" which is having the experience. That's the whole point of Descartes, and Dennett simply does not feel the need to account for it, instead presenting the epistemological limitations of his ""heterophenomonology"" as ontological statements. But a map is not the territory, and a scientific model is not the thing itself. Simply because heterophenomonology cannot take with subjective evidence seriously does not mean that subjective evidence should not be taken seriously. This point is very poetically (and popularly) driven home in Nature, Man and Woman, and Dennett is aware of it, but simply dismisses it as not relevant. If you read through my progress in this book, you'll see lots of places where those dismissals are explicitly identified, because they drove me nuts. (Here's an example.)To a certain extent, though, he is right: phenomonology is not relevant within the context of science, where heterophenomenology is sufficient. As a text in cognitive science, Dennett's approach is really insightful and makes many challenging points. In the world of philosophy, though, the phenomonology needs to be accounted for. It's not philosophically sufficient to assume an air of ""anthropological"" condescension towards at least our own phenomonology — that's discounting a vital piece of evidence without basis, and if it cannot be accounted for, then consciousness (at least our own consciousness) is insufficiently explained. Dennett claims that consciousness is just an illusion — but who is perceiving the illusion? If it is a deception, who is being deceived? That claim is actually begging the question, and Dennett responds by retreating to functionalism, and saying it is our memories that are being deceived. But I do not simply remember being conscious — I am conscious of being conscious! But that sentence doesn't even make sense in the functionalist conception. But Dennett seems to be paraphrasing Groucho Marx: ""Who are you going to believe? Me or your own mind's eye?""It is notable at this point, though, to mention that the kind of ""anthropological"" condescension Dennett advocates has actually come under an extreme kind of fire as a Eurocentric and fundamentally racist pattern of thought which results not in real knowledge, but more in generating a hybrid of European presumptions and European interpretative ""data"".

I bring this up because so much of the argumentation feels like 19th century thinking, not 21st century thinking, and the model Dennett proposes reads more like an artifact of philosophy's own artifices and methodologies than an account of reality. Appeals to the specialness of language (strictly conceived), to Newtonian physics, and conflations between non-materialism and dualism really reinforce that sense.On top of all of this, Dennett builds heavily upon ideas of evolutionary psychology and memes, which are roundly destroyed as non-scientific materialistic doctrines in The Spiritual Brain: A Neuroscientist's Case for the Existence of the Soul. There is also some significant ethological (""animal-psychological"") claims about the communication and cognition of animals which are simply empirically wrong given research done by people like Marc Bekoff. And the idea that we could have immortality by ""copying our brain's software"" is not very comforting to this particular copy (a point made well in The Prestige). There is no serious engagement with psi or spirituality, as though they are self-evidently irrelevant to discussions of consciousness.With all these complaints, however, the book still gets 4 stars. It's definitely worth a read, and it is really an eye-opening revelation of just how complicated the apparently simple idea of ""the conscious mind"" really is. Highly suggested."
161,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260292-erik,2,"2091: one hundred years ago philosophers wrote books using words like ""consciousness,"" ""qualia,"" ""functionalism,"" ""materialism,"" and ""zombie,"" words which have since been banned for the sake of the public good. You see philosophers, without actually asking themselves what these words meant, used to debate with each other by filling the blanks in arguments with these words and moving them around like rebus tiles, inventing more and more recondite scenarios for their use and claiming to refute their opponents with sheer tour de force applications of logic. I think you can see why someone had to put a stop to this.More seriously, it does seem uncontroversial to me that the neurons underlying color perception and other sensations can be affected by further causal relations to judgments and object perceptions (it has been known for more than 100 years!). Does this mean sensations are simply a network of discriminatory judgments and their concreteness an illusion of being embedded in a network of such judgments? No because they are realized by the effective physical powers expressed in the sensations. It is probably true that a space of colors could be simulated in a machine or even a computer program. For example if a machine were charged with navigating a space of numbered points and could carry out rotations, translations etc. on these points and if the machine had a way of specifying its own position in the manifold and representations of the other points and distances and directions, it would make sense to say the machine carries an internal representation that would ""seem to it like living in a space."" Why not? But the physical realization would matter too. It isn't just the structure that matters but the stuff too. If the color space were navigated by a color observer then certainly I could buy the idea that the representation would seem to it like sensing (its own) colors. But the same colors as those expressed by the physics of the human brain? Doubtful, unless the relevant physical realization was exactly duplicated, by electrical -chemical signals for example. The idea that the sensations are nothing but an artifact of being in a certain representation regardless of how it is realized, this seems to ignore the fact that the physical realization must matter too. Proof: take two such realizations and let them interact in one big representation. Because the causal roles of the materials are different those differences also have further causal roles in relation to each other and would be manifested as such, so the non-identity would be revealed immediately. Dennett claims that if discriminatory judgments are divorced from their qualitative appearance this leads to absurdity, but how can these roles be separated at all if sensations are also physical and if their qualitative appearance is a result of their configured causal powers? By separating them you are leaving out some of their causal roles and the thought experiment is impossible. He doesn't even consider any of this. I'm not impartial to this discussion (see my Realistic Empiricism) but the concrete physical reality of sensation seems hard to deny if it is there in the cells."
162,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,4,"I saw a quote somewhere (in a David Chalmers book but not by Chalmers himself) that basically pointed out that the fact that we are conscious beings means that we've never really said anything of interest about consciousness. It's both so obvious as to be self-evident, and yet so ineffable that it can't be spoken about clearly. This double-edged sword is what Dennett tackles. He wants to challenge the view that conscious is this thing that we known intrinsically from a first-person perspective, whilst also undermining any claim that it cannot be spoken about clearly. What is required is a rethinking of the very assumptions we make about our conscious minds in light of what we discover from everything from neuroscience to AI, from anthropology to zoology, and start to shut down the Cartesian Theatre once and for all.The results are a mixed bag. Dennett's eye for detail, need to make sure you've fully understood every nuance of his point and dedication to defending himself against any predicted counter-argument mean that the book is immense, long and quite a slog. This is partly where my criticism of the text emerges. For a book of popular philosophy combined with popular science, this is dense and detailed. It isn't a simple overview of his key ideas that any engrossed reader can follow up afterwards. He covers every angle, every philosophical nook and cranny, until he feels he has exhausted the discussion. On the other hand, the book is so filled with simplifications, metaphors, ""intuition pumps"" and reader-friendly summaries that any one who is reading it for academic reasons may feel a little undernourished. The big question is: who is this book for? With that aside, I found the book entertaining and engaging. The sheer volume of the text means it takes quite a while to get through it all, and one chapter at a time is more than enough. There's little chance of readers ploughing through this at speed because they can't wait to see what happens next. However, there is a payoff. In later chapters, the painfully long analysis of the early sections start to reappear and the relevance of everything starts to look more like a coherent theory than a series of musings on what things might be like if we take the time to think about them differently. This is rewarding due to the effort that has to be put in during the early stages of the book. It took me nearly 3 months to read it because it wasn't the book I thought it would be. I thought this was a handy overview of his ideas in a digestible form. It wasn't. Or rather it was, but in such gargantuan amounts of prose that it took me a while to churn through it, and bedtime reading became a non-starter. I still enjoyed it. It was still worth the effort, but had I not been in the mood to tackle it, I would have given up sooner. "
163,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99056689-katyen,4,"Daniel Dennett's book ""Consciousness Explained"" is currently one of the classic books on consciousness. In addition, it is one of the most important Dennett books he has ever written. I can also consider Daniel Dennett to be one of the most important representatives of contemporary philosophy of mind. The views he presents in the book are in many cases conservative and provocative, which was part of Dennett's goal, and this book has provoked much discussion, criticism, indignation, but also appreciation.Most critics accused Dennett of either not explaining consciousness in the book at all or rejecting it altogether. None of these views is true, on the contrary, Dennett tries to explain consciousness, but in a completely different way. Dennett does not try to say directly what consciousness is, but rather what consciousness does. Related to this is his rejection of the famous ""hard problem of consciousness"" and his replacement by the ""hard question"", which reads: And then what happens? (Dennett 1991, p. 255). In the book, he tries to explain and to some extent also summarize the knowledge about the brain from the cognitive sciences and neurosciences so far. Dennett himself is not only a philosopher but also a cognitive scientist, and even today he is actively involved in discussions of consciousness. The aim of the book is not so much to explain consciousness as to demystify it. That is, to point out that consciousness is a natural phenomenon in nature that arose during an evolutionary process that lasted millions of years. The fact that most authors consider consciousness to be mysterious and exceptional is more related to moral views on the uniqueness of human beings. This is exactly what Dennett tries to prove in the book and to point out that even if we remove the mysticism, there will still be beauty and space for new questions. As he claims:When we understand consciousness - when there is no more mystery - consciousness will be different, but there will still be beauty, and more room than ever for awe (Dennett 1991, pp. 25).Overall, I especially liked the book because of its new concept of consciousness, which was unconventional for the 90s of the 20th century. A possible downside to the book is that in some parts of the book, Dennett vaguely expresses his views, which may ultimately lead to Dennett's rejection of consciousness."
164,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"I was already aware of the bad fame of this book, and every time I saw it being referenced, I saw it as being referenced as a failure. As the typical saying goes ""consciousness explained away"". Nevertheless, I decided to give it a shot. I figured the bad reputation of the book was because it failed its goal and stated purpose, which was way too ambitious. But I figured I could still have a lot of value and insight into consciousness. But I was wrong. While it explained some characteristics of thought and consciousness, it didn't explain consciousness as such. I gave up and stopped reading briefly before halfway. I very rarely leave books unfinished, but I truly felt like it was a waste of time. Not only it didn't explain very much, but the writing itself is rather boring, and Dennett often shifts too laterally. While I usually appreciate this, I found it pointless and dull. I felt he often confused the validity of the experience of consciousness as phenomenology itself. The fact that your phenomenology leads you to a flawed assumption and you don't quite understand the mechanisms, doesn't in any way solve the actual problem of experiencing it, which is exactly the point. Coming up with heterophenomenology to make it more ""objective"" doesn't help very much. If it's accurate or not is almost irrelevant. Calling it a simple projection feels an equal cheap escape. This is my 2nd book from Dennett, the first being Breaking the Spell, which was similarly disappointing. I had a good impression of Dennet from a few his lectures that I watched, and after the disappointment of the first book I figured I'd give it another try, but looks like I'm fighting for a lost cause.I'm sure there are some good arguments and ideas in the book, I found the categorization of consciousness as being Orwelling or Stalinesque quite witty and useful for example, and the refutation of the Cartesian Theatre is solid, although it was beaten to death. But overall, I personally felt it wasn't worth the grinding."
165,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59307958-katy-koivastik,5,"References to consciousness in Sam Harris’ “Waking Up” reminded me of “Consciousness Explained” sitting unread in my library probably since it was first published in 1991. I decided to finally open it to see whether it would hold my interest all these years later.I earnestly powered through the first third of the book, and then pick and chose my way through the rest. There is a reason I am not a scientist, as I found the descriptions of the experiments boring, despite being written for the layman. The author does discuss the nature of memory and of the human tendency toward false and embellished memory, a topic I find unendingly fascinating. The book is peppered with quotations, and this one from novelist Ariel Dorfman on memory resonated: “I’m really not sure if others fail to perceive me or if, one fraction of a second after my face interferes with their horizon, a millionth of a second after they have cast their gaze on me, they already begin to wash me from their memory: forgotten before arriving at the scant, sad archangel of a remembrance.”I gave the book 5 stars because it is well written, includes wry cartoons, and can be understood by non-scientists. One quote from the author sums up the topic for me: “We, in contrast (to animals), are almost constantly engaged in presenting ourselves to others, and to ourselves, and hence representing ourselves — in language and gesture, external and internal. The most obvious difference in our environment that would explain this difference in our behavior is the behavior itself. Our human environment contains not just food and shelter, enemies to fight or flee, and conspecifics with whom to mate, but words, words, words. These words are potent elements of our environment that we readily incorporate, ingesting and extruding them, weaving them like spiderwebs into self-protective strings of narrative. ....when we let in these words, these meme-vehicles, they tend to take over, creating us out of the raw materials they find in our brains.”"
166,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7804740-paul,4,"Dennett's intention in this book is to defend and advance materialism, which is the idea that only matter exists, and that there are no other special things, like 'mind stuff' or the soul. The challenge which he addresses is to explain how something as complex, varied and wonderful as human consciousness could possibly originate 100% from the human brain. The subtext really should be 'Dualism Demolished', as he spends quite some time dismantling the idea that there must be some other medium or entity in which consciousness happens. As well the related idea of the 'Cartesian centre of consciousness', the idea that there is a central point in the brain where all of the senses, inputs and thinking comes together to become our consciousness.I'm a materialist myself, and as I work with computers, I don't have any objection to the idea that consciousness is some kind of 'virtual machine' that runs in the brain in a massively parallel way, which is an idea he presents. However, I must say that at times I found the book heavy going. Perhaps it's my fault that I thought the book belonged in the 'popular philosophy' category, which it certainly does not. This is a Serious Philosophical Work, and it's intended to make a Real Contribution to the science and philosophy of mind. It's chock full of references, annotations and asides. Dennett tries in every page to be as rational and scientific as possible. That's fine, but at times I found it wearing. While I agree with the broad thrust of what he's saying, there's plenty you could object to (such as the idea that you don't really experience sensory input, you only 'seem to'. Although it was published in 1991, it still felt relevant to me, due to timeless nature of the issues he addresses. Although I have no doubt that the argument has moved on a great deal since that time. Overall a great read, but not for the faint of heart."
167,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54462119-mohammadhossein-haqiqatkhah,4,"Daniel C. Dennett tends to prolixity when explaining the stuff. Although it's mainly focused on challenging Cartesian dualism, he introduces very interesting perspectives toward consciousness.All he tries to do in this book (and I believe he succeeds in it) is to suggest new metaphors to substitute the more intuitive metaphors the dualist theories provide. He digs very deeply into qualia and challenges almost every aspect of it. As he puts it:My explanation of consciousness is far from complete. One might even say that it was just a beginning, but it is a beginning, because it breaks the spell of the enchanted circle of ideas that made explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t replaced a metaphorical theory, the Cartesian Theater, with a nonmetaphorical (“literal, scientific”) theory. All I have done, really, is to replace one family of metaphors and images with another, trading in the Theater, the Witness, the Central Meaner, the Figment, for Software, Virtual Machines, Multiple Drafts, a Pandemonium of Homunculi. It’s just a war of metaphors, you say — but metaphors are not “just” metaphors; metaphors are the tools of thought. No one can think about consciousness without them, so it is important to equip yourself with the best set of tools available. Look what we have built with our tools. Could you have imagined it without them?He ends up, quite quickly, with a narrative theory of self and individual identity. It's an exotic view (let's say, journey) into the philosophy of consciousness, but it leaves many questions unaddressed. However, indeed, Consciousness Explained is a no-return point in your philosophical relationship with consciousness."
168,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"In a way Dennett feels like a curmudgeon about how the roots of the consciousness and the mind works in much the same way Richard Dawkins feels to me a curmudgeon about the roots of our biology. And just like Dawkins, I find him very convincing. Dennett is very much in line with other thinkers I've been reading like Douglas Hofstadter (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) and Michael S.A. Graziano (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) who see consciousness as an emergent property of the whole system of our brain rather than something that emerges from a single point or theater in the mind. His dialogues on the chinese room thought experiment and philosophical zombies were great on this point. There can be unconscious zombies or operators in the chinese rooms only if we propose a single theater that consciousness arises from. If we look at the larger system, it's clear that any philosophical zombie will all of the skills and insights of a human would indeed be a conscious system.This counterintuitive conclusion is something that we all seem to naturally battle because it strikes at the very nature of the self that is doing the intuiting. As Dennett wrote: ""Many people are afraid to see consciousness explained because they fear that if we succeed in explaining it, we will lose our moral bearings."" I suppose I can partially excuse some of my favorite thinkers like Yuval Noah Harari and Sam Harris for continuing to make claims that consciousness is still a fundamental mystery. I think what they mean is that we still haven't found the metaphors that allow us collectively to think about our minds in the way we think about our biology and the world around us. Dennett, in spite of his best attempt to reach a broad audience, is far too academic for my mother or my dentist and probably for me, but I'm hoping work from someone is on the way to help carry this torch."
169,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47952052-chloe-noland,3,"I'm not sure which is more convoluted: the topic of consciousness, or the author Dennett himself. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other, more mainstream styles of discussion regarding issues of science and morality, from authors like Harris and Pinker. The fact that Dennett's central thesis of this book -- deconstructing our ""intuitive"" but incorrect understanding of our conscious selves as a Cartesian witness sitting inside our brains, and replacing it with a Multiple Drafts Model of cognition that supports the way our minds truly process, adapt, & repeat in order to make conscious choices and actions -- is written in an extremely self-referential and conceited style, to the point that it distracts from the thesis itself, and weighs down a lot of Dennett's brilliant observations and theories with nods to his own superiority over his colleagues, including at least one citation to the author's other works on every other page. Basically, I wish he had just shared his ideas in a more neutral and simplistic way. The theories themselves are not hard to understand, although do require commitment to what Dennett is asking of the reader -- to put aside everything they think they understand about what consciousness is and how our minds operate. After this, it's just Dennett's world and we're living in it: in showing how our brains evolved to their current levels of complexity through a complicated process of trial and error, shaping and reshaping, layering new information on top of old, Dennett illuminates many processes of cognition that provide new and consequential insights into why we tell stories, how identities are formed, and what these narratives mean for our continuing evolution -- the least of which is that no such thing as a SELF really exists, or has ever existed. I just wish he had cut back on the running side commentary. "
170,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75618360-tien-manh,5,"What is subjective experience? When I imagine a purple cow, the purpleness ""feels"" purple to ""me"". Who is this ""me""? Dennett tackles a very difficult problem in a beautifully written work of philosophy (+a bit of cognitive science).Slowly, the author dismantles the myth of the ""Cartesian theater"", or the idea that past perception, and the parallel neural processes going on in the brain, content is ""presented"" to a fictitious viewer. There is no such ""Audience"". Thinking is thought. There is no ""central hub"" where everything ""comes together"", and Dennett introduces ""Multiple Drafts"" to give consciousness an elementary stab.Then Dennett compares consciousness as a sort of serial (illusory) program running on the parallel brain. This part I'm not super convinced about, thinking of a computer as subsystems of information processing is useful in some ways but maybe we need more models and analogies besides the Von Neumann architecture.What about the ""language"" that we think in? Dennett refutes a ""Central Meaner"", and instead replaces it with a ""Pandemonium"", multiple neural pathways in our head all having something to say.Dennett also discusses the evolution of consciousness, problems with folk psychology, Libet's experiments and temporal inference, and philosophical problems like ""In the Mind's eye"", ""Mary the scientist"", Searle's ""Chinese Room"", ""What is it like to be a bat""...There was a lot of thought provoking content in this book. The idea of the self as a ""center of narrative gravity"", an abstract concept, instead of some dualistic ""brain pearl"" was illuminating for me. Book is kinda old, probably there are more up-to-date ones, but I'd say this is still extremely well worth the time for anyone curious in the nature of the mind."
171,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74862840-cary-giese,3,"Consciousness is the ability of humans to be aware of their own mind. “I think, therefore I am,” per Rene Descartes of the 17th century, is still the prevailing understanding. The book’s author explained, in excessive detail, what was known or believed in 1991, namely a confusion of ideas from the disciplines of psychology, philosophy and science. No real progress! No advanced ideas beyond Descartes’ description since then. More theses, no consensus! It does seem that each persons consciousness is unique to them! Each of us has sole awareness of our self! Our soul?? There is an underlying belief that our human consciousness is an evolved state resulting from the creative processes of evolution. Now the question is: Can Artificial Intelligence develop consciousness through a similar creative process, to become unique, super smart “silicone individuals,” competing with humans? Wow! The question is: how can we use and manage Artificial Intelligece without it surpassing us? I need to read more updated studies to understand this more! I will if they exist, most books on the subject date to the 1980-90’s! This book provides the questions, no answers, and only speculations. Though the book is credited as the landmark start of the discussion! For that, Dennett deserves respect for providing a foundation reading!"
172,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914286-sarah,2,"I was really interested in this work for about the first 200 pages. One of the biggest drawbacks is that this text was published in 1991 (almost 30 years ago); and the author uses a lot of illustrations and arguments from the science and philosophy of artificial intelligence. That science has changed so much in the last 30 years. Also, I have no real science or philosophy background, so I found parts of this a tough go. The early chapters, when the author was trying to define consciousness were the best for me - he raised a number of ideas and issues that I found fascinating. Not only about how speech developed, but when did we start talking to ourselves? And the importance of that action. You have to think of yourself as a self to bother speaking. Not to mention, how do we hear our own voices (or our parents voices, etc) in our heads? No sound is actually being generated; yet our brain gives it to us as if playing a recording. How do you ""hear"" when you are 100 percent by passing your auditory system? Same thing with ""seeing"" things in your head. But as the book dragged on, I lost interest and felt more and more lost in his endless responses to others ideas of consciousness. In the end, he never did explain consciousness to me. I just kept falling asleep whenever I picked up this book - so I very lightly skimmed the last 200 pages and called it a day."

Dennett undoubtedly makes a thought provoking case for how we ought to look at consciousness, perhaps shaking a fair few my previously held ideas regarding the soundness of epiphenomenalism and philosophical zombies. The examples regarding tastes, and the experience of an acquired taste, as a phenomenon that changes over time versus your conscious experience of the taste of said phenomenon changing, seems quite crucial in considering the relevance of consciousness as explained via external objective measures. His last section addressing the issue of 'explaining' a phenomenon versus 'explaining away' said phenomenon was also a nice touch. I agree with his conclusion that he has at the very least started the explanation; perhaps he wouldn't have gotten so much heat for this book if he reconsidered the tense of his verbiage when drawing up a title. A simple gerund could likely have made others' perception of him and his work much more palatable, though with some further pressure, their conscious experience of his work could perhaps become acquired as well :)"

On the one hand, it’s impressive to view Dennett attempt to topple (and replace) what he views as a misinformed view of what consciousness is. Naturally, something as familiar to us as our own consciousness will carry with it a certain obviousness about the mechanisms and features of that consciousness. Dennett’s task is to show you that although you may be the observer, you don’t have a claim to infallibility over the mechanisms that produce your experience, only the effects of those mechanisms. My problem with the book was that oftentimes Dennett‘s writing seems filled with unnecessary jargon. While I understand that in a book that tries to do no less than explain consciousness there will be some requisite wordiness, I was left with the feeling that if only Dennett was a more pithy writer, his points would’ve landed with more force. Many times throughout the book I would finish a section and feel that I had missed an aspect of an argument that Dennett supposed would win me over in dramatic fashion.All this said, I enjoyed Dennett’s method and although I may still have subtle bonds to my old ways of thinking about consciousness, Dennett has done much to weaken and replace them."
175,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79330012-arthur-ryman,4,"Definitely worth the read, but not exactly what I was hoping for or what is advertised in the title. A more accurate title would be ""Consciousness Explained Away"". I am in full agreement with Dennett's basic position, namely that the brain is a computing device. However, Dennett does not explain the basic phenomenon of awareness. Rather, he substitutes the term ""dispositional state"". Disappointing. I decided to read this, and similar works, because I felt that physics lacked the conceptual vocabulary to talk about awareness, that abundantly obvious feeling that we are observers. Coincidentally, quantum mechanics, although spectacularly successful, relies on the injection of an observer to collapse superpositions of states into an actual observation. In the absence of a better explanation from Dennett and his colleagues, I'll simply tell myself that awareness is what collapsing wave functions feel like. :-)"

(the quotes are not actual quotes but my paraphrasing).It was like a constant tease, I guess to keep you hooked, while he rambled on with his filler. But after a while of this not stop filler with teases, I got fed up and put the book down. I did not even bother to skip to the end.

Then from the middle, he seemed to want to clean up for later and remove a central ""meaner"" for consciousness and describe his multiple drafts theory so that he can link up any ol' robot to a zombified human state, since there isn't one ""perfect"" setup for an human mind. Then from a negative direction cut up phenomenology and then remove qualia, which for some reason was so important for him to do, and then say we've landed somewhere in the middle, along with the robots he's described.It is a fun read with plenty of interesting pop psychology experiments.Overall, an account of what it might look like to explain consciousness away.

187,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71339698-nour-elhuda-zuraiki,3,"When I finally finished reading this book all I was thinking about is: ‘’ I wish I could have a chance of smoking pot with Dennett watching Westworld’’Here is my advice if you want to read this book and really enjoy it: first, have an open mind, yes don’t disagree from the first thing you encounter, the book is challenging and it subconsciously demands from you to unlink your intuitions about your inner experiences to wrap your head around other alternatives. Secondly, there might seem to be contradiction in the book which you’ll unravel especially when you reach the core purpose of it (chapter 5) but remember the ‘’psychoanalysis Party Game’’ when Dennett talked about in the early chapters concluding at the end: ‘’ In such a cycle, one’s current expectations and interests shape hypotheses for one’s perceptual systems to confirm or disconfirm, and a rapid sequence of such hypothesis generations and confirmations produces the ultimate product, the ongoing, updated ‘’model’’ of the world of perceived ….All we suppose is that the illusionist goes into an arbitrary confirmation mode and the victim provides the content by asking the questions’’. This is very much applied to every concept introduced in the book, for instance when Dennett mentions the thought experiment ‘’Mary the Colour Scientist’’ he presumes that your brain has made the assumption that knowing every physical fact about a colour is the same as knowing a lot about the colour. Now Dennett concludes that if Mary really did know every physical fact about a colour yellow, she will be to know what yellow is like by entirely anticipating her entire cognitive simulation and response to the stimulus.Now Dennett introduces a model for the mental processes that we call consciousness where he claims ‘’some of the most perplexing paradoxes of consciousness arise because we cling too long to a good habit of thought, a habit that usually keeps us out of trouble’’ he starts of by laying down what we need to establish to build a model he revisits Descartes Cartesian Theatre-where all the aspects of a profound experience come together to provide a unified phenomenal world- he discusses why this model cannot work by maintaining that there is no single point for which it all has to come together for central processing so he then introduces ‘’The Multiple Drafts Model’’ where According it, ‘’all varieties of perception- indeed, all varieties of thought or mental activity- are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous "" here Dennett then emphasis that this model makes the discrimination that ‘’ the brain just adjusts to the conclusion that is drawn, making the new interpretation of the information available for the modulation of subsequent behaviour’’.In conclusion, Dennett believes that instead for the consciousness to be at a single point he imagines it described as a virtual machine like a computer that is built on top of a different system, it is a linear, sequential machine that is built on top of a massively parallel structure which in this case is the brain.Now this is a very short summary of the book, of course the book is so rich with information, starting from Descartes’ Dualism and the Cartesian Theatre then explaining that there’s no Theatre in the first place to introducing many thoughts experiments to get you ready to absorb the new way of thinking about consciousness, getting a grasp on how your inner mental life might have come. It is subtly profound and valuable. It’s like Dennett looks at consciousness as the brain’s way of making sense of the world around us. For me personally it was an astonishing whole new worldview to form and just like any other worldview, it does have its complexities and assumptions but that doesn’t mean that it is not logical to consider, I suppose when I’m having this worldview of the denial of consciousness and the experience (According to Dennett) I become more of a depressed person who doesn’t seem to find meaning of anything around, having the idea that what we perceive as reality is subjective and what we think is the objective reality is only hypothetical since or senses are flawed and limited is an unescapable truth.At the end I’m only an amature philosopher, a curious human mind that like to share her views assertively yet tactfully. "
188,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37283541-fran-cavanagh,4,"This is a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain. At least, it's a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain as was understood to be the case nearly 30 years ago. Honestly, I felt Dennett's summary of the cognitive science behind perception, attention, memory and language stood up very well despite the book's age, so that isn't much of a criticism. While there have obviously been many developments in these fields since Dennett was writing, much of the same base material has been covered in my 2020-era Psychology Masters programme. This is also a great introduction to some of the key philosophical debates regarding consciousness, human and otherwise (although, as very much a non-philosopher, I'm not sure I'd be able to identify if it wasn't). I'm not sure Dennett fully marries these two strands together to put forward a fully satisfying view on the nature of human consciousness.I can get on board with Dennett's ""Multiple Drafts"" view of human perception, as far as I understand it. It's backed up by a significant body of literature in Psychology and Neuroscience that suggests that our experience of reality is a lot choppier and less constant or consistent than it appears. I can also agree, as a result, that the ""Cartesian Theatre"" and the idea of one centralised observer self doesn't make a whole lot of scientific sense. But none of this, for me, touches on the question of what the consciousness that we experience in ourselves and others actually is, or how it appears. Dennett again makes a very convincing case that our brains can be seen as effectively very complicated supercomputers, and that a non-biological supercomputer that worked exactly like the brain would be functionally indistinguishable from the brain. Dennett also puts forward fascinating points, building principally on the work of Dawkins and Levelt, about language and ideas and how these grow and propagate between our brains and across societies. There's truly a lot of fascinating and valid discussion here, and Dennett is clearly much more knowledgeable and generally intelligent than I could ever hope to be. I appreciated hearing his synthesised perspective on all of these topics. Again, though, I was still left feeling that he didn't fully explore or explain how consciousness emerges from this biological supercomputer we call the brain. The book also doesn't really directly discuss in any depth what consciousness is, how it functions, or why. This book is apparently often re-titled by its critics as ""Consciousness Explained Away"". This seems a little unfair. Dennett makes it very clear in his closing remarks that he believes that consciousness is a ""thing"". I'm just still not convinced that I understand how the mechanisms and functions and processes he describes in great detail in this book add up to the consciousness that he stresses he believes exists.The entry for Consciousness in the 1989 Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology offers a succinctly damning description: “The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings: awareness… Nothing worth reading has been written about it.” I'm not sure this book provided a counterexample to that definition, but I'm also of half a mind to believe that it's impossible for us to truly understand the nature of consciousness, at least with the scientific tools currently at our disposal. I suspect that Dennett would feel very differently about that proposition, and that there may be some fundamental definitional disconnects at play between whatever school of philosophy I fall into and the largely functionalist worldview inhabited by Dennett. An impasse I'm honestly under-equipped to fully describe. Philosophical disagreements about the nature of the subject matter aside, then, this was a really well put-together, intelligent and enjoyable read. One I expect I'll return to a lot."
189,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,3,"Following my readings on history and future of humanity, I wanted to explore the question of “what is humanity”? and why super intelligent machines lack “humanity” despite their superior intelligence? If it's not intelligence that makes us human then it must be “consciousness”, or that continuous stream of subjective experiences, feelings and emotions that flow through our brain every second of our waking hours. What exactly is it? and how does it happen is an unsolved mystery despite significant advances in neurosciences, biology, psychology and computing. Therefore, a book titled “Consciousness Explained” seemed like exactly the right book I need.This book is not my first reading on intelligence but it is the first on consciousness and I have to say it was a disappointing start, the book is overly academic and lacks the story telling convenience I got so used to that I now expect from any writer who respects their audience. It’s not my job to clean up an author’s mess and order it into concise narrative. It should be the job of the one who got paid to write in the first place. Anyway, back to consciousness. The book tries to replace the traditional view with a different view that is better supported by evidence from experimental neuroscience. The Traditional view is called the “Cartesian theater” where basically all sensory information is projected in a theater-like area of the brain that is continuously monitored by “the mind” or “the conscious soul” that is continuously issuing commands to different body parts in response to the information presented to it. This view is obviously wrong for multiple reasons, first because neuroscience can not find such area in the brain and more importantly, because this creates an infinite recursive loop of ""what, then, is the mind of that mind, ... etc?""The alternative model is the “multiple drafts” model where different but connected brain regions unconsciously and simultaneously develop several subjective experience narratives, each has a partial draft of the story and some even have a plan for action, however, these competing experiences get filtered by higher level brain areas (probably in the frontal cortex) that decide which narrative/plan of action should get the highest priority based on millions of years of natural selection design followed by several years of cultural training in the surrounding environment. This explains why conscious experience of all humans is genetically sensitive to snakes, the color red, and vertical symmetry (faces) while each human culture is sensitive to specific environmental memes like jokes, beliefs and local common sense.The evidence for this model comes in two variants: (1) logical: because a virtual machine of consciousness that is made up of several subconscious components escapes the recursive flaw of the Cartesian theater model. (2) It has been proven recently by neuroscience that decisions are made in the brain a few milliseconds BEFORE we become “conscious” of making them, and not the other way around.At the end, I don't think I have a satisfactory understanding of consciousness, but to have my consciousness explained in just one book was an audacious goal in the first place. The book, although useful, could have been written in a much better way and could have left out so many useless details. So, if interested in consciousness, wait till I find you a better book to read."
190,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060524-robert-fischer,4,"Rhetorically, this book is a masterpiece. Without a doubt, Dennett is a master of the persuasive argument, and he pulls out all the stops here: see the gradual shifts in word choice (""the familiar Cartesian Theater"" at the beginning morphs by the end into ""our old nemesis, the Cartesian Theater""), very carefully chosen metaphorical models in order to pull in all kinds of technological magic, the way he performs a mea culpa without actually admitting guilt near the end of the book, and prevalent rhetorical questions and blanket declarations to mask over the places where things are most awkward. It's really well done. If it weren't for the theoretical issues (really, one major theoretical issue), this would easily be a 5 star book. It is both rigorous yet accessible, and it is a wonderfully enjoyable exploration of consciousness and its limitations. The book has a lot to teach people about their own self-experience, even (and especially!) those who aren't prone to agree with him (such as me). To borrow a term Dennett uses to describe a fellow philosopher's work, this book is an ""instructive failure"". It's definitely worth your time to read.I read this book, however, with a particular question in mind: when I see something in my mind's eye, where does that image reside? (Note that I have a vivid mind's eye — some people don't even have a mind's eye at all, and don't even know they're missing one! See this Discover article for more.) This book was referred to me because it was apparently a solid materialist argument and explanation. Unfortunately, Dennett simply doesn't have an answer for that question. His rhetoric obscures that fact very well (although he cops to side-stepping questions of ""the nature of things"" in Appendix A), but ultimately he takes a functionalist approach, and that handily does away with the very evidence which I was looking for him to explain.To see how this happens, it is first necessary to realize that we can't actually prove anyone else is conscious in the same sense we are. As was popularized in The Matrix, we could be dreaming and not realizing it, and everyone else could be projections of our own consciousness. Like in A Beautiful Mind (SPOILER ALERT), we could be populating our experience with non-existent people. No test proves anything more than the fact that it is a very clever illusion or bit of calculation going on — but, ultimately, our own consciousness is uniquely experienced by us. Everyone else could be a zombie (in the philosophical sense), and we have no way to know differently. This is not the point Dennett starts with, but it's implicit within Dennett's functionalist approach. The move Dennett makes is to then project that back on to us, and say that we, too, have no consciousness in any real sense. How could you prove differently to anyone else? What objectively accessible function can you perform as a conscious entity which these potentially unconscious entities could not?The problem is that the experience of having consciousness — not just computational complexity or a narrative world, but some ""audience in a Cartesian Theater"" — is not simply a ""doctrine"" (that word choice is a great example of Dennett's excellent and subtle rhetorical moves), but stems from evidence. It's not functional-objective evidence, but it is evidence none the less. That evidence is the experience of having consciousness. As much as you chip away at what the consciousness is and does (and Dennett does that excellently), there is always still an ""I"" which is having the experience. That's the whole point of Descartes, and Dennett simply does not feel the need to account for it, instead presenting the epistemological limitations of his ""heterophenomonology"" as ontological statements. But a map is not the territory, and a scientific model is not the thing itself. Simply because heterophenomonology cannot take with subjective evidence seriously does not mean that subjective evidence should not be taken seriously. This point is very poetically (and popularly) driven home in Nature, Man and Woman, and Dennett is aware of it, but simply dismisses it as not relevant. If you read through my progress in this book, you'll see lots of places where those dismissals are explicitly identified, because they drove me nuts. (Here's an example.)To a certain extent, though, he is right: phenomonology is not relevant within the context of science, where heterophenomenology is sufficient. As a text in cognitive science, Dennett's approach is really insightful and makes many challenging points. In the world of philosophy, though, the phenomonology needs to be accounted for. It's not philosophically sufficient to assume an air of ""anthropological"" condescension towards at least our own phenomonology — that's discounting a vital piece of evidence without basis, and if it cannot be accounted for, then consciousness (at least our own consciousness) is insufficiently explained. Dennett claims that consciousness is just an illusion — but who is perceiving the illusion? If it is a deception, who is being deceived? That claim is actually begging the question, and Dennett responds by retreating to functionalism, and saying it is our memories that are being deceived. But I do not simply remember being conscious — I am conscious of being conscious! But that sentence doesn't even make sense in the functionalist conception. But Dennett seems to be paraphrasing Groucho Marx: ""Who are you going to believe? Me or your own mind's eye?""It is notable at this point, though, to mention that the kind of ""anthropological"" condescension Dennett advocates has actually come under an extreme kind of fire as a Eurocentric and fundamentally racist pattern of thought which results not in real knowledge, but more in generating a hybrid of European presumptions and European interpretative ""data"". For more on this point, see Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference. I bring this up because so much of the argumentation feels like 19th century thinking, not 21st century thinking, and the model Dennett proposes reads more like an artifact of philosophy's own artifices and methodologies than an account of reality. Appeals to the specialness of language (strictly conceived), to Newtonian physics, and conflations between non-materialism and dualism really reinforce that sense.On top of all of this, Dennett builds heavily upon ideas of evolutionary psychology and memes, which are roundly destroyed as non-scientific materialistic doctrines in The Spiritual Brain: A Neuroscientist's Case for the Existence of the Soul. There is also some significant ethological (""animal-psychological"") claims about the communication and cognition of animals which are simply empirically wrong given research done by people like Marc Bekoff. And the idea that we could have immortality by ""copying our brain's software"" is not very comforting to this particular copy (a point made well in The Prestige). There is no serious engagement with psi or spirituality, as though they are self-evidently irrelevant to discussions of consciousness.With all these complaints, however, the book still gets 4 stars. It's definitely worth a read, and it is really an eye-opening revelation of just how complicated the apparently simple idea of ""the conscious mind"" really is. Highly suggested."
191,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260292-erik,2,"2091: one hundred years ago philosophers wrote books using words like ""consciousness,"" ""qualia,"" ""functionalism,"" ""materialism,"" and ""zombie,"" words which have since been banned for the sake of the public good. You see philosophers, without actually asking themselves what these words meant, used to debate with each other by filling the blanks in arguments with these words and moving them around like rebus tiles, inventing more and more recondite scenarios for their use and claiming to refute their opponents with sheer tour de force applications of logic. I think you can see why someone had to put a stop to this.More seriously, it does seem uncontroversial to me that the neurons underlying color perception and other sensations can be affected by further causal relations to judgments and object perceptions (it has been known for more than 100 years!). Does this mean sensations are simply a network of discriminatory judgments and their concreteness an illusion of being embedded in a network of such judgments? No because they are realized by the effective physical powers expressed in the sensations. It is probably true that a space of colors could be simulated in a machine or even a computer program. For example if a machine were charged with navigating a space of numbered points and could carry out rotations, translations etc. on these points and if the machine had a way of specifying its own position in the manifold and representations of the other points and distances and directions, it would make sense to say the machine carries an internal representation that would ""seem to it like living in a space."" Why not? But the physical realization would matter too. It isn't just the structure that matters but the stuff too. If the color space were navigated by a color observer then certainly I could buy the idea that the representation would seem to it like sensing (its own) colors. But the same colors as those expressed by the physics of the human brain? Doubtful, unless the relevant physical realization was exactly duplicated, by electrical -chemical signals for example. The idea that the sensations are nothing but an artifact of being in a certain representation regardless of how it is realized, this seems to ignore the fact that the physical realization must matter too. Proof: take two such realizations and let them interact in one big representation. Because the causal roles of the materials are different those differences also have further causal roles in relation to each other and would be manifested as such, so the non-identity would be revealed immediately. Dennett claims that if discriminatory judgments are divorced from their qualitative appearance this leads to absurdity, but how can these roles be separated at all if sensations are also physical and if their qualitative appearance is a result of their configured causal powers? By separating them you are leaving out some of their causal roles and the thought experiment is impossible. He doesn't even consider any of this. I'm not impartial to this discussion (see my Realistic Empiricism) but the concrete physical reality of sensation seems hard to deny if it is there in the cells."
192,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,4,"I saw a quote somewhere (in a David Chalmers book but not by Chalmers himself) that basically pointed out that the fact that we are conscious beings means that we've never really said anything of interest about consciousness. It's both so obvious as to be self-evident, and yet so ineffable that it can't be spoken about clearly. This double-edged sword is what Dennett tackles. He wants to challenge the view that conscious is this thing that we known intrinsically from a first-person perspective, whilst also undermining any claim that it cannot be spoken about clearly. What is required is a rethinking of the very assumptions we make about our conscious minds in light of what we discover from everything from neuroscience to AI, from anthropology to zoology, and start to shut down the Cartesian Theatre once and for all.The results are a mixed bag. Dennett's eye for detail, need to make sure you've fully understood every nuance of his point and dedication to defending himself against any predicted counter-argument mean that the book is immense, long and quite a slog. This is partly where my criticism of the text emerges. For a book of popular philosophy combined with popular science, this is dense and detailed. It isn't a simple overview of his key ideas that any engrossed reader can follow up afterwards. He covers every angle, every philosophical nook and cranny, until he feels he has exhausted the discussion. On the other hand, the book is so filled with simplifications, metaphors, ""intuition pumps"" and reader-friendly summaries that any one who is reading it for academic reasons may feel a little undernourished. The big question is: who is this book for? With that aside, I found the book entertaining and engaging. The sheer volume of the text means it takes quite a while to get through it all, and one chapter at a time is more than enough. There's little chance of readers ploughing through this at speed because they can't wait to see what happens next. However, there is a payoff. In later chapters, the painfully long analysis of the early sections start to reappear and the relevance of everything starts to look more like a coherent theory than a series of musings on what things might be like if we take the time to think about them differently. This is rewarding due to the effort that has to be put in during the early stages of the book. It took me nearly 3 months to read it because it wasn't the book I thought it would be. I thought this was a handy overview of his ideas in a digestible form. It wasn't. Or rather it was, but in such gargantuan amounts of prose that it took me a while to churn through it, and bedtime reading became a non-starter. I still enjoyed it. It was still worth the effort, but had I not been in the mood to tackle it, I would have given up sooner. "
193,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99056689-katyen,4,"Daniel Dennett's book ""Consciousness Explained"" is currently one of the classic books on consciousness. In addition, it is one of the most important Dennett books he has ever written. I can also consider Daniel Dennett to be one of the most important representatives of contemporary philosophy of mind. The views he presents in the book are in many cases conservative and provocative, which was part of Dennett's goal, and this book has provoked much discussion, criticism, indignation, but also appreciation.Most critics accused Dennett of either not explaining consciousness in the book at all or rejecting it altogether. None of these views is true, on the contrary, Dennett tries to explain consciousness, but in a completely different way. Dennett does not try to say directly what consciousness is, but rather what consciousness does. Related to this is his rejection of the famous ""hard problem of consciousness"" and his replacement by the ""hard question"", which reads: And then what happens? (Dennett 1991, p. 255). In the book, he tries to explain and to some extent also summarize the knowledge about the brain from the cognitive sciences and neurosciences so far. Dennett himself is not only a philosopher but also a cognitive scientist, and even today he is actively involved in discussions of consciousness. The aim of the book is not so much to explain consciousness as to demystify it. That is, to point out that consciousness is a natural phenomenon in nature that arose during an evolutionary process that lasted millions of years. The fact that most authors consider consciousness to be mysterious and exceptional is more related to moral views on the uniqueness of human beings. This is exactly what Dennett tries to prove in the book and to point out that even if we remove the mysticism, there will still be beauty and space for new questions. As he claims:When we understand consciousness - when there is no more mystery - consciousness will be different, but there will still be beauty, and more room than ever for awe (Dennett 1991, pp. 25).Overall, I especially liked the book because of its new concept of consciousness, which was unconventional for the 90s of the 20th century. A possible downside to the book is that in some parts of the book, Dennett vaguely expresses his views, which may ultimately lead to Dennett's rejection of consciousness."
194,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"I was already aware of the bad fame of this book, and every time I saw it being referenced, I saw it as being referenced as a failure. As the typical saying goes ""consciousness explained away"". Nevertheless, I decided to give it a shot. I figured the bad reputation of the book was because it failed its goal and stated purpose, which was way too ambitious. But I figured I could still have a lot of value and insight into consciousness. But I was wrong. While it explained some characteristics of thought and consciousness, it didn't explain consciousness as such. I gave up and stopped reading briefly before halfway. I very rarely leave books unfinished, but I truly felt like it was a waste of time. Not only it didn't explain very much, but the writing itself is rather boring, and Dennett often shifts too laterally. While I usually appreciate this, I found it pointless and dull. I felt he often confused the validity of the experience of consciousness as phenomenology itself. The fact that your phenomenology leads you to a flawed assumption and you don't quite understand the mechanisms, doesn't in any way solve the actual problem of experiencing it, which is exactly the point. Coming up with heterophenomenology to make it more ""objective"" doesn't help very much. If it's accurate or not is almost irrelevant. Calling it a simple projection feels an equal cheap escape. This is my 2nd book from Dennett, the first being Breaking the Spell, which was similarly disappointing. I had a good impression of Dennet from a few his lectures that I watched, and after the disappointment of the first book I figured I'd give it another try, but looks like I'm fighting for a lost cause.I'm sure there are some good arguments and ideas in the book, I found the categorization of consciousness as being Orwelling or Stalinesque quite witty and useful for example, and the refutation of the Cartesian Theatre is solid, although it was beaten to death. But overall, I personally felt it wasn't worth the grinding."
195,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59307958-katy-koivastik,5,"References to consciousness in Sam Harris’ “Waking Up” reminded me of “Consciousness Explained” sitting unread in my library probably since it was first published in 1991. I decided to finally open it to see whether it would hold my interest all these years later.I earnestly powered through the first third of the book, and then pick and chose my way through the rest. There is a reason I am not a scientist, as I found the descriptions of the experiments boring, despite being written for the layman. The author does discuss the nature of memory and of the human tendency toward false and embellished memory, a topic I find unendingly fascinating. The book is peppered with quotations, and this one from novelist Ariel Dorfman on memory resonated: “I’m really not sure if others fail to perceive me or if, one fraction of a second after my face interferes with their horizon, a millionth of a second after they have cast their gaze on me, they already begin to wash me from their memory: forgotten before arriving at the scant, sad archangel of a remembrance.”I gave the book 5 stars because it is well written, includes wry cartoons, and can be understood by non-scientists. One quote from the author sums up the topic for me: “We, in contrast (to animals), are almost constantly engaged in presenting ourselves to others, and to ourselves, and hence representing ourselves — in language and gesture, external and internal. The most obvious difference in our environment that would explain this difference in our behavior is the behavior itself. Our human environment contains not just food and shelter, enemies to fight or flee, and conspecifics with whom to mate, but words, words, words. These words are potent elements of our environment that we readily incorporate, ingesting and extruding them, weaving them like spiderwebs into self-protective strings of narrative. ....when we let in these words, these meme-vehicles, they tend to take over, creating us out of the raw materials they find in our brains.”"
196,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7804740-paul,4,"Dennett's intention in this book is to defend and advance materialism, which is the idea that only matter exists, and that there are no other special things, like 'mind stuff' or the soul. The challenge which he addresses is to explain how something as complex, varied and wonderful as human consciousness could possibly originate 100% from the human brain. The subtext really should be 'Dualism Demolished', as he spends quite some time dismantling the idea that there must be some other medium or entity in which consciousness happens. As well the related idea of the 'Cartesian centre of consciousness', the idea that there is a central point in the brain where all of the senses, inputs and thinking comes together to become our consciousness.I'm a materialist myself, and as I work with computers, I don't have any objection to the idea that consciousness is some kind of 'virtual machine' that runs in the brain in a massively parallel way, which is an idea he presents. However, I must say that at times I found the book heavy going. Perhaps it's my fault that I thought the book belonged in the 'popular philosophy' category, which it certainly does not. This is a Serious Philosophical Work, and it's intended to make a Real Contribution to the science and philosophy of mind. It's chock full of references, annotations and asides. Dennett tries in every page to be as rational and scientific as possible. That's fine, but at times I found it wearing. While I agree with the broad thrust of what he's saying, there's plenty you could object to (such as the idea that you don't really experience sensory input, you only 'seem to'. Although it was published in 1991, it still felt relevant to me, due to timeless nature of the issues he addresses. Although I have no doubt that the argument has moved on a great deal since that time. Overall a great read, but not for the faint of heart."
197,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54462119-mohammadhossein-haqiqatkhah,4,"Daniel C. Dennett tends to prolixity when explaining the stuff. Although it's mainly focused on challenging Cartesian dualism, he introduces very interesting perspectives toward consciousness.All he tries to do in this book (and I believe he succeeds in it) is to suggest new metaphors to substitute the more intuitive metaphors the dualist theories provide. He digs very deeply into qualia and challenges almost every aspect of it. As he puts it:My explanation of consciousness is far from complete. One might even say that it was just a beginning, but it is a beginning, because it breaks the spell of the enchanted circle of ideas that made explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t replaced a metaphorical theory, the Cartesian Theater, with a nonmetaphorical (“literal, scientific”) theory. All I have done, really, is to replace one family of metaphors and images with another, trading in the Theater, the Witness, the Central Meaner, the Figment, for Software, Virtual Machines, Multiple Drafts, a Pandemonium of Homunculi. It’s just a war of metaphors, you say — but metaphors are not “just” metaphors; metaphors are the tools of thought. No one can think about consciousness without them, so it is important to equip yourself with the best set of tools available. Look what we have built with our tools. Could you have imagined it without them?He ends up, quite quickly, with a narrative theory of self and individual identity. It's an exotic view (let's say, journey) into the philosophy of consciousness, but it leaves many questions unaddressed. However, indeed, Consciousness Explained is a no-return point in your philosophical relationship with consciousness."
198,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"In a way Dennett feels like a curmudgeon about how the roots of the consciousness and the mind works in much the same way Richard Dawkins feels to me a curmudgeon about the roots of our biology. And just like Dawkins, I find him very convincing. Dennett is very much in line with other thinkers I've been reading like Douglas Hofstadter (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) and Michael S.A. Graziano (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) who see consciousness as an emergent property of the whole system of our brain rather than something that emerges from a single point or theater in the mind. His dialogues on the chinese room thought experiment and philosophical zombies were great on this point. There can be unconscious zombies or operators in the chinese rooms only if we propose a single theater that consciousness arises from. If we look at the larger system, it's clear that any philosophical zombie will all of the skills and insights of a human would indeed be a conscious system.This counterintuitive conclusion is something that we all seem to naturally battle because it strikes at the very nature of the self that is doing the intuiting. As Dennett wrote: ""Many people are afraid to see consciousness explained because they fear that if we succeed in explaining it, we will lose our moral bearings."" I suppose I can partially excuse some of my favorite thinkers like Yuval Noah Harari and Sam Harris for continuing to make claims that consciousness is still a fundamental mystery. I think what they mean is that we still haven't found the metaphors that allow us collectively to think about our minds in the way we think about our biology and the world around us. Dennett, in spite of his best attempt to reach a broad audience, is far too academic for my mother or my dentist and probably for me, but I'm hoping work from someone is on the way to help carry this torch."
199,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47952052-chloe-noland,3,"I'm not sure which is more convoluted: the topic of consciousness, or the author Dennett himself. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other, more mainstream styles of discussion regarding issues of science and morality, from authors like Harris and Pinker. The fact that Dennett's central thesis of this book -- deconstructing our ""intuitive"" but incorrect understanding of our conscious selves as a Cartesian witness sitting inside our brains, and replacing it with a Multiple Drafts Model of cognition that supports the way our minds truly process, adapt, & repeat in order to make conscious choices and actions -- is written in an extremely self-referential and conceited style, to the point that it distracts from the thesis itself, and weighs down a lot of Dennett's brilliant observations and theories with nods to his own superiority over his colleagues, including at least one citation to the author's other works on every other page. Basically, I wish he had just shared his ideas in a more neutral and simplistic way. The theories themselves are not hard to understand, although do require commitment to what Dennett is asking of the reader -- to put aside everything they think they understand about what consciousness is and how our minds operate. After this, it's just Dennett's world and we're living in it: in showing how our brains evolved to their current levels of complexity through a complicated process of trial and error, shaping and reshaping, layering new information on top of old, Dennett illuminates many processes of cognition that provide new and consequential insights into why we tell stories, how identities are formed, and what these narratives mean for our continuing evolution -- the least of which is that no such thing as a SELF really exists, or has ever existed. I just wish he had cut back on the running side commentary. "

Dennett tackles a very difficult problem in a beautifully written work of philosophy (+a bit of cognitive science).Slowly, the author dismantles the myth of the ""Cartesian theater"", or the idea that past perception, and the parallel neural processes going on in the brain, content is ""presented"" to a fictitious viewer. There is no such ""Audience"". Thinking is thought. There is no ""central hub"" where everything ""comes together"", and Dennett introduces ""Multiple Drafts"" to give consciousness an elementary stab.Then Dennett compares consciousness as a sort of serial (illusory) program running on the parallel brain. This part I'm not super convinced about, thinking of a computer as subsystems of information processing is useful in some ways but maybe we need more models and analogies besides the Von Neumann architecture.What about the ""language"" that we think in? Dennett refutes a ""Central Meaner"", and instead replaces it with a ""Pandemonium"", multiple neural pathways in our head all having something to say.Dennett also discusses the evolution of consciousness, problems with folk psychology, Libet's experiments and temporal inference, and philosophical problems like ""In the Mind's eye"", ""Mary the scientist"", Searle's ""Chinese Room"", ""What is it like to be a bat""...There was a lot of thought provoking content in this book. The idea of the self as a ""center of narrative gravity"", an abstract concept, instead of some dualistic ""brain pearl"" was illuminating for me. Book is kinda old, probably there are more up-to-date ones, but I'd say this is still extremely well worth the time for anyone curious in the nature of the mind."
201,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74862840-cary-giese,3,"Consciousness is the ability of humans to be aware of their own mind. “I think, therefore I am,” per Rene Descartes of the 17th century, is still the prevailing understanding. The book’s author explained, in excessive detail, what was known or believed in 1991, namely a confusion of ideas from the disciplines of psychology, philosophy and science. No real progress! No advanced ideas beyond Descartes’ description since then. More theses, no consensus! It does seem that each persons consciousness is unique to them! Each of us has sole awareness of our self! Our soul?? There is an underlying belief that our human consciousness is an evolved state resulting from the creative processes of evolution. Now the question is: Can Artificial Intelligence develop consciousness through a similar creative process, to become unique, super smart “silicone individuals,” competing with humans? Wow! The question is: how can we use and manage Artificial Intelligece without it surpassing us? I need to read more updated studies to understand this more! I will if they exist, most books on the subject date to the 1980-90’s! This book provides the questions, no answers, and only speculations. Though the book is credited as the landmark start of the discussion! For that, Dennett deserves respect for providing a foundation reading!"
202,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914286-sarah,2,"I was really interested in this work for about the first 200 pages. One of the biggest drawbacks is that this text was published in 1991 (almost 30 years ago); and the author uses a lot of illustrations and arguments from the science and philosophy of artificial intelligence. That science has changed so much in the last 30 years. Also, I have no real science or philosophy background, so I found parts of this a tough go. The early chapters, when the author was trying to define consciousness were the best for me - he raised a number of ideas and issues that I found fascinating. Not only about how speech developed, but when did we start talking to ourselves? And the importance of that action. You have to think of yourself as a self to bother speaking. Not to mention, how do we hear our own voices (or our parents voices, etc) in our heads? No sound is actually being generated; yet our brain gives it to us as if playing a recording. How do you ""hear"" when you are 100 percent by passing your auditory system? Same thing with ""seeing"" things in your head. But as the book dragged on, I lost interest and felt more and more lost in his endless responses to others ideas of consciousness. In the end, he never did explain consciousness to me. I just kept falling asleep whenever I picked up this book - so I very lightly skimmed the last 200 pages and called it a day."

Dennett undoubtedly makes a thought provoking case for how we ought to look at consciousness, perhaps shaking a fair few my previously held ideas regarding the soundness of epiphenomenalism and philosophical zombies. The examples regarding tastes, and the experience of an acquired taste, as a phenomenon that changes over time versus your conscious experience of the taste of said phenomenon changing, seems quite crucial in considering the relevance of consciousness as explained via external objective measures. His last section addressing the issue of 'explaining' a phenomenon versus 'explaining away' said phenomenon was also a nice touch. I agree with his conclusion that he has at the very least started the explanation; perhaps he wouldn't have gotten so much heat for this book if he reconsidered the tense of his verbiage when drawing up a title. A simple gerund could likely have made others' perception of him and his work much more palatable, though with some further pressure, their conscious experience of his work could perhaps become acquired as well :)"
204,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21625655-chase-mcclendon,4,"I was between 3 and 4 stars on this book. On the one hand, it’s impressive to view Dennett attempt to topple (and replace) what he views as a misinformed view of what consciousness is. Naturally, something as familiar to us as our own consciousness will carry with it a certain obviousness about the mechanisms and features of that consciousness. Dennett’s task is to show you that although you may be the observer, you don’t have a claim to infallibility over the mechanisms that produce your experience, only the effects of those mechanisms. My problem with the book was that oftentimes Dennett‘s writing seems filled with unnecessary jargon. While I understand that in a book that tries to do no less than explain consciousness there will be some requisite wordiness, I was left with the feeling that if only Dennett was a more pithy writer, his points would’ve landed with more force. Many times throughout the book I would finish a section and feel that I had missed an aspect of an argument that Dennett supposed would win me over in dramatic fashion.All this said, I enjoyed Dennett’s method and although I may still have subtle bonds to my old ways of thinking about consciousness, Dennett has done much to weaken and replace them."
205,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79330012-arthur-ryman,4,"Definitely worth the read, but not exactly what I was hoping for or what is advertised in the title. A more accurate title would be ""Consciousness Explained Away"". I am in full agreement with Dennett's basic position, namely that the brain is a computing device. However, Dennett does not explain the basic phenomenon of awareness. Rather, he substitutes the term ""dispositional state"". Disappointing. I decided to read this, and similar works, because I felt that physics lacked the conceptual vocabulary to talk about awareness, that abundantly obvious feeling that we are observers. Coincidentally, quantum mechanics, although spectacularly successful, relies on the injection of an observer to collapse superpositions of states into an actual observation. In the absence of a better explanation from Dennett and his colleagues, I'll simply tell myself that awareness is what collapsing wave functions feel like. :-)"

(the quotes are not actual quotes but my paraphrasing).It was like a constant tease, I guess to keep you hooked, while he rambled on with his filler.

Then from the middle, he seemed to want to clean up for later and remove a central ""meaner"" for consciousness and describe his multiple drafts theory so that he can link up any ol' robot to a zombified human state, since there isn't one ""perfect"" setup for an human mind. Then from a negative direction cut up phenomenology and then remove qualia, which for some reason was so important for him to do, and then say we've landed somewhere in the middle, along with the robots he's described.It is a fun read with plenty of interesting pop psychology experiments.Overall, an account of what it might look like to explain consciousness away.

It's hard to argue with someone as smart as Dennett, he sets traps, finds the perfect arguments, and is just so undeniably smarter and prepared than any of us, which is one of the reasons why I have to remain slightly skeptical about his final premise.He has succeeded in making me see his argument, and though it still remains closer to a philosophical one than a scientific one, it's the best one I've heard so far and the one that explains consciousness the best while not falling for metaphysical interpretations at all.Great book.

217,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71339698-nour-elhuda-zuraiki,3,"When I finally finished reading this book all I was thinking about is: ‘’ I wish I could have a chance of smoking pot with Dennett watching Westworld’’Here is my advice if you want to read this book and really enjoy it: first, have an open mind, yes don’t disagree from the first thing you encounter, the book is challenging and it subconsciously demands from you to unlink your intuitions about your inner experiences to wrap your head around other alternatives. Secondly, there might seem to be contradiction in the book which you’ll unravel especially when you reach the core purpose of it (chapter 5) but remember the ‘’psychoanalysis Party Game’’ when Dennett talked about in the early chapters concluding at the end: ‘’ In such a cycle, one’s current expectations and interests shape hypotheses for one’s perceptual systems to confirm or disconfirm, and a rapid sequence of such hypothesis generations and confirmations produces the ultimate product, the ongoing, updated ‘’model’’ of the world of perceived ….All we suppose is that the illusionist goes into an arbitrary confirmation mode and the victim provides the content by asking the questions’’. This is very much applied to every concept introduced in the book, for instance when Dennett mentions the thought experiment ‘’Mary the Colour Scientist’’ he presumes that your brain has made the assumption that knowing every physical fact about a colour is the same as knowing a lot about the colour. Now Dennett concludes that if Mary really did know every physical fact about a colour yellow, she will be to know what yellow is like by entirely anticipating her entire cognitive simulation and response to the stimulus.Now Dennett introduces a model for the mental processes that we call consciousness where he claims ‘’some of the most perplexing paradoxes of consciousness arise because we cling too long to a good habit of thought, a habit that usually keeps us out of trouble’’ he starts of by laying down what we need to establish to build a model he revisits Descartes Cartesian Theatre-where all the aspects of a profound experience come together to provide a unified phenomenal world- he discusses why this model cannot work by maintaining that there is no single point for which it all has to come together for central processing so he then introduces ‘’The Multiple Drafts Model’’ where According it, ‘’all varieties of perception- indeed, all varieties of thought or mental activity- are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous "" here Dennett then emphasis that this model makes the discrimination that ‘’ the brain just adjusts to the conclusion that is drawn, making the new interpretation of the information available for the modulation of subsequent behaviour’’.In conclusion, Dennett believes that instead for the consciousness to be at a single point he imagines it described as a virtual machine like a computer that is built on top of a different system, it is a linear, sequential machine that is built on top of a massively parallel structure which in this case is the brain.Now this is a very short summary of the book, of course the book is so rich with information, starting from Descartes’ Dualism and the Cartesian Theatre then explaining that there’s no Theatre in the first place to introducing many thoughts experiments to get you ready to absorb the new way of thinking about consciousness, getting a grasp on how your inner mental life might have come. It is subtly profound and valuable. It’s like Dennett looks at consciousness as the brain’s way of making sense of the world around us. For me personally it was an astonishing whole new worldview to form and just like any other worldview, it does have its complexities and assumptions but that doesn’t mean that it is not logical to consider, I suppose when I’m having this worldview of the denial of consciousness and the experience (According to Dennett) I become more of a depressed person who doesn’t seem to find meaning of anything around, having the idea that what we perceive as reality is subjective and what we think is the objective reality is only hypothetical since or senses are flawed and limited is an unescapable truth.At the end I’m only an amature philosopher, a curious human mind that like to share her views assertively yet tactfully. "
218,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37283541-fran-cavanagh,4,"This is a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain. At least, it's a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain as was understood to be the case nearly 30 years ago. Honestly, I felt Dennett's summary of the cognitive science behind perception, attention, memory and language stood up very well despite the book's age, so that isn't much of a criticism. While there have obviously been many developments in these fields since Dennett was writing, much of the same base material has been covered in my 2020-era Psychology Masters programme. This is also a great introduction to some of the key philosophical debates regarding consciousness, human and otherwise (although, as very much a non-philosopher, I'm not sure I'd be able to identify if it wasn't). I'm not sure Dennett fully marries these two strands together to put forward a fully satisfying view on the nature of human consciousness.I can get on board with Dennett's ""Multiple Drafts"" view of human perception, as far as I understand it. It's backed up by a significant body of literature in Psychology and Neuroscience that suggests that our experience of reality is a lot choppier and less constant or consistent than it appears. I can also agree, as a result, that the ""Cartesian Theatre"" and the idea of one centralised observer self doesn't make a whole lot of scientific sense. But none of this, for me, touches on the question of what the consciousness that we experience in ourselves and others actually is, or how it appears. Dennett again makes a very convincing case that our brains can be seen as effectively very complicated supercomputers, and that a non-biological supercomputer that worked exactly like the brain would be functionally indistinguishable from the brain. Dennett also puts forward fascinating points, building principally on the work of Dawkins and Levelt, about language and ideas and how these grow and propagate between our brains and across societies. There's truly a lot of fascinating and valid discussion here, and Dennett is clearly much more knowledgeable and generally intelligent than I could ever hope to be. I appreciated hearing his synthesised perspective on all of these topics. Again, though, I was still left feeling that he didn't fully explore or explain how consciousness emerges from this biological supercomputer we call the brain. The book also doesn't really directly discuss in any depth what consciousness is, how it functions, or why. This book is apparently often re-titled by its critics as ""Consciousness Explained Away"". This seems a little unfair. Dennett makes it very clear in his closing remarks that he believes that consciousness is a ""thing"". I'm just still not convinced that I understand how the mechanisms and functions and processes he describes in great detail in this book add up to the consciousness that he stresses he believes exists.The entry for Consciousness in the 1989 Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology offers a succinctly damning description: “The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings: awareness… Nothing worth reading has been written about it.” I'm not sure this book provided a counterexample to that definition, but I'm also of half a mind to believe that it's impossible for us to truly understand the nature of consciousness, at least with the scientific tools currently at our disposal. I suspect that Dennett would feel very differently about that proposition, and that there may be some fundamental definitional disconnects at play between whatever school of philosophy I fall into and the largely functionalist worldview inhabited by Dennett. An impasse I'm honestly under-equipped to fully describe. Philosophical disagreements about the nature of the subject matter aside, then, this was a really well put-together, intelligent and enjoyable read. One I expect I'll return to a lot."
219,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,3,"Following my readings on history and future of humanity, I wanted to explore the question of “what is humanity”? and why super intelligent machines lack “humanity” despite their superior intelligence? If it's not intelligence that makes us human then it must be “consciousness”, or that continuous stream of subjective experiences, feelings and emotions that flow through our brain every second of our waking hours. What exactly is it? and how does it happen is an unsolved mystery despite significant advances in neurosciences, biology, psychology and computing. Therefore, a book titled “Consciousness Explained” seemed like exactly the right book I need.This book is not my first reading on intelligence but it is the first on consciousness and I have to say it was a disappointing start, the book is overly academic and lacks the story telling convenience I got so used to that I now expect from any writer who respects their audience. It’s not my job to clean up an author’s mess and order it into concise narrative. It should be the job of the one who got paid to write in the first place. Anyway, back to consciousness. The book tries to replace the traditional view with a different view that is better supported by evidence from experimental neuroscience. The Traditional view is called the “Cartesian theater” where basically all sensory information is projected in a theater-like area of the brain that is continuously monitored by “the mind” or “the conscious soul” that is continuously issuing commands to different body parts in response to the information presented to it. This view is obviously wrong for multiple reasons, first because neuroscience can not find such area in the brain and more importantly, because this creates an infinite recursive loop of ""what, then, is the mind of that mind, ... etc?""The alternative model is the “multiple drafts” model where different but connected brain regions unconsciously and simultaneously develop several subjective experience narratives, each has a partial draft of the story and some even have a plan for action, however, these competing experiences get filtered by higher level brain areas (probably in the frontal cortex) that decide which narrative/plan of action should get the highest priority based on millions of years of natural selection design followed by several years of cultural training in the surrounding environment. This explains why conscious experience of all humans is genetically sensitive to snakes, the color red, and vertical symmetry (faces) while each human culture is sensitive to specific environmental memes like jokes, beliefs and local common sense.The evidence for this model comes in two variants: (1) logical: because a virtual machine of consciousness that is made up of several subconscious components escapes the recursive flaw of the Cartesian theater model. (2) It has been proven recently by neuroscience that decisions are made in the brain a few milliseconds BEFORE we become “conscious” of making them, and not the other way around.At the end, I don't think I have a satisfactory understanding of consciousness, but to have my consciousness explained in just one book was an audacious goal in the first place. The book, although useful, could have been written in a much better way and could have left out so many useless details. So, if interested in consciousness, wait till I find you a better book to read."
220,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060524-robert-fischer,4,"Rhetorically, this book is a masterpiece. Without a doubt, Dennett is a master of the persuasive argument, and he pulls out all the stops here: see the gradual shifts in word choice (""the familiar Cartesian Theater"" at the beginning morphs by the end into ""our old nemesis, the Cartesian Theater""), very carefully chosen metaphorical models in order to pull in all kinds of technological magic, the way he performs a mea culpa without actually admitting guilt near the end of the book, and prevalent rhetorical questions and blanket declarations to mask over the places where things are most awkward. It's really well done. If it weren't for the theoretical issues (really, one major theoretical issue), this would easily be a 5 star book. It is both rigorous yet accessible, and it is a wonderfully enjoyable exploration of consciousness and its limitations. The book has a lot to teach people about their own self-experience, even (and especially!) those who aren't prone to agree with him (such as me). To borrow a term Dennett uses to describe a fellow philosopher's work, this book is an ""instructive failure"". It's definitely worth your time to read.I read this book, however, with a particular question in mind: when I see something in my mind's eye, where does that image reside? (Note that I have a vivid mind's eye — some people don't even have a mind's eye at all, and don't even know they're missing one! See this Discover article for more.) This book was referred to me because it was apparently a solid materialist argument and explanation. Unfortunately, Dennett simply doesn't have an answer for that question. His rhetoric obscures that fact very well (although he cops to side-stepping questions of ""the nature of things"" in Appendix A), but ultimately he takes a functionalist approach, and that handily does away with the very evidence which I was looking for him to explain.To see how this happens, it is first necessary to realize that we can't actually prove anyone else is conscious in the same sense we are. As was popularized in The Matrix, we could be dreaming and not realizing it, and everyone else could be projections of our own consciousness. Like in A Beautiful Mind (SPOILER ALERT), we could be populating our experience with non-existent people. No test proves anything more than the fact that it is a very clever illusion or bit of calculation going on — but, ultimately, our own consciousness is uniquely experienced by us. Everyone else could be a zombie (in the philosophical sense), and we have no way to know differently. This is not the point Dennett starts with, but it's implicit within Dennett's functionalist approach. The move Dennett makes is to then project that back on to us, and say that we, too, have no consciousness in any real sense. How could you prove differently to anyone else? What objectively accessible function can you perform as a conscious entity which these potentially unconscious entities could not?The problem is that the experience of having consciousness — not just computational complexity or a narrative world, but some ""audience in a Cartesian Theater"" — is not simply a ""doctrine"" (that word choice is a great example of Dennett's excellent and subtle rhetorical moves), but stems from evidence. It's not functional-objective evidence, but it is evidence none the less. That evidence is the experience of having consciousness. As much as you chip away at what the consciousness is and does (and Dennett does that excellently), there is always still an ""I"" which is having the experience. That's the whole point of Descartes, and Dennett simply does not feel the need to account for it, instead presenting the epistemological limitations of his ""heterophenomonology"" as ontological statements. But a map is not the territory, and a scientific model is not the thing itself. Simply because heterophenomonology cannot take with subjective evidence seriously does not mean that subjective evidence should not be taken seriously. This point is very poetically (and popularly) driven home in Nature, Man and Woman, and Dennett is aware of it, but simply dismisses it as not relevant. If you read through my progress in this book, you'll see lots of places where those dismissals are explicitly identified, because they drove me nuts. (Here's an example.)To a certain extent, though, he is right: phenomonology is not relevant within the context of science, where heterophenomenology is sufficient. As a text in cognitive science, Dennett's approach is really insightful and makes many challenging points. In the world of philosophy, though, the phenomonology needs to be accounted for. It's not philosophically sufficient to assume an air of ""anthropological"" condescension towards at least our own phenomonology — that's discounting a vital piece of evidence without basis, and if it cannot be accounted for, then consciousness (at least our own consciousness) is insufficiently explained. Dennett claims that consciousness is just an illusion — but who is perceiving the illusion? If it is a deception, who is being deceived? That claim is actually begging the question, and Dennett responds by retreating to functionalism, and saying it is our memories that are being deceived. But I do not simply remember being conscious — I am conscious of being conscious! But that sentence doesn't even make sense in the functionalist conception. But Dennett seems to be paraphrasing Groucho Marx: ""Who are you going to believe? Me or your own mind's eye?""It is notable at this point, though, to mention that the kind of ""anthropological"" condescension Dennett advocates has actually come under an extreme kind of fire as a Eurocentric and fundamentally racist pattern of thought which results not in real knowledge, but more in generating a hybrid of European presumptions and European interpretative ""data"". For more on this point, see Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference. I bring this up because so much of the argumentation feels like 19th century thinking, not 21st century thinking, and the model Dennett proposes reads more like an artifact of philosophy's own artifices and methodologies than an account of reality. Appeals to the specialness of language (strictly conceived), to Newtonian physics, and conflations between non-materialism and dualism really reinforce that sense.On top of all of this, Dennett builds heavily upon ideas of evolutionary psychology and memes, which are roundly destroyed as non-scientific materialistic doctrines in The Spiritual Brain: A Neuroscientist's Case for the Existence of the Soul. There is also some significant ethological (""animal-psychological"") claims about the communication and cognition of animals which are simply empirically wrong given research done by people like Marc Bekoff. And the idea that we could have immortality by ""copying our brain's software"" is not very comforting to this particular copy (a point made well in The Prestige). There is no serious engagement with psi or spirituality, as though they are self-evidently irrelevant to discussions of consciousness.With all these complaints, however, the book still gets 4 stars. It's definitely worth a read, and it is really an eye-opening revelation of just how complicated the apparently simple idea of ""the conscious mind"" really is. Highly suggested."
221,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260292-erik,2,"2091: one hundred years ago philosophers wrote books using words like ""consciousness,"" ""qualia,"" ""functionalism,"" ""materialism,"" and ""zombie,"" words which have since been banned for the sake of the public good. You see philosophers, without actually asking themselves what these words meant, used to debate with each other by filling the blanks in arguments with these words and moving them around like rebus tiles, inventing more and more recondite scenarios for their use and claiming to refute their opponents with sheer tour de force applications of logic. I think you can see why someone had to put a stop to this.More seriously, it does seem uncontroversial to me that the neurons underlying color perception and other sensations can be affected by further causal relations to judgments and object perceptions (it has been known for more than 100 years!). Does this mean sensations are simply a network of discriminatory judgments and their concreteness an illusion of being embedded in a network of such judgments? No because they are realized by the effective physical powers expressed in the sensations. It is probably true that a space of colors could be simulated in a machine or even a computer program. For example if a machine were charged with navigating a space of numbered points and could carry out rotations, translations etc. on these points and if the machine had a way of specifying its own position in the manifold and representations of the other points and distances and directions, it would make sense to say the machine carries an internal representation that would ""seem to it like living in a space."" Why not? But the physical realization would matter too. It isn't just the structure that matters but the stuff too. If the color space were navigated by a color observer then certainly I could buy the idea that the representation would seem to it like sensing (its own) colors. But the same colors as those expressed by the physics of the human brain? Doubtful, unless the relevant physical realization was exactly duplicated, by electrical -chemical signals for example. The idea that the sensations are nothing but an artifact of being in a certain representation regardless of how it is realized, this seems to ignore the fact that the physical realization must matter too. Proof: take two such realizations and let them interact in one big representation. Because the causal roles of the materials are different those differences also have further causal roles in relation to each other and would be manifested as such, so the non-identity would be revealed immediately. Dennett claims that if discriminatory judgments are divorced from their qualitative appearance this leads to absurdity, but how can these roles be separated at all if sensations are also physical and if their qualitative appearance is a result of their configured causal powers? By separating them you are leaving out some of their causal roles and the thought experiment is impossible. He doesn't even consider any of this. I'm not impartial to this discussion (see my Realistic Empiricism) but the concrete physical reality of sensation seems hard to deny if it is there in the cells."
222,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,4,"I saw a quote somewhere (in a David Chalmers book but not by Chalmers himself) that basically pointed out that the fact that we are conscious beings means that we've never really said anything of interest about consciousness. It's both so obvious as to be self-evident, and yet so ineffable that it can't be spoken about clearly. This double-edged sword is what Dennett tackles. He wants to challenge the view that conscious is this thing that we known intrinsically from a first-person perspective, whilst also undermining any claim that it cannot be spoken about clearly. What is required is a rethinking of the very assumptions we make about our conscious minds in light of what we discover from everything from neuroscience to AI, from anthropology to zoology, and start to shut down the Cartesian Theatre once and for all.The results are a mixed bag. Dennett's eye for detail, need to make sure you've fully understood every nuance of his point and dedication to defending himself against any predicted counter-argument mean that the book is immense, long and quite a slog. This is partly where my criticism of the text emerges. For a book of popular philosophy combined with popular science, this is dense and detailed. It isn't a simple overview of his key ideas that any engrossed reader can follow up afterwards. He covers every angle, every philosophical nook and cranny, until he feels he has exhausted the discussion. On the other hand, the book is so filled with simplifications, metaphors, ""intuition pumps"" and reader-friendly summaries that any one who is reading it for academic reasons may feel a little undernourished. The big question is: who is this book for? With that aside, I found the book entertaining and engaging. The sheer volume of the text means it takes quite a while to get through it all, and one chapter at a time is more than enough. There's little chance of readers ploughing through this at speed because they can't wait to see what happens next. However, there is a payoff. In later chapters, the painfully long analysis of the early sections start to reappear and the relevance of everything starts to look more like a coherent theory than a series of musings on what things might be like if we take the time to think about them differently. This is rewarding due to the effort that has to be put in during the early stages of the book. It took me nearly 3 months to read it because it wasn't the book I thought it would be. I thought this was a handy overview of his ideas in a digestible form. It wasn't. Or rather it was, but in such gargantuan amounts of prose that it took me a while to churn through it, and bedtime reading became a non-starter. I still enjoyed it. It was still worth the effort, but had I not been in the mood to tackle it, I would have given up sooner. "
223,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99056689-katyen,4,"Daniel Dennett's book ""Consciousness Explained"" is currently one of the classic books on consciousness. In addition, it is one of the most important Dennett books he has ever written. I can also consider Daniel Dennett to be one of the most important representatives of contemporary philosophy of mind. The views he presents in the book are in many cases conservative and provocative, which was part of Dennett's goal, and this book has provoked much discussion, criticism, indignation, but also appreciation.Most critics accused Dennett of either not explaining consciousness in the book at all or rejecting it altogether. None of these views is true, on the contrary, Dennett tries to explain consciousness, but in a completely different way. Dennett does not try to say directly what consciousness is, but rather what consciousness does. Related to this is his rejection of the famous ""hard problem of consciousness"" and his replacement by the ""hard question"", which reads: And then what happens? (Dennett 1991, p. 255). In the book, he tries to explain and to some extent also summarize the knowledge about the brain from the cognitive sciences and neurosciences so far. Dennett himself is not only a philosopher but also a cognitive scientist, and even today he is actively involved in discussions of consciousness. The aim of the book is not so much to explain consciousness as to demystify it. That is, to point out that consciousness is a natural phenomenon in nature that arose during an evolutionary process that lasted millions of years. The fact that most authors consider consciousness to be mysterious and exceptional is more related to moral views on the uniqueness of human beings. This is exactly what Dennett tries to prove in the book and to point out that even if we remove the mysticism, there will still be beauty and space for new questions. As he claims:When we understand consciousness - when there is no more mystery - consciousness will be different, but there will still be beauty, and more room than ever for awe (Dennett 1991, pp. 25).Overall, I especially liked the book because of its new concept of consciousness, which was unconventional for the 90s of the 20th century. A possible downside to the book is that in some parts of the book, Dennett vaguely expresses his views, which may ultimately lead to Dennett's rejection of consciousness."
224,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"I was already aware of the bad fame of this book, and every time I saw it being referenced, I saw it as being referenced as a failure. As the typical saying goes ""consciousness explained away"". Nevertheless, I decided to give it a shot. I figured the bad reputation of the book was because it failed its goal and stated purpose, which was way too ambitious. But I figured I could still have a lot of value and insight into consciousness. But I was wrong. While it explained some characteristics of thought and consciousness, it didn't explain consciousness as such. I gave up and stopped reading briefly before halfway. I very rarely leave books unfinished, but I truly felt like it was a waste of time. Not only it didn't explain very much, but the writing itself is rather boring, and Dennett often shifts too laterally. While I usually appreciate this, I found it pointless and dull. I felt he often confused the validity of the experience of consciousness as phenomenology itself. The fact that your phenomenology leads you to a flawed assumption and you don't quite understand the mechanisms, doesn't in any way solve the actual problem of experiencing it, which is exactly the point. Coming up with heterophenomenology to make it more ""objective"" doesn't help very much. If it's accurate or not is almost irrelevant. Calling it a simple projection feels an equal cheap escape. This is my 2nd book from Dennett, the first being Breaking the Spell, which was similarly disappointing. I had a good impression of Dennet from a few his lectures that I watched, and after the disappointment of the first book I figured I'd give it another try, but looks like I'm fighting for a lost cause.I'm sure there are some good arguments and ideas in the book, I found the categorization of consciousness as being Orwelling or Stalinesque quite witty and useful for example, and the refutation of the Cartesian Theatre is solid, although it was beaten to death. But overall, I personally felt it wasn't worth the grinding."
225,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59307958-katy-koivastik,5,"References to consciousness in Sam Harris’ “Waking Up” reminded me of “Consciousness Explained” sitting unread in my library probably since it was first published in 1991. I decided to finally open it to see whether it would hold my interest all these years later.I earnestly powered through the first third of the book, and then pick and chose my way through the rest. There is a reason I am not a scientist, as I found the descriptions of the experiments boring, despite being written for the layman. The author does discuss the nature of memory and of the human tendency toward false and embellished memory, a topic I find unendingly fascinating. The book is peppered with quotations, and this one from novelist Ariel Dorfman on memory resonated: “I’m really not sure if others fail to perceive me or if, one fraction of a second after my face interferes with their horizon, a millionth of a second after they have cast their gaze on me, they already begin to wash me from their memory: forgotten before arriving at the scant, sad archangel of a remembrance.”I gave the book 5 stars because it is well written, includes wry cartoons, and can be understood by non-scientists. One quote from the author sums up the topic for me: “We, in contrast (to animals), are almost constantly engaged in presenting ourselves to others, and to ourselves, and hence representing ourselves — in language and gesture, external and internal. The most obvious difference in our environment that would explain this difference in our behavior is the behavior itself. Our human environment contains not just food and shelter, enemies to fight or flee, and conspecifics with whom to mate, but words, words, words. These words are potent elements of our environment that we readily incorporate, ingesting and extruding them, weaving them like spiderwebs into self-protective strings of narrative. ....when we let in these words, these meme-vehicles, they tend to take over, creating us out of the raw materials they find in our brains.”"
226,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7804740-paul,4,"Dennett's intention in this book is to defend and advance materialism, which is the idea that only matter exists, and that there are no other special things, like 'mind stuff' or the soul. The challenge which he addresses is to explain how something as complex, varied and wonderful as human consciousness could possibly originate 100% from the human brain. The subtext really should be 'Dualism Demolished', as he spends quite some time dismantling the idea that there must be some other medium or entity in which consciousness happens. As well the related idea of the 'Cartesian centre of consciousness', the idea that there is a central point in the brain where all of the senses, inputs and thinking comes together to become our consciousness.I'm a materialist myself, and as I work with computers, I don't have any objection to the idea that consciousness is some kind of 'virtual machine' that runs in the brain in a massively parallel way, which is an idea he presents. However, I must say that at times I found the book heavy going. Perhaps it's my fault that I thought the book belonged in the 'popular philosophy' category, which it certainly does not. This is a Serious Philosophical Work, and it's intended to make a Real Contribution to the science and philosophy of mind. It's chock full of references, annotations and asides. Dennett tries in every page to be as rational and scientific as possible. That's fine, but at times I found it wearing. While I agree with the broad thrust of what he's saying, there's plenty you could object to (such as the idea that you don't really experience sensory input, you only 'seem to'. Although it was published in 1991, it still felt relevant to me, due to timeless nature of the issues he addresses. Although I have no doubt that the argument has moved on a great deal since that time. Overall a great read, but not for the faint of heart."
227,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54462119-mohammadhossein-haqiqatkhah,4,"Daniel C. Dennett tends to prolixity when explaining the stuff. Although it's mainly focused on challenging Cartesian dualism, he introduces very interesting perspectives toward consciousness.All he tries to do in this book (and I believe he succeeds in it) is to suggest new metaphors to substitute the more intuitive metaphors the dualist theories provide. He digs very deeply into qualia and challenges almost every aspect of it. As he puts it:My explanation of consciousness is far from complete. One might even say that it was just a beginning, but it is a beginning, because it breaks the spell of the enchanted circle of ideas that made explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t replaced a metaphorical theory, the Cartesian Theater, with a nonmetaphorical (“literal, scientific”) theory. All I have done, really, is to replace one family of metaphors and images with another, trading in the Theater, the Witness, the Central Meaner, the Figment, for Software, Virtual Machines, Multiple Drafts, a Pandemonium of Homunculi. It’s just a war of metaphors, you say — but metaphors are not “just” metaphors; metaphors are the tools of thought. No one can think about consciousness without them, so it is important to equip yourself with the best set of tools available. Look what we have built with our tools. Could you have imagined it without them?He ends up, quite quickly, with a narrative theory of self and individual identity. It's an exotic view (let's say, journey) into the philosophy of consciousness, but it leaves many questions unaddressed. However, indeed, Consciousness Explained is a no-return point in your philosophical relationship with consciousness."
228,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"In a way Dennett feels like a curmudgeon about how the roots of the consciousness and the mind works in much the same way Richard Dawkins feels to me a curmudgeon about the roots of our biology. And just like Dawkins, I find him very convincing. Dennett is very much in line with other thinkers I've been reading like Douglas Hofstadter (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) and Michael S.A. Graziano (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) who see consciousness as an emergent property of the whole system of our brain rather than something that emerges from a single point or theater in the mind. His dialogues on the chinese room thought experiment and philosophical zombies were great on this point. There can be unconscious zombies or operators in the chinese rooms only if we propose a single theater that consciousness arises from. If we look at the larger system, it's clear that any philosophical zombie will all of the skills and insights of a human would indeed be a conscious system.This counterintuitive conclusion is something that we all seem to naturally battle because it strikes at the very nature of the self that is doing the intuiting. As Dennett wrote: ""Many people are afraid to see consciousness explained because they fear that if we succeed in explaining it, we will lose our moral bearings."" I suppose I can partially excuse some of my favorite thinkers like Yuval Noah Harari and Sam Harris for continuing to make claims that consciousness is still a fundamental mystery. I think what they mean is that we still haven't found the metaphors that allow us collectively to think about our minds in the way we think about our biology and the world around us. Dennett, in spite of his best attempt to reach a broad audience, is far too academic for my mother or my dentist and probably for me, but I'm hoping work from someone is on the way to help carry this torch."
229,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47952052-chloe-noland,3,"I'm not sure which is more convoluted: the topic of consciousness, or the author Dennett himself. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other, more mainstream styles of discussion regarding issues of science and morality, from authors like Harris and Pinker. The fact that Dennett's central thesis of this book -- deconstructing our ""intuitive"" but incorrect understanding of our conscious selves as a Cartesian witness sitting inside our brains, and replacing it with a Multiple Drafts Model of cognition that supports the way our minds truly process, adapt, & repeat in order to make conscious choices and actions -- is written in an extremely self-referential and conceited style, to the point that it distracts from the thesis itself, and weighs down a lot of Dennett's brilliant observations and theories with nods to his own superiority over his colleagues, including at least one citation to the author's other works on every other page. Basically, I wish he had just shared his ideas in a more neutral and simplistic way. The theories themselves are not hard to understand, although do require commitment to what Dennett is asking of the reader -- to put aside everything they think they understand about what consciousness is and how our minds operate. After this, it's just Dennett's world and we're living in it: in showing how our brains evolved to their current levels of complexity through a complicated process of trial and error, shaping and reshaping, layering new information on top of old, Dennett illuminates many processes of cognition that provide new and consequential insights into why we tell stories, how identities are formed, and what these narratives mean for our continuing evolution -- the least of which is that no such thing as a SELF really exists, or has ever existed. I just wish he had cut back on the running side commentary. "
230,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75618360-tien-manh,5,"What is subjective experience? When I imagine a purple cow, the purpleness ""feels"" purple to ""me"". Who is this ""me""? Dennett tackles a very difficult problem in a beautifully written work of philosophy (+a bit of cognitive science).Slowly, the author dismantles the myth of the ""Cartesian theater"", or the idea that past perception, and the parallel neural processes going on in the brain, content is ""presented"" to a fictitious viewer. There is no such ""Audience"". Thinking is thought. There is no ""central hub"" where everything ""comes together"", and Dennett introduces ""Multiple Drafts"" to give consciousness an elementary stab.Then Dennett compares consciousness as a sort of serial (illusory) program running on the parallel brain. This part I'm not super convinced about, thinking of a computer as subsystems of information processing is useful in some ways but maybe we need more models and analogies besides the Von Neumann architecture.What about the ""language"" that we think in? Dennett refutes a ""Central Meaner"", and instead replaces it with a ""Pandemonium"", multiple neural pathways in our head all having something to say.Dennett also discusses the evolution of consciousness, problems with folk psychology, Libet's experiments and temporal inference, and philosophical problems like ""In the Mind's eye"", ""Mary the scientist"", Searle's ""Chinese Room"", ""What is it like to be a bat""...There was a lot of thought provoking content in this book. The idea of the self as a ""center of narrative gravity"", an abstract concept, instead of some dualistic ""brain pearl"" was illuminating for me. Book is kinda old, probably there are more up-to-date ones, but I'd say this is still extremely well worth the time for anyone curious in the nature of the mind."
231,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74862840-cary-giese,3,"Consciousness is the ability of humans to be aware of their own mind. “I think, therefore I am,” per Rene Descartes of the 17th century, is still the prevailing understanding. The book’s author explained, in excessive detail, what was known or believed in 1991, namely a confusion of ideas from the disciplines of psychology, philosophy and science. No real progress! No advanced ideas beyond Descartes’ description since then. More theses, no consensus! It does seem that each persons consciousness is unique to them! Each of us has sole awareness of our self! Our soul?? There is an underlying belief that our human consciousness is an evolved state resulting from the creative processes of evolution. Now the question is: Can Artificial Intelligence develop consciousness through a similar creative process, to become unique, super smart “silicone individuals,” competing with humans? Wow! The question is: how can we use and manage Artificial Intelligece without it surpassing us? I need to read more updated studies to understand this more! I will if they exist, most books on the subject date to the 1980-90’s! This book provides the questions, no answers, and only speculations. Though the book is credited as the landmark start of the discussion! For that, Dennett deserves respect for providing a foundation reading!"
232,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914286-sarah,2,"I was really interested in this work for about the first 200 pages. One of the biggest drawbacks is that this text was published in 1991 (almost 30 years ago); and the author uses a lot of illustrations and arguments from the science and philosophy of artificial intelligence. That science has changed so much in the last 30 years. Also, I have no real science or philosophy background, so I found parts of this a tough go. The early chapters, when the author was trying to define consciousness were the best for me - he raised a number of ideas and issues that I found fascinating. Not only about how speech developed, but when did we start talking to ourselves? And the importance of that action. You have to think of yourself as a self to bother speaking. Not to mention, how do we hear our own voices (or our parents voices, etc) in our heads? No sound is actually being generated; yet our brain gives it to us as if playing a recording. How do you ""hear"" when you are 100 percent by passing your auditory system? Same thing with ""seeing"" things in your head. But as the book dragged on, I lost interest and felt more and more lost in his endless responses to others ideas of consciousness. In the end, he never did explain consciousness to me. I just kept falling asleep whenever I picked up this book - so I very lightly skimmed the last 200 pages and called it a day."
233,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72796908-daniel-hageman,3,"This is a book where my judgment of it could change for the better or worse upon reading more material in the area of Theory of Mind, and then even rereading this work. Dennett undoubtedly makes a thought provoking case for how we ought to look at consciousness, perhaps shaking a fair few my previously held ideas regarding the soundness of epiphenomenalism and philosophical zombies. The examples regarding tastes, and the experience of an acquired taste, as a phenomenon that changes over time versus your conscious experience of the taste of said phenomenon changing, seems quite crucial in considering the relevance of consciousness as explained via external objective measures. His last section addressing the issue of 'explaining' a phenomenon versus 'explaining away' said phenomenon was also a nice touch. I agree with his conclusion that he has at the very least started the explanation; perhaps he wouldn't have gotten so much heat for this book if he reconsidered the tense of his verbiage when drawing up a title. A simple gerund could likely have made others' perception of him and his work much more palatable, though with some further pressure, their conscious experience of his work could perhaps become acquired as well :)"
234,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21625655-chase-mcclendon,4,"I was between 3 and 4 stars on this book. On the one hand, it’s impressive to view Dennett attempt to topple (and replace) what he views as a misinformed view of what consciousness is. Naturally, something as familiar to us as our own consciousness will carry with it a certain obviousness about the mechanisms and features of that consciousness. Dennett’s task is to show you that although you may be the observer, you don’t have a claim to infallibility over the mechanisms that produce your experience, only the effects of those mechanisms. My problem with the book was that oftentimes Dennett‘s writing seems filled with unnecessary jargon. While I understand that in a book that tries to do no less than explain consciousness there will be some requisite wordiness, I was left with the feeling that if only Dennett was a more pithy writer, his points would’ve landed with more force. Many times throughout the book I would finish a section and feel that I had missed an aspect of an argument that Dennett supposed would win me over in dramatic fashion.All this said, I enjoyed Dennett’s method and although I may still have subtle bonds to my old ways of thinking about consciousness, Dennett has done much to weaken and replace them."
235,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79330012-arthur-ryman,4,"Definitely worth the read, but not exactly what I was hoping for or what is advertised in the title. A more accurate title would be ""Consciousness Explained Away"". I am in full agreement with Dennett's basic position, namely that the brain is a computing device. However, Dennett does not explain the basic phenomenon of awareness. Rather, he substitutes the term ""dispositional state"". Disappointing. I decided to read this, and similar works, because I felt that physics lacked the conceptual vocabulary to talk about awareness, that abundantly obvious feeling that we are observers. Coincidentally, quantum mechanics, although spectacularly successful, relies on the injection of an observer to collapse superpositions of states into an actual observation. In the absence of a better explanation from Dennett and his colleagues, I'll simply tell myself that awareness is what collapsing wave functions feel like. :-)"

(the quotes are not actual quotes but my paraphrasing).It was like a constant tease, I guess to keep you hooked, while he rambled on with his filler. But after a while of this not stop filler with teases, I got fed up and put the book down. I did not even bother to skip to the end. I got the feeling it was something that could be summarized in a paragraph and I did not want to search the book for that paragraph. I was truly disappointed."

Then from the middle, he seemed to want to clean up for later and remove a central ""meaner"" for consciousness and describe his multiple drafts theory so that he can link up any ol' robot to a zombified human state, since there isn't one ""perfect"" setup for an human mind. Then from a negative direction cut up phenomenology and then remove qualia, which for some reason was so important for him to do, and then say we've landed somewhere in the middle, along with the robots he's described.It is a fun read with plenty of interesting pop psychology experiments.Overall, an account of what it might look like to explain consciousness away.

It's hard to argue with someone as smart as Dennett, he sets traps, finds the perfect arguments, and is just so undeniably smarter and prepared than any of us, which is one of the reasons why I have to remain slightly skeptical about his final premise.He has succeeded in making me see his argument, and though it still remains closer to a philosophical one than a scientific one, it's the best one I've heard so far and the one that explains consciousness the best while not falling for metaphysical interpretations at all.Great book. It doesn't matter if you don't buy into the final conclusion, the road that gets you there will open your mind."

At times it felt as though Dennett wanted to report on so many experiments and studies as to overwhelm anyone who wants to strike down his arguments.

247,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71339698-nour-elhuda-zuraiki,3,"When I finally finished reading this book all I was thinking about is: ‘’ I wish I could have a chance of smoking pot with Dennett watching Westworld’’Here is my advice if you want to read this book and really enjoy it: first, have an open mind, yes don’t disagree from the first thing you encounter, the book is challenging and it subconsciously demands from you to unlink your intuitions about your inner experiences to wrap your head around other alternatives. Secondly, there might seem to be contradiction in the book which you’ll unravel especially when you reach the core purpose of it (chapter 5) but remember the ‘’psychoanalysis Party Game’’ when Dennett talked about in the early chapters concluding at the end: ‘’ In such a cycle, one’s current expectations and interests shape hypotheses for one’s perceptual systems to confirm or disconfirm, and a rapid sequence of such hypothesis generations and confirmations produces the ultimate product, the ongoing, updated ‘’model’’ of the world of perceived ….All we suppose is that the illusionist goes into an arbitrary confirmation mode and the victim provides the content by asking the questions’’. This is very much applied to every concept introduced in the book, for instance when Dennett mentions the thought experiment ‘’Mary the Colour Scientist’’ he presumes that your brain has made the assumption that knowing every physical fact about a colour is the same as knowing a lot about the colour. Now Dennett concludes that if Mary really did know every physical fact about a colour yellow, she will be to know what yellow is like by entirely anticipating her entire cognitive simulation and response to the stimulus.Now Dennett introduces a model for the mental processes that we call consciousness where he claims ‘’some of the most perplexing paradoxes of consciousness arise because we cling too long to a good habit of thought, a habit that usually keeps us out of trouble’’ he starts of by laying down what we need to establish to build a model he revisits Descartes Cartesian Theatre-where all the aspects of a profound experience come together to provide a unified phenomenal world- he discusses why this model cannot work by maintaining that there is no single point for which it all has to come together for central processing so he then introduces ‘’The Multiple Drafts Model’’ where According it, ‘’all varieties of perception- indeed, all varieties of thought or mental activity- are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous "" here Dennett then emphasis that this model makes the discrimination that ‘’ the brain just adjusts to the conclusion that is drawn, making the new interpretation of the information available for the modulation of subsequent behaviour’’.In conclusion, Dennett believes that instead for the consciousness to be at a single point he imagines it described as a virtual machine like a computer that is built on top of a different system, it is a linear, sequential machine that is built on top of a massively parallel structure which in this case is the brain.Now this is a very short summary of the book, of course the book is so rich with information, starting from Descartes’ Dualism and the Cartesian Theatre then explaining that there’s no Theatre in the first place to introducing many thoughts experiments to get you ready to absorb the new way of thinking about consciousness, getting a grasp on how your inner mental life might have come. It is subtly profound and valuable. It’s like Dennett looks at consciousness as the brain’s way of making sense of the world around us. For me personally it was an astonishing whole new worldview to form and just like any other worldview, it does have its complexities and assumptions but that doesn’t mean that it is not logical to consider, I suppose when I’m having this worldview of the denial of consciousness and the experience (According to Dennett) I become more of a depressed person who doesn’t seem to find meaning of anything around, having the idea that what we perceive as reality is subjective and what we think is the objective reality is only hypothetical since or senses are flawed and limited is an unescapable truth.At the end I’m only an amature philosopher, a curious human mind that like to share her views assertively yet tactfully. "
248,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37283541-fran-cavanagh,4,"This is a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain. At least, it's a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain as was understood to be the case nearly 30 years ago. Honestly, I felt Dennett's summary of the cognitive science behind perception, attention, memory and language stood up very well despite the book's age, so that isn't much of a criticism. While there have obviously been many developments in these fields since Dennett was writing, much of the same base material has been covered in my 2020-era Psychology Masters programme. This is also a great introduction to some of the key philosophical debates regarding consciousness, human and otherwise (although, as very much a non-philosopher, I'm not sure I'd be able to identify if it wasn't). I'm not sure Dennett fully marries these two strands together to put forward a fully satisfying view on the nature of human consciousness.I can get on board with Dennett's ""Multiple Drafts"" view of human perception, as far as I understand it. It's backed up by a significant body of literature in Psychology and Neuroscience that suggests that our experience of reality is a lot choppier and less constant or consistent than it appears. I can also agree, as a result, that the ""Cartesian Theatre"" and the idea of one centralised observer self doesn't make a whole lot of scientific sense. But none of this, for me, touches on the question of what the consciousness that we experience in ourselves and others actually is, or how it appears. Dennett again makes a very convincing case that our brains can be seen as effectively very complicated supercomputers, and that a non-biological supercomputer that worked exactly like the brain would be functionally indistinguishable from the brain. Dennett also puts forward fascinating points, building principally on the work of Dawkins and Levelt, about language and ideas and how these grow and propagate between our brains and across societies. There's truly a lot of fascinating and valid discussion here, and Dennett is clearly much more knowledgeable and generally intelligent than I could ever hope to be. I appreciated hearing his synthesised perspective on all of these topics. Again, though, I was still left feeling that he didn't fully explore or explain how consciousness emerges from this biological supercomputer we call the brain. The book also doesn't really directly discuss in any depth what consciousness is, how it functions, or why. This book is apparently often re-titled by its critics as ""Consciousness Explained Away"". This seems a little unfair. Dennett makes it very clear in his closing remarks that he believes that consciousness is a ""thing"". I'm just still not convinced that I understand how the mechanisms and functions and processes he describes in great detail in this book add up to the consciousness that he stresses he believes exists.The entry for Consciousness in the 1989 Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology offers a succinctly damning description: “The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings: awareness… Nothing worth reading has been written about it.” I'm not sure this book provided a counterexample to that definition, but I'm also of half a mind to believe that it's impossible for us to truly understand the nature of consciousness, at least with the scientific tools currently at our disposal. I suspect that Dennett would feel very differently about that proposition, and that there may be some fundamental definitional disconnects at play between whatever school of philosophy I fall into and the largely functionalist worldview inhabited by Dennett. An impasse I'm honestly under-equipped to fully describe. Philosophical disagreements about the nature of the subject matter aside, then, this was a really well put-together, intelligent and enjoyable read. One I expect I'll return to a lot."
249,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,3,"Following my readings on history and future of humanity, I wanted to explore the question of “what is humanity”? and why super intelligent machines lack “humanity” despite their superior intelligence? If it's not intelligence that makes us human then it must be “consciousness”, or that continuous stream of subjective experiences, feelings and emotions that flow through our brain every second of our waking hours. What exactly is it? and how does it happen is an unsolved mystery despite significant advances in neurosciences, biology, psychology and computing. Therefore, a book titled “Consciousness Explained” seemed like exactly the right book I need.This book is not my first reading on intelligence but it is the first on consciousness and I have to say it was a disappointing start, the book is overly academic and lacks the story telling convenience I got so used to that I now expect from any writer who respects their audience. It’s not my job to clean up an author’s mess and order it into concise narrative. It should be the job of the one who got paid to write in the first place. Anyway, back to consciousness. The book tries to replace the traditional view with a different view that is better supported by evidence from experimental neuroscience. The Traditional view is called the “Cartesian theater” where basically all sensory information is projected in a theater-like area of the brain that is continuously monitored by “the mind” or “the conscious soul” that is continuously issuing commands to different body parts in response to the information presented to it. This view is obviously wrong for multiple reasons, first because neuroscience can not find such area in the brain and more importantly, because this creates an infinite recursive loop of ""what, then, is the mind of that mind, ... etc?""The alternative model is the “multiple drafts” model where different but connected brain regions unconsciously and simultaneously develop several subjective experience narratives, each has a partial draft of the story and some even have a plan for action, however, these competing experiences get filtered by higher level brain areas (probably in the frontal cortex) that decide which narrative/plan of action should get the highest priority based on millions of years of natural selection design followed by several years of cultural training in the surrounding environment. This explains why conscious experience of all humans is genetically sensitive to snakes, the color red, and vertical symmetry (faces) while each human culture is sensitive to specific environmental memes like jokes, beliefs and local common sense.The evidence for this model comes in two variants: (1) logical: because a virtual machine of consciousness that is made up of several subconscious components escapes the recursive flaw of the Cartesian theater model. (2) It has been proven recently by neuroscience that decisions are made in the brain a few milliseconds BEFORE we become “conscious” of making them, and not the other way around.At the end, I don't think I have a satisfactory understanding of consciousness, but to have my consciousness explained in just one book was an audacious goal in the first place. The book, although useful, could have been written in a much better way and could have left out so many useless details. So, if interested in consciousness, wait till I find you a better book to read."
250,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060524-robert-fischer,4,"Rhetorically, this book is a masterpiece. Without a doubt, Dennett is a master of the persuasive argument, and he pulls out all the stops here: see the gradual shifts in word choice (""the familiar Cartesian Theater"" at the beginning morphs by the end into ""our old nemesis, the Cartesian Theater""), very carefully chosen metaphorical models in order to pull in all kinds of technological magic, the way he performs a mea culpa without actually admitting guilt near the end of the book, and prevalent rhetorical questions and blanket declarations to mask over the places where things are most awkward. It's really well done. If it weren't for the theoretical issues (really, one major theoretical issue), this would easily be a 5 star book. It is both rigorous yet accessible, and it is a wonderfully enjoyable exploration of consciousness and its limitations. The book has a lot to teach people about their own self-experience, even (and especially!) those who aren't prone to agree with him (such as me). To borrow a term Dennett uses to describe a fellow philosopher's work, this book is an ""instructive failure"". It's definitely worth your time to read.I read this book, however, with a particular question in mind: when I see something in my mind's eye, where does that image reside? (Note that I have a vivid mind's eye — some people don't even have a mind's eye at all, and don't even know they're missing one! See this Discover article for more.) This book was referred to me because it was apparently a solid materialist argument and explanation. Unfortunately, Dennett simply doesn't have an answer for that question. His rhetoric obscures that fact very well (although he cops to side-stepping questions of ""the nature of things"" in Appendix A), but ultimately he takes a functionalist approach, and that handily does away with the very evidence which I was looking for him to explain.To see how this happens, it is first necessary to realize that we can't actually prove anyone else is conscious in the same sense we are. As was popularized in The Matrix, we could be dreaming and not realizing it, and everyone else could be projections of our own consciousness. Like in A Beautiful Mind (SPOILER ALERT), we could be populating our experience with non-existent people. No test proves anything more than the fact that it is a very clever illusion or bit of calculation going on — but, ultimately, our own consciousness is uniquely experienced by us. Everyone else could be a zombie (in the philosophical sense), and we have no way to know differently. This is not the point Dennett starts with, but it's implicit within Dennett's functionalist approach. The move Dennett makes is to then project that back on to us, and say that we, too, have no consciousness in any real sense. How could you prove differently to anyone else? What objectively accessible function can you perform as a conscious entity which these potentially unconscious entities could not?The problem is that the experience of having consciousness — not just computational complexity or a narrative world, but some ""audience in a Cartesian Theater"" — is not simply a ""doctrine"" (that word choice is a great example of Dennett's excellent and subtle rhetorical moves), but stems from evidence. It's not functional-objective evidence, but it is evidence none the less. That evidence is the experience of having consciousness. As much as you chip away at what the consciousness is and does (and Dennett does that excellently), there is always still an ""I"" which is having the experience. That's the whole point of Descartes, and Dennett simply does not feel the need to account for it, instead presenting the epistemological limitations of his ""heterophenomonology"" as ontological statements. But a map is not the territory, and a scientific model is not the thing itself. Simply because heterophenomonology cannot take with subjective evidence seriously does not mean that subjective evidence should not be taken seriously. This point is very poetically (and popularly) driven home in Nature, Man and Woman, and Dennett is aware of it, but simply dismisses it as not relevant. If you read through my progress in this book, you'll see lots of places where those dismissals are explicitly identified, because they drove me nuts. (Here's an example.)To a certain extent, though, he is right: phenomonology is not relevant within the context of science, where heterophenomenology is sufficient. As a text in cognitive science, Dennett's approach is really insightful and makes many challenging points. In the world of philosophy, though, the phenomonology needs to be accounted for. It's not philosophically sufficient to assume an air of ""anthropological"" condescension towards at least our own phenomonology — that's discounting a vital piece of evidence without basis, and if it cannot be accounted for, then consciousness (at least our own consciousness) is insufficiently explained. Dennett claims that consciousness is just an illusion — but who is perceiving the illusion? If it is a deception, who is being deceived? That claim is actually begging the question, and Dennett responds by retreating to functionalism, and saying it is our memories that are being deceived. But I do not simply remember being conscious — I am conscious of being conscious! But that sentence doesn't even make sense in the functionalist conception. But Dennett seems to be paraphrasing Groucho Marx: ""Who are you going to believe? Me or your own mind's eye?""It is notable at this point, though, to mention that the kind of ""anthropological"" condescension Dennett advocates has actually come under an extreme kind of fire as a Eurocentric and fundamentally racist pattern of thought which results not in real knowledge, but more in generating a hybrid of European presumptions and European interpretative ""data"". For more on this point, see Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference. I bring this up because so much of the argumentation feels like 19th century thinking, not 21st century thinking, and the model Dennett proposes reads more like an artifact of philosophy's own artifices and methodologies than an account of reality. Appeals to the specialness of language (strictly conceived), to Newtonian physics, and conflations between non-materialism and dualism really reinforce that sense.On top of all of this, Dennett builds heavily upon ideas of evolutionary psychology and memes, which are roundly destroyed as non-scientific materialistic doctrines in The Spiritual Brain: A Neuroscientist's Case for the Existence of the Soul. There is also some significant ethological (""animal-psychological"") claims about the communication and cognition of animals which are simply empirically wrong given research done by people like Marc Bekoff. And the idea that we could have immortality by ""copying our brain's software"" is not very comforting to this particular copy (a point made well in The Prestige). There is no serious engagement with psi or spirituality, as though they are self-evidently irrelevant to discussions of consciousness.With all these complaints, however, the book still gets 4 stars. It's definitely worth a read, and it is really an eye-opening revelation of just how complicated the apparently simple idea of ""the conscious mind"" really is. Highly suggested."
251,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260292-erik,2,"2091: one hundred years ago philosophers wrote books using words like ""consciousness,"" ""qualia,"" ""functionalism,"" ""materialism,"" and ""zombie,"" words which have since been banned for the sake of the public good. You see philosophers, without actually asking themselves what these words meant, used to debate with each other by filling the blanks in arguments with these words and moving them around like rebus tiles, inventing more and more recondite scenarios for their use and claiming to refute their opponents with sheer tour de force applications of logic. I think you can see why someone had to put a stop to this.More seriously, it does seem uncontroversial to me that the neurons underlying color perception and other sensations can be affected by further causal relations to judgments and object perceptions (it has been known for more than 100 years!). Does this mean sensations are simply a network of discriminatory judgments and their concreteness an illusion of being embedded in a network of such judgments? No because they are realized by the effective physical powers expressed in the sensations. It is probably true that a space of colors could be simulated in a machine or even a computer program. For example if a machine were charged with navigating a space of numbered points and could carry out rotations, translations etc. on these points and if the machine had a way of specifying its own position in the manifold and representations of the other points and distances and directions, it would make sense to say the machine carries an internal representation that would ""seem to it like living in a space."" Why not? But the physical realization would matter too. It isn't just the structure that matters but the stuff too. If the color space were navigated by a color observer then certainly I could buy the idea that the representation would seem to it like sensing (its own) colors. But the same colors as those expressed by the physics of the human brain? Doubtful, unless the relevant physical realization was exactly duplicated, by electrical -chemical signals for example. The idea that the sensations are nothing but an artifact of being in a certain representation regardless of how it is realized, this seems to ignore the fact that the physical realization must matter too. Proof: take two such realizations and let them interact in one big representation. Because the causal roles of the materials are different those differences also have further causal roles in relation to each other and would be manifested as such, so the non-identity would be revealed immediately. Dennett claims that if discriminatory judgments are divorced from their qualitative appearance this leads to absurdity, but how can these roles be separated at all if sensations are also physical and if their qualitative appearance is a result of their configured causal powers? By separating them you are leaving out some of their causal roles and the thought experiment is impossible. He doesn't even consider any of this. I'm not impartial to this discussion (see my Realistic Empiricism) but the concrete physical reality of sensation seems hard to deny if it is there in the cells."
252,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,4,"I saw a quote somewhere (in a David Chalmers book but not by Chalmers himself) that basically pointed out that the fact that we are conscious beings means that we've never really said anything of interest about consciousness. It's both so obvious as to be self-evident, and yet so ineffable that it can't be spoken about clearly. This double-edged sword is what Dennett tackles. He wants to challenge the view that conscious is this thing that we known intrinsically from a first-person perspective, whilst also undermining any claim that it cannot be spoken about clearly. What is required is a rethinking of the very assumptions we make about our conscious minds in light of what we discover from everything from neuroscience to AI, from anthropology to zoology, and start to shut down the Cartesian Theatre once and for all.The results are a mixed bag. Dennett's eye for detail, need to make sure you've fully understood every nuance of his point and dedication to defending himself against any predicted counter-argument mean that the book is immense, long and quite a slog. This is partly where my criticism of the text emerges. For a book of popular philosophy combined with popular science, this is dense and detailed. It isn't a simple overview of his key ideas that any engrossed reader can follow up afterwards. He covers every angle, every philosophical nook and cranny, until he feels he has exhausted the discussion. On the other hand, the book is so filled with simplifications, metaphors, ""intuition pumps"" and reader-friendly summaries that any one who is reading it for academic reasons may feel a little undernourished. The big question is: who is this book for? With that aside, I found the book entertaining and engaging. The sheer volume of the text means it takes quite a while to get through it all, and one chapter at a time is more than enough. There's little chance of readers ploughing through this at speed because they can't wait to see what happens next. However, there is a payoff. In later chapters, the painfully long analysis of the early sections start to reappear and the relevance of everything starts to look more like a coherent theory than a series of musings on what things might be like if we take the time to think about them differently. This is rewarding due to the effort that has to be put in during the early stages of the book. It took me nearly 3 months to read it because it wasn't the book I thought it would be. I thought this was a handy overview of his ideas in a digestible form. It wasn't. Or rather it was, but in such gargantuan amounts of prose that it took me a while to churn through it, and bedtime reading became a non-starter. I still enjoyed it. It was still worth the effort, but had I not been in the mood to tackle it, I would have given up sooner. "
253,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99056689-katyen,4,"Daniel Dennett's book ""Consciousness Explained"" is currently one of the classic books on consciousness. In addition, it is one of the most important Dennett books he has ever written. I can also consider Daniel Dennett to be one of the most important representatives of contemporary philosophy of mind. The views he presents in the book are in many cases conservative and provocative, which was part of Dennett's goal, and this book has provoked much discussion, criticism, indignation, but also appreciation.Most critics accused Dennett of either not explaining consciousness in the book at all or rejecting it altogether. None of these views is true, on the contrary, Dennett tries to explain consciousness, but in a completely different way. Dennett does not try to say directly what consciousness is, but rather what consciousness does. Related to this is his rejection of the famous ""hard problem of consciousness"" and his replacement by the ""hard question"", which reads: And then what happens? (Dennett 1991, p. 255). In the book, he tries to explain and to some extent also summarize the knowledge about the brain from the cognitive sciences and neurosciences so far. Dennett himself is not only a philosopher but also a cognitive scientist, and even today he is actively involved in discussions of consciousness. The aim of the book is not so much to explain consciousness as to demystify it. That is, to point out that consciousness is a natural phenomenon in nature that arose during an evolutionary process that lasted millions of years. The fact that most authors consider consciousness to be mysterious and exceptional is more related to moral views on the uniqueness of human beings. This is exactly what Dennett tries to prove in the book and to point out that even if we remove the mysticism, there will still be beauty and space for new questions. As he claims:When we understand consciousness - when there is no more mystery - consciousness will be different, but there will still be beauty, and more room than ever for awe (Dennett 1991, pp. 25).Overall, I especially liked the book because of its new concept of consciousness, which was unconventional for the 90s of the 20th century. A possible downside to the book is that in some parts of the book, Dennett vaguely expresses his views, which may ultimately lead to Dennett's rejection of consciousness."
254,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"I was already aware of the bad fame of this book, and every time I saw it being referenced, I saw it as being referenced as a failure. As the typical saying goes ""consciousness explained away"". Nevertheless, I decided to give it a shot. I figured the bad reputation of the book was because it failed its goal and stated purpose, which was way too ambitious. But I figured I could still have a lot of value and insight into consciousness. But I was wrong. While it explained some characteristics of thought and consciousness, it didn't explain consciousness as such. I gave up and stopped reading briefly before halfway. I very rarely leave books unfinished, but I truly felt like it was a waste of time. Not only it didn't explain very much, but the writing itself is rather boring, and Dennett often shifts too laterally. While I usually appreciate this, I found it pointless and dull. I felt he often confused the validity of the experience of consciousness as phenomenology itself. The fact that your phenomenology leads you to a flawed assumption and you don't quite understand the mechanisms, doesn't in any way solve the actual problem of experiencing it, which is exactly the point. Coming up with heterophenomenology to make it more ""objective"" doesn't help very much. If it's accurate or not is almost irrelevant. Calling it a simple projection feels an equal cheap escape. This is my 2nd book from Dennett, the first being Breaking the Spell, which was similarly disappointing. I had a good impression of Dennet from a few his lectures that I watched, and after the disappointment of the first book I figured I'd give it another try, but looks like I'm fighting for a lost cause.I'm sure there are some good arguments and ideas in the book, I found the categorization of consciousness as being Orwelling or Stalinesque quite witty and useful for example, and the refutation of the Cartesian Theatre is solid, although it was beaten to death. But overall, I personally felt it wasn't worth the grinding."
255,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59307958-katy-koivastik,5,"References to consciousness in Sam Harris’ “Waking Up” reminded me of “Consciousness Explained” sitting unread in my library probably since it was first published in 1991. I decided to finally open it to see whether it would hold my interest all these years later.I earnestly powered through the first third of the book, and then pick and chose my way through the rest. There is a reason I am not a scientist, as I found the descriptions of the experiments boring, despite being written for the layman. The author does discuss the nature of memory and of the human tendency toward false and embellished memory, a topic I find unendingly fascinating. The book is peppered with quotations, and this one from novelist Ariel Dorfman on memory resonated: “I’m really not sure if others fail to perceive me or if, one fraction of a second after my face interferes with their horizon, a millionth of a second after they have cast their gaze on me, they already begin to wash me from their memory: forgotten before arriving at the scant, sad archangel of a remembrance.”I gave the book 5 stars because it is well written, includes wry cartoons, and can be understood by non-scientists. One quote from the author sums up the topic for me: “We, in contrast (to animals), are almost constantly engaged in presenting ourselves to others, and to ourselves, and hence representing ourselves — in language and gesture, external and internal. The most obvious difference in our environment that would explain this difference in our behavior is the behavior itself. Our human environment contains not just food and shelter, enemies to fight or flee, and conspecifics with whom to mate, but words, words, words. These words are potent elements of our environment that we readily incorporate, ingesting and extruding them, weaving them like spiderwebs into self-protective strings of narrative. ....when we let in these words, these meme-vehicles, they tend to take over, creating us out of the raw materials they find in our brains.”"
256,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7804740-paul,4,"Dennett's intention in this book is to defend and advance materialism, which is the idea that only matter exists, and that there are no other special things, like 'mind stuff' or the soul. The challenge which he addresses is to explain how something as complex, varied and wonderful as human consciousness could possibly originate 100% from the human brain. The subtext really should be 'Dualism Demolished', as he spends quite some time dismantling the idea that there must be some other medium or entity in which consciousness happens. As well the related idea of the 'Cartesian centre of consciousness', the idea that there is a central point in the brain where all of the senses, inputs and thinking comes together to become our consciousness.I'm a materialist myself, and as I work with computers, I don't have any objection to the idea that consciousness is some kind of 'virtual machine' that runs in the brain in a massively parallel way, which is an idea he presents. However, I must say that at times I found the book heavy going. Perhaps it's my fault that I thought the book belonged in the 'popular philosophy' category, which it certainly does not. This is a Serious Philosophical Work, and it's intended to make a Real Contribution to the science and philosophy of mind. It's chock full of references, annotations and asides. Dennett tries in every page to be as rational and scientific as possible. That's fine, but at times I found it wearing. While I agree with the broad thrust of what he's saying, there's plenty you could object to (such as the idea that you don't really experience sensory input, you only 'seem to'. Although it was published in 1991, it still felt relevant to me, due to timeless nature of the issues he addresses. Although I have no doubt that the argument has moved on a great deal since that time. Overall a great read, but not for the faint of heart."
257,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54462119-mohammadhossein-haqiqatkhah,4,"Daniel C. Dennett tends to prolixity when explaining the stuff. Although it's mainly focused on challenging Cartesian dualism, he introduces very interesting perspectives toward consciousness.All he tries to do in this book (and I believe he succeeds in it) is to suggest new metaphors to substitute the more intuitive metaphors the dualist theories provide. He digs very deeply into qualia and challenges almost every aspect of it. As he puts it:My explanation of consciousness is far from complete. One might even say that it was just a beginning, but it is a beginning, because it breaks the spell of the enchanted circle of ideas that made explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t replaced a metaphorical theory, the Cartesian Theater, with a nonmetaphorical (“literal, scientific”) theory. All I have done, really, is to replace one family of metaphors and images with another, trading in the Theater, the Witness, the Central Meaner, the Figment, for Software, Virtual Machines, Multiple Drafts, a Pandemonium of Homunculi. It’s just a war of metaphors, you say — but metaphors are not “just” metaphors; metaphors are the tools of thought. No one can think about consciousness without them, so it is important to equip yourself with the best set of tools available. Look what we have built with our tools. Could you have imagined it without them?He ends up, quite quickly, with a narrative theory of self and individual identity. It's an exotic view (let's say, journey) into the philosophy of consciousness, but it leaves many questions unaddressed. However, indeed, Consciousness Explained is a no-return point in your philosophical relationship with consciousness."
258,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"In a way Dennett feels like a curmudgeon about how the roots of the consciousness and the mind works in much the same way Richard Dawkins feels to me a curmudgeon about the roots of our biology. And just like Dawkins, I find him very convincing. Dennett is very much in line with other thinkers I've been reading like Douglas Hofstadter (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) and Michael S.A. Graziano (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) who see consciousness as an emergent property of the whole system of our brain rather than something that emerges from a single point or theater in the mind. His dialogues on the chinese room thought experiment and philosophical zombies were great on this point. There can be unconscious zombies or operators in the chinese rooms only if we propose a single theater that consciousness arises from. If we look at the larger system, it's clear that any philosophical zombie will all of the skills and insights of a human would indeed be a conscious system.This counterintuitive conclusion is something that we all seem to naturally battle because it strikes at the very nature of the self that is doing the intuiting. As Dennett wrote: ""Many people are afraid to see consciousness explained because they fear that if we succeed in explaining it, we will lose our moral bearings."" I suppose I can partially excuse some of my favorite thinkers like Yuval Noah Harari and Sam Harris for continuing to make claims that consciousness is still a fundamental mystery. I think what they mean is that we still haven't found the metaphors that allow us collectively to think about our minds in the way we think about our biology and the world around us. Dennett, in spite of his best attempt to reach a broad audience, is far too academic for my mother or my dentist and probably for me, but I'm hoping work from someone is on the way to help carry this torch."
259,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47952052-chloe-noland,3,"I'm not sure which is more convoluted: the topic of consciousness, or the author Dennett himself. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other, more mainstream styles of discussion regarding issues of science and morality, from authors like Harris and Pinker. The fact that Dennett's central thesis of this book -- deconstructing our ""intuitive"" but incorrect understanding of our conscious selves as a Cartesian witness sitting inside our brains, and replacing it with a Multiple Drafts Model of cognition that supports the way our minds truly process, adapt, & repeat in order to make conscious choices and actions -- is written in an extremely self-referential and conceited style, to the point that it distracts from the thesis itself, and weighs down a lot of Dennett's brilliant observations and theories with nods to his own superiority over his colleagues, including at least one citation to the author's other works on every other page. Basically, I wish he had just shared his ideas in a more neutral and simplistic way. The theories themselves are not hard to understand, although do require commitment to what Dennett is asking of the reader -- to put aside everything they think they understand about what consciousness is and how our minds operate. After this, it's just Dennett's world and we're living in it: in showing how our brains evolved to their current levels of complexity through a complicated process of trial and error, shaping and reshaping, layering new information on top of old, Dennett illuminates many processes of cognition that provide new and consequential insights into why we tell stories, how identities are formed, and what these narratives mean for our continuing evolution -- the least of which is that no such thing as a SELF really exists, or has ever existed. I just wish he had cut back on the running side commentary. "

Dennett tackles a very difficult problem in a beautifully written work of philosophy (+a bit of cognitive science).Slowly, the author dismantles the myth of the ""Cartesian theater"", or the idea that past perception, and the parallel neural processes going on in the brain, content is ""presented"" to a fictitious viewer. There is no such ""Audience"". Thinking is thought. There is no ""central hub"" where everything ""comes together"", and Dennett introduces ""Multiple Drafts"" to give consciousness an elementary stab.Then Dennett compares consciousness as a sort of serial (illusory) program running on the parallel brain. This part I'm not super convinced about, thinking of a computer as subsystems of information processing is useful in some ways but maybe we need more models and analogies besides the Von Neumann architecture.What about the ""language"" that we think in? Dennett refutes a ""Central Meaner"", and instead replaces it with a ""Pandemonium"", multiple neural pathways in our head all having something to say.Dennett also discusses the evolution of consciousness, problems with folk psychology, Libet's experiments and temporal inference, and philosophical problems like ""In the Mind's eye"", ""Mary the scientist"", Searle's ""Chinese Room"", ""What is it like to be a bat""...There was a lot of thought provoking content in this book. The idea of the self as a ""center of narrative gravity"", an abstract concept, instead of some dualistic ""brain pearl"" was illuminating for me. Book is kinda old, probably there are more up-to-date ones, but I'd say this is still extremely well worth the time for anyone curious in the nature of the mind."
261,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74862840-cary-giese,3,"Consciousness is the ability of humans to be aware of their own mind. “I think, therefore I am,” per Rene Descartes of the 17th century, is still the prevailing understanding. The book’s author explained, in excessive detail, what was known or believed in 1991, namely a confusion of ideas from the disciplines of psychology, philosophy and science. No real progress! No advanced ideas beyond Descartes’ description since then. More theses, no consensus! It does seem that each persons consciousness is unique to them! Each of us has sole awareness of our self! Our soul?? There is an underlying belief that our human consciousness is an evolved state resulting from the creative processes of evolution. Now the question is: Can Artificial Intelligence develop consciousness through a similar creative process, to become unique, super smart “silicone individuals,” competing with humans? Wow! The question is: how can we use and manage Artificial Intelligece without it surpassing us? I need to read more updated studies to understand this more! I will if they exist, most books on the subject date to the 1980-90’s! This book provides the questions, no answers, and only speculations. Though the book is credited as the landmark start of the discussion! For that, Dennett deserves respect for providing a foundation reading!"
262,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914286-sarah,2,"I was really interested in this work for about the first 200 pages. One of the biggest drawbacks is that this text was published in 1991 (almost 30 years ago); and the author uses a lot of illustrations and arguments from the science and philosophy of artificial intelligence. That science has changed so much in the last 30 years. Also, I have no real science or philosophy background, so I found parts of this a tough go. The early chapters, when the author was trying to define consciousness were the best for me - he raised a number of ideas and issues that I found fascinating. Not only about how speech developed, but when did we start talking to ourselves? And the importance of that action. You have to think of yourself as a self to bother speaking. Not to mention, how do we hear our own voices (or our parents voices, etc) in our heads? No sound is actually being generated; yet our brain gives it to us as if playing a recording. How do you ""hear"" when you are 100 percent by passing your auditory system? Same thing with ""seeing"" things in your head. But as the book dragged on, I lost interest and felt more and more lost in his endless responses to others ideas of consciousness. In the end, he never did explain consciousness to me. I just kept falling asleep whenever I picked up this book - so I very lightly skimmed the last 200 pages and called it a day."

Dennett undoubtedly makes a thought provoking case for how we ought to look at consciousness, perhaps shaking a fair few my previously held ideas regarding the soundness of epiphenomenalism and philosophical zombies. The examples regarding tastes, and the experience of an acquired taste, as a phenomenon that changes over time versus your conscious experience of the taste of said phenomenon changing, seems quite crucial in considering the relevance of consciousness as explained via external objective measures. His last section addressing the issue of 'explaining' a phenomenon versus 'explaining away' said phenomenon was also a nice touch. I agree with his conclusion that he has at the very least started the explanation; perhaps he wouldn't have gotten so much heat for this book if he reconsidered the tense of his verbiage when drawing up a title. A simple gerund could likely have made others' perception of him and his work much more palatable, though with some further pressure, their conscious experience of his work could perhaps become acquired as well :)"
264,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21625655-chase-mcclendon,4,"I was between 3 and 4 stars on this book. On the one hand, it’s impressive to view Dennett attempt to topple (and replace) what he views as a misinformed view of what consciousness is. Naturally, something as familiar to us as our own consciousness will carry with it a certain obviousness about the mechanisms and features of that consciousness. Dennett’s task is to show you that although you may be the observer, you don’t have a claim to infallibility over the mechanisms that produce your experience, only the effects of those mechanisms. My problem with the book was that oftentimes Dennett‘s writing seems filled with unnecessary jargon. While I understand that in a book that tries to do no less than explain consciousness there will be some requisite wordiness, I was left with the feeling that if only Dennett was a more pithy writer, his points would’ve landed with more force. Many times throughout the book I would finish a section and feel that I had missed an aspect of an argument that Dennett supposed would win me over in dramatic fashion.All this said, I enjoyed Dennett’s method and although I may still have subtle bonds to my old ways of thinking about consciousness, Dennett has done much to weaken and replace them."
265,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79330012-arthur-ryman,4,"Definitely worth the read, but not exactly what I was hoping for or what is advertised in the title. A more accurate title would be ""Consciousness Explained Away"". I am in full agreement with Dennett's basic position, namely that the brain is a computing device. However, Dennett does not explain the basic phenomenon of awareness. Rather, he substitutes the term ""dispositional state"". Disappointing. I decided to read this, and similar works, because I felt that physics lacked the conceptual vocabulary to talk about awareness, that abundantly obvious feeling that we are observers. Coincidentally, quantum mechanics, although spectacularly successful, relies on the injection of an observer to collapse superpositions of states into an actual observation. In the absence of a better explanation from Dennett and his colleagues, I'll simply tell myself that awareness is what collapsing wave functions feel like. :-)"

(the quotes are not actual quotes but my paraphrasing).It was like a constant tease, I guess to keep you hooked, while he rambled on with his filler. But after a while of this not stop filler with teases, I got fed up and put the book down. I did not even bother to skip to the end.

Then from the middle, he seemed to want to clean up for later and remove a central ""meaner"" for consciousness and describe his multiple drafts theory so that he can link up any ol' robot to a zombified human state, since there isn't one ""perfect"" setup for an human mind. Then from a negative direction cut up phenomenology and then remove qualia, which for some reason was so important for him to do, and then say we've landed somewhere in the middle, along with the robots he's described.It is a fun read with plenty of interesting pop psychology experiments.Overall, an account of what it might look like to explain consciousness away.

It's hard to argue with someone as smart as Dennett, he sets traps, finds the perfect arguments, and is just so undeniably smarter and prepared than any of us, which is one of the reasons why I have to remain slightly skeptical about his final premise.He has succeeded in making me see his argument, and though it still remains closer to a philosophical one than a scientific one, it's the best one I've heard so far and the one that explains consciousness the best while not falling for metaphysical interpretations at all.Great book.

277,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71339698-nour-elhuda-zuraiki,3,"When I finally finished reading this book all I was thinking about is: ‘’ I wish I could have a chance of smoking pot with Dennett watching Westworld’’Here is my advice if you want to read this book and really enjoy it: first, have an open mind, yes don’t disagree from the first thing you encounter, the book is challenging and it subconsciously demands from you to unlink your intuitions about your inner experiences to wrap your head around other alternatives. Secondly, there might seem to be contradiction in the book which you’ll unravel especially when you reach the core purpose of it (chapter 5) but remember the ‘’psychoanalysis Party Game’’ when Dennett talked about in the early chapters concluding at the end: ‘’ In such a cycle, one’s current expectations and interests shape hypotheses for one’s perceptual systems to confirm or disconfirm, and a rapid sequence of such hypothesis generations and confirmations produces the ultimate product, the ongoing, updated ‘’model’’ of the world of perceived ….All we suppose is that the illusionist goes into an arbitrary confirmation mode and the victim provides the content by asking the questions’’. This is very much applied to every concept introduced in the book, for instance when Dennett mentions the thought experiment ‘’Mary the Colour Scientist’’ he presumes that your brain has made the assumption that knowing every physical fact about a colour is the same as knowing a lot about the colour. Now Dennett concludes that if Mary really did know every physical fact about a colour yellow, she will be to know what yellow is like by entirely anticipating her entire cognitive simulation and response to the stimulus.Now Dennett introduces a model for the mental processes that we call consciousness where he claims ‘’some of the most perplexing paradoxes of consciousness arise because we cling too long to a good habit of thought, a habit that usually keeps us out of trouble’’ he starts of by laying down what we need to establish to build a model he revisits Descartes Cartesian Theatre-where all the aspects of a profound experience come together to provide a unified phenomenal world- he discusses why this model cannot work by maintaining that there is no single point for which it all has to come together for central processing so he then introduces ‘’The Multiple Drafts Model’’ where According it, ‘’all varieties of perception- indeed, all varieties of thought or mental activity- are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous "" here Dennett then emphasis that this model makes the discrimination that ‘’ the brain just adjusts to the conclusion that is drawn, making the new interpretation of the information available for the modulation of subsequent behaviour’’.In conclusion, Dennett believes that instead for the consciousness to be at a single point he imagines it described as a virtual machine like a computer that is built on top of a different system, it is a linear, sequential machine that is built on top of a massively parallel structure which in this case is the brain.Now this is a very short summary of the book, of course the book is so rich with information, starting from Descartes’ Dualism and the Cartesian Theatre then explaining that there’s no Theatre in the first place to introducing many thoughts experiments to get you ready to absorb the new way of thinking about consciousness, getting a grasp on how your inner mental life might have come. It is subtly profound and valuable. It’s like Dennett looks at consciousness as the brain’s way of making sense of the world around us. For me personally it was an astonishing whole new worldview to form and just like any other worldview, it does have its complexities and assumptions but that doesn’t mean that it is not logical to consider, I suppose when I’m having this worldview of the denial of consciousness and the experience (According to Dennett) I become more of a depressed person who doesn’t seem to find meaning of anything around, having the idea that what we perceive as reality is subjective and what we think is the objective reality is only hypothetical since or senses are flawed and limited is an unescapable truth.At the end I’m only an amature philosopher, a curious human mind that like to share her views assertively yet tactfully. "
278,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37283541-fran-cavanagh,4,"This is a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain. At least, it's a great introduction to the science of the workings of the human brain as was understood to be the case nearly 30 years ago. Honestly, I felt Dennett's summary of the cognitive science behind perception, attention, memory and language stood up very well despite the book's age, so that isn't much of a criticism. While there have obviously been many developments in these fields since Dennett was writing, much of the same base material has been covered in my 2020-era Psychology Masters programme. This is also a great introduction to some of the key philosophical debates regarding consciousness, human and otherwise (although, as very much a non-philosopher, I'm not sure I'd be able to identify if it wasn't). I'm not sure Dennett fully marries these two strands together to put forward a fully satisfying view on the nature of human consciousness.I can get on board with Dennett's ""Multiple Drafts"" view of human perception, as far as I understand it. It's backed up by a significant body of literature in Psychology and Neuroscience that suggests that our experience of reality is a lot choppier and less constant or consistent than it appears. I can also agree, as a result, that the ""Cartesian Theatre"" and the idea of one centralised observer self doesn't make a whole lot of scientific sense. But none of this, for me, touches on the question of what the consciousness that we experience in ourselves and others actually is, or how it appears. Dennett again makes a very convincing case that our brains can be seen as effectively very complicated supercomputers, and that a non-biological supercomputer that worked exactly like the brain would be functionally indistinguishable from the brain. Dennett also puts forward fascinating points, building principally on the work of Dawkins and Levelt, about language and ideas and how these grow and propagate between our brains and across societies. There's truly a lot of fascinating and valid discussion here, and Dennett is clearly much more knowledgeable and generally intelligent than I could ever hope to be. I appreciated hearing his synthesised perspective on all of these topics. Again, though, I was still left feeling that he didn't fully explore or explain how consciousness emerges from this biological supercomputer we call the brain. The book also doesn't really directly discuss in any depth what consciousness is, how it functions, or why. This book is apparently often re-titled by its critics as ""Consciousness Explained Away"". This seems a little unfair. Dennett makes it very clear in his closing remarks that he believes that consciousness is a ""thing"". I'm just still not convinced that I understand how the mechanisms and functions and processes he describes in great detail in this book add up to the consciousness that he stresses he believes exists.The entry for Consciousness in the 1989 Macmillan Dictionary of Psychology offers a succinctly damning description: “The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings: awareness… Nothing worth reading has been written about it.” I'm not sure this book provided a counterexample to that definition, but I'm also of half a mind to believe that it's impossible for us to truly understand the nature of consciousness, at least with the scientific tools currently at our disposal. I suspect that Dennett would feel very differently about that proposition, and that there may be some fundamental definitional disconnects at play between whatever school of philosophy I fall into and the largely functionalist worldview inhabited by Dennett. An impasse I'm honestly under-equipped to fully describe. Philosophical disagreements about the nature of the subject matter aside, then, this was a really well put-together, intelligent and enjoyable read. One I expect I'll return to a lot."
279,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,3,"Following my readings on history and future of humanity, I wanted to explore the question of “what is humanity”? and why super intelligent machines lack “humanity” despite their superior intelligence? If it's not intelligence that makes us human then it must be “consciousness”, or that continuous stream of subjective experiences, feelings and emotions that flow through our brain every second of our waking hours. What exactly is it? and how does it happen is an unsolved mystery despite significant advances in neurosciences, biology, psychology and computing. Therefore, a book titled “Consciousness Explained” seemed like exactly the right book I need.This book is not my first reading on intelligence but it is the first on consciousness and I have to say it was a disappointing start, the book is overly academic and lacks the story telling convenience I got so used to that I now expect from any writer who respects their audience. It’s not my job to clean up an author’s mess and order it into concise narrative. It should be the job of the one who got paid to write in the first place. Anyway, back to consciousness. The book tries to replace the traditional view with a different view that is better supported by evidence from experimental neuroscience. The Traditional view is called the “Cartesian theater” where basically all sensory information is projected in a theater-like area of the brain that is continuously monitored by “the mind” or “the conscious soul” that is continuously issuing commands to different body parts in response to the information presented to it. This view is obviously wrong for multiple reasons, first because neuroscience can not find such area in the brain and more importantly, because this creates an infinite recursive loop of ""what, then, is the mind of that mind, ... etc?""The alternative model is the “multiple drafts” model where different but connected brain regions unconsciously and simultaneously develop several subjective experience narratives, each has a partial draft of the story and some even have a plan for action, however, these competing experiences get filtered by higher level brain areas (probably in the frontal cortex) that decide which narrative/plan of action should get the highest priority based on millions of years of natural selection design followed by several years of cultural training in the surrounding environment. This explains why conscious experience of all humans is genetically sensitive to snakes, the color red, and vertical symmetry (faces) while each human culture is sensitive to specific environmental memes like jokes, beliefs and local common sense.The evidence for this model comes in two variants: (1) logical: because a virtual machine of consciousness that is made up of several subconscious components escapes the recursive flaw of the Cartesian theater model. (2) It has been proven recently by neuroscience that decisions are made in the brain a few milliseconds BEFORE we become “conscious” of making them, and not the other way around.At the end, I don't think I have a satisfactory understanding of consciousness, but to have my consciousness explained in just one book was an audacious goal in the first place. The book, although useful, could have been written in a much better way and could have left out so many useless details. So, if interested in consciousness, wait till I find you a better book to read."
280,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060524-robert-fischer,4,"Rhetorically, this book is a masterpiece. Without a doubt, Dennett is a master of the persuasive argument, and he pulls out all the stops here: see the gradual shifts in word choice (""the familiar Cartesian Theater"" at the beginning morphs by the end into ""our old nemesis, the Cartesian Theater""), very carefully chosen metaphorical models in order to pull in all kinds of technological magic, the way he performs a mea culpa without actually admitting guilt near the end of the book, and prevalent rhetorical questions and blanket declarations to mask over the places where things are most awkward. It's really well done. If it weren't for the theoretical issues (really, one major theoretical issue), this would easily be a 5 star book. It is both rigorous yet accessible, and it is a wonderfully enjoyable exploration of consciousness and its limitations. The book has a lot to teach people about their own self-experience, even (and especially!) those who aren't prone to agree with him (such as me). To borrow a term Dennett uses to describe a fellow philosopher's work, this book is an ""instructive failure"". It's definitely worth your time to read.I read this book, however, with a particular question in mind: when I see something in my mind's eye, where does that image reside? (Note that I have a vivid mind's eye — some people don't even have a mind's eye at all, and don't even know they're missing one! See this Discover article for more.) This book was referred to me because it was apparently a solid materialist argument and explanation. Unfortunately, Dennett simply doesn't have an answer for that question. His rhetoric obscures that fact very well (although he cops to side-stepping questions of ""the nature of things"" in Appendix A), but ultimately he takes a functionalist approach, and that handily does away with the very evidence which I was looking for him to explain.To see how this happens, it is first necessary to realize that we can't actually prove anyone else is conscious in the same sense we are. As was popularized in The Matrix, we could be dreaming and not realizing it, and everyone else could be projections of our own consciousness. Like in A Beautiful Mind (SPOILER ALERT), we could be populating our experience with non-existent people. No test proves anything more than the fact that it is a very clever illusion or bit of calculation going on — but, ultimately, our own consciousness is uniquely experienced by us. Everyone else could be a zombie (in the philosophical sense), and we have no way to know differently. This is not the point Dennett starts with, but it's implicit within Dennett's functionalist approach. The move Dennett makes is to then project that back on to us, and say that we, too, have no consciousness in any real sense. How could you prove differently to anyone else? What objectively accessible function can you perform as a conscious entity which these potentially unconscious entities could not?The problem is that the experience of having consciousness — not just computational complexity or a narrative world, but some ""audience in a Cartesian Theater"" — is not simply a ""doctrine"" (that word choice is a great example of Dennett's excellent and subtle rhetorical moves), but stems from evidence. It's not functional-objective evidence, but it is evidence none the less. That evidence is the experience of having consciousness. As much as you chip away at what the consciousness is and does (and Dennett does that excellently), there is always still an ""I"" which is having the experience. That's the whole point of Descartes, and Dennett simply does not feel the need to account for it, instead presenting the epistemological limitations of his ""heterophenomonology"" as ontological statements. But a map is not the territory, and a scientific model is not the thing itself. Simply because heterophenomonology cannot take with subjective evidence seriously does not mean that subjective evidence should not be taken seriously. This point is very poetically (and popularly) driven home in Nature, Man and Woman, and Dennett is aware of it, but simply dismisses it as not relevant. If you read through my progress in this book, you'll see lots of places where those dismissals are explicitly identified, because they drove me nuts. (Here's an example.)To a certain extent, though, he is right: phenomonology is not relevant within the context of science, where heterophenomenology is sufficient. As a text in cognitive science, Dennett's approach is really insightful and makes many challenging points. In the world of philosophy, though, the phenomonology needs to be accounted for. It's not philosophically sufficient to assume an air of ""anthropological"" condescension towards at least our own phenomonology — that's discounting a vital piece of evidence without basis, and if it cannot be accounted for, then consciousness (at least our own consciousness) is insufficiently explained. Dennett claims that consciousness is just an illusion — but who is perceiving the illusion? If it is a deception, who is being deceived? That claim is actually begging the question, and Dennett responds by retreating to functionalism, and saying it is our memories that are being deceived. But I do not simply remember being conscious — I am conscious of being conscious! But that sentence doesn't even make sense in the functionalist conception. But Dennett seems to be paraphrasing Groucho Marx: ""Who are you going to believe? Me or your own mind's eye?""It is notable at this point, though, to mention that the kind of ""anthropological"" condescension Dennett advocates has actually come under an extreme kind of fire as a Eurocentric and fundamentally racist pattern of thought which results not in real knowledge, but more in generating a hybrid of European presumptions and European interpretative ""data"". For more on this point, see Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference. I bring this up because so much of the argumentation feels like 19th century thinking, not 21st century thinking, and the model Dennett proposes reads more like an artifact of philosophy's own artifices and methodologies than an account of reality. Appeals to the specialness of language (strictly conceived), to Newtonian physics, and conflations between non-materialism and dualism really reinforce that sense.On top of all of this, Dennett builds heavily upon ideas of evolutionary psychology and memes, which are roundly destroyed as non-scientific materialistic doctrines in The Spiritual Brain: A Neuroscientist's Case for the Existence of the Soul. There is also some significant ethological (""animal-psychological"") claims about the communication and cognition of animals which are simply empirically wrong given research done by people like Marc Bekoff. And the idea that we could have immortality by ""copying our brain's software"" is not very comforting to this particular copy (a point made well in The Prestige). There is no serious engagement with psi or spirituality, as though they are self-evidently irrelevant to discussions of consciousness.With all these complaints, however, the book still gets 4 stars. It's definitely worth a read, and it is really an eye-opening revelation of just how complicated the apparently simple idea of ""the conscious mind"" really is. Highly suggested."
281,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260292-erik,2,"2091: one hundred years ago philosophers wrote books using words like ""consciousness,"" ""qualia,"" ""functionalism,"" ""materialism,"" and ""zombie,"" words which have since been banned for the sake of the public good. You see philosophers, without actually asking themselves what these words meant, used to debate with each other by filling the blanks in arguments with these words and moving them around like rebus tiles, inventing more and more recondite scenarios for their use and claiming to refute their opponents with sheer tour de force applications of logic. I think you can see why someone had to put a stop to this.More seriously, it does seem uncontroversial to me that the neurons underlying color perception and other sensations can be affected by further causal relations to judgments and object perceptions (it has been known for more than 100 years!). Does this mean sensations are simply a network of discriminatory judgments and their concreteness an illusion of being embedded in a network of such judgments? No because they are realized by the effective physical powers expressed in the sensations. It is probably true that a space of colors could be simulated in a machine or even a computer program. For example if a machine were charged with navigating a space of numbered points and could carry out rotations, translations etc. on these points and if the machine had a way of specifying its own position in the manifold and representations of the other points and distances and directions, it would make sense to say the machine carries an internal representation that would ""seem to it like living in a space."" Why not? But the physical realization would matter too. It isn't just the structure that matters but the stuff too. If the color space were navigated by a color observer then certainly I could buy the idea that the representation would seem to it like sensing (its own) colors. But the same colors as those expressed by the physics of the human brain? Doubtful, unless the relevant physical realization was exactly duplicated, by electrical -chemical signals for example. The idea that the sensations are nothing but an artifact of being in a certain representation regardless of how it is realized, this seems to ignore the fact that the physical realization must matter too. Proof: take two such realizations and let them interact in one big representation. Because the causal roles of the materials are different those differences also have further causal roles in relation to each other and would be manifested as such, so the non-identity would be revealed immediately. Dennett claims that if discriminatory judgments are divorced from their qualitative appearance this leads to absurdity, but how can these roles be separated at all if sensations are also physical and if their qualitative appearance is a result of their configured causal powers? By separating them you are leaving out some of their causal roles and the thought experiment is impossible. He doesn't even consider any of this. I'm not impartial to this discussion (see my Realistic Empiricism) but the concrete physical reality of sensation seems hard to deny if it is there in the cells."
282,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879607-benjamin,4,"I saw a quote somewhere (in a David Chalmers book but not by Chalmers himself) that basically pointed out that the fact that we are conscious beings means that we've never really said anything of interest about consciousness. It's both so obvious as to be self-evident, and yet so ineffable that it can't be spoken about clearly. This double-edged sword is what Dennett tackles. He wants to challenge the view that conscious is this thing that we known intrinsically from a first-person perspective, whilst also undermining any claim that it cannot be spoken about clearly. What is required is a rethinking of the very assumptions we make about our conscious minds in light of what we discover from everything from neuroscience to AI, from anthropology to zoology, and start to shut down the Cartesian Theatre once and for all.The results are a mixed bag. Dennett's eye for detail, need to make sure you've fully understood every nuance of his point and dedication to defending himself against any predicted counter-argument mean that the book is immense, long and quite a slog. This is partly where my criticism of the text emerges. For a book of popular philosophy combined with popular science, this is dense and detailed. It isn't a simple overview of his key ideas that any engrossed reader can follow up afterwards. He covers every angle, every philosophical nook and cranny, until he feels he has exhausted the discussion. On the other hand, the book is so filled with simplifications, metaphors, ""intuition pumps"" and reader-friendly summaries that any one who is reading it for academic reasons may feel a little undernourished. The big question is: who is this book for? With that aside, I found the book entertaining and engaging. The sheer volume of the text means it takes quite a while to get through it all, and one chapter at a time is more than enough. There's little chance of readers ploughing through this at speed because they can't wait to see what happens next. However, there is a payoff. In later chapters, the painfully long analysis of the early sections start to reappear and the relevance of everything starts to look more like a coherent theory than a series of musings on what things might be like if we take the time to think about them differently. This is rewarding due to the effort that has to be put in during the early stages of the book. It took me nearly 3 months to read it because it wasn't the book I thought it would be. I thought this was a handy overview of his ideas in a digestible form. It wasn't. Or rather it was, but in such gargantuan amounts of prose that it took me a while to churn through it, and bedtime reading became a non-starter. I still enjoyed it. It was still worth the effort, but had I not been in the mood to tackle it, I would have given up sooner. "
283,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99056689-katyen,4,"Daniel Dennett's book ""Consciousness Explained"" is currently one of the classic books on consciousness. In addition, it is one of the most important Dennett books he has ever written. I can also consider Daniel Dennett to be one of the most important representatives of contemporary philosophy of mind. The views he presents in the book are in many cases conservative and provocative, which was part of Dennett's goal, and this book has provoked much discussion, criticism, indignation, but also appreciation.Most critics accused Dennett of either not explaining consciousness in the book at all or rejecting it altogether. None of these views is true, on the contrary, Dennett tries to explain consciousness, but in a completely different way. Dennett does not try to say directly what consciousness is, but rather what consciousness does. Related to this is his rejection of the famous ""hard problem of consciousness"" and his replacement by the ""hard question"", which reads: And then what happens? (Dennett 1991, p. 255). In the book, he tries to explain and to some extent also summarize the knowledge about the brain from the cognitive sciences and neurosciences so far. Dennett himself is not only a philosopher but also a cognitive scientist, and even today he is actively involved in discussions of consciousness. The aim of the book is not so much to explain consciousness as to demystify it. That is, to point out that consciousness is a natural phenomenon in nature that arose during an evolutionary process that lasted millions of years. The fact that most authors consider consciousness to be mysterious and exceptional is more related to moral views on the uniqueness of human beings. This is exactly what Dennett tries to prove in the book and to point out that even if we remove the mysticism, there will still be beauty and space for new questions. As he claims:When we understand consciousness - when there is no more mystery - consciousness will be different, but there will still be beauty, and more room than ever for awe (Dennett 1991, pp. 25).Overall, I especially liked the book because of its new concept of consciousness, which was unconventional for the 90s of the 20th century. A possible downside to the book is that in some parts of the book, Dennett vaguely expresses his views, which may ultimately lead to Dennett's rejection of consciousness."
284,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,2,"I was already aware of the bad fame of this book, and every time I saw it being referenced, I saw it as being referenced as a failure. As the typical saying goes ""consciousness explained away"". Nevertheless, I decided to give it a shot. I figured the bad reputation of the book was because it failed its goal and stated purpose, which was way too ambitious. But I figured I could still have a lot of value and insight into consciousness. But I was wrong. While it explained some characteristics of thought and consciousness, it didn't explain consciousness as such. I gave up and stopped reading briefly before halfway. I very rarely leave books unfinished, but I truly felt like it was a waste of time. Not only it didn't explain very much, but the writing itself is rather boring, and Dennett often shifts too laterally. While I usually appreciate this, I found it pointless and dull. I felt he often confused the validity of the experience of consciousness as phenomenology itself. The fact that your phenomenology leads you to a flawed assumption and you don't quite understand the mechanisms, doesn't in any way solve the actual problem of experiencing it, which is exactly the point. Coming up with heterophenomenology to make it more ""objective"" doesn't help very much. If it's accurate or not is almost irrelevant. Calling it a simple projection feels an equal cheap escape. This is my 2nd book from Dennett, the first being Breaking the Spell, which was similarly disappointing. I had a good impression of Dennet from a few his lectures that I watched, and after the disappointment of the first book I figured I'd give it another try, but looks like I'm fighting for a lost cause.I'm sure there are some good arguments and ideas in the book, I found the categorization of consciousness as being Orwelling or Stalinesque quite witty and useful for example, and the refutation of the Cartesian Theatre is solid, although it was beaten to death. But overall, I personally felt it wasn't worth the grinding."
285,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59307958-katy-koivastik,5,"References to consciousness in Sam Harris’ “Waking Up” reminded me of “Consciousness Explained” sitting unread in my library probably since it was first published in 1991. I decided to finally open it to see whether it would hold my interest all these years later.I earnestly powered through the first third of the book, and then pick and chose my way through the rest. There is a reason I am not a scientist, as I found the descriptions of the experiments boring, despite being written for the layman. The author does discuss the nature of memory and of the human tendency toward false and embellished memory, a topic I find unendingly fascinating. The book is peppered with quotations, and this one from novelist Ariel Dorfman on memory resonated: “I’m really not sure if others fail to perceive me or if, one fraction of a second after my face interferes with their horizon, a millionth of a second after they have cast their gaze on me, they already begin to wash me from their memory: forgotten before arriving at the scant, sad archangel of a remembrance.”I gave the book 5 stars because it is well written, includes wry cartoons, and can be understood by non-scientists. One quote from the author sums up the topic for me: “We, in contrast (to animals), are almost constantly engaged in presenting ourselves to others, and to ourselves, and hence representing ourselves — in language and gesture, external and internal. The most obvious difference in our environment that would explain this difference in our behavior is the behavior itself. Our human environment contains not just food and shelter, enemies to fight or flee, and conspecifics with whom to mate, but words, words, words. These words are potent elements of our environment that we readily incorporate, ingesting and extruding them, weaving them like spiderwebs into self-protective strings of narrative. ....when we let in these words, these meme-vehicles, they tend to take over, creating us out of the raw materials they find in our brains.”"
286,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7804740-paul,4,"Dennett's intention in this book is to defend and advance materialism, which is the idea that only matter exists, and that there are no other special things, like 'mind stuff' or the soul. The challenge which he addresses is to explain how something as complex, varied and wonderful as human consciousness could possibly originate 100% from the human brain. The subtext really should be 'Dualism Demolished', as he spends quite some time dismantling the idea that there must be some other medium or entity in which consciousness happens. As well the related idea of the 'Cartesian centre of consciousness', the idea that there is a central point in the brain where all of the senses, inputs and thinking comes together to become our consciousness.I'm a materialist myself, and as I work with computers, I don't have any objection to the idea that consciousness is some kind of 'virtual machine' that runs in the brain in a massively parallel way, which is an idea he presents. However, I must say that at times I found the book heavy going. Perhaps it's my fault that I thought the book belonged in the 'popular philosophy' category, which it certainly does not. This is a Serious Philosophical Work, and it's intended to make a Real Contribution to the science and philosophy of mind. It's chock full of references, annotations and asides. Dennett tries in every page to be as rational and scientific as possible. That's fine, but at times I found it wearing. While I agree with the broad thrust of what he's saying, there's plenty you could object to (such as the idea that you don't really experience sensory input, you only 'seem to'. Although it was published in 1991, it still felt relevant to me, due to timeless nature of the issues he addresses. Although I have no doubt that the argument has moved on a great deal since that time. Overall a great read, but not for the faint of heart."
287,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54462119-mohammadhossein-haqiqatkhah,4,"Daniel C. Dennett tends to prolixity when explaining the stuff. Although it's mainly focused on challenging Cartesian dualism, he introduces very interesting perspectives toward consciousness.All he tries to do in this book (and I believe he succeeds in it) is to suggest new metaphors to substitute the more intuitive metaphors the dualist theories provide. He digs very deeply into qualia and challenges almost every aspect of it. As he puts it:My explanation of consciousness is far from complete. One might even say that it was just a beginning, but it is a beginning, because it breaks the spell of the enchanted circle of ideas that made explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t explaining consciousness seem impossible. I haven’t replaced a metaphorical theory, the Cartesian Theater, with a nonmetaphorical (“literal, scientific”) theory. All I have done, really, is to replace one family of metaphors and images with another, trading in the Theater, the Witness, the Central Meaner, the Figment, for Software, Virtual Machines, Multiple Drafts, a Pandemonium of Homunculi. It’s just a war of metaphors, you say — but metaphors are not “just” metaphors; metaphors are the tools of thought. No one can think about consciousness without them, so it is important to equip yourself with the best set of tools available. Look what we have built with our tools. Could you have imagined it without them?He ends up, quite quickly, with a narrative theory of self and individual identity. It's an exotic view (let's say, journey) into the philosophy of consciousness, but it leaves many questions unaddressed. However, indeed, Consciousness Explained is a no-return point in your philosophical relationship with consciousness."
288,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7935166-david,5,"In a way Dennett feels like a curmudgeon about how the roots of the consciousness and the mind works in much the same way Richard Dawkins feels to me a curmudgeon about the roots of our biology. And just like Dawkins, I find him very convincing. Dennett is very much in line with other thinkers I've been reading like Douglas Hofstadter (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) and Michael S.A. Graziano (https://www.goodreads.com/author/show...) who see consciousness as an emergent property of the whole system of our brain rather than something that emerges from a single point or theater in the mind. His dialogues on the chinese room thought experiment and philosophical zombies were great on this point. There can be unconscious zombies or operators in the chinese rooms only if we propose a single theater that consciousness arises from. If we look at the larger system, it's clear that any philosophical zombie will all of the skills and insights of a human would indeed be a conscious system.This counterintuitive conclusion is something that we all seem to naturally battle because it strikes at the very nature of the self that is doing the intuiting. As Dennett wrote: ""Many people are afraid to see consciousness explained because they fear that if we succeed in explaining it, we will lose our moral bearings."" I suppose I can partially excuse some of my favorite thinkers like Yuval Noah Harari and Sam Harris for continuing to make claims that consciousness is still a fundamental mystery. I think what they mean is that we still haven't found the metaphors that allow us collectively to think about our minds in the way we think about our biology and the world around us. Dennett, in spite of his best attempt to reach a broad audience, is far too academic for my mother or my dentist and probably for me, but I'm hoping work from someone is on the way to help carry this torch."
289,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47952052-chloe-noland,3,"I'm not sure which is more convoluted: the topic of consciousness, or the author Dennett himself. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other, more mainstream styles of discussion regarding issues of science and morality, from authors like Harris and Pinker. The fact that Dennett's central thesis of this book -- deconstructing our ""intuitive"" but incorrect understanding of our conscious selves as a Cartesian witness sitting inside our brains, and replacing it with a Multiple Drafts Model of cognition that supports the way our minds truly process, adapt, & repeat in order to make conscious choices and actions -- is written in an extremely self-referential and conceited style, to the point that it distracts from the thesis itself, and weighs down a lot of Dennett's brilliant observations and theories with nods to his own superiority over his colleagues, including at least one citation to the author's other works on every other page. Basically, I wish he had just shared his ideas in a more neutral and simplistic way. The theories themselves are not hard to understand, although do require commitment to what Dennett is asking of the reader -- to put aside everything they think they understand about what consciousness is and how our minds operate. After this, it's just Dennett's world and we're living in it: in showing how our brains evolved to their current levels of complexity through a complicated process of trial and error, shaping and reshaping, layering new information on top of old, Dennett illuminates many processes of cognition that provide new and consequential insights into why we tell stories, how identities are formed, and what these narratives mean for our continuing evolution -- the least of which is that no such thing as a SELF really exists, or has ever existed. I just wish he had cut back on the running side commentary. "
290,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75618360-tien-manh,5,"What is subjective experience? When I imagine a purple cow, the purpleness ""feels"" purple to ""me"". Who is this ""me""? Dennett tackles a very difficult problem in a beautifully written work of philosophy (+a bit of cognitive science).Slowly, the author dismantles the myth of the ""Cartesian theater"", or the idea that past perception, and the parallel neural processes going on in the brain, content is ""presented"" to a fictitious viewer. There is no such ""Audience"". Thinking is thought. There is no ""central hub"" where everything ""comes together"", and Dennett introduces ""Multiple Drafts"" to give consciousness an elementary stab.Then Dennett compares consciousness as a sort of serial (illusory) program running on the parallel brain. This part I'm not super convinced about, thinking of a computer as subsystems of information processing is useful in some ways but maybe we need more models and analogies besides the Von Neumann architecture.What about the ""language"" that we think in? Dennett refutes a ""Central Meaner"", and instead replaces it with a ""Pandemonium"", multiple neural pathways in our head all having something to say.Dennett also discusses the evolution of consciousness, problems with folk psychology, Libet's experiments and temporal inference, and philosophical problems like ""In the Mind's eye"", ""Mary the scientist"", Searle's ""Chinese Room"", ""What is it like to be a bat""...There was a lot of thought provoking content in this book. The idea of the self as a ""center of narrative gravity"", an abstract concept, instead of some dualistic ""brain pearl"" was illuminating for me. Book is kinda old, probably there are more up-to-date ones, but I'd say this is still extremely well worth the time for anyone curious in the nature of the mind."
291,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74862840-cary-giese,3,"Consciousness is the ability of humans to be aware of their own mind. “I think, therefore I am,” per Rene Descartes of the 17th century, is still the prevailing understanding. The book’s author explained, in excessive detail, what was known or believed in 1991, namely a confusion of ideas from the disciplines of psychology, philosophy and science. No real progress! No advanced ideas beyond Descartes’ description since then. More theses, no consensus! It does seem that each persons consciousness is unique to them! Each of us has sole awareness of our self! Our soul?? There is an underlying belief that our human consciousness is an evolved state resulting from the creative processes of evolution. Now the question is: Can Artificial Intelligence develop consciousness through a similar creative process, to become unique, super smart “silicone individuals,” competing with humans? Wow! The question is: how can we use and manage Artificial Intelligece without it surpassing us? I need to read more updated studies to understand this more! I will if they exist, most books on the subject date to the 1980-90’s! This book provides the questions, no answers, and only speculations. Though the book is credited as the landmark start of the discussion! For that, Dennett deserves respect for providing a foundation reading!"
292,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914286-sarah,2,"I was really interested in this work for about the first 200 pages. One of the biggest drawbacks is that this text was published in 1991 (almost 30 years ago); and the author uses a lot of illustrations and arguments from the science and philosophy of artificial intelligence. That science has changed so much in the last 30 years. Also, I have no real science or philosophy background, so I found parts of this a tough go. The early chapters, when the author was trying to define consciousness were the best for me - he raised a number of ideas and issues that I found fascinating. Not only about how speech developed, but when did we start talking to ourselves? And the importance of that action. You have to think of yourself as a self to bother speaking. Not to mention, how do we hear our own voices (or our parents voices, etc) in our heads? No sound is actually being generated; yet our brain gives it to us as if playing a recording. How do you ""hear"" when you are 100 percent by passing your auditory system? Same thing with ""seeing"" things in your head. But as the book dragged on, I lost interest and felt more and more lost in his endless responses to others ideas of consciousness. In the end, he never did explain consciousness to me. I just kept falling asleep whenever I picked up this book - so I very lightly skimmed the last 200 pages and called it a day."

Dennett undoubtedly makes a thought provoking case for how we ought to look at consciousness, perhaps shaking a fair few my previously held ideas regarding the soundness of epiphenomenalism and philosophical zombies. The examples regarding tastes, and the experience of an acquired taste, as a phenomenon that changes over time versus your conscious experience of the taste of said phenomenon changing, seems quite crucial in considering the relevance of consciousness as explained via external objective measures. His last section addressing the issue of 'explaining' a phenomenon versus 'explaining away' said phenomenon was also a nice touch. I agree with his conclusion that he has at the very least started the explanation; perhaps he wouldn't have gotten so much heat for this book if he reconsidered the tense of his verbiage when drawing up a title. A simple gerund could likely have made others' perception of him and his work much more palatable, though with some further pressure, their conscious experience of his work could perhaps become acquired as well :)"

On the one hand, it’s impressive to view Dennett attempt to topple (and replace) what he views as a misinformed view of what consciousness is. Naturally, something as familiar to us as our own consciousness will carry with it a certain obviousness about the mechanisms and features of that consciousness. Dennett’s task is to show you that although you may be the observer, you don’t have a claim to infallibility over the mechanisms that produce your experience, only the effects of those mechanisms. My problem with the book was that oftentimes Dennett‘s writing seems filled with unnecessary jargon. While I understand that in a book that tries to do no less than explain consciousness there will be some requisite wordiness, I was left with the feeling that if only Dennett was a more pithy writer, his points would’ve landed with more force. Many times throughout the book I would finish a section and feel that I had missed an aspect of an argument that Dennett supposed would win me over in dramatic fashion.All this said, I enjoyed Dennett’s method and although I may still have subtle bonds to my old ways of thinking about consciousness, Dennett has done much to weaken and replace them."
295,0316180661,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79330012-arthur-ryman,4,"Definitely worth the read, but not exactly what I was hoping for or what is advertised in the title. A more accurate title would be ""Consciousness Explained Away"". I am in full agreement with Dennett's basic position, namely that the brain is a computing device. However, Dennett does not explain the basic phenomenon of awareness. Rather, he substitutes the term ""dispositional state"". Disappointing. I decided to read this, and similar works, because I felt that physics lacked the conceptual vocabulary to talk about awareness, that abundantly obvious feeling that we are observers. Coincidentally, quantum mechanics, although spectacularly successful, relies on the injection of an observer to collapse superpositions of states into an actual observation. In the absence of a better explanation from Dennett and his colleagues, I'll simply tell myself that awareness is what collapsing wave functions feel like. :-)"

(the quotes are not actual quotes but my paraphrasing).It was like a constant tease, I guess to keep you hooked, while he rambled on with his filler. But after a while of this not stop filler with teases, I got fed up and put the book down. I did not even bother to skip to the end.

Then from the middle, he seemed to want to clean up for later and remove a central ""meaner"" for consciousness and describe his multiple drafts theory so that he can link up any ol' robot to a zombified human state, since there isn't one ""perfect"" setup for an human mind. Then from a negative direction cut up phenomenology and then remove qualia, which for some reason was so important for him to do, and then say we've landed somewhere in the middle, along with the robots he's described.It is a fun read with plenty of interesting pop psychology experiments.Overall, an account of what it might look like to explain consciousness away.

It's hard to argue with someone as smart as Dennett, he sets traps, finds the perfect arguments, and is just so undeniably smarter and prepared than any of us, which is one of the reasons why I have to remain slightly skeptical about his final premise.He has succeeded in making me see his argument, and though it still remains closer to a philosophical one than a scientific one, it's the best one I've heard so far and the one that explains consciousness the best while not falling for metaphysical interpretations at all.Great book. It doesn't matter if you don't buy into the final conclusion, the road that gets you there will open your mind."

At times it felt as though Dennett wanted to report on so many experiments and studies as to overwhelm anyone who wants to strike down his arguments. This can be an effective writing method but it does make the text rather difficult to read. Though you can tell some chapters are dated, most of the content is still relevant to the discussions going on today in the study of consciousness. This was a pivotal book for many intellectuals working today and it is clear to see why. Standout features:Rigorously studied content Precision in languageIdeas are still relevant 26 years later."
