0,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/178470-claudette,5,"As I read this book, I wondered: why am I only learning about evolution in depth NOW...and through my own desire to learn? How did I get through school--including a Bachelor's Degree--without really understanding the nitty gritty of evolution? I think much of the problem is that so many discoveries were so recent, but actually there is no excuse. I THInK I paid attention in school. But if I remember learning about Geometry, and, in fact, had at least one high school class CALLED Geometry, shouldn't I have also had a class called Evolution? If there was such a class offered in my enormous suburban public high school, how did I get out of it? This is crucial stuff. Read it. This needs to be ingrained knowledge from like first grade on up."
1,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/970677-ravic,5,"Shocking and sadHere in Europe we tend to forget that the USA are not exclusively a country of reason and progress. Books like this remind us that there is also religious fundamentalism and that uneducated people who believe that the world is 6000 years old and favour „intelligent design“ can rise to the highest political offices. The shocking thing is what this book reveals about the condition of our society. What kind of society is it where brillant scientists feel compelled to waste valuable time writing serious books to refute harebrained nonsense like a flat earth, geocentrism or creationism / intelligent design? In Europe creationism is usually perceived as a minor problem, at least one not affecting the educational system. In America it seems that creationists are able to gain influence in schools, so much so that in some cases they have to be subdued in court. The introduction to this book detailing a recent court case is enough to make your skin crawl. How far have we actually come since the times of the Scopes trial? If the „Untergang des Abendlandes“ should come it will begin like this. With the rise of religious fundamentalism and the abolishment of reason in education. The saddest aspect of this book is the realization that those who are really in need of learning the facts will not read it. People already interested in life, in biology or in evolution will read ist. People who want to know, people who wish to learn, people who have an open mind will read this book. Religious fundamentalists are not interested in facts. They cannot be convinced by facts because they have an entirely different outlook on life. They cannot be reached by the truth because they have chosen to ignore it, fabricating their own twisted and bigoted versions of truth. So, sadly, this excellent treatise on evolution, lucid and compelling, will benefit only those who are already open-minded and critical. It makes for a great introduction to the subject for younger readers or for people with little previous knowledge in biology. It may be less suitable for Europeans as the frequent references to creationism would probably be considered distracting and unnecessary by most readers. But take out these parts and you have a wonderful introduction to evolution ready for translation into French or German, Italian or Greek, Polish or Swedish. Weathermen say that with the prevailing currents it usually takes three weeks for heavy weather from North America to reach Europe. Creationism is decidedly slower and it has not yet gained a strong foothold in most European countries. Let us hope that it does not act like the weather and that it can be vanquished before it spreads and pollutes the world. If anything it will be books like this which may help to teach and enlighten at least those who are willing to learn. "
2,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,5,"I'll come right to the point: Jerry Coyne's ""Why Evolution Is True"" is arguably the best general-interest reference book on the scientific evidence for evolution currently in print. It really is.Many of the items that Coyne marshals will be familiar to those who are well-versed in this topic. But I found several items that I had never before seen. One example is the recent discovery that diurnal and annual patterns in the growth of Devonian corals could be used to date these corals, since the length of years (396 days) evident in these records matches the age (approximately 380 million years old) coincides with radiometric ages.One of the myths about evolution that Coyne explodes is the claim that there are lots of ""missing links"" in the fossil record. To the contrary, in the past decade or two numerous transitional fossils have been found, in many cases bridging gaps (such as the fish-terapod link) that creationist critics of evolution have asserted could never be bridged. Coyne addresses human evolution in particular, and shows how the fossilized bones of hominin ancestors fit perfectly into the predicted intermediate forms.Coyne's analysis of how evolution coincides with the geographical history of the earth (meaning the history of how continents have shifted) is particularly good. Other notable parts include the evolution of vision, sexual selection selection and evolution, and observations of evolution acting on bacterial species (such as Hall's experiments). Coyne's chapter on vestigal organs and instances of ""bad design"" (such as the loss of Vitamin C machinery in primates) is alone worth the purchase price.It will be quite a while before someone tops Coyne's book. Enjoy it while it lasts."
3,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/755462-nathan,3,"I picked this book after reading Dawkins' Greatest Show on Earth. After a series of conversations I had with some young-earth creationists, and in light of what is occurring in the battle for science curriculum here in Texas, I wanted to find a book that I could recommend to creationists, since most creationists have absolutely no clue about the actual science. Dawkins' book is not that book because he is unable to keep his contempt for young-earth creationists out of the conversation. I think the book would only insult those people who I wish would open up their worldviews a bit. To that end, Dawkins defeats his own purpose for writing the book in the way he delivers the material. This book has a far more neutral tone, and is a a nice succinct look at the science of evolution. He chases less rabbits than Dawkins also, and he presents the evidence with a less impassioned tone than Dawkins, which I think is real plus if you're actually hoping to get those who disagree with you to listen to what you're saying. You can see the differences in these two books just by looking at the titles. Dawkins' Greatest Show on Earth is an impassioned case for evolution. It's practically a love letter to the natural world. Why Evolution is True is a far drier presentation of much of the same evidence. I personally enjoy Dawkins clever writing and all his rabbit chasing, and the passion for the subject that he can not hide, so personally I didn't enjoy this book as much as The Greatest Show on Earth. But it's a very good general-interest overview of the science of evolution. Reading these two books together, I realize how much my education as a child failed me, largely because my science teachers were clearly afraid of wrath of the religious influences in our community if they really taught the facts of evolution. To me that this is still going on is a travesty. Since I started the quest for a book that I could share with young-earth creationists, I've realized the search is a futile one. Once you realize where creationists begin their argument, you realize there's no point in trying to have a reasoned conversation with them. They start by stating their hypothesis is fact, and indeed is revealed through God's own words. Then they work in reverse. Anything that doesn't support this conclusion is suspect, and is thrown out, or otherwise ignored. They aren't looking at the evidence to see where it leads, they are looking at the evidence to figure out how to discredit it, or how they can possibly warp it into a way in which it might lend some kind of credibility to what they already believe. Their minds are already made up. They have no respect for the scientific process, and consider the academic process of peer reviewed publication--probably one of the greatest things to happen to the process of learning--to be a conspiracy. I don't know how I forgot this, but i'm grateful for the reminder. Far greater minds than me have been unable to get these people to see how flawed this worldview is. It's certainly not something I'm going to cure. So I think this book concludes my quest. I don't think it will sway many minds that are already made up, But if you're someone out there just looking for a great overview so you can learn more about about the massive evidence used to understand the process that got us here, or if you genuinely don't know what to believe, because science education in this country has failed you miserably, this is a great place to start. One more thought. I think he should have left the final chapter out. I understand why he feels like he needs to assuage fears that if society in general accepts evolution is true, we'll quickly de-evolve into a pack rabid dogs, but i don't think the argument is something that can be tacked on to this conversation and dealt with fairly in a few pages, and I don't think it has any place in a book about the science itself. It's the job of science to excavate the truth about how the world around us works. It's up to philosophers and religious leaders and the like to figure out what to do with that information. I think the fear of evolution destroying religious world views is about as rational as the fear that the entire universe doesn't revolve around the earth will end the Christian world view. When religion and science spar, historically, religion always loses, and it always finds a way to bounce back. I think the best way to forward for science is to continue to present the evidence and let the religious leaders work out how they're going to work it into their wordview, though I see why Coyne and Dawkins and others feel that to this point, that approach hasn't worked out so well. Still I think the important point that should be hammered relentlessly is that science makes no commentary on faith. Evolution makes no true commentary on God. It isn't even a theory on origins, merely a theory on how life adapted over time. Faith deals with the super-natural. Science stops at the natural world. I think the scientific world would make better progress if they continue to make this point with the religious communities. "
4,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67532575-kevin-shepherd,5,"Coyne is direct and no-nonsense. He doesn't get bogged down in the pointless debate of trying to disprove a negative, he simply states what IS and what IS NOT. Evolution is not a belief, it's a science. It's a science supported by 150 years of research and (literally) mountains of evidence. And, like any true science, the timelines and conclusions have been tweaked and recalculated with the introduction of new data. In the end, everyone will draw their own conclusions. Either the theological narrative of the origin of life is not entirely accurate or the sciences of paleontology, anthropology, astrophysics, genetics and evolutionary biology are bogus and irrelevant."
5,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1258773-douglas-wilson,2,Coyne admittedly had the uphill struggle of trying to prove something that is not true.
6,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2619231-richard,2,"I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could. Seeing how I think he's wrong, though, I'll downgrade rather than upgrade.I probably agree with 70% of what's in the book, which may be surprising, me being a creationist. I'm not going to try to untangle all the mixtures of agreement and disagreement.. but its interesting that I definitely am fully onboard with over half of the book, but still disagree with the major premise; that evolution is true.Coyne succeeds in presenting a case for neo-darwinian evolution. By which I mean, he successfully explains observations in light a modern evolutionary theory. He paints a fairly complete systematic understanding of the history of life. I recommend the book to everyone for this reason. E.O. Wilson is correct when he writes in the blurb on the back that this is a ""clear, well-written explanation of evolution.""Unfortunately, he doesn't begin to explain the serious difficulties of darwinism (he outright denies the existence of such problems!). That's a major drawback of the book... it presents it more as a defensive boast rather than a scientific and critical examination of evidence.A further detriment is the apparently intentional strawman portrayal of creationists. There is an endnote on page 33 that explains the creationist position as allowing for microevolutionary change within biblical 'kinds'. But this is the only place in the book creationists are treated this honestly. Everywhere else 'special creation' is caricatured as a special creation event for each and every species of organism. It is dishonest and, once again, takes away from the argument of the book.The final failure of the book I will mention is the last chapter, where Coyne attempts to deal with philosophical and metaphysical implications of evolution. It is a sad attempt... while he should be praised for recognizing the need to deal with these issues, he should have stopped when he honestly stated the case: ""How can you derive meaning, purpose, or ethics from evolution? You can't."" (p225)"
7,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3046014-jesse,2,"This one is like the Beak of the Finch: it shows impressive work on Natural Selection, but it doesn't prove that the little changes must lead to the huge changes between people and animals. This book also illustrates how scientists are trying to be historians--a kind of integrating of subjects--and they are failing miserably. If any historian tried to pass of these kinds of arguments as history they wouldn't survive the laughter. Evolutionists reason like this: if these two bone structures look alike they must be related; therefore one must have come from the other. That's like an historian saying Alexander the Great and Charlemagne were both kings; therefore one must have come from the other. Evolutionists assume a system and then fit everything into it, but they seem to think that they are not making assumptions. Some how they are assumption free. Really?"
8,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502680-david,3,"First of all, this is a very well-written book that powerfully makes the case for Darwinian evolution. The author is well-versed in the subject. I would recommend this book to anyone who, like me, has little knowledge of the actual science of evolution but wants to learn. That said, I am not really bothered by evolution (and I am an evangelical Christian, though not a creationist). Yes there are theological challenges that the science of evolution brings to scripture. I don't think these challenges are as much in Genesis 1. Genesis 1 comes across poetically and I highly doubt whomever wrote it was intending to write modern science. The bigger challenge comes in Genesis 2 and 3 which presents Adam and Eve as the first humans and of course, Paul speaks of Adam as the first human in parallel to Christ as the new human. But even there, many Christians have found a way to reconcile evolution and faith.The rest of this is not so much a review of the book as my thoughts on the real questions at the heart of the debate (which are philosophical, not scientific, questions)I think part of the problem in the whole debate is the rhetoric both sides use. Throughout the book Coyne attacks creationists. To some degree this is necessary as creationists are the ones most opposed to evolution. But such rhetoric tends to put people on the defensive. I mean, I think everyone has been in an argument where they knew they were wrong but kept arguing anyway to save face. The fact is that whether evolution is true or not is irrelevant to the question of whether God exists.A parallel to other sciences may help make my point. The Bible talks often about God sending rain and sunshine. Yet when meteorology explains how weather patterns occur naturally, no one blinked an eye. People of faith continued to see that behind those natural processes, God is still involved in the weather. There is no battle to get a creationist view of meteorology taught in schools. But I imagine when you read a meteorology textbook there are no slams on God, there is no argument that because we know how weather arises naturally we know God has nothing to do with it.When we get to evolution, the dialogue changes. Again, this is not a knock on Coyne for he is specifically defending evolution against creationists, so of course he will attack them. I just wonder how the debate would change if both sides admitted that the science of evolution does not prove God does not exist. Maybe I am idealistic, but if we heard more people in the middle (believers who accept evolution, nonbelievers who accept evolution but admit it does not rule out God) and less extremes (both Richard Dawkins and Ken Hamm see evolution as ruling out God) perhaps the debate would change.Coyne manages to mostly avoid the problem of moving from science into philosophy. In the last chapter he writes: ""How can you derive meaning, purpose, or ethics from evolution? You can't. Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life's diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life"" (225). Nice. In the next paragraph he notes that finding meaning, purpose and moral guidance are outside the domain of science. But by the end of the chapter Coyne is talking about ""deriving your spirituality from science"" (232). That seems muddled. Right before this, he writes: ""The world still teems with selfishness, immorality, and injustice. But look elsewhere and you'll find innumerable acts of kindness and altruism. There may be elements of both behaviors that come from our evolutionary heritage, but these acts are largely a matter of choice, not of genes. Giving to charity, volunteering to eradicate disease in poor countries, fighting fires at immense personal risk - none of these acts could have been instilled in us directly by evolution"" (230-231). Then where did they come from? Not science.He goes on to say evolution acts in a ""purposeless, materialistic way"" (231). This is okay, because people find meaning in all kinds of places, including religion (231). Then he gets to spirituality from science, ending up with a quote from an author lamenting the failure of science to replace conventional religion (232). He ends by assuring us that accepting evolution will not cause us to behave like beasts because, well, look how much great art and literature humans have made.I do wonder though, earlier he talks about infanticide among lions (122). If humans are just a part of nature, then why is infanticide wrong for us? Likewise, he seems to lament humans introducing foreign species into habitats that then kill native animals off (110). But if humans are part of nature, are we not just playing a role in natural evolution where some animals survive and others do not?It appears like on one hand he is saying the science of evolution says nothing about religion for science only talks about how. On the other hand, if only we could get rid of religion and just have science. But back to the first hand, science alone gives us no meaning and purpose. Thus, we have some vague ""spirituality from science"", whatever that is. To me, it seems muddled. Overall, this is a good book to learn about the science of evolution. But whether this science is true or not (and Coyne makes a strong case that it is) reveals little to nothing about the questions of meaning, purpose and God's existence."
9,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264605-elaine,5,"This was such an awesome book. I have read a lot of books on evolution, but this is the first that actually made me interested in fossils. Very, very cool. Of course it wouldn't convince a dummy that evolution is true because you actually have to have some reading comprehension and be able to understand what you read, but for anyone with a brain that doesn't believe in evolution (I still can't undertand how there are people out there that fit that bill, but I digress), this book will remove all doubt and if it doesn't, you aren't understanding it. "
10,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"This book avoids bickering over details and goes right for the throat; exposing Creationism and Intelligent Design for the unworkable, unscientific ploys that they are. It does so without being too aggressive, a la Dawkins, because such heavy hitting really isn't necessary, when there's so much evidence to be presented. Instead, the chapters cover fossils and a little bit of genetics. The reader is walked through the process of how we came to know what we know. It's not a challenging book, nor a long one, but it does suffice to show Why Evolution Is True."
11,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6199925-david,1,"I have recently been interested in the topic of evolution. I am a Bible believing creationist and I have heard of many questions that seem to really challenge the theory of evolution. For me when considering an argument I try to consider both sides of the argument with an open mind. So I picked up this book with the intention to have an open mind and hear the ""other side of the story"".Unfortunately I was very disappointed. Based on the title of this book ""Why Evolution is True"" I was expecting to hear the author speak to some of the serious challenges to evolution. However, this was not the case. In my opinion Coyne seems to setup so-called ""straw men"" and then attack those with an air of pompous superiority that made me want to throw the book in the garbage. Coyne did not deal with any of the serious questions that I had and seemed content to pick and choose whatever parts of ID, creationism, or literal 6-day creationism that seemed easy for him to pick off.""Why ... do we need a book that gives the evidence for a theory that long ago became part of mainstream science? After all, nobody writes books explaining the evidence for atoms, or for the germ theory of disease."" - pg. xvii. This comment in the introduction sets the tone for the rest of the book. The attitude conveyed is one of ""I can't believe I have to write a book like this"". Thanks a lot bud.These are the major topics that Coyne covers along with my thoughts:1. History in rocks. No mention of the objections to radiometric dating. Radiometric dating makes some serious assumptions about presence of certain isotopes. Not to mention that the various types of dating (uranium-lead, carbon-14, etc) can very often disagree. Rock recently formed from a volcanic eruption known to have happened 200 years ago using radiometric dating could conclude it happened 100-600 million years ago (article). Also, there are some serious questions to the geological column. One example is trees that sit upright in the column and ""straddle"" multiple layers of rock that supposedly represent thousands of years (article). Also, how do we see ""flat gaps"" between rock layers that supposedly represent millions of years of sedimentation and then erosion? (article). In my opinion, the geological column and radiometric dating are where evolution is the most open to doubt. And if this is the case then this is Coyne's largest omission. 2. Vestiges, Embryos, Bad Design. I found Coyne's argument for vestigial traits to be guilty of circular reasoning. Example. ""Our bodies team with remnants of primate ancestry. We have a vestigial tail: the coccyx, or the triangular end of our spine that's made of several fuzed vertebrae hanging below our pelvis. It's what remains of the long, useful tail of our ancestors. It still has a function, but remember that it's vestigiality is diagnosed not by its usefulness but because it no longer has the function for which it evolved."" - pg. 62Question: How do we know that we evolved from other species? Evolution: Because we see vestigial traits.Question: How do we know that what you consider to be vestigial is in fact vestigial? Evolution: Because we know we evolved from other species.The same type of reasoning is used for embryology and so called ""bad design"". Not to mention the fact that in order to truly be able to classify something as a vestige or bad design you must 100% understand the entire function of the organism. Which science cannot say in the case of the majority of organisms on this planet. Right?BTW there are huge objections to embryology. So much so that it is not taken seriously anymore (aritcle).I could go on and on of these topics but I will stop there.3. Bio-geography. Nothing I read here seemed un-explainable with the Flood model. As per Coyne himself plants/animals have been documented to cover huge distances of water and land and to colonize an area in a relatively short period of time.4. Genetics. This is something that I admittedly need to study in more depth. However, my conclusions in this area did not seem to be seriously challenged by this chapter. Namely that each species has a certain amount of genetic ""material"" that allows for adaptation to it's environment. Some organisms have a huge range of potential adaptational ability and others do not. For example look at the dog. Man has used breeding so that now we have dogs that range from the Saint Bernard to the Chihuahua. The dog seemingly has a huge adaptational ability. However, would anyone think that breeders could somehow breed a dog into a fish? Or maybe even just an additional leg? No, no I don't think anyone would think this is possible no matter how long a breeder had to do this. But for some reason if you add millions of years into the mix anything is possible. Speaking of dogs I thought this was an interesting comment from Coyne about dogs - ""If somehow the recognized breeds existed only as fossils, palaeontologists would consider them not one species but many - certainly more than the 36 species of wild dogs that live in nature today"". Yes and not only that but palaeontologists would construct an evolutionary tree around them and call this ""proof"" of evolution. Then biologists would use this as ""proof"" for vestigial traits and embryology. A seemingly tidy arrangement. :)5. Origin of Species. Depends on genetics. Coyne makes an interesting point that macro-evolution, because of the long periods of time necessary, will NEVER be seen in a human lifetime as is not provable in history because we only started serious scientific documentation in the last few hundred years. Guess we will just have to wait for 100,000 years to see if this theory is true. :) Perhaps if radiometric dating and the theory of the geological columns was absolutely rock solid with no assumptions we might be justified in making some some conclusions here. However, this does not seem to be the case. An assumption based on another assumption does not equal to ""fact"". 6. Human evolution. Does not deal with the huge objections to the fossil evidence for human evolution. Find just a summary here (article). By Coyne's own admission ""...our early human ancestors were large, relatively few in number compared to grazers like antelopes, and inhabited a small part of Africa under dry conditions not conductive to fossilization. Their fossils, like those of all apes and monkeys, are scarce."" - pg. 195 However he goes on to speak of the human fossil record as if it is indisputable. ""These mysteries about how we evolved should not distract us from the indisputable fact that we did evolve. Even without fossils, we have evidence of human evolution from comparative anatomy, embryology, our vestigial traits, and even biogeography. ...The fossil record is really the icing on the cake."" - pg. 209-210. Perhaps Coyne does not remember that in the chapters dealing with embryology and vestigial traits he uses the fossil record as the proof. Circular reasoning yet again.7. Evolution redux. Probably the most disappointing chapter of them all. Coyne dips into philosophy and tries to make some profound statements without any logical backup or reasoning. Ex: ""Although evolution operates in a purposeless, materialistic way, that doesn't mean that our lives have no purpose."" - pg. 231. But then Coyne does not attempt to give a fundamental reason for purpose. I realize that he did not intend for this book to be philosophical in nature. But if you are not going to do it justice then please don't even go there. :)To summarize my thoughts on this book:1. Many assumptions and circular reasoning.2. Extremely tough on creationists lack of evidence but then seemingly forgiving for any lack of evidence on the evolutionary side.3. Does NOT deal with the serious objections to evolution. 4. This is NOT a book that seriously considers evidence on both sides and tries to make an objective conclusion. It is only a book to RE-ENFORCE evolutionary BELIEF in evolution as a ""fact"".I sincerely hope that this book does not accurately represent evolutionary science.SIDE NOTE: ""There, on the very land that symbolizes evolution, the iconic islands that inspired Darwin, a Seventh-day Adventist school dispenses undiluted creationist biology to children of all faiths."" - pg. xix. I had to smile at this comment as I am a Seventh-day Adventist myself. Way to go Adventists!!"
12,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,5,"This is an eloquent, detailed and fascinating study of Evolution. An idea as controversial, and one with such profound socio-political repercussion, deserves to be treated the way Coyne has dealt it. He presents arguments systematically and he is not too keen on bashing creationists. He keeps his nose out of futile arguments and focuses primarily on the scientific aspect of evolution and not the psychological or philosophical elements that often become a part of such a discussion. This makes the book an excellent and in-depth introduction to Evolutionary Biology, its historical significance and the tremendous amount of scientific research that has been undertaken over the years by scientists. 	Coyne at length describes fossil evidence, vestigial organs, genetics and other subjects that are involved in every sophisticated study of Evolution. Recent studies have been mixed with previous predictions and some beautiful diagrams illustrate them for convenience.  This is a brilliant book and I can’t recommend it enough."
13,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"Why Evolution Is True by Jerry A. CoyneWhy Evolution Is True is my favorite book on evolution. It starts of course with the prodigious knowledge of Mr. Coyne but it’s his ability to explain such complex topics with ease that sets this book apart from the rest. It’s profound without being unintelligible. It’s always the first book I recommend when I want to convince someone that the theory of evolution is true and supported by converging mountains of evidence. The book is composed of the following nine chapters: What is Evolution, Written in the Rocks, Remnants: Vestiges, Embryos, and Bad Design, The Geography of Life, The Engine of Evolution, How Sex Drives Evolution, The Origin of Species, What About Us?, and Evolution Redux.Positives: 1.	I absolutely love Mr. Coyne’s assured, confident approach backed by lucid scientific evidence. He masters his topic and he conveys it with expertise. This is how all scientific books should be written, make your point and provide cogent arguments to defend it, bravo!2.	Great scientific quotes abound. Reference material.3.	The best explanation for the theory of natural selection with a luxury of details.4.	Mr. Coyne tells it as he sees it without being disrespectful. He establishes clearly where the resistance for evolution comes from and puts it in its proper place.5.	Great use of figures that help illustrate evolution.6.	I absolutely love how Mr. Coyne weaves several disciplines of science to make his points as clear as possible.7.	In making the case perfectly clear for evolution, he in fact destroys any notion of an “Intelligent Design”.8.	An outstanding explanation for evolutionary predictions.9.	Radiometric dating and how we are able to have confidence in its accuracy.10.	Everything you wanted to know about fossil records and transitional forms. Including two of the best examples: Tiktaalik and Archaeopteryx. 11.	One of my favorite sections…vestigial traits. A lot of aha moments here.12.	Great examples of bad “design”.13.	Convergent evolution explained.14.	Genetics made easy to understand.15.	The best explanation on how our eyes evolved. 16.	Sexual evolution…I finally get it.17.	I enjoy the admiration that evolutionary biologists have for the icons of their industry: Darwin goes without saying but there is great admiration for Ernst Mayr and Richard Dawkins.18.	Absolutely loved the chapter about human evolution.19.	This book explains the most important concepts of evolution like no other. Brilliant!20.	All the links, notes, glossary does this superb book justice.Negatives:1.	Having to wait for Mr. Coyne’s next book. In summary, this is in my humble opinion the best book about evolution for the masses. No book explains the theory of evolution any better than this one. It’s thorough, well written, and makes you proud to love science. I can’t recommend this book enough. A well deserved 5-star book. You don’t have to believe in evolution but once you read this book it will leave you no choice but to accept it.Recommendations: “Your Inner Fish…” by Neil Shubin, “The Making of the Fittest” by Sean B. Carroll, “What Evolution Is” by Ernst Mayr, “Life Ascending: The Ten Great Inventions of Evolution” by Nick Lane and “The Greatest Show on Earth” by the great Richard Dawkins. "
14,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20245481-mohamed-al-jamri,4,"For those looking for evidence supporting evolution, either because they themselves doubt it or want more evidences to argue for it, these two books can do the job extremely well.I bet the vast majority if not all of those who read ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" & ""Why Evolution is True"" with an open mind and understand them, will regard evolution as true and be able to argue in its favor strongly.Both authors maintain that evolution is compatible with #religion although they do not elaborate on that. In fact, Dawkins -who is notorious for his criticism of religion- goes on and lists a number of British #bishops and public figures who call for teaching of evolution in publicly-funded schools.I recommend reading Dawkins book first since he explains what is evolution and natural selection in detail before moving to the evidence while Coyne presents a lot of evidences and details.For books that try to reconcile between religion and evolution, I hear that ""Finding Darwin's God"" & ""The Language of God"" are good, although I haven't read them yet."
15,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution"". That classic quote from the great Russian-American evolutionary geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky is replete with far more truth now than when he uttered it in 1973. Thousands of scientists around the globe are using the principles of evolution towards understanding phenomena as simple as bacterial population growth to those as complex as the origin and spread of such virulent diseases as malaria and HIV/AIDS, and the conservation of many endangered plant and animal species. There is no other scientific theory I know of that has withstood such rigorous, and repeated, testing as the modern synthetic theory of evolution. The overwhelming proof of biological evolution is so robust, that entire books have been written describing pertinent evidence from sciences that, at first glance, seem as dissimilar from each other as paleobiology, molecular biology and ecology. But alas this hasn't convinced many in the court of public opinion, especially here, in the United States, who remain skeptical of evolution as both a scientific fact and a scientific theory, and who are too often persuaded by those who insist that there are such compelling ""weaknesses"" in evolution, that instead of it, better, still ""scientific"", alternatives exist, most notably, Intelligent Design creationism. Distinguished evolutionary geneticist Jerry Coyne's ""Why Evolution Is True"" is not just a timely book, but it is quite simply, the best, most succinct, summation I can think of on behalf of evolution's scientific validity. No other modern evolutionary biologist has attempted to convey, with such excitement, and enthusiasm, a comprehensive, quite compelling, proof of biological evolution, unless you consider the notable literary careers of Coyne's graduate school mentors; Ernst Mayr and Stephen Jay Gould. Coyne's achievement is especially noteworthy for covering virtually every major evolutionary aspect of biology in a treatment that barely exceeds two hundred and thirty pages. In essence, ""Why Evolution is True"" can be viewed as an updated, modern rendition of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"", but encompassing those biological sciences, such as population genetics, molecular systematics, evolutionary developmental biology - better known as ""evo - devo"" - and, indeed, even paleobiology, which were unknown to Darwin; to put it bluntly, this is ""one long argument"" on behalf of evolutionary biology, told via Coyne's respectable, occasionally lyrical, prose and compelling logic. Coyne asserts that there are six principles of evolution in the book's first chapter (having been preceded by two brief prefaces devoted to the nature of science and the ongoing intellectual threat posed by Intelligent Design creationism); evolution - which he defines as a species undergoing genetic change through time - gradualism, speciation, common ancestry, natural selection, and nonselective mechanisms of evolutionary change. These are indeed the very principles recognizable to anyone who has taken an undergraduate course in evolution, the key features of the Modern Synthesis Theory of Evolution; in other words, modern evolutionary theory. And they are principles recognizable to those evolutionary biologists who concur with Gould's observation that current evolutionary theory is incomplete in explaining the origin, composition and history of our planet's biodiversity; scientifically testable principles unlike those alleged to exist for Intelligent Design and other flavors of ""scientific"" creationism. In the book's remaining nine chapters, Coyne offers persuasive evidence on behalf of these principles from the fossil record, from the biogeography of plants and animals, from molecular genomic data, and other aspects of biology, discusses the importance of sex in driving evolutionary change, and the process of speciation itself. There is much worthy of praise in Coyne's elegantly terse tome in defense of biological evolution. His fossil record chapter (Chapter Two) compellingly recounts the evolution of primitive tetrapods from bony fishes in the late Devonian, the mid Mesozoic evolution and early radiation of birds from their feathered theropod dinosaur ancestors, and the early Cenozoic evolution of whales from primitive ungulates distantly related to rhinos and tapirs. He demonstrates persuasively (Chapter Three) how humans and other animals are so poorly ""designed"", that their ""designs"" bear ample witness against the existence of an Intelligent Designer. His superb treatment of biogeography (Chapter Four) echoes the literary elegance of Darwin's prose, and reminds us of the stark differences between so-called Intelligent Design ""theory"" and evolution in making testable, verifiable, predictions regarding both present-day and fossil distributions of plants and animals. In the book's finest chapter (Chapter Seven), devoted to speciation, Coyne - who is among our foremost authorities on speciation - offers a surprisingly comprehensive account that discusses not only the mechanisms of speciation, but also, of equal importance to biologists, how species are recognized and defined as distinct populations separated from others in space and time. But readers may find most moving, his poignant treatment of humanity as a biological species (Chapter Eight), and how evolution may still be driving the course of human evolution. There is so much worthy of praise in Coyne's book, that it seems almost an afterthought to mention errors, omissions, and potential disagreements. The most glaring of these may be his insistence of gradualism as an important principle of evolution, since others, like his Stony Brook University colleague Douglas Futuyma, have recognized the importance of morphological stasis (Though he might contend vigorously and persuasively that to do so would be to recast the argument as one of evolutionary tempo, instead of mode.). But I am especially surprised by his omission of the significant role of mass extinctions in reshaping the composition and complexity of Earth's biosphere, not just once, but approximately seven times in the last five hundred-odd million years, which has garnered ample attention from past and current University of Chicago colleagues; paleobiologists David Raup, J. John Sepkoski, and David Jablonski, among others. By themselves, mass extinctions are the key episodes in the history of life on Earth still ignored by leading Intelligent Design creationists such as mathematician and philosopher William Dembski and biochemist Michael Behe; their very existence strongly refutes the inane assertion that life has been ""intelligently designed"". ""Why Evolution is True"" belongs on the bookshelves of anyone interested in science. However, those who are skeptical of evolution's scientific validity, remain its intended audience. Any of them possessing an objective, open mind, should be persuaded by Coyne's terse prose and compelling logic. The evidence for biological evolution is quite overwhelmingly true; Coyne's slender book is a magnificent presentation of this proof. "
16,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1282558-rebecca,5,"I really enjoyed this book. Basically, it's a several-hundred page review of the major arguments for not only why scientists accept the theory biological evolution, but why it is so well accepted that it is stated to be 'true'. Each chapter breaks down a part of the evidence -- fossils, embryology, genetic evidence, observations of natural selection, the role of sex in evolution, speciation, and so on. Usually the general case is talked about, with examples about specific evidence, though the author notes that he can't give every case of, say, discovery of transitional fossils where and when transitional fossils should exist, as each topic he discussed was something that books could be written on by their lonesome. I knew a lot of the examples -- Tiktaalik, the fish-with-legs; the signs of human evolution of lactose tolerance but only in populations that herded; the strange geometry of arteries and nerves in the human head and neck that came from gill arches in the embryo very similar to the ones fishes have; etc. -- but I still would often find a specific case that I had never heard of. Even things that would be useful on Ask an Astronomer -- like that corals show that the Earth was spinning faster in the Paleozoic, and this amount matched up with both models of the Moon despinning the Earth and radiometric dating. The last two chapters were especially interesting. The author singles out humans for a full chapter on their evolution, noting that acceptance of evolution always seems to boil down to whether people are comfortable with the idea that we share an ancestor with chimpanzees (and... well, everything else). The last chapter spoke about the moral implications of evolution -- both that just because something is true does not impose any stance on right versus wrong -- and takes a brief dip into the field of evolutionary psychology. If you are already convinced by the evidence, you might get a bit weary about the author's insistence on noting that creationism/ID does not have any explanation about why such is so. I mean, for me, he's lecturing to the teaching assistants. But it is the elephant in the room, I suppose -- the idea that ID offers an actual scientific alternative, rather than being a disguised religious belief. (Completely unrelated, but I find it amusing that the person who recommended this book to me noted that Richard Dawkins was a good biology writer, but the fact he was known for writing on atheism as well as biology meant that the recommender felt like any wavering theist would reject his biology books out of hand, while would take something like this as a way of seeing the evidence. Yet, this book has a blurb from Dawkins, which notes him as the author of The God Delusion, rather than, say, The Selfish Gene. Way to go, marketing department. *eyeroll*) "
17,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1334545-david-s-t,5,"This book is fascinating and well written. I think the highest complement I could give it is, had I read it 10 years ago when I was in college, I'd likely be in the field of biology instead of computer science. This book starts off with a basic overview of evolution before heading into the bulk of the evidence. The first section of evidence is based off of fossils, I didn't realize just how many transitional fossils exist for certain species such as the whale (there a pretty good number of fossils showing the progression from a land mammal to a sea one. Something else I found interesting is that in the human embryo, grow lanugo full body hair before losing it all (a remnant of their evolution heritage). Of course I haven't even scratched the surface of everything this book contains. One thing I do wish he expounded on more is DNA, during one discussions on speciation he addresses how once the chromosomes are different enough they can no longer produce an offspring, but this left me confused because how did we get from the 24 ape Chromosomes to the 23 in humans, sadly for a book so full of information this much have been beyond the scope of it, I'll soon read Relics of Eden which appears to discuss the fusion of two chromosomes from the ape into one for man. This is also the one area where Dawkins' The Great Show on Earth does better (DNA evidence) I'm still pretty new on learning about evolution so this book might be too basic for some, but so far its the best of the 4 books that I've read or am reading on the subject. It seems that this book is often compared to Dawkins The Greatest Show on Earth since they were written about the same time, in my opinion for a first book on evolution this one is better, its more concise but there's much more evidence presented in this 250ish page book than I've gotten out of the 350 pages I've read so far of Dawkins book (which is a great read also, but pretty unfocused, full of great information but not much evidence). As for the other two books I've read, ff you're a creationist or follow intelligent design, Finding Darwin's God is a great read. I'm also reading Darwin's On the Origin of The Species and I think anyone wanting to learn more about evolution should start elsewhere and only read that for historical/important work purposes. Growing up in the bible belt, I've heard discussions on the validity of evolution, but without really knowing much about it, I never actually formed an opinion one way or the other. Its hard to have an opinion on hearsay, but after reading this and Finding Darwin's God, I think the evidence is pretty apparent. I wonder how many anti-evolutionists actually read up on the subject and not just follow what they've been taught. I'm finding evolution highly interesting, I wish more would read up on it before dismissing it and this book is a great place to start. "
18,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"Oh, I am such a cheater this month! I totally started this book a couple of days ago but, in my defense, I finished it up this morning....I just couldn't help myself.Evolution. Very few words in science can raise the religious hackles and get the debate juices flowing like this one. Even numerous court trials have become involved to help decide if evolution is science fact or fiction and whether the opposing viewpoint - creationism - deserves to be taught and considered on the same academic level.Granted, I went into this book a full-fledged supporter of evolution but I was still struck (again) by the beauty and elegance of this biological process that was thought of hundreds of years ago. Coyne logically and concisely went through the evidence for evolution - tracing his way through the fossil record to show dinosaurs evolving into birds, fish invading the land as terrestrial tetrapods, and terrestrial mammals going migrating back into the oceans. He not only shows fossil evidence and supports it with rigorous hypothesis testing (the hallmark of robust science) and examples from nature, but also brilliantly illustrates evolution rapidly occurring during a human lifetime. The vast majority of the book focuses on evolution in general - single-celled organisms up through mammals - but the final chapter focuses on humans evolution from primates and, what I feel is, irrefutable evidence that this process is the best explanation we have for how Homo sapiens came to be.Sometimes science books can be a little tedious (shock, I know) but Coyne's writing style had me anxiously awaiting to pick the book back up! His words were illustrated by lovely drawings that I prefer so much more to pictures because it brings uniformity to book. And, possibly my favorite part, is that Coyne didn't attack any other belief system - he occasionally brought up the creationist argument against a specific evolution viewpoint but I didn't feel like he was hostile in any way, he simply laid out the facts and let them speak for themselves.If you are a supporter of evolution but want to learn more, are unsure on the issue but would like more facts, or are even staunchly against evolution but think it's important to know the opposition, then I would highly recommend this book."
19,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,5,"This is a remarkable book. It is written by someone who is really interested in educating people and not just laying out facts. I loved the tone of the author and am now following his blog Why Evolution is True which is really interesting and amusing (this guy really loves cats!). He almost daily posts lots of interesting facts about evolution.There's a good YT video about this book that people may be interested in seeing before reading the book http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1m4mA...Before buying this book, I read some bad reviews about it from people who said that the tone of the author was aggressive and he was really obnoxious. This is certainly not the case. After hearing what some say about Dawkins (whom I personally calm and convincing) being aggressive and obnoxious and about Coyne, I came to the sad conclusion that some will really get offended no matter how you write about evolution. It could be that people like Hitch may sometimes be offensive, but Dawkins or this guy Coyne, they are serious people interested in education other than paying lip service. Anyway, the author shows how natural selection operates and drives life by demonstrating some of the most interesting stuff about evolution of different species. There is a chapter about embryos and especially how the human evolution can be traced by the different stages that our embryo undergoes which made me shudder. People who are very familiar with evolution may find some of ideas in this book repetitive, but there is certainly some new stuff here. I read both The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker and was still amazed by many interesting facts, so I recommend it, especially to those who want an easy and brief introduction to evolution. "
20,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41987697-mohamed-elsherif,5,"It only took me 3 years to finish this book, but I'm glad I did, very good book that is mainly written for people who are not bilogists yet curious to know about the scientific literature in the subject, it answers most of the questions people have about evolution in a very logical way and lays down the evidence clear early enough in the book and I appreciated that it left the human evolution subject towards the end of the book after it established a lot of terminology with the reader so it doesn't come as a surprise after all.Very important read and highly recommended for those curious to actually know the scientific subject."
21,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392101-scarlett-sims,2,"I chose to read this book to learn more about the science behind evolution, at least partially so I could defend or explain it to people. However, Coyne's writing style left much to be desired.At the parts where he did actually discuss evidence for evolution (which he often mislabeled as ""proof""), I enjoyed learning about it. However, he repeatedly attempted to use this information to discredit creationism, his main argument being ""See.... why would a creator do this?"" which is obviously neither science nor logical. It also bothered me that his working definition of creationism was sufficiently narrow as to be easily refuted. He also made statements like ""all creationist believe x"" or ""no creationist believes x"" which is sloppy and in some if not all cases just plain wrong.In his section of further reading, he makes a point of not including any books by proponents of creationism. This is his prerogative, but it makes me wonder if he has read any of them because of the many errors he attributes to the creationist perspective.Coyne claims that he wants to educate the public about evolution, but the tone of the book is so insular and, ultimately, many of the reasons people have for denying evolution aren't going to go away just because they read a book discussing scientific evidence contrary to their viewpoint."
22,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20015365-may,5,"A great book to end the year with. ""But there is something even more wondrous. We are the one creature to whom natural selection has bequeathed a brain complex enough to comprehend the laws that govern the universe. And we should be proud that we are the only species that has figured out how we came to be."""
23,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,3,"Well, I now have a new understanding why evolutionist feel so strongly and are so insistent that evolution is true. The evidence in this book is truly staggering, much of which I had never heard before. The book is well written and he seemed like a pretty reasonable guy, quick to mention when something is speculation and when something (according to the scientific community) is established fact. He bent over backwards to show that evolution is science in the fullest sense of the word and is scientific fact like the law of gravity. But yeah, one thing that bothered me is how much he fears and derides creationist, as if, if we let them have even a slight foot in the door, then its not just the end of science, but the end of the world. I think this is an over reaction. He also, refuses to acknowledge that modern science has its foundation on the Christian assumption that the universe is reasonable and discoverable. Secondly, for decades those making the biggest science advances (Like Isaac Newton) were creationist, their believe in God fueled their curiosity to learn about His universe and they believe by showing how it worked, they were bringing glory to God. I don't think the ""eeeeeevil"" creationist are as dangerous as he thinks. Though what he shared is extremely convincing, I am sure there are some devils in the details; details that the science community does well to hide or refuses to acknowledge in the first place. Evolution is to most now as it was to Darwin, their beloved child whom no one can question or insult or challenge. Unlike most evolutionist I don't deride those who have a different perspectives and see the evidence in a different light. I think one can learn from Jerry A Coyne and equally from Stephen Meyer. It is obvious that though there may be many interpretations of the data, only one is allowed. I also know the power of perspective and how when we go out to prove something, we can find a lot that fits and what does not, we can force until it does fit. So much of the evidence for evolution is in the fossil record, its like we have a bunch of puzzle pieces and they have in their mind a picture of how they're to all go together, so how can they help but arrange the pieces to please the eyes, just like the evil creationist also arrange the pieces to please their eyes. The presuppositions causes them to think the other side absurd. But yeah, evolutionist believe most species are extinct, but are not even open to the possibility that a fossil is from an extinct creature that we knew not of, but rather automatically assumes it is transitional fossil. But yeah, i am sure I am sounding like an idiot. So I'll shut up about this. The part concerning the genes was the most convincing, especially concerning the pseudo-genes in dolphins. But now i've found a book called ""The myth of junk DNA"", so I know there is different interpretation of the data. So I look forward to reading this book. The section about the evolution of creatures on remote islands is hard to propose a reasonable creationist alternative to, yet it has been done, unlike the author said.  He mentions if evolution was just random chance and accidence, then there would be no life, but he says its not just randomness, but we have lawful natural selection that solves everything. But it still is hard for me to follow the logic on how this fixes the problem. I mean he mentions that mutations are rare and beneficial mutations are extremely rare, so even though national selection grabs every positive mutation and carries it on, it still seems like the chances are absurdly low. Imagine a monkey typing on a keyboard (representing the random mutations) and then a man (who acts the part of natural selection) who jots down every intelligible word and throws out every nonsensical letter. This would not resulted in the writings of Shakespeare or even a intelligible sentence. In the DNA its like we have a word over a billion letters long, I just can't be convinced that randomness can produced more orderly information in the cell then information in the Encyclopedia Britannica. So yeah, I still am far from unconvinced of how the extremely rare unguided, random mutations can bring this about, even with the added element of natural selection. He also does not touch on origins, so yeah how did the molecule evolve the ability to evolve? they think the universe created them, who then created their creator?  There author seems to think the fact of evolution demands a naturalistic/darwinistic explanation, but I disagree and I think Alvin Plantinga's evolutionary argument against philosophical naturalism is pretty good. Plantinga shows if one embraces naturalism, then evolution turns into a defeater to naturalism. As John Lennox put it concerning how naturalism undermines science; ""Faith lies at the heart of science, that the universe is accessible to the human mind. What justifies this faith? Why should we believe that the universe is rational?... The materialist says; my mind is my brain, whats my brain? Its the end product of a mindless, unguided processes... Ohh... So why on earth should I believe anything it tells me? Including that it is the end product of a mindless unguided process!""  Finally, I could not disagree with him more, as he is trying to lay people's worries aside that if their kids are taught they are animals, that they'll start acting like ones. He thinks there is absolutely no bad consequence to believing one is just a bunch of molecules with no concrete value, no absolute morality and no ultimate meaning. But a lot of atheist are running on the fums of Christian ethics, but should we not fear that it might dry up? In the 1900s we saw Darwinism taken to its logical conclusions several times throughout Russia, Germany, China and we even saw eugenics happened in the united states. Atheist regimes had part in the murder of 100 million of their OWN people, they evidently did not believe in the value of the individual and they're political drive was in perfect harmony with their godless belief in the origin of the universe."
24,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2765549-jonathan,3,"I was homeschooled as a child, and my parents believed strongly that creation was a fundamental tenant of Christianity. My science education included quite a lot of books by Creationist authors like Duane Gish, who views evolution as a laughable, largely unsupported ""theory"" invented to dispose of the inconvenient need for a Creator. So, for me, reading this book was a little like looking at a photographic negative: the same tone, similar content, but with all the characters flipped. Just like the zealous Creationists who wrote the textbooks I read as a child, this one is written by a zealous Evolutionist who, in his eagerness to demonstrate the superiority of his theory, strays beyond the boundaries of fair debate.For example, he is very fond of pointing out bits of nature that weren't designed as he would have designed them, and coming to the unfounded conclusion that they weren't designed at all. For example, as evidence of evolution, he points out that the plants that live in the deserts near California are different species than those that live in the deserts of the Sahara. Wouldn't a designer, he argues, have simply used the same kinds of plants in both places, since they have similar climates? Since the plants are different, we can conclude that they were not created. QED. Lest you think that I'm exaggerating, here's the actual quote from the book:Why would a creator put plants that are fundamentally different, but look so similar, in diverse areas of the world that seem ecologically identical? Wouldn’t it make more sense to put the same species of plants in areas with the same type of soil and climate?To which I say: well goodness, Jerry, do you buy the precisely same decorations for your living room as you do for your dining room? If not, your interior design can hardly be intelligent. Surely you can grant that a Creator might have enjoyed filling each corner of the Earth with different kinds of plants and animals!With so much good evidence for evolution (and this book lays out plenty of it), there's hardly a need to stray into this line of argument. Yet the author does so, repeatedly, and betrays more than a little condescenion towards those poor, foolish Creationists. However grating the occasional overreaches and smugness are, however, they aren't a major feature of the book and in truth this is a very well-organized, well-written, and thorough defense of evolution. There are even moments of humility, in which the author admits that science doesn't, and maybe never will, know how certain implausible bridges were crossed. Finally, there's a bit at the end that addresses the elephant in the room, without flinching: if we're nothing more than an accidental result of blind, purposeless forces, what's the point of ... well, anything really? While more a question for philosophers than biologists, he addresses it admirably. Perhaps the biggest challenge to the adoption of evolution as fact is not its lack of scientific evidence but its lack of a compelling, purposeful story."
25,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"This is a suggested book related to one of my current classes on Coursera, so I decided to pick it up. I already believe in evolution, so I can't judge on whether it's convincing -- I already know that evolution by natural selection is mathematically inevitable, and I know of a lot of the supporting evidence. Still, this is the kind of book that produces all sorts of titbits that you didn't know before, and which lays things out so clearly it helps you understand how to explain it to other people (which, to my mind, means a deeper understanding of the theory -- if you can explain it, there are fewer grey areas).Overall, it's clearly written, with lots of supporting diagrams and so on where it's useful, and a good set of footnotes and suggestions for further reading. I found it interesting, too; perhaps not for a person with a science background to begin with, but for me (humanities background, science interest) it was easy but not boringly so.Interestingly, he also touches a little on why people find it hard to accept evolution, and answers some of those objections, too -- for example, why our behaviour isn't fully dictated by our genes, why morality and ethics aren't dismantled in any way by evolution."
26,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3411374-mattmiller,3,"As a firm believer in the God of the Bible and his work in the creation of all things I picked up this book to try to become better educated on the subject of evolution. Coyne's writing is clear and concise. He is a good communicator and uses plenty of sources and examples for which I was grateful.Rather than completely contradicting my theistic view, many (yet not all) of his points broadened my appreciation of the immensity and beauty of God's creation. Although his end-of-book thoughts on evolution and the meaning of life were a bit lame, he's after all a scientist not a philosopher and so I guess you have to keep that in mind.While I understand his consistent interaction with Creationism and ID thought, I thought his jabs were unnecessary and his tone condescending at times. But I expected worse.Anyway, I feel like I have been inadequately educated on this branch of science and this book helped me. There are still many questions I have and points to ponder, as I believe in the inerrant nature of the biblical text. But I feel much better equipped to ponder after reading this book."

However there are yet lots of questions that are unsolved and probably needs decades of research until humans come to a better understanding of how we “biologically” came to existence. The author was more respectful to deniers of evolution that Dawkins is. He was also more straight forward. The big drawback though, is that when comparing the ideas of “creationists” as the author likes to call them, he mainly focused on Christianity teachings who anyways believe that life of humans does not exceed 10 thousand years. The author did not touch on the logic of Islamic teachings (where some scholars do not deny evolution) which talk of creation as the work of Allah; ""It is] the work of Allah who perfected all things Indeed He is Acquainted with that which you do""The balance we see on earth, the beauty of all what is on earth (as opposed to the emptiness in the universe) are all but obvious evidence that what has become did not come by luck. Natural selection might be good a theory explaining the biological evolution of the species, but not enough to explain the first creation (which the author purposefully and openly did not include in his book).I enjoyed the book and now have questions of my own; such as how to understand the story of Adam and Eve in light of evolution? Is it possible they ascended to the heavens and back to earth? I am sure one day it will be clear and obvious, and the evidence of creation by Allah will be too strong to deny. "

Jerry A. Coyne's argumentation shapes evolution as a FACT. However, there are yet lots of questions that are unsolved and probably needs decades of research until humans come to a better understanding of how we “biologically” came to existence. And also as Thomas Nagel puts forward in his ""Mind and Cosmos"" book : If materialism cannot accommodate ""consciousness"" and other mind-related aspects of reality, then we must abandon a purely materialist understanding of nature in general, extending to biology, evolutionary theory, and cosmology. Since minds are features of biological systems that have developed through evolution, the standard materialist version of evolutionary biology is fundamentally incomplete. Intelligent Design(ID) & DNA is a hot issue in evolutionary science yet to be clarified by philosophers or so.کتاب های انتقادی داروینیسمBooks against Darwinism: https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/4..."

It's short but packed with evidence from embryology, biogeography, vestigial structures and the fossil record and explains, with plenty of examples, the process of natural selection, genetic drift, speciation, sexual selection and human evolution.One of the examples that most appealed to me because it is so wholesome was John Wells' study of coral fossils which the isotope dating places in the Devonian period (380 million years ago). The theory of the geophysicists that the friction produced by the ocean tides gradually slows Earth's rotation down by 2 seconds every 100,000 years was neatly confirmed by the corals Wells studied, in that the corals had about 400 daily growth rings inside an annual ring - in accordance with the calculation that 380 million years ago a day lasted about 22h, or that there were about 396 days in a year, while the modern corals show about 365 rings. It's such a well-rounded, brilliant yet accessible example of interdisciplinary science at work.This was primarily intended to reason with the creationists in USA, of which there's no lack of. I can't help but wonder if he managed to ""turn"" a single fundamentalist, but at least the general public - myself included - got a very readable and well articulated overview of evolution."
30,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"I hesitated before buying this book because I was a little put off by the title. I already assumed evolution was ""true"" (as much as any scientific knowledge can be considered ""the truth""), and I was more interested in knowing how it works, and the history of it all, from the first micro-organisms to now. The ""how"" part is covered pretty well, and by covering the ""how"" the author addresses creationist or ""intelligent design"" arguments and provides a clear, rational, and most importantly scientific answer. To be fair, the idea of natural selection and evolution seems simple enough, but how it leads to complex devices like an eyeball seems inexplicable... until it is explained. The creationist arguments are all fair, in the sense that they are perfectly valid questions to ask- until they are answered. But a perfectly valid question isn't the same as a valid objection. The book does a very good job at answering questions and debunking creationist objections in the process of explaining how evolution works, although this isn't the main focus of the book. At points along the way the author pauses to address a creationist objection- debunks it- and moves right along. And its done with such convincing ease that by the end the question is not ""How could evolution be true?"" but ""How could it be otherwise?""I don't think this book will change a creationist's mind, because if mere logical, rational, scientific explanations were all it took, creationism (an appeal to the supernatural rather than the natural) wouldn't exist in the first place. But I don't think that was the intent with this book. The book's title isn't ""Why creationism is wrong."" There is no point in arguing with a creationist whose faith feels threatened by science. If somebody isn't threatened by science then ""more science"" isn't going to change anything. But for the rest of us, laypeople who occasionally hear a creationist argument and think ""Oh, well that seems like a good point, I wonder how Darwanism answers that?"" the answers are here. And eventually, by the end of the book, with a good understanding of how darwanism works, any creationist question no longer seems like a good question- but more of an admission of ""I don't understand how this works.""There is nothing wrong with the statement ""I don't understand how this works"" as long as it is not followed with ""Therefore it can not be true."" Is it any better than saying ""I don't understand how this works, but I'll assume it's true""? No- unless that statement is followed by ""Because I understand the method by which this conclusion was reached."" If you understand the scientific method and think that observation, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, and comparison are really good ways to arrive at a conclusion about something then you will readily accept conclusions reached by those methods without knowing the details. So by understanding and accepting this method as a valid way to understand the world, it is perfectly reasonable to accept knowledge as being ""true"" that was achieved using these methods.You can't, however, argue one way or the other for something without knowing anything about it. I believed evolution to be true because I trusted the method by which the theory was developed, but I wanted to be able to understand the theory itself, and this book did a great job of it.One final note. The author did a great job at addressing the ""Just a theory"" argument. It isn't ""just a theory"", but a ""scientific theory"" which is completely different than ""a random guess with no way of testing it"". There is no point arguing it in a book review. Suffice to say the book spells it out and does a great job. Enough so that I underlined the entire thing.If you want to understand Darwinism, don't be put off by the title. By the end of the book you will understand how it works. The books isn't a defense of the theory but an explanation that is so thorough that it defends itself.I subtracted one star because I wish there was a little more about the timeline of evolution and the different eras of the earth's history. Another chapter would have been nice. "

I was expecting evolution/creationist argument in the preface, maybe even in the first chapter. Unfortunately, It's littered throughout the book. I understand that some readers actually enjoy this mindless drubbing, if so, this book is for you. What I was hoping for was a deeper biological understanding of speciation and specialization, and to Coyne's credit there are anecdotes littered throughout. Sadly, Those anecdotes are merely a way for Coyne to stick out his tongue and say ""I told you so, dummy"", they offer little new insights to those with a baseline understanding of biology. If you like Dawkins,you'll like Coyne, and If you like both I offer some simple advice. Grow up, and read a book with some scientific teeth. I recommend Stephen Jay Gould. If you are like me and are interested in speciation and specialization, I recommend skipping this book, and watching Coyne's lecture.

I can't imagine how hard it is to summarize a topic as voluminous as evolution into 230 pages.Without a doubt, evolution is complicated. It is one of the most misunderstood facts, and definitely the most viciously attacked. Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of explaining some of the basic tenets of evolution to the reader in a very succinct way. It is a breath taking read; this book needs to be read more than once. If only those who are so adamant about ID would crack open this book! Evolution is a beautiful mess. But, the fact that of all the species and of all mutations over billions of years, we are the only ones who have been awarded reason and a complex brain- that, to me, is far more meaningful and beautiful than to think someone created us and ""blessed us"" with it. We managed to become who we are, through billions of years of genetic fight. We are special, and we are here. Wow.

The author has a remarkably humble tone as he describes both the assertive truth of evolution as well as the ongoing process of unfinished learning of science (e.g., the study of biogenesis, the beginning of the universe, evolutionary psychology, evolution's inability to stand alone as an ethical/moral system, etc.). I believe that this book was well worth the time to read.Evolution can by no means explain everything about the world around us, but contrary to the opinions of many creationists/ID advocates, it does not presume to. This is the essence of science: the search for knowledge rather than the presumption of it.Why Evolution is True is an excellent popular treatise of evolution because it makes clear these points, and is honest about the shortcomings (both real and imagined) of modern evolutionary theory.

39,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,4,"Let me tell you a little story.In high school, I was taught science from a ""Creationist"" perspective. I did who-knows-how-many research projects and papers on ""Creation versus Evolution"". I became pretty knowledgeable about the subject (or so I thought). I owned a tome titled ""Science vs Evolution"", a graduation present from my biology teacher, and could give all the talking points on why Darwinism was false.Fast forward a number of years. I can't pinpoint the moment when my perspective changed. I think it started with a nagging suspicion that, despite all the Creationist videos I had watched and the articles I had read, I had never truly, actually heard the argument for evolution from evolutionary scientists themselves, and only knew the distorted interpretations of their arguments from their ""critics"".I changed my mind, ultimately, not because of a wealth of scientific rebuttals to combat every objection of Intelligent Design advocates. It came down to a simple matter of logic.That logic is this: The theory of evolution came about from the scientific process. Predictions are made, evidence is gathered, and conclusions are drawn. At every turn, for more than a century, the assumptions about evolution have been rigorously questioned, challenged, and tested under scientific scrutiny.And throughout this process, the theory of evolution has not only survived, but become stronger and more deeply understood. And it is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists.Contrast this with the idea of Intelligent Design, or Creationism. This concept does not start with predictions that can be completely questioned or re-thought at any moment; it cannot flexibly follow the evidence, wherever it leads.Creationism begins with a conclusion, and seeks evidence to support that conclusion.In other words, the theory of evolution is scientific. Creationism is not.I had become convinced of evolution from a logical perspective, but I still did not understand it. I did not have the high school education most people get on the subject. I still had all those talking points from Answers in Genesis that I knew were false, but didn't have responses for.This book, Why Evolution is True, became the perfect answer to my needs. Coyne lays out the mechanisms of and evidence for evolution in very easy-to-understand, eye-opening terms that the average, non-scientific reader can absorb and enjoy.It's also relatively short (not a difficult read), while still astonishingly robust in the power of its evidence and strength of its arguments.I came to this book already convinced of evolution; I came way fully understanding it (for the first time), and EXCITED about its awesomeness. Seriously, evolution is... REALLY COOL???I'm greatly appreciative of the author for writing this, and helping me to fill a gap in my knowledge... while also helping me discovery the pure joy and wonder that comes with knowing our origins.Buuuuuuut... he does get one tiny star bumped off, and this is for purely opinionated reasons, but in his discussions of gender he sometimes lapsed into what I can only call ""male arrogance"". The way he talked about men and women just grated on my nerves. Not what he said was untrue or anything, just written in an annoying way that felt way too comfortable with male superiority. My objection is completely non-intellectual and subjective, but hey! This is my review! I can give whatever stars I wanted!In all seriousness, this book is amazing. It will doubtlessly be my default recommendation for fence-sitters, skeptics, and other people who lacked an honest education in the fact of evolution like I did."
40,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81496242-sakshi-sinha,5,"This book is a compelling read. Learning about evolution, the process and time that goes into this makes you just respect and admire our environment and animals even more. -Firstly, Coyne discusses about creationism and evolution. He often includes antidotes throughout the book. Its so unbelievable that there are people out there who don’t believe in evolution!!There are references from Darwin’s book “The Origin”, other authors and scientists who have worked in this field. Introducing different viewpoints to us. -Then it continues with Coyne explaining different theories and concepts of evolution. This isn’t much of a rocket science. It just requires basic comprehension of species and biology and I think it’s pretty easy to grip on. -Along with facts and views, Coyne mentions alot of studies conducted on fossils and how they helped in grouping and combining the story of evolution. It’s really an engaging study and this has actually amplified my interest in fossils.-In addition to this the author addresses evolution in different aspects of wildlife such as in aquatic animals, birds, mammals etc. Coyne also describes at length natural selection , vestigial organs, genetics etc.-Altogether the book is filled with engrossing examples and it’s so amusing. There are images for references which make it easier to interpret description the author provides. -lastly, I do have a suggestion, Coyne mentions various kinds of animals, insects, birds, and not all of them have a visual representation in the book. I suggest you use google to understand their anatomy and explore various journals or articles. It might take extra time but I think this just adds another layer of knowledge to the read. This book really is an eye opener. Overall brilliant book! I would recommend it:) "
41,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25797445-eugene,5,"Why Evolution is True is a very interesting and thought provoking read. Detailed yet written for the lay person, Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of clearly laying out the evidence for Darwinian evolution from a common ancestor and why it is unanimously accepted by all scientists not already predisposed to creationism. From the fossil record and DNA sequencing to continental drift and speciation, he not only lays out the multiple lines of evidence but also shows the countless predictions that have been made using the evolutionary model, and counters each example by explaining how creationism fails these predictions and doesn't yield what we would expect to find were it the case. I have a very limited scientific background, but had no trouble understanding most of the book. On top of arguing the scientific evidence, he also does well at addressing common social and moral objections to evolution. The last chapter describes how contrary to popular (usually creationist) belief, evolution properly understood does not lend itself to racism. Races evolved to adapt better to various environments as branches spreading out on the evolutionary tree, and there is nothing to suggest any sort of racial superiority. Likewise Coyne debunks the popular but misguided argument that believing evolution will make people lose all sense of morality. Quite contrary, the more we learn about how our social behaviours evolved and how our brains developed to comprehend all these questions, the more we can appreciate the value of our lives. My only contention is how he subtly seems to slip in his anti-theist presupposition toward the end by saying appeal to the supernatural is not necessary when discussing origins. It may not be necessary, but it would be more accurate to say science and the God debate fall under seperate, non overlapping categories as one deals purely in falsifiable claims while the other does not. That being said, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious to learn more about evolution and its implications written in a very matter of fact, unbiased way."

So why, when evolution is being reconfirmed every day, and forms the backbone of modern biology, do we need a book entitled Why Evolution Is True?""It's just as the description above has said, the evidence that supporting Evolution is enormous, starting from the first life on Earth until the evolution of Homo-sapiens. Every single life is just as Darwin had predicted, you won't find a fossil that exists in the Cambrian Age in the Precambrian Age and vice versa. In fact Evolution declared a bet as the evolutionist Richard Dawkins said: ""To those who has doubts about Evolution to scratch hardly in the Rocks to find an unsuitable fossil, we challenge them to that, will they accept the bet?"" In ""Why Evolution Is True"", Jerry A Coyne takes us to a journey in the Wonders of Natural Selection. He started with what a scientific theory means and then he goes on to explain the endless evidence of evolution and connecting it with everything around us, ""Some claim that evolution is just a theory, as if it were merely an opinion. But evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact. Evolution really happened. Accepting our kinship with all life on Earth is not only solid science ... in my view it's also a soaring spiritual experience."" –Neil deGrasse TysonYour body is a proof of multiple enhancing processes that have been done over millions of years starting from your individual cells to genes to last nerve in your Brain, for example the way human born is one of the best examples that we are descending from birds, by time the human evolved the way of giving birth doesn't change, the body of the baby turned upside down and the head of the baby (which becomes significantly bigger than that of our ancestors) faced the entrance of the womb, here we have to say isn't it ridiculous for God to do something like that, I mean why would He even blueprint-ed (or design) us with something very painful and can threatened the life of the mother just to prove something nothing than His sadistic nature of enjoying the screams of the mothers. Then he talked about Mutation and how it was at first the stick that Creationists wave on the face of Evolutionists every time they started a debate, he also mentioned and shed some lights on Linski's magnificent experiment on E-coli Bacteria which took 20 years and opened the gate in front of us to witness that ""Natural Selection + Mutations + Time = Darwin was Right""After that he talked about neuroscience and that evolution also has the ability to describe Morals and that Morals are not something comes up with Religion, it's something far more than that, it's something we might inherited it but mostly we gain it by practicing (eg: The Chimpanzees experiment). Jerry also explained that evolution doesn't necessarily mean to evolve into something more sophisticated, there's also a ""Redox Evolution"" which for example the evolution of Whales from Reptiles. I know I haven't wrote much and I won't, coz if you want to know something you have to dig for it, but what I'm totally convinced about is that the evidence evolution provides are stronger, reliable and more scientific than the Ideal Design provides, and that the idea of us coming from Adam and Eve is nothing but a Myth. It's not my words it's what science told us with EVIDENCE. It's as Carl Sagan said: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” – Cosmos."

But I can at least try to dispel the misconceptions that frighten people away from evolution and from the amazing derivation of life’s staggering diversity from a single naked replicating molecule.""Such is the writing style of Jerry Coyne, an accessible and well-versed author and research professor of evolutionary biology. This landmark work should have staying power in the annals of popular science, though it is lacking in philosophical nuance and subtlety. It is not intended to be a textbook for academics but rather a treatise to persuade anyone without a background in the subject. He is strong in his convictions and forceful in his rhetoric; a blog of the same name may be consulted for further reading and development of his thinking in this area.Why Evolution Is True is a serious page-turner. Coyne has a gift for conveying complex ideas and anyone of high-school education should not have trouble following his arguments.Far easier to understand than other overviews like Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, the primary focus is the direct evidence and ever-mounting proof which we have amassed since Darwin's formulation of the theory nearly two centuries ago. If one went into this topic without any knowledge the book would serve as a comprehensive introduction to the topic and its fundamental concepts, though they will miss out on discussion of related issues, e.g. memes and extended phenotype.Coyne makes the commendable decision to anticipate objections to each of his chapters, much like Darwin did in later editions of On the Origin of Species; he knows that evolution is a contested and widely-misunderstood field and that minds tend to be closed to its authenticity. There are some questions that are oft-raised without sufficient answer in the public square: how did the eye form if not by a miracle? Of what use is half a wing to an evolving bird, and how could that possibly be selected for? He tackles these deftly and head-on, giving answers and insight that reflect his depth of knowledge.Near the end of chapter 9 we are given this summary:""Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life’s diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life... Most of us do need meaning, purpose, and moral guidance in our lives. How do we find them if we accept that evolution is the real story of our origin? That question is outside the domain of science.""He then proceeds to dismiss all answers outside of naturalism and materialism outright, which shows the limitations of his view in dialogue with contrasting opinions. Coyne does not attempt to appear as an unbiased explicator of evolutionary theory. This is a minor problem in the scope of the work, and perhaps a deserved one; he could hardly be more vindicated due to the sheer force of evidence for macroevolution. It makes me wonder if a more dispassionate approach could have been helpful. There are, despite his bewilderment, religious people who believe in evolution.He leaves us with a pithy and hopeful quote:""Evolution tells us where we came from, not where we can go.""I would definitely recommend this work to anyone who is curious about the developments in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural and sexual selection. As long as they are open to the evidence and don't mind the occasional sneer from the author, by the end there should be little doubt that evolution is, in fact, true."
44,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6350127-seawood,5,"Read for Coursera ""Writing in the Sciences"" and ""Genetics & Evolution"" courses.Why Evolution Is True is a love-letter to Charles Darwin; an accessible and detailed overview of the current state of evolution research. Each strand of knowledge which contributes to our understanding is laid out clearly, starting in many cases with what Darwin knew or intuited when writing On The Origin Of Species. Coyne deftly takes us through the developments in areas such as the fossil record, embryology, vestigial organs, biogeography and genetics; showing how predictions can be made and how discoveries since Darwin's time have confirmed the process of evolution over and over again. Many eye-catching examples are used to demonstrate where we can expect to find fossils in geological layers; how the bodily organisation of modern creatures follows patterns laid down in ancestral forms; and how environmental pressures lead to adaptation. The example of the modern mammalian laryngeal nerve as poor design derived from ancient forms is particularly striking. The nerve is involved in speech and swallowing and connects the brain to the larynx. It wraps around the aorta (a large vessel in the heart) rather than taking a direct route. This is not an issue for an ancient fishlike creature – but in a human the nerve has to be about a foot in length to follow the same route. In a giraffe, which has the same basic body plan, the nerve is three feet long! This is obviously inefficient and may even be more prone to injury, but clearly shows the laryngeal nerve adapting to follow the evolutionary changes in the body pattern.Coyne also shows how these additions to our knowledge efficiently take down the creationist or “intelligent design” arguments. Whilst he concedes that those arguing from faith will probably not change their minds, the book is very much aimed at people who are uncertain about the science. For European readers, this frequent referencing of creationism is a little grating since it is not such a large issue in this part of the world, but it is understandable when the American audience has a much greater background of “disbelief” in evolution [1].The final chapters are devoted to recent human evolution (from the period following divergence from chimps) and an overview of some of the difficulties people have with the possible implications of evolution for human behaviour. Overall, this is an excellent text for anyone who would like to understand the principles of evolution or update their knowledge, written in an entertaining and engaging style.[1] http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313... – unfortunately this, the original article in Science, is paywalled, but you can see a mirror at http://old.richarddawkins.net/article..., including the table comparing “belief” vs “disbelief” in evolution from 34 countries in 2005.

If you are an evolutionist, you'll probably be quite pleased with the book. And there's pity. For many, the book won't be read on its merits but for whether it supports or challenges one's views on the issue of Darwinian evolutionary theory.In terms of the book itself. . . . The purpose is specified by Jerry Coyne, the author, on page xiv: ""This book lays out the main lines of evidence for evolution. For those who oppose Darwinism purely as a matter of faith, no amount of evidence will do--theirs is a belief not based on reason. But for the many who find themselves uncertain, or who accept evolution but are not sure how to argue the case, this volume gives a succinct summary of why modern science recognizes evolution as true.""The book unfolds in a straightforward fashion. Chapter 1 summarizes the nature of evolution. He discusses the essence of the concept of evolution--""a species undergoing genetic change over time"" (page 3). Also discussed is ""natural selection,"" the process by which the more ""fit"" individuals tend to be more successful in reproductive terms That is, they leave more offspring than their less fit peers).Subsequent chapters outline the evidence for evolution, including often jury-rigged adaptations (evolution makes do with the organism/species as it exists and often leaves organisms that are poorly designed--but still capable of successful reproduction: think the lower back of humans!), the fossil record, a more detailed discussion of the process of natural selection, the relationship between sex and evolution, how species arise and develop, and--always an issue that excites passion--the relevance of evolution for humankind.The book itself does well what it sets out to do. There are things that bother me. As with many, the author claims that evolution is a ""fact."" I have never understood this allegation. Neo-Darwinian theory is a THEORY--not a fact. Lots of facts support the theory. By itself, though, it is NOT a fact. I think advocates of evolution shoot themselves in the foot with such an argument. Many, of course, would rejoin, ""It's ONLY a theory."" Such folks also don't know what they're talking about. A good theory is a great thing! Not ""just."" Quantum theory is terrific; Einstein's relativity is a fine theory. And so on.All in all, if the reader wants an accessible advocacy of evolutionary theory, this book does the job nicely. If the reader does not accept it, the book, of course, will not be very compelling."
46,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36384001-yousuf,2,"Good Overview, But Contains Straw MenThis is a good summary for the pro-Evolution side if anyone is researching the evolution-creation controversy. It goes through the fossil evidence, genetic evidence, geological evidence, and more for Evolution via natural selection (and other naturalistic processes). The author writes in a clear and logical manner, and generally avoids the confrontational polemics that other writers such as Richard Dawkins are prone to.My main objection is that Coyne uses misrepresentations to attack Intelligent Design (ID). He tries to associate ID with Young Earth Creationism many times, arguing that the two are similar or have similar methods. Nothing could be further from the truth. Pro-ID people are NOT making a deduction from religious scriptures; rather they are analyzing the structure of the cell (such as the information encoded in DNA) and making inferences based on that. You might not agree with their conclusions, but you should not try to smear them in a dishonest way.Another issue that I had was that most of Coyne's objections to ID are ""theological"" in nature. What I mean is that he points to ""flaws"" in organisms and basically states: ""An intelligent designer would have done a better job of this.""But these are theological, not scientific, objections; and they have theological, not scientific, answers. Probably because the Designer made the designs bad on purpose - I dunno, perhaps this world wasn't supposed to be perfect in the first place?He admits that materialist scientists do not have an explanation for the origin of life (OOL) as well as the Cambrian Explosion. But then he brings out the stereotypical ""God-of-the-gaps! God-of-the-gaps!"" argument to rebut ID here... I was literally shaking my head out of disappointment (though I wasn't at all surprised). Also, the response to integrated complexity was vague and didn't make much sense to me.I'm currently reading Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design, which is a pro-ID account of OOL. And I can tell you, it is anything but God-of-the-gaps. The entire argument is based on what we do know in biology, not a gap of any kind.I know the above review sounds harsh, but I actually enjoyed reading this book and I do recommend it to anyone who's interested in evolution or the evolution-creation controversy."

However, if you are undecided and truly interested in learning about the wealth of evidence that supports evolution as, indeed, the way (along with sea cucumbers, lichen, platypuses and blue whales) came to be, this is a wonderful book. Even if you already have a fair working knowledge of the theory (and that's theory in the scientific sense, not in the casual ""it's only a theory"" sense), you'll likely find a lot of new and fascinating details herein.All the classic evidence that you learned in school (if you're my age) is here, along with scads of new evidence in fields like microbiology, geology, paleobotany, and many others. The book avoids jargon except when it's needed in order to be specific, defines unfamiliar terms as it goes, explains how the facts in highly diverse areas support one another, points out the numerous areas where evolution would predict X and in fact science finds X, and generally lays out its case in a comprehensive and coherent manner. Happily, it also does so without either proselytizing or haranguing, leaving the reader to make his or her own decision in evaluating the range of interlocking facts presented. The last chapter discusses why certain religious sects have such difficulty accepting evolution, which was also enlightening and interesting.Highly recommended for the lay reader interested in acquiring a solid overview of the scientific evidence for evolution."

Coyne's Why Evolution Is True is a fine place to start. As his unsubtle title suggests, Coyne's purpose is to banish the arguments of creationists and their intelligent design fellow travelers. Much as Darwin did, he draws upon geology and the fossil record; biogeography, or the distribution of plants and animals; and the similarities and differences among living species. But gaps that once frustrated Darwin, such as so-called ""missing links"" in the fossil record, can now be filled. ... ... he builds a strong case for the fact of evolution, and for Darwin's theory of how it works. (That species change over time isn't theoretical; how and why the changes occur is the subject of ""evolutionary theory."") Coyne addresses many of the common creationist arguments head-on, outlining how complex systems such as eyes and biochemical pathways can evolve by natural selection. To his credit, however, the author acknowledges his strategy's fatal flaw: The refusal to accept evolution has precious little to do with reason, logic or evidence. Like the introductory college courses it too-closely resembles, Why Evolution Is True is packed with facts and clear explanations but is unlikely to change many minds."""
49,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59370311-gerald-di-o,4,"The title of the book is akin to ""Why Gravity Is True"" or ""Why Existence Of Atoms Is True"". It's sad to think that even on this modern day, we still need books to show what is just actually is. It's always my dream to become an evolutionary anthropologist and by reading this book only ignites that passion more! This is a great book on evolution though some might find it to be dry. But the author has thoroughly described how evolution works and presented - as is the case in scientific literatures - a lot of convincing and irrefutable evidence. One thing I liked is the organization of the chapters where Coyne subtly explained the concepts and applied them first on evolution of ""lesser"" organisms, then on to human evolution. For readers who are honest-seekers, do not discount evolution until you have read this book. And for those who are already convinced, this could be a good weapon against Creationists (Intelligent Design proponents)."
50,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6019621-willard-brickey,4,"Richard Dawkins has set the bar very high for books about evolution for the layman. The Blind Watchmaker and The Ancestor's Tale are the best books of this genre I have ever read. He is a bit more detailed than Coyne, a bit more lucid, and if I may say so, a bit more exciting, even a bit more poetic.Nevertheless, at under 300 pages, Why Evolution Is True is the best short book I've ever read on the subject. The last chapter, about the implications (and lack of implications) of the theory of evolution for our own species, is very good. And Dawkins himself gives the book high praise.Well worth reading."
51,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/596234-rashid,5,"One can only think of the words of Richard Dawkins, quoted in the book, where he says “after sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet, sparkling with colour, bountiful with life. Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isn’t it a noble, an enlighten way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it? This is how I answer when I’m asked - as I am surprisingly often - why I bother to get up in the mornings.” This book helps in its short and concise manner lay the argument for evolution, helping us understand our place in the intricacies of this marvellous world."

56,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42147710-michael-shore,5,Coyne nailed it. A fantastic summary of the basic concepts and evidence for evolution.
57,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"To be more precise and clear, the title of the book should be ""why the modern theory of evolution is true."" Changing the title doesn't make a difference to us the believers of the theory (I'll call the theory Darwinism for short), because we usually accept it as a bundle package. But after reading the book, I realize the theory makes multi-level propositions. ""Evolution happened"" is only one of them. Coyne mentions this structure of Darwinism repeatedly, but I think he could make the book stronger by laying it out at the very beginning. In my own words, the theory of evolution proposes the following hierarchy of propositions:1. Evolutionary change (change in inheritable traits of a population through generations) happened. Not only on the micro level (change of traits within a species) but also the macro level (the transformation of one species into another)2. Natural selection explains most of the microevolutionary change, e.g., the change in beak size of birds.3. Natural selection explains most of the macroevolutionary change, e.g., the origin of birds.4. Natural selection builds complex features in nonhuman species, such as the eyes and the brain.5. Natural selection builds complex features of humans, such as language and consciousness.  Some creationists refuse all propositions above. Some admit (1) but refuse to explain it by natural selection. Others accept natural selection only to a certain level. All of them share one common belief: natural selection cannot make us human to be what we are. As a response, Coyne provides ample evidence to support Darwinism. The evidence includes the following: • Species can be classified and grouped in a tree-like way• Discovery of transitional fossils at predicted locations with the expected age.• Features that only make sense by natural selection: vestiges / atavism / dead DNA / Embryo palimpsest / bad design• Distributions of species across the globe, such as how different species fill similar roles in different areas, how certain species lack on volcanic islands but not on continental islands, and the radiations of endemic species on volcanic islands.• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by artificial selection• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by natural selection in labs and fields• Math simulations that exhibit evolutionary paths to complex features under natural selection. An important lesson I learned from Coyne's enumeration of the evidence above, is to treat the following two things differently: 1) the general evolutionary theory, and 2) individual evolutionary explanations of traits and behaviors. Darwin provides us a beautiful theory. It is so simple, yet so powerful. But beauty does not equal truth. Darwinism is generally correct because scientists have accumulated a huge amount of supporting evidence. An individual evolutionary explanation, however, must bear its own burden of proof. We should not blindly believe in a single evolutionary explanation because there are often multiple competing evolutionary explanations of a trait or behavior. Many of them are inevitable ""just-so stories."" Moreover, natural selection is not the only chisel used by nature the sculptor. Features can be generated by other mechanisms, such as genetic drift and sexual selection. I found the hypothesis explaining the existence of human appendix especially interesting: it is possible that natural selection simply can't shrink the appendix anymore, because before it disappears from shrinking, a smaller appendix gives rise to a higher risk of being blocked.  This lesson also applies to economics, another discipline that is guided by a core theory — the rational choice theory. Again, the core theory might be generally correct, but this does not mean it is correct in every context, far from it.  Coyne also reminds me that most evolutionary explanations of complex human features, no matter how elaborate, are untested and probably untestable. This is unfortunate, because the evolution of such features, especially the evolution of consciousness, seems to be the most intriguing question of all. But to quote Darwin, we should not ""positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."" Instead, we should keep searching for testable theories in the future.  Stray observation:- The book solved a big puzzle I had in high school biology class: why human embryos look so weird and go through phases of development that make no sense.- Darwin did not explain the origin of species in his same-titled book (he would explain it in later books and papers). A better title for The Origin of Species, would have been The Origin of Adaptations."
58,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23258105-dileep-n,5,"tl;dr Evolution is true. The big picture is indisputably clear. What remains is to probe the finer details of the mechanics and processes underlying it. If Coyne's primary goal in writing this book was to convince Creationists that evolution is true, it remains unfulfilled. The people he's trying to convince are precisely the kind whom no amount of evidence supporting evolution can convince. This book lacks the only thing that can convince Creationists and proponents of Intelligent Design - passages from their holy book of choice, or even better, a direct quote from their god of choice, stating evolution is true. Kidding aside, the sad truth is that it is nigh impossible to fight dogma and deeply entrenched beliefs with logic and evidence. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. This book is the result of one such attempt and it is a brilliant one at that. Kudos to Coyne for fighting the good fight. Unless you're the kind of person who relies exclusively on made-up stories from stale, antiquated texts for moral guidance and laws of the natural world, you probably already know evolution is true, or rather, that it is the best explanation we have so far for the origin of life on this planet; and I'm fairly sure you will find this book insightful and enjoyable. The book is full of interesting facts and observations that unequivocally prove that evolution is a scientific fact. Topics that are covered include discovery of fossils, particularly of intermediates; speciation and biogeography; vestigial traits and organs that along with emryology provide a window into the past; genetic drift as an alternative (although minor) engine of evolution besides Darwinian natural selection; the powers of sexual selection; and lastly, the origin of of our own species along with a brief but useful discussion on the dicey issue of race. Along with a historical overview, Coyne also details recent evidence (last three decades) supporting evolution and advances made in paleontology, molecular and evolutionary biology, and a few other fields, which I found very helpful. At one time or another, I'm sure most of us have wondered, ""Now that the pressures of natural selection are largely absent in most human societies, are we still evolving? If so, in what ways?"" I found the beginnings of an answer to this in the penultimate chapter.The crisp, clear, and no-nonsense writing style makes digesting this information-rich book painless. Coyne has also provided handy notes clarifying certain ideas, pointing out opposing viewpoints, and lisiting resources for those interested in exploring a topic further. Several of the books he has mentioned have found their way into my to to-read list.This is a cogent synthesis of facts about evolution and of coherent arguments in its favor. Not only does it satiate your curiosity and expand your mind but it also arms you with knowledge for those uncomfortable engagements with staunch Creationsists. Highly recommended!"
59,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"The title of this book bluntly states its purpose, which is to refute, head on, the claims advanced by creationists and supporters of intelligent design that evolution by natural selection cannot possibly explain how life takes the many forms that it does. Biologist Jerry Coyne convincingly addresses every conceivable argument that could be made against evolution, using numerous examples to explain how life as it exists today must have arisen through evolution. To this end, he covers evidence from:- Fossils and biogeography.- Vestigial organs (eg, our appendix). - Vestigial genes. We have around 2,000 that no longer work because evolution rendered them unnecessary. An example is our gene for the final step in the biosynthesis of vitamin C which became non-functional after we started to consume this essential substance in our diet.- Atavisms (eg, our coccyx). - Embryonic development, where the early embryos of most vertebrates bear a striking resemblance to one another. The human embryo, for example, starts looking like that of a jawless fish, before becoming reptilian, and then mammalian. - Bad design, such as the asymmetric structure of flat, side-swimming fish, such as Dover sole, or the convoluted route taken in mammals by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which covers about 15 feet in the giraffe, to join two points just one foot apart).As Coyne points out, no supreme being would have created these oddities and imperfections unless it was that being’s intention to deceive us into believing they were the outcome of evolution, which seems extremely implausible. This is not a textbook on evolution, so its purpose is not to teach the underlying principles. The reader needs to look elsewhere for detailed explanations of genetics, genomes, DNA, inheritance, population growth, genetic drift, etc, but this is the ideal book for anyone who is open-mindedly sitting on the fence, unsure as to whether or not life arose through evolution, creation or intelligent design. Coyne’s arguments are very compelling although, as he admits, “evolution raises such profound questions of purpose, morality, and meaning that [some people] just can’t accept it no matter how much evidence they see”. He illustrates this point by referring to a talk on evolution he gave in Chicago to a group of businessmen. Afterwards, he was approached by one of the delegates who said, “I found your evidence for evolution very convincing—but I still don’t believe it”."
60,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"I hesitated before buying this book because I was a little put off by the title. I already assumed evolution was ""true"" (as much as any scientific knowledge can be considered ""the truth""), and I was more interested in knowing how it works, and the history of it all, from the first micro-organisms to now. The ""how"" part is covered pretty well, and by covering the ""how"" the author addresses creationist or ""intelligent design"" arguments and provides a clear, rational, and most importantly scientific answer. To be fair, the idea of natural selection and evolution seems simple enough, but how it leads to complex devices like an eyeball seems inexplicable... until it is explained. The creationist arguments are all fair, in the sense that they are perfectly valid questions to ask- until they are answered. But a perfectly valid question isn't the same as a valid objection. The book does a very good job at answering questions and debunking creationist objections in the process of explaining how evolution works, although this isn't the main focus of the book. At points along the way the author pauses to address a creationist objection- debunks it- and moves right along. And its done with such convincing ease that by the end the question is not ""How could evolution be true?"" but ""How could it be otherwise?""I don't think this book will change a creationist's mind, because if mere logical, rational, scientific explanations were all it took, creationism (an appeal to the supernatural rather than the natural) wouldn't exist in the first place. But I don't think that was the intent with this book. The book's title isn't ""Why creationism is wrong."" There is no point in arguing with a creationist whose faith feels threatened by science. If somebody isn't threatened by science then ""more science"" isn't going to change anything. But for the rest of us, laypeople who occasionally hear a creationist argument and think ""Oh, well that seems like a good point, I wonder how Darwanism answers that?"" the answers are here. And eventually, by the end of the book, with a good understanding of how darwanism works, any creationist question no longer seems like a good question- but more of an admission of ""I don't understand how this works.""There is nothing wrong with the statement ""I don't understand how this works"" as long as it is not followed with ""Therefore it can not be true."" Is it any better than saying ""I don't understand how this works, but I'll assume it's true""? No- unless that statement is followed by ""Because I understand the method by which this conclusion was reached."" If you understand the scientific method and think that observation, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, and comparison are really good ways to arrive at a conclusion about something then you will readily accept conclusions reached by those methods without knowing the details. So by understanding and accepting this method as a valid way to understand the world, it is perfectly reasonable to accept knowledge as being ""true"" that was achieved using these methods.You can't, however, argue one way or the other for something without knowing anything about it. I believed evolution to be true because I trusted the method by which the theory was developed, but I wanted to be able to understand the theory itself, and this book did a great job of it.One final note. The author did a great job at addressing the ""Just a theory"" argument. It isn't ""just a theory"", but a ""scientific theory"" which is completely different than ""a random guess with no way of testing it"". There is no point arguing it in a book review. Suffice to say the book spells it out and does a great job. Enough so that I underlined the entire thing.If you want to understand Darwinism, don't be put off by the title. By the end of the book you will understand how it works. The books isn't a defense of the theory but an explanation that is so thorough that it defends itself.I subtracted one star because I wish there was a little more about the timeline of evolution and the different eras of the earth's history. Another chapter would have been nice. "
61,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1643812-andrew,2,"Once again a great scientific mind has stooped to the lowest common denominator; mindlessly bickering with the creationist argument. I was expecting evolution/creationist argument in the preface, maybe even in the first chapter. Unfortunately, It's littered throughout the book. I understand that some readers actually enjoy this mindless drubbing, if so, this book is for you. What I was hoping for was a deeper biological understanding of speciation and specialization, and to Coyne's credit there are anecdotes littered throughout. Sadly, Those anecdotes are merely a way for Coyne to stick out his tongue and say ""I told you so, dummy"", they offer little new insights to those with a baseline understanding of biology. If you like Dawkins,you'll like Coyne, and If you like both I offer some simple advice. Grow up, and read a book with some scientific teeth. I recommend Stephen Jay Gould. If you are like me and are interested in speciation and specialization, I recommend skipping this book, and watching Coyne's lecture. It's a condensed version of the book, that skips all the bickering, and gets right down to the good stuff: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1m4mA... "

I can't imagine how hard it is to summarize a topic as voluminous as evolution into 230 pages.Without a doubt, evolution is complicated. It is one of the most misunderstood facts, and definitely the most viciously attacked. Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of explaining some of the basic tenets of evolution to the reader in a very succinct way. It is a breath taking read; this book needs to be read more than once. If only those who are so adamant about ID would crack open this book! Evolution is a beautiful mess. But, the fact that of all the species and of all mutations over billions of years, we are the only ones who have been awarded reason and a complex brain- that, to me, is far more meaningful and beautiful than to think someone created us and ""blessed us"" with it. We managed to become who we are, through billions of years of genetic fight. We are special, and we are here. Wow. Do we really need to believe in miracles when science gives us something this mind blowing?!"

So that was a good news at the time.I remember at my very first year as a med student, my anatomy professor explaining to us the action of a muscle that was useless unless we think of its potential action for a creature who walks on four limbs, "" i am just telling u this to memorize the muscle but this is a western explanation and it's not my intention to promote it"" said my professor.I remember so many times in my education process in which i was denied a chance to learn about evolution or to be given a fair criticism of Darwinian evolution, everything i was told about evolution turned out to be false.They told me ""evolution is completely random"" ""Darwin said that man came from monkeys"" and of course the most irritating ignorant phrase ""it's just a theory""I highly recommend this book for people like me, who missed a proper teacher to tell them about one of the most important ideas that ever crossed the minds of humankind.

64,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3547378-benjamin,5,"This book is a well-structured argument that the process of evolution has occurred and does occur. The author has a remarkably humble tone as he describes both the assertive truth of evolution as well as the ongoing process of unfinished learning of science (e.g., the study of biogenesis, the beginning of the universe, evolutionary psychology, evolution's inability to stand alone as an ethical/moral system, etc.). I believe that this book was well worth the time to read.Evolution can by no means explain everything about the world around us, but contrary to the opinions of many creationists/ID advocates, it does not presume to. This is the essence of science: the search for knowledge rather than the presumption of it.Why Evolution is True is an excellent popular treatise of evolution because it makes clear these points, and is honest about the shortcomings (both real and imagined) of modern evolutionary theory. Do yourself a service and read it!"

66,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3268791-tim,1,A real scientist would never say evolution is a fact. Have they changed a fly into a dog yet? Dan Shectman won the noble prize for chemistry. He battled against established science for years. Lost jobs and told he was stupid. He forced scientists to reconsider their conception of the very nature of matter. To call evolution a fact is to place your mind in a box. You will never find truth that way.

69,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,4,"Let me tell you a little story.In high school, I was taught science from a ""Creationist"" perspective. I did who-knows-how-many research projects and papers on ""Creation versus Evolution"". I became pretty knowledgeable about the subject (or so I thought). I owned a tome titled ""Science vs Evolution"", a graduation present from my biology teacher, and could give all the talking points on why Darwinism was false.Fast forward a number of years. I can't pinpoint the moment when my perspective changed. I think it started with a nagging suspicion that, despite all the Creationist videos I had watched and the articles I had read, I had never truly, actually heard the argument for evolution from evolutionary scientists themselves, and only knew the distorted interpretations of their arguments from their ""critics"".I changed my mind, ultimately, not because of a wealth of scientific rebuttals to combat every objection of Intelligent Design advocates. It came down to a simple matter of logic.That logic is this: The theory of evolution came about from the scientific process. Predictions are made, evidence is gathered, and conclusions are drawn. At every turn, for more than a century, the assumptions about evolution have been rigorously questioned, challenged, and tested under scientific scrutiny.And throughout this process, the theory of evolution has not only survived, but become stronger and more deeply understood. And it is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists.Contrast this with the idea of Intelligent Design, or Creationism. This concept does not start with predictions that can be completely questioned or re-thought at any moment; it cannot flexibly follow the evidence, wherever it leads.Creationism begins with a conclusion, and seeks evidence to support that conclusion.In other words, the theory of evolution is scientific. Creationism is not.I had become convinced of evolution from a logical perspective, but I still did not understand it. I did not have the high school education most people get on the subject. I still had all those talking points from Answers in Genesis that I knew were false, but didn't have responses for.This book, Why Evolution is True, became the perfect answer to my needs. Coyne lays out the mechanisms of and evidence for evolution in very easy-to-understand, eye-opening terms that the average, non-scientific reader can absorb and enjoy.It's also relatively short (not a difficult read), while still astonishingly robust in the power of its evidence and strength of its arguments.I came to this book already convinced of evolution; I came way fully understanding it (for the first time), and EXCITED about its awesomeness. Seriously, evolution is... REALLY COOL???I'm greatly appreciative of the author for writing this, and helping me to fill a gap in my knowledge... while also helping me discovery the pure joy and wonder that comes with knowing our origins.Buuuuuuut... he does get one tiny star bumped off, and this is for purely opinionated reasons, but in his discussions of gender he sometimes lapsed into what I can only call ""male arrogance"". The way he talked about men and women just grated on my nerves. Not what he said was untrue or anything, just written in an annoying way that felt way too comfortable with male superiority. My objection is completely non-intellectual and subjective, but hey! This is my review! I can give whatever stars I wanted!In all seriousness, this book is amazing. It will doubtlessly be my default recommendation for fence-sitters, skeptics, and other people who lacked an honest education in the fact of evolution like I did."
70,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81496242-sakshi-sinha,5,"This book is a compelling read. Learning about evolution, the process and time that goes into this makes you just respect and admire our environment and animals even more. -Firstly, Coyne discusses about creationism and evolution. He often includes antidotes throughout the book. Its so unbelievable that there are people out there who don’t believe in evolution!!There are references from Darwin’s book “The Origin”, other authors and scientists who have worked in this field. Introducing different viewpoints to us. -Then it continues with Coyne explaining different theories and concepts of evolution. This isn’t much of a rocket science. It just requires basic comprehension of species and biology and I think it’s pretty easy to grip on. -Along with facts and views, Coyne mentions alot of studies conducted on fossils and how they helped in grouping and combining the story of evolution. It’s really an engaging study and this has actually amplified my interest in fossils.-In addition to this the author addresses evolution in different aspects of wildlife such as in aquatic animals, birds, mammals etc. Coyne also describes at length natural selection , vestigial organs, genetics etc.-Altogether the book is filled with engrossing examples and it’s so amusing. There are images for references which make it easier to interpret description the author provides. -lastly, I do have a suggestion, Coyne mentions various kinds of animals, insects, birds, and not all of them have a visual representation in the book. I suggest you use google to understand their anatomy and explore various journals or articles. It might take extra time but I think this just adds another layer of knowledge to the read. This book really is an eye opener. Overall brilliant book! I would recommend it:) "
71,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25797445-eugene,5,"Why Evolution is True is a very interesting and thought provoking read. Detailed yet written for the lay person, Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of clearly laying out the evidence for Darwinian evolution from a common ancestor and why it is unanimously accepted by all scientists not already predisposed to creationism. From the fossil record and DNA sequencing to continental drift and speciation, he not only lays out the multiple lines of evidence but also shows the countless predictions that have been made using the evolutionary model, and counters each example by explaining how creationism fails these predictions and doesn't yield what we would expect to find were it the case. I have a very limited scientific background, but had no trouble understanding most of the book. On top of arguing the scientific evidence, he also does well at addressing common social and moral objections to evolution. The last chapter describes how contrary to popular (usually creationist) belief, evolution properly understood does not lend itself to racism. Races evolved to adapt better to various environments as branches spreading out on the evolutionary tree, and there is nothing to suggest any sort of racial superiority. Likewise Coyne debunks the popular but misguided argument that believing evolution will make people lose all sense of morality. Quite contrary, the more we learn about how our social behaviours evolved and how our brains developed to comprehend all these questions, the more we can appreciate the value of our lives. My only contention is how he subtly seems to slip in his anti-theist presupposition toward the end by saying appeal to the supernatural is not necessary when discussing origins. It may not be necessary, but it would be more accurate to say science and the God debate fall under seperate, non overlapping categories as one deals purely in falsifiable claims while the other does not. That being said, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious to learn more about evolution and its implications written in a very matter of fact, unbiased way."

He started with what a scientific theory means and then he goes on to explain the endless evidence of evolution and connecting it with everything around us, ""Some claim that evolution is just a theory, as if it were merely an opinion. But evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact. Evolution really happened. Accepting our kinship with all life on Earth is not only solid science ... in my view it's also a soaring spiritual experience."" –Neil deGrasse TysonYour body is a proof of multiple enhancing processes that have been done over millions of years starting from your individual cells to genes to last nerve in your Brain, for example the way human born is one of the best examples that we are descending from birds, by time the human evolved the way of giving birth doesn't change, the body of the baby turned upside down and the head of the baby (which becomes significantly bigger than that of our ancestors) faced the entrance of the womb, here we have to say isn't it ridiculous for God to do something like that, I mean why would He even blueprint-ed (or design) us with something very painful and can threatened the life of the mother just to prove something nothing than His sadistic nature of enjoying the screams of the mothers. Then he talked about Mutation and how it was at first the stick that Creationists wave on the face of Evolutionists every time they started a debate, he also mentioned and shed some lights on Linski's magnificent experiment on E-coli Bacteria which took 20 years and opened the gate in front of us to witness that ""Natural Selection + Mutations + Time = Darwin was Right""After that he talked about neuroscience and that evolution also has the ability to describe Morals and that Morals are not something comes up with Religion, it's something far more than that, it's something we might inherited it but mostly we gain it by practicing (eg: The Chimpanzees experiment). Jerry also explained that evolution doesn't necessarily mean to evolve into something more sophisticated, there's also a ""Redox Evolution"" which for example the evolution of Whales from Reptiles. I know I haven't wrote much and I won't, coz if you want to know something you have to dig for it, but what I'm totally convinced about is that the evidence evolution provides are stronger, reliable and more scientific than the Ideal Design provides, and that the idea of us coming from Adam and Eve is nothing but a Myth. It's not my words it's what science told us with EVIDENCE. It's as Carl Sagan said: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” – Cosmos."

But I can at least try to dispel the misconceptions that frighten people away from evolution and from the amazing derivation of life’s staggering diversity from a single naked replicating molecule.""Such is the writing style of Jerry Coyne, an accessible and well-versed author and research professor of evolutionary biology. This landmark work should have staying power in the annals of popular science, though it is lacking in philosophical nuance and subtlety. It is not intended to be a textbook for academics but rather a treatise to persuade anyone without a background in the subject. He is strong in his convictions and forceful in his rhetoric; a blog of the same name may be consulted for further reading and development of his thinking in this area.Why Evolution Is True is a serious page-turner. Coyne has a gift for conveying complex ideas and anyone of high-school education should not have trouble following his arguments.Far easier to understand than other overviews like Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, the primary focus is the direct evidence and ever-mounting proof which we have amassed since Darwin's formulation of the theory nearly two centuries ago. If one went into this topic without any knowledge the book would serve as a comprehensive introduction to the topic and its fundamental concepts, though they will miss out on discussion of related issues, e.g. memes and extended phenotype.Coyne makes the commendable decision to anticipate objections to each of his chapters, much like Darwin did in later editions of On the Origin of Species; he knows that evolution is a contested and widely-misunderstood field and that minds tend to be closed to its authenticity. There are some questions that are oft-raised without sufficient answer in the public square: how did the eye form if not by a miracle? Of what use is half a wing to an evolving bird, and how could that possibly be selected for? He tackles these deftly and head-on, giving answers and insight that reflect his depth of knowledge.Near the end of chapter 9 we are given this summary:""Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life’s diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life... Most of us do need meaning, purpose, and moral guidance in our lives. How do we find them if we accept that evolution is the real story of our origin? That question is outside the domain of science.""He then proceeds to dismiss all answers outside of naturalism and materialism outright, which shows the limitations of his view in dialogue with contrasting opinions. Coyne does not attempt to appear as an unbiased explicator of evolutionary theory. This is a minor problem in the scope of the work, and perhaps a deserved one; he could hardly be more vindicated due to the sheer force of evidence for macroevolution. It makes me wonder if a more dispassionate approach could have been helpful. There are, despite his bewilderment, religious people who believe in evolution.He leaves us with a pithy and hopeful quote:""Evolution tells us where we came from, not where we can go.""I would definitely recommend this work to anyone who is curious about the developments in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural and sexual selection. As long as they are open to the evidence and don't mind the occasional sneer from the author, by the end there should be little doubt that evolution is, in fact, true."

Each strand of knowledge which contributes to our understanding is laid out clearly, starting in many cases with what Darwin knew or intuited when writing On The Origin Of Species. Coyne deftly takes us through the developments in areas such as the fossil record, embryology, vestigial organs, biogeography and genetics; showing how predictions can be made and how discoveries since Darwin's time have confirmed the process of evolution over and over again. Many eye-catching examples are used to demonstrate where we can expect to find fossils in geological layers; how the bodily organisation of modern creatures follows patterns laid down in ancestral forms; and how environmental pressures lead to adaptation. The example of the modern mammalian laryngeal nerve as poor design derived from ancient forms is particularly striking. The nerve is involved in speech and swallowing and connects the brain to the larynx. It wraps around the aorta (a large vessel in the heart) rather than taking a direct route. This is not an issue for an ancient fishlike creature – but in a human the nerve has to be about a foot in length to follow the same route. In a giraffe, which has the same basic body plan, the nerve is three feet long! This is obviously inefficient and may even be more prone to injury, but clearly shows the laryngeal nerve adapting to follow the evolutionary changes in the body pattern.Coyne also shows how these additions to our knowledge efficiently take down the creationist or “intelligent design” arguments. Whilst he concedes that those arguing from faith will probably not change their minds, the book is very much aimed at people who are uncertain about the science. For European readers, this frequent referencing of creationism is a little grating since it is not such a large issue in this part of the world, but it is understandable when the American audience has a much greater background of “disbelief” in evolution [1].The final chapters are devoted to recent human evolution (from the period following divergence from chimps) and an overview of some of the difficulties people have with the possible implications of evolution for human behaviour. Overall, this is an excellent text for anyone who would like to understand the principles of evolution or update their knowledge, written in an entertaining and engaging style.[1] http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313... – unfortunately this, the original article in Science, is paywalled, but you can see a mirror at http://old.richarddawkins.net/article..., including the table comparing “belief” vs “disbelief” in evolution from 34 countries in 2005.

75,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"I read this book a while back and really enjoyed it. Note: If you are a creationist, you will doubtless NOT enjoy this. If you are an evolutionist, you'll probably be quite pleased with the book. And there's pity. For many, the book won't be read on its merits but for whether it supports or challenges one's views on the issue of Darwinian evolutionary theory.In terms of the book itself. . . . The purpose is specified by Jerry Coyne, the author, on page xiv: ""This book lays out the main lines of evidence for evolution. For those who oppose Darwinism purely as a matter of faith, no amount of evidence will do--theirs is a belief not based on reason. But for the many who find themselves uncertain, or who accept evolution but are not sure how to argue the case, this volume gives a succinct summary of why modern science recognizes evolution as true.""The book unfolds in a straightforward fashion. Chapter 1 summarizes the nature of evolution. He discusses the essence of the concept of evolution--""a species undergoing genetic change over time"" (page 3). Also discussed is ""natural selection,"" the process by which the more ""fit"" individuals tend to be more successful in reproductive terms That is, they leave more offspring than their less fit peers).Subsequent chapters outline the evidence for evolution, including often jury-rigged adaptations (evolution makes do with the organism/species as it exists and often leaves organisms that are poorly designed--but still capable of successful reproduction: think the lower back of humans!), the fossil record, a more detailed discussion of the process of natural selection, the relationship between sex and evolution, how species arise and develop, and--always an issue that excites passion--the relevance of evolution for humankind.The book itself does well what it sets out to do. There are things that bother me. As with many, the author claims that evolution is a ""fact."" I have never understood this allegation. Neo-Darwinian theory is a THEORY--not a fact. Lots of facts support the theory. By itself, though, it is NOT a fact. I think advocates of evolution shoot themselves in the foot with such an argument. Many, of course, would rejoin, ""It's ONLY a theory."" Such folks also don't know what they're talking about. A good theory is a great thing! Not ""just."" Quantum theory is terrific; Einstein's relativity is a fine theory. And so on.All in all, if the reader wants an accessible advocacy of evolutionary theory, this book does the job nicely. If the reader does not accept it, the book, of course, will not be very compelling."
76,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36384001-yousuf,2,"Good Overview, But Contains Straw MenThis is a good summary for the pro-Evolution side if anyone is researching the evolution-creation controversy. It goes through the fossil evidence, genetic evidence, geological evidence, and more for Evolution via natural selection (and other naturalistic processes). The author writes in a clear and logical manner, and generally avoids the confrontational polemics that other writers such as Richard Dawkins are prone to.My main objection is that Coyne uses misrepresentations to attack Intelligent Design (ID). He tries to associate ID with Young Earth Creationism many times, arguing that the two are similar or have similar methods. Nothing could be further from the truth. Pro-ID people are NOT making a deduction from religious scriptures; rather they are analyzing the structure of the cell (such as the information encoded in DNA) and making inferences based on that. You might not agree with their conclusions, but you should not try to smear them in a dishonest way.Another issue that I had was that most of Coyne's objections to ID are ""theological"" in nature. What I mean is that he points to ""flaws"" in organisms and basically states: ""An intelligent designer would have done a better job of this.""But these are theological, not scientific, objections; and they have theological, not scientific, answers. Probably because the Designer made the designs bad on purpose - I dunno, perhaps this world wasn't supposed to be perfect in the first place?He admits that materialist scientists do not have an explanation for the origin of life (OOL) as well as the Cambrian Explosion. But then he brings out the stereotypical ""God-of-the-gaps! God-of-the-gaps!"" argument to rebut ID here... I was literally shaking my head out of disappointment (though I wasn't at all surprised). Also, the response to integrated complexity was vague and didn't make much sense to me.I'm currently reading Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design, which is a pro-ID account of OOL. And I can tell you, it is anything but God-of-the-gaps. The entire argument is based on what we do know in biology, not a gap of any kind.I know the above review sounds harsh, but I actually enjoyed reading this book and I do recommend it to anyone who's interested in evolution or the evolution-creation controversy."

However, if you are undecided and truly interested in learning about the wealth of evidence that supports evolution as, indeed, the way (along with sea cucumbers, lichen, platypuses and blue whales) came to be, this is a wonderful book. Even if you already have a fair working knowledge of the theory (and that's theory in the scientific sense, not in the casual ""it's only a theory"" sense), you'll likely find a lot of new and fascinating details herein.All the classic evidence that you learned in school (if you're my age) is here, along with scads of new evidence in fields like microbiology, geology, paleobotany, and many others. The book avoids jargon except when it's needed in order to be specific, defines unfamiliar terms as it goes, explains how the facts in highly diverse areas support one another, points out the numerous areas where evolution would predict X and in fact science finds X, and generally lays out its case in a comprehensive and coherent manner. Happily, it also does so without either proselytizing or haranguing, leaving the reader to make his or her own decision in evaluating the range of interlocking facts presented. The last chapter discusses why certain religious sects have such difficulty accepting evolution, which was also enlightening and interesting.Highly recommended for the lay reader interested in acquiring a solid overview of the scientific evidence for evolution."

Coyne's Why Evolution Is True is a fine place to start. As his unsubtle title suggests, Coyne's purpose is to banish the arguments of creationists and their intelligent design fellow travelers. Much as Darwin did, he draws upon geology and the fossil record; biogeography, or the distribution of plants and animals; and the similarities and differences among living species. But gaps that once frustrated Darwin, such as so-called ""missing links"" in the fossil record, can now be filled. ... ... he builds a strong case for the fact of evolution, and for Darwin's theory of how it works. (That species change over time isn't theoretical; how and why the changes occur is the subject of ""evolutionary theory."") Coyne addresses many of the common creationist arguments head-on, outlining how complex systems such as eyes and biochemical pathways can evolve by natural selection. To his credit, however, the author acknowledges his strategy's fatal flaw: The refusal to accept evolution has precious little to do with reason, logic or evidence. Like the introductory college courses it too-closely resembles, Why Evolution Is True is packed with facts and clear explanations but is unlikely to change many minds."""

It's sad to think that even on this modern day, we still need books to show what is just actually is. It's always my dream to become an evolutionary anthropologist and by reading this book only ignites that passion more! This is a great book on evolution though some might find it to be dry. But the author has thoroughly described how evolution works and presented - as is the case in scientific literatures - a lot of convincing and irrefutable evidence. One thing I liked is the organization of the chapters where Coyne subtly explained the concepts and applied them first on evolution of ""lesser"" organisms, then on to human evolution. For readers who are honest-seekers, do not discount evolution until you have read this book. And for those who are already convinced, this could be a good weapon against Creationists (Intelligent Design proponents)."

The Blind Watchmaker and The Ancestor's Tale are the best books of this genre I have ever read. He is a bit more detailed than Coyne, a bit more lucid, and if I may say so, a bit more exciting, even a bit more poetic.Nevertheless, at under 300 pages, Why Evolution Is True is the best short book I've ever read on the subject. The last chapter, about the implications (and lack of implications) of the theory of evolution for our own species, is very good. And Dawkins himself gives the book high praise.Well worth reading."

86,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42147710-michael-shore,5,Coyne nailed it. A fantastic summary of the basic concepts and evidence for evolution.
87,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"To be more precise and clear, the title of the book should be ""why the modern theory of evolution is true."" Changing the title doesn't make a difference to us the believers of the theory (I'll call the theory Darwinism for short), because we usually accept it as a bundle package. But after reading the book, I realize the theory makes multi-level propositions. ""Evolution happened"" is only one of them. Coyne mentions this structure of Darwinism repeatedly, but I think he could make the book stronger by laying it out at the very beginning. In my own words, the theory of evolution proposes the following hierarchy of propositions:1. Evolutionary change (change in inheritable traits of a population through generations) happened. Not only on the micro level (change of traits within a species) but also the macro level (the transformation of one species into another)2. Natural selection explains most of the microevolutionary change, e.g., the change in beak size of birds.3. Natural selection explains most of the macroevolutionary change, e.g., the origin of birds.4. Natural selection builds complex features in nonhuman species, such as the eyes and the brain.5. Natural selection builds complex features of humans, such as language and consciousness.  Some creationists refuse all propositions above. Some admit (1) but refuse to explain it by natural selection. Others accept natural selection only to a certain level. All of them share one common belief: natural selection cannot make us human to be what we are. As a response, Coyne provides ample evidence to support Darwinism. The evidence includes the following: • Species can be classified and grouped in a tree-like way• Discovery of transitional fossils at predicted locations with the expected age.• Features that only make sense by natural selection: vestiges / atavism / dead DNA / Embryo palimpsest / bad design• Distributions of species across the globe, such as how different species fill similar roles in different areas, how certain species lack on volcanic islands but not on continental islands, and the radiations of endemic species on volcanic islands.• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by artificial selection• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by natural selection in labs and fields• Math simulations that exhibit evolutionary paths to complex features under natural selection. An important lesson I learned from Coyne's enumeration of the evidence above, is to treat the following two things differently: 1) the general evolutionary theory, and 2) individual evolutionary explanations of traits and behaviors. Darwin provides us a beautiful theory. It is so simple, yet so powerful. But beauty does not equal truth. Darwinism is generally correct because scientists have accumulated a huge amount of supporting evidence. An individual evolutionary explanation, however, must bear its own burden of proof. We should not blindly believe in a single evolutionary explanation because there are often multiple competing evolutionary explanations of a trait or behavior. Many of them are inevitable ""just-so stories."" Moreover, natural selection is not the only chisel used by nature the sculptor. Features can be generated by other mechanisms, such as genetic drift and sexual selection. I found the hypothesis explaining the existence of human appendix especially interesting: it is possible that natural selection simply can't shrink the appendix anymore, because before it disappears from shrinking, a smaller appendix gives rise to a higher risk of being blocked.  This lesson also applies to economics, another discipline that is guided by a core theory — the rational choice theory. Again, the core theory might be generally correct, but this does not mean it is correct in every context, far from it.  Coyne also reminds me that most evolutionary explanations of complex human features, no matter how elaborate, are untested and probably untestable. This is unfortunate, because the evolution of such features, especially the evolution of consciousness, seems to be the most intriguing question of all. But to quote Darwin, we should not ""positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."" Instead, we should keep searching for testable theories in the future.  Stray observation:- The book solved a big puzzle I had in high school biology class: why human embryos look so weird and go through phases of development that make no sense.- Darwin did not explain the origin of species in his same-titled book (he would explain it in later books and papers). A better title for The Origin of Species, would have been The Origin of Adaptations."
88,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23258105-dileep-n,5,"tl;dr Evolution is true. The big picture is indisputably clear. What remains is to probe the finer details of the mechanics and processes underlying it. If Coyne's primary goal in writing this book was to convince Creationists that evolution is true, it remains unfulfilled. The people he's trying to convince are precisely the kind whom no amount of evidence supporting evolution can convince. This book lacks the only thing that can convince Creationists and proponents of Intelligent Design - passages from their holy book of choice, or even better, a direct quote from their god of choice, stating evolution is true. Kidding aside, the sad truth is that it is nigh impossible to fight dogma and deeply entrenched beliefs with logic and evidence. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. This book is the result of one such attempt and it is a brilliant one at that. Kudos to Coyne for fighting the good fight. Unless you're the kind of person who relies exclusively on made-up stories from stale, antiquated texts for moral guidance and laws of the natural world, you probably already know evolution is true, or rather, that it is the best explanation we have so far for the origin of life on this planet; and I'm fairly sure you will find this book insightful and enjoyable. The book is full of interesting facts and observations that unequivocally prove that evolution is a scientific fact. Topics that are covered include discovery of fossils, particularly of intermediates; speciation and biogeography; vestigial traits and organs that along with emryology provide a window into the past; genetic drift as an alternative (although minor) engine of evolution besides Darwinian natural selection; the powers of sexual selection; and lastly, the origin of of our own species along with a brief but useful discussion on the dicey issue of race. Along with a historical overview, Coyne also details recent evidence (last three decades) supporting evolution and advances made in paleontology, molecular and evolutionary biology, and a few other fields, which I found very helpful. At one time or another, I'm sure most of us have wondered, ""Now that the pressures of natural selection are largely absent in most human societies, are we still evolving? If so, in what ways?"" I found the beginnings of an answer to this in the penultimate chapter.The crisp, clear, and no-nonsense writing style makes digesting this information-rich book painless. Coyne has also provided handy notes clarifying certain ideas, pointing out opposing viewpoints, and lisiting resources for those interested in exploring a topic further. Several of the books he has mentioned have found their way into my to to-read list.This is a cogent synthesis of facts about evolution and of coherent arguments in its favor. Not only does it satiate your curiosity and expand your mind but it also arms you with knowledge for those uncomfortable engagements with staunch Creationsists. Highly recommended!"
89,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"The title of this book bluntly states its purpose, which is to refute, head on, the claims advanced by creationists and supporters of intelligent design that evolution by natural selection cannot possibly explain how life takes the many forms that it does. Biologist Jerry Coyne convincingly addresses every conceivable argument that could be made against evolution, using numerous examples to explain how life as it exists today must have arisen through evolution. To this end, he covers evidence from:- Fossils and biogeography.- Vestigial organs (eg, our appendix). - Vestigial genes. We have around 2,000 that no longer work because evolution rendered them unnecessary. An example is our gene for the final step in the biosynthesis of vitamin C which became non-functional after we started to consume this essential substance in our diet.- Atavisms (eg, our coccyx). - Embryonic development, where the early embryos of most vertebrates bear a striking resemblance to one another. The human embryo, for example, starts looking like that of a jawless fish, before becoming reptilian, and then mammalian. - Bad design, such as the asymmetric structure of flat, side-swimming fish, such as Dover sole, or the convoluted route taken in mammals by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which covers about 15 feet in the giraffe, to join two points just one foot apart).As Coyne points out, no supreme being would have created these oddities and imperfections unless it was that being’s intention to deceive us into believing they were the outcome of evolution, which seems extremely implausible. This is not a textbook on evolution, so its purpose is not to teach the underlying principles. The reader needs to look elsewhere for detailed explanations of genetics, genomes, DNA, inheritance, population growth, genetic drift, etc, but this is the ideal book for anyone who is open-mindedly sitting on the fence, unsure as to whether or not life arose through evolution, creation or intelligent design. Coyne’s arguments are very compelling although, as he admits, “evolution raises such profound questions of purpose, morality, and meaning that [some people] just can’t accept it no matter how much evidence they see”. He illustrates this point by referring to a talk on evolution he gave in Chicago to a group of businessmen. Afterwards, he was approached by one of the delegates who said, “I found your evidence for evolution very convincing—but I still don’t believe it”."
90,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"I hesitated before buying this book because I was a little put off by the title. I already assumed evolution was ""true"" (as much as any scientific knowledge can be considered ""the truth""), and I was more interested in knowing how it works, and the history of it all, from the first micro-organisms to now. The ""how"" part is covered pretty well, and by covering the ""how"" the author addresses creationist or ""intelligent design"" arguments and provides a clear, rational, and most importantly scientific answer. To be fair, the idea of natural selection and evolution seems simple enough, but how it leads to complex devices like an eyeball seems inexplicable... until it is explained. The creationist arguments are all fair, in the sense that they are perfectly valid questions to ask- until they are answered. But a perfectly valid question isn't the same as a valid objection. The book does a very good job at answering questions and debunking creationist objections in the process of explaining how evolution works, although this isn't the main focus of the book. At points along the way the author pauses to address a creationist objection- debunks it- and moves right along. And its done with such convincing ease that by the end the question is not ""How could evolution be true?"" but ""How could it be otherwise?""I don't think this book will change a creationist's mind, because if mere logical, rational, scientific explanations were all it took, creationism (an appeal to the supernatural rather than the natural) wouldn't exist in the first place. But I don't think that was the intent with this book. The book's title isn't ""Why creationism is wrong."" There is no point in arguing with a creationist whose faith feels threatened by science. If somebody isn't threatened by science then ""more science"" isn't going to change anything. But for the rest of us, laypeople who occasionally hear a creationist argument and think ""Oh, well that seems like a good point, I wonder how Darwanism answers that?"" the answers are here. And eventually, by the end of the book, with a good understanding of how darwanism works, any creationist question no longer seems like a good question- but more of an admission of ""I don't understand how this works.""There is nothing wrong with the statement ""I don't understand how this works"" as long as it is not followed with ""Therefore it can not be true."" Is it any better than saying ""I don't understand how this works, but I'll assume it's true""? No- unless that statement is followed by ""Because I understand the method by which this conclusion was reached."" If you understand the scientific method and think that observation, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, and comparison are really good ways to arrive at a conclusion about something then you will readily accept conclusions reached by those methods without knowing the details. So by understanding and accepting this method as a valid way to understand the world, it is perfectly reasonable to accept knowledge as being ""true"" that was achieved using these methods.You can't, however, argue one way or the other for something without knowing anything about it. I believed evolution to be true because I trusted the method by which the theory was developed, but I wanted to be able to understand the theory itself, and this book did a great job of it.One final note. The author did a great job at addressing the ""Just a theory"" argument. It isn't ""just a theory"", but a ""scientific theory"" which is completely different than ""a random guess with no way of testing it"". There is no point arguing it in a book review. Suffice to say the book spells it out and does a great job. Enough so that I underlined the entire thing.If you want to understand Darwinism, don't be put off by the title. By the end of the book you will understand how it works. The books isn't a defense of the theory but an explanation that is so thorough that it defends itself.I subtracted one star because I wish there was a little more about the timeline of evolution and the different eras of the earth's history. Another chapter would have been nice. "

I was expecting evolution/creationist argument in the preface, maybe even in the first chapter. Unfortunately, It's littered throughout the book. I understand that some readers actually enjoy this mindless drubbing, if so, this book is for you. What I was hoping for was a deeper biological understanding of speciation and specialization, and to Coyne's credit there are anecdotes littered throughout. Sadly, Those anecdotes are merely a way for Coyne to stick out his tongue and say ""I told you so, dummy"", they offer little new insights to those with a baseline understanding of biology. If you like Dawkins,you'll like Coyne, and If you like both I offer some simple advice. Grow up, and read a book with some scientific teeth. I recommend Stephen Jay Gould. If you are like me and are interested in speciation and specialization, I recommend skipping this book, and watching Coyne's lecture. It's a condensed version of the book, that skips all the bickering, and gets right down to the good stuff: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1m4mA... "

I can't imagine how hard it is to summarize a topic as voluminous as evolution into 230 pages.Without a doubt, evolution is complicated. It is one of the most misunderstood facts, and definitely the most viciously attacked. Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of explaining some of the basic tenets of evolution to the reader in a very succinct way. It is a breath taking read; this book needs to be read more than once. If only those who are so adamant about ID would crack open this book! Evolution is a beautiful mess. But, the fact that of all the species and of all mutations over billions of years, we are the only ones who have been awarded reason and a complex brain- that, to me, is far more meaningful and beautiful than to think someone created us and ""blessed us"" with it. We managed to become who we are, through billions of years of genetic fight. We are special, and we are here. Wow. Do we really need to believe in miracles when science gives us something this mind blowing?!"

So that was a good news at the time.I remember at my very first year as a med student, my anatomy professor explaining to us the action of a muscle that was useless unless we think of its potential action for a creature who walks on four limbs, "" i am just telling u this to memorize the muscle but this is a western explanation and it's not my intention to promote it"" said my professor.I remember so many times in my education process in which i was denied a chance to learn about evolution or to be given a fair criticism of Darwinian evolution, everything i was told about evolution turned out to be false.They told me ""evolution is completely random"" ""Darwin said that man came from monkeys"" and of course the most irritating ignorant phrase ""it's just a theory""I highly recommend this book for people like me, who missed a proper teacher to tell them about one of the most important ideas that ever crossed the minds of humankind.

The author has a remarkably humble tone as he describes both the assertive truth of evolution as well as the ongoing process of unfinished learning of science (e.g., the study of biogenesis, the beginning of the universe, evolutionary psychology, evolution's inability to stand alone as an ethical/moral system, etc.). I believe that this book was well worth the time to read.Evolution can by no means explain everything about the world around us, but contrary to the opinions of many creationists/ID advocates, it does not presume to. This is the essence of science: the search for knowledge rather than the presumption of it.Why Evolution is True is an excellent popular treatise of evolution because it makes clear these points, and is honest about the shortcomings (both real and imagined) of modern evolutionary theory.

99,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,4,"Let me tell you a little story.In high school, I was taught science from a ""Creationist"" perspective. I did who-knows-how-many research projects and papers on ""Creation versus Evolution"". I became pretty knowledgeable about the subject (or so I thought). I owned a tome titled ""Science vs Evolution"", a graduation present from my biology teacher, and could give all the talking points on why Darwinism was false.Fast forward a number of years. I can't pinpoint the moment when my perspective changed. I think it started with a nagging suspicion that, despite all the Creationist videos I had watched and the articles I had read, I had never truly, actually heard the argument for evolution from evolutionary scientists themselves, and only knew the distorted interpretations of their arguments from their ""critics"".I changed my mind, ultimately, not because of a wealth of scientific rebuttals to combat every objection of Intelligent Design advocates. It came down to a simple matter of logic.That logic is this: The theory of evolution came about from the scientific process. Predictions are made, evidence is gathered, and conclusions are drawn. At every turn, for more than a century, the assumptions about evolution have been rigorously questioned, challenged, and tested under scientific scrutiny.And throughout this process, the theory of evolution has not only survived, but become stronger and more deeply understood. And it is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists.Contrast this with the idea of Intelligent Design, or Creationism. This concept does not start with predictions that can be completely questioned or re-thought at any moment; it cannot flexibly follow the evidence, wherever it leads.Creationism begins with a conclusion, and seeks evidence to support that conclusion.In other words, the theory of evolution is scientific. Creationism is not.I had become convinced of evolution from a logical perspective, but I still did not understand it. I did not have the high school education most people get on the subject. I still had all those talking points from Answers in Genesis that I knew were false, but didn't have responses for.This book, Why Evolution is True, became the perfect answer to my needs. Coyne lays out the mechanisms of and evidence for evolution in very easy-to-understand, eye-opening terms that the average, non-scientific reader can absorb and enjoy.It's also relatively short (not a difficult read), while still astonishingly robust in the power of its evidence and strength of its arguments.I came to this book already convinced of evolution; I came way fully understanding it (for the first time), and EXCITED about its awesomeness. Seriously, evolution is... REALLY COOL???I'm greatly appreciative of the author for writing this, and helping me to fill a gap in my knowledge... while also helping me discovery the pure joy and wonder that comes with knowing our origins.Buuuuuuut... he does get one tiny star bumped off, and this is for purely opinionated reasons, but in his discussions of gender he sometimes lapsed into what I can only call ""male arrogance"". The way he talked about men and women just grated on my nerves. Not what he said was untrue or anything, just written in an annoying way that felt way too comfortable with male superiority. My objection is completely non-intellectual and subjective, but hey! This is my review! I can give whatever stars I wanted!In all seriousness, this book is amazing. It will doubtlessly be my default recommendation for fence-sitters, skeptics, and other people who lacked an honest education in the fact of evolution like I did."
100,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81496242-sakshi-sinha,5,"This book is a compelling read. Learning about evolution, the process and time that goes into this makes you just respect and admire our environment and animals even more. -Firstly, Coyne discusses about creationism and evolution. He often includes antidotes throughout the book. Its so unbelievable that there are people out there who don’t believe in evolution!!There are references from Darwin’s book “The Origin”, other authors and scientists who have worked in this field. Introducing different viewpoints to us. -Then it continues with Coyne explaining different theories and concepts of evolution. This isn’t much of a rocket science. It just requires basic comprehension of species and biology and I think it’s pretty easy to grip on. -Along with facts and views, Coyne mentions alot of studies conducted on fossils and how they helped in grouping and combining the story of evolution. It’s really an engaging study and this has actually amplified my interest in fossils.-In addition to this the author addresses evolution in different aspects of wildlife such as in aquatic animals, birds, mammals etc. Coyne also describes at length natural selection , vestigial organs, genetics etc.-Altogether the book is filled with engrossing examples and it’s so amusing. There are images for references which make it easier to interpret description the author provides. -lastly, I do have a suggestion, Coyne mentions various kinds of animals, insects, birds, and not all of them have a visual representation in the book. I suggest you use google to understand their anatomy and explore various journals or articles. It might take extra time but I think this just adds another layer of knowledge to the read. This book really is an eye opener. Overall brilliant book! I would recommend it:) "
101,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25797445-eugene,5,"Why Evolution is True is a very interesting and thought provoking read. Detailed yet written for the lay person, Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of clearly laying out the evidence for Darwinian evolution from a common ancestor and why it is unanimously accepted by all scientists not already predisposed to creationism. From the fossil record and DNA sequencing to continental drift and speciation, he not only lays out the multiple lines of evidence but also shows the countless predictions that have been made using the evolutionary model, and counters each example by explaining how creationism fails these predictions and doesn't yield what we would expect to find were it the case. I have a very limited scientific background, but had no trouble understanding most of the book. On top of arguing the scientific evidence, he also does well at addressing common social and moral objections to evolution. The last chapter describes how contrary to popular (usually creationist) belief, evolution properly understood does not lend itself to racism. Races evolved to adapt better to various environments as branches spreading out on the evolutionary tree, and there is nothing to suggest any sort of racial superiority. Likewise Coyne debunks the popular but misguided argument that believing evolution will make people lose all sense of morality. Quite contrary, the more we learn about how our social behaviours evolved and how our brains developed to comprehend all these questions, the more we can appreciate the value of our lives. My only contention is how he subtly seems to slip in his anti-theist presupposition toward the end by saying appeal to the supernatural is not necessary when discussing origins. It may not be necessary, but it would be more accurate to say science and the God debate fall under seperate, non overlapping categories as one deals purely in falsifiable claims while the other does not. That being said, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious to learn more about evolution and its implications written in a very matter of fact, unbiased way."

So why, when evolution is being reconfirmed every day, and forms the backbone of modern biology, do we need a book entitled Why Evolution Is True?""It's just as the description above has said, the evidence that supporting Evolution is enormous, starting from the first life on Earth until the evolution of Homo-sapiens. Every single life is just as Darwin had predicted, you won't find a fossil that exists in the Cambrian Age in the Precambrian Age and vice versa. In fact Evolution declared a bet as the evolutionist Richard Dawkins said: ""To those who has doubts about Evolution to scratch hardly in the Rocks to find an unsuitable fossil, we challenge them to that, will they accept the bet?"" In ""Why Evolution Is True"", Jerry A Coyne takes us to a journey in the Wonders of Natural Selection. He started with what a scientific theory means and then he goes on to explain the endless evidence of evolution and connecting it with everything around us, ""Some claim that evolution is just a theory, as if it were merely an opinion. But evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact. Evolution really happened. Accepting our kinship with all life on Earth is not only solid science ... in my view it's also a soaring spiritual experience."" –Neil deGrasse TysonYour body is a proof of multiple enhancing processes that have been done over millions of years starting from your individual cells to genes to last nerve in your Brain, for example the way human born is one of the best examples that we are descending from birds, by time the human evolved the way of giving birth doesn't change, the body of the baby turned upside down and the head of the baby (which becomes significantly bigger than that of our ancestors) faced the entrance of the womb, here we have to say isn't it ridiculous for God to do something like that, I mean why would He even blueprint-ed (or design) us with something very painful and can threatened the life of the mother just to prove something nothing than His sadistic nature of enjoying the screams of the mothers. Then he talked about Mutation and how it was at first the stick that Creationists wave on the face of Evolutionists every time they started a debate, he also mentioned and shed some lights on Linski's magnificent experiment on E-coli Bacteria which took 20 years and opened the gate in front of us to witness that ""Natural Selection + Mutations + Time = Darwin was Right""After that he talked about neuroscience and that evolution also has the ability to describe Morals and that Morals are not something comes up with Religion, it's something far more than that, it's something we might inherited it but mostly we gain it by practicing (eg: The Chimpanzees experiment). Jerry also explained that evolution doesn't necessarily mean to evolve into something more sophisticated, there's also a ""Redox Evolution"" which for example the evolution of Whales from Reptiles. I know I haven't wrote much and I won't, coz if you want to know something you have to dig for it, but what I'm totally convinced about is that the evidence evolution provides are stronger, reliable and more scientific than the Ideal Design provides, and that the idea of us coming from Adam and Eve is nothing but a Myth. It's not my words it's what science told us with EVIDENCE. It's as Carl Sagan said: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” – Cosmos."

But I can at least try to dispel the misconceptions that frighten people away from evolution and from the amazing derivation of life’s staggering diversity from a single naked replicating molecule.""Such is the writing style of Jerry Coyne, an accessible and well-versed author and research professor of evolutionary biology. This landmark work should have staying power in the annals of popular science, though it is lacking in philosophical nuance and subtlety. It is not intended to be a textbook for academics but rather a treatise to persuade anyone without a background in the subject. He is strong in his convictions and forceful in his rhetoric; a blog of the same name may be consulted for further reading and development of his thinking in this area.Why Evolution Is True is a serious page-turner. Coyne has a gift for conveying complex ideas and anyone of high-school education should not have trouble following his arguments.Far easier to understand than other overviews like Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, the primary focus is the direct evidence and ever-mounting proof which we have amassed since Darwin's formulation of the theory nearly two centuries ago. If one went into this topic without any knowledge the book would serve as a comprehensive introduction to the topic and its fundamental concepts, though they will miss out on discussion of related issues, e.g. memes and extended phenotype.Coyne makes the commendable decision to anticipate objections to each of his chapters, much like Darwin did in later editions of On the Origin of Species; he knows that evolution is a contested and widely-misunderstood field and that minds tend to be closed to its authenticity. There are some questions that are oft-raised without sufficient answer in the public square: how did the eye form if not by a miracle? Of what use is half a wing to an evolving bird, and how could that possibly be selected for? He tackles these deftly and head-on, giving answers and insight that reflect his depth of knowledge.Near the end of chapter 9 we are given this summary:""Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life’s diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life... Most of us do need meaning, purpose, and moral guidance in our lives. How do we find them if we accept that evolution is the real story of our origin? That question is outside the domain of science.""He then proceeds to dismiss all answers outside of naturalism and materialism outright, which shows the limitations of his view in dialogue with contrasting opinions. Coyne does not attempt to appear as an unbiased explicator of evolutionary theory. This is a minor problem in the scope of the work, and perhaps a deserved one; he could hardly be more vindicated due to the sheer force of evidence for macroevolution. It makes me wonder if a more dispassionate approach could have been helpful. There are, despite his bewilderment, religious people who believe in evolution.He leaves us with a pithy and hopeful quote:""Evolution tells us where we came from, not where we can go.""I would definitely recommend this work to anyone who is curious about the developments in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural and sexual selection. As long as they are open to the evidence and don't mind the occasional sneer from the author, by the end there should be little doubt that evolution is, in fact, true."
104,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6350127-seawood,5,"Read for Coursera ""Writing in the Sciences"" and ""Genetics & Evolution"" courses.Why Evolution Is True is a love-letter to Charles Darwin; an accessible and detailed overview of the current state of evolution research. Each strand of knowledge which contributes to our understanding is laid out clearly, starting in many cases with what Darwin knew or intuited when writing On The Origin Of Species. Coyne deftly takes us through the developments in areas such as the fossil record, embryology, vestigial organs, biogeography and genetics; showing how predictions can be made and how discoveries since Darwin's time have confirmed the process of evolution over and over again. Many eye-catching examples are used to demonstrate where we can expect to find fossils in geological layers; how the bodily organisation of modern creatures follows patterns laid down in ancestral forms; and how environmental pressures lead to adaptation. The example of the modern mammalian laryngeal nerve as poor design derived from ancient forms is particularly striking. The nerve is involved in speech and swallowing and connects the brain to the larynx. It wraps around the aorta (a large vessel in the heart) rather than taking a direct route. This is not an issue for an ancient fishlike creature – but in a human the nerve has to be about a foot in length to follow the same route. In a giraffe, which has the same basic body plan, the nerve is three feet long! This is obviously inefficient and may even be more prone to injury, but clearly shows the laryngeal nerve adapting to follow the evolutionary changes in the body pattern.Coyne also shows how these additions to our knowledge efficiently take down the creationist or “intelligent design” arguments. Whilst he concedes that those arguing from faith will probably not change their minds, the book is very much aimed at people who are uncertain about the science. For European readers, this frequent referencing of creationism is a little grating since it is not such a large issue in this part of the world, but it is understandable when the American audience has a much greater background of “disbelief” in evolution [1].The final chapters are devoted to recent human evolution (from the period following divergence from chimps) and an overview of some of the difficulties people have with the possible implications of evolution for human behaviour. Overall, this is an excellent text for anyone who would like to understand the principles of evolution or update their knowledge, written in an entertaining and engaging style.[1] http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313... – unfortunately this, the original article in Science, is paywalled, but you can see a mirror at http://old.richarddawkins.net/article..., including the table comparing “belief” vs “disbelief” in evolution from 34 countries in 2005.

105,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"I read this book a while back and really enjoyed it. Note: If you are a creationist, you will doubtless NOT enjoy this. If you are an evolutionist, you'll probably be quite pleased with the book. And there's pity. For many, the book won't be read on its merits but for whether it supports or challenges one's views on the issue of Darwinian evolutionary theory.In terms of the book itself. . . . The purpose is specified by Jerry Coyne, the author, on page xiv: ""This book lays out the main lines of evidence for evolution. For those who oppose Darwinism purely as a matter of faith, no amount of evidence will do--theirs is a belief not based on reason. But for the many who find themselves uncertain, or who accept evolution but are not sure how to argue the case, this volume gives a succinct summary of why modern science recognizes evolution as true.""The book unfolds in a straightforward fashion. Chapter 1 summarizes the nature of evolution. He discusses the essence of the concept of evolution--""a species undergoing genetic change over time"" (page 3). Also discussed is ""natural selection,"" the process by which the more ""fit"" individuals tend to be more successful in reproductive terms That is, they leave more offspring than their less fit peers).Subsequent chapters outline the evidence for evolution, including often jury-rigged adaptations (evolution makes do with the organism/species as it exists and often leaves organisms that are poorly designed--but still capable of successful reproduction: think the lower back of humans!), the fossil record, a more detailed discussion of the process of natural selection, the relationship between sex and evolution, how species arise and develop, and--always an issue that excites passion--the relevance of evolution for humankind.The book itself does well what it sets out to do. There are things that bother me. As with many, the author claims that evolution is a ""fact."" I have never understood this allegation. Neo-Darwinian theory is a THEORY--not a fact. Lots of facts support the theory. By itself, though, it is NOT a fact. I think advocates of evolution shoot themselves in the foot with such an argument. Many, of course, would rejoin, ""It's ONLY a theory."" Such folks also don't know what they're talking about. A good theory is a great thing! Not ""just."" Quantum theory is terrific; Einstein's relativity is a fine theory. And so on.All in all, if the reader wants an accessible advocacy of evolutionary theory, this book does the job nicely. If the reader does not accept it, the book, of course, will not be very compelling."
106,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36384001-yousuf,2,"Good Overview, But Contains Straw MenThis is a good summary for the pro-Evolution side if anyone is researching the evolution-creation controversy. It goes through the fossil evidence, genetic evidence, geological evidence, and more for Evolution via natural selection (and other naturalistic processes). The author writes in a clear and logical manner, and generally avoids the confrontational polemics that other writers such as Richard Dawkins are prone to.My main objection is that Coyne uses misrepresentations to attack Intelligent Design (ID). He tries to associate ID with Young Earth Creationism many times, arguing that the two are similar or have similar methods. Nothing could be further from the truth. Pro-ID people are NOT making a deduction from religious scriptures; rather they are analyzing the structure of the cell (such as the information encoded in DNA) and making inferences based on that. You might not agree with their conclusions, but you should not try to smear them in a dishonest way.Another issue that I had was that most of Coyne's objections to ID are ""theological"" in nature. What I mean is that he points to ""flaws"" in organisms and basically states: ""An intelligent designer would have done a better job of this.""But these are theological, not scientific, objections; and they have theological, not scientific, answers. Probably because the Designer made the designs bad on purpose - I dunno, perhaps this world wasn't supposed to be perfect in the first place?He admits that materialist scientists do not have an explanation for the origin of life (OOL) as well as the Cambrian Explosion. But then he brings out the stereotypical ""God-of-the-gaps! God-of-the-gaps!"" argument to rebut ID here... I was literally shaking my head out of disappointment (though I wasn't at all surprised). Also, the response to integrated complexity was vague and didn't make much sense to me.I'm currently reading Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design, which is a pro-ID account of OOL. And I can tell you, it is anything but God-of-the-gaps. The entire argument is based on what we do know in biology, not a gap of any kind.I know the above review sounds harsh, but I actually enjoyed reading this book and I do recommend it to anyone who's interested in evolution or the evolution-creation controversy."

However, if you are undecided and truly interested in learning about the wealth of evidence that supports evolution as, indeed, the way (along with sea cucumbers, lichen, platypuses and blue whales) came to be, this is a wonderful book. Even if you already have a fair working knowledge of the theory (and that's theory in the scientific sense, not in the casual ""it's only a theory"" sense), you'll likely find a lot of new and fascinating details herein.All the classic evidence that you learned in school (if you're my age) is here, along with scads of new evidence in fields like microbiology, geology, paleobotany, and many others. The book avoids jargon except when it's needed in order to be specific, defines unfamiliar terms as it goes, explains how the facts in highly diverse areas support one another, points out the numerous areas where evolution would predict X and in fact science finds X, and generally lays out its case in a comprehensive and coherent manner. Happily, it also does so without either proselytizing or haranguing, leaving the reader to make his or her own decision in evaluating the range of interlocking facts presented. The last chapter discusses why certain religious sects have such difficulty accepting evolution, which was also enlightening and interesting.Highly recommended for the lay reader interested in acquiring a solid overview of the scientific evidence for evolution."

Coyne's Why Evolution Is True is a fine place to start. As his unsubtle title suggests, Coyne's purpose is to banish the arguments of creationists and their intelligent design fellow travelers. Much as Darwin did, he draws upon geology and the fossil record; biogeography, or the distribution of plants and animals; and the similarities and differences among living species. But gaps that once frustrated Darwin, such as so-called ""missing links"" in the fossil record, can now be filled. ... ... he builds a strong case for the fact of evolution, and for Darwin's theory of how it works. (That species change over time isn't theoretical; how and why the changes occur is the subject of ""evolutionary theory."") Coyne addresses many of the common creationist arguments head-on, outlining how complex systems such as eyes and biochemical pathways can evolve by natural selection. To his credit, however, the author acknowledges his strategy's fatal flaw: The refusal to accept evolution has precious little to do with reason, logic or evidence. Like the introductory college courses it too-closely resembles, Why Evolution Is True is packed with facts and clear explanations but is unlikely to change many minds."""

It's sad to think that even on this modern day, we still need books to show what is just actually is. It's always my dream to become an evolutionary anthropologist and by reading this book only ignites that passion more! This is a great book on evolution though some might find it to be dry. But the author has thoroughly described how evolution works and presented - as is the case in scientific literatures - a lot of convincing and irrefutable evidence. One thing I liked is the organization of the chapters where Coyne subtly explained the concepts and applied them first on evolution of ""lesser"" organisms, then on to human evolution. For readers who are honest-seekers, do not discount evolution until you have read this book. And for those who are already convinced, this could be a good weapon against Creationists (Intelligent Design proponents)."

The Blind Watchmaker and The Ancestor's Tale are the best books of this genre I have ever read. He is a bit more detailed than Coyne, a bit more lucid, and if I may say so, a bit more exciting, even a bit more poetic.Nevertheless, at under 300 pages, Why Evolution Is True is the best short book I've ever read on the subject. The last chapter, about the implications (and lack of implications) of the theory of evolution for our own species, is very good. And Dawkins himself gives the book high praise.Well worth reading."

Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isn’t it a noble, an enlighten way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it? This is how I answer when I’m asked - as I am surprisingly often - why I bother to get up in the mornings.” This book helps in its short and concise manner lay the argument for evolution, helping us understand our place in the intricacies of this marvellous world."

It is very well written and makes for an interesting case for Darwinian evolution. I was suprised at how little knowledge I had on this subject.

116,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42147710-michael-shore,5,Coyne nailed it. A fantastic summary of the basic concepts and evidence for evolution.
117,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"To be more precise and clear, the title of the book should be ""why the modern theory of evolution is true."" Changing the title doesn't make a difference to us the believers of the theory (I'll call the theory Darwinism for short), because we usually accept it as a bundle package. But after reading the book, I realize the theory makes multi-level propositions. ""Evolution happened"" is only one of them. Coyne mentions this structure of Darwinism repeatedly, but I think he could make the book stronger by laying it out at the very beginning. In my own words, the theory of evolution proposes the following hierarchy of propositions:1. Evolutionary change (change in inheritable traits of a population through generations) happened. Not only on the micro level (change of traits within a species) but also the macro level (the transformation of one species into another)2. Natural selection explains most of the microevolutionary change, e.g., the change in beak size of birds.3. Natural selection explains most of the macroevolutionary change, e.g., the origin of birds.4. Natural selection builds complex features in nonhuman species, such as the eyes and the brain.5. Natural selection builds complex features of humans, such as language and consciousness.  Some creationists refuse all propositions above. Some admit (1) but refuse to explain it by natural selection. Others accept natural selection only to a certain level. All of them share one common belief: natural selection cannot make us human to be what we are. As a response, Coyne provides ample evidence to support Darwinism. The evidence includes the following: • Species can be classified and grouped in a tree-like way• Discovery of transitional fossils at predicted locations with the expected age.• Features that only make sense by natural selection: vestiges / atavism / dead DNA / Embryo palimpsest / bad design• Distributions of species across the globe, such as how different species fill similar roles in different areas, how certain species lack on volcanic islands but not on continental islands, and the radiations of endemic species on volcanic islands.• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by artificial selection• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by natural selection in labs and fields• Math simulations that exhibit evolutionary paths to complex features under natural selection. An important lesson I learned from Coyne's enumeration of the evidence above, is to treat the following two things differently: 1) the general evolutionary theory, and 2) individual evolutionary explanations of traits and behaviors. Darwin provides us a beautiful theory. It is so simple, yet so powerful. But beauty does not equal truth. Darwinism is generally correct because scientists have accumulated a huge amount of supporting evidence. An individual evolutionary explanation, however, must bear its own burden of proof. We should not blindly believe in a single evolutionary explanation because there are often multiple competing evolutionary explanations of a trait or behavior. Many of them are inevitable ""just-so stories."" Moreover, natural selection is not the only chisel used by nature the sculptor. Features can be generated by other mechanisms, such as genetic drift and sexual selection. I found the hypothesis explaining the existence of human appendix especially interesting: it is possible that natural selection simply can't shrink the appendix anymore, because before it disappears from shrinking, a smaller appendix gives rise to a higher risk of being blocked.  This lesson also applies to economics, another discipline that is guided by a core theory — the rational choice theory. Again, the core theory might be generally correct, but this does not mean it is correct in every context, far from it.  Coyne also reminds me that most evolutionary explanations of complex human features, no matter how elaborate, are untested and probably untestable. This is unfortunate, because the evolution of such features, especially the evolution of consciousness, seems to be the most intriguing question of all. But to quote Darwin, we should not ""positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."" Instead, we should keep searching for testable theories in the future.  Stray observation:- The book solved a big puzzle I had in high school biology class: why human embryos look so weird and go through phases of development that make no sense.- Darwin did not explain the origin of species in his same-titled book (he would explain it in later books and papers). A better title for The Origin of Species, would have been The Origin of Adaptations."
118,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23258105-dileep-n,5,"tl;dr Evolution is true. The big picture is indisputably clear. What remains is to probe the finer details of the mechanics and processes underlying it. If Coyne's primary goal in writing this book was to convince Creationists that evolution is true, it remains unfulfilled. The people he's trying to convince are precisely the kind whom no amount of evidence supporting evolution can convince. This book lacks the only thing that can convince Creationists and proponents of Intelligent Design - passages from their holy book of choice, or even better, a direct quote from their god of choice, stating evolution is true. Kidding aside, the sad truth is that it is nigh impossible to fight dogma and deeply entrenched beliefs with logic and evidence. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. This book is the result of one such attempt and it is a brilliant one at that. Kudos to Coyne for fighting the good fight. Unless you're the kind of person who relies exclusively on made-up stories from stale, antiquated texts for moral guidance and laws of the natural world, you probably already know evolution is true, or rather, that it is the best explanation we have so far for the origin of life on this planet; and I'm fairly sure you will find this book insightful and enjoyable. The book is full of interesting facts and observations that unequivocally prove that evolution is a scientific fact. Topics that are covered include discovery of fossils, particularly of intermediates; speciation and biogeography; vestigial traits and organs that along with emryology provide a window into the past; genetic drift as an alternative (although minor) engine of evolution besides Darwinian natural selection; the powers of sexual selection; and lastly, the origin of of our own species along with a brief but useful discussion on the dicey issue of race. Along with a historical overview, Coyne also details recent evidence (last three decades) supporting evolution and advances made in paleontology, molecular and evolutionary biology, and a few other fields, which I found very helpful. At one time or another, I'm sure most of us have wondered, ""Now that the pressures of natural selection are largely absent in most human societies, are we still evolving? If so, in what ways?"" I found the beginnings of an answer to this in the penultimate chapter.The crisp, clear, and no-nonsense writing style makes digesting this information-rich book painless. Coyne has also provided handy notes clarifying certain ideas, pointing out opposing viewpoints, and lisiting resources for those interested in exploring a topic further. Several of the books he has mentioned have found their way into my to to-read list.This is a cogent synthesis of facts about evolution and of coherent arguments in its favor. Not only does it satiate your curiosity and expand your mind but it also arms you with knowledge for those uncomfortable engagements with staunch Creationsists. Highly recommended!"
119,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"The title of this book bluntly states its purpose, which is to refute, head on, the claims advanced by creationists and supporters of intelligent design that evolution by natural selection cannot possibly explain how life takes the many forms that it does. Biologist Jerry Coyne convincingly addresses every conceivable argument that could be made against evolution, using numerous examples to explain how life as it exists today must have arisen through evolution. To this end, he covers evidence from:- Fossils and biogeography.- Vestigial organs (eg, our appendix). - Vestigial genes. We have around 2,000 that no longer work because evolution rendered them unnecessary. An example is our gene for the final step in the biosynthesis of vitamin C which became non-functional after we started to consume this essential substance in our diet.- Atavisms (eg, our coccyx). - Embryonic development, where the early embryos of most vertebrates bear a striking resemblance to one another. The human embryo, for example, starts looking like that of a jawless fish, before becoming reptilian, and then mammalian. - Bad design, such as the asymmetric structure of flat, side-swimming fish, such as Dover sole, or the convoluted route taken in mammals by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which covers about 15 feet in the giraffe, to join two points just one foot apart).As Coyne points out, no supreme being would have created these oddities and imperfections unless it was that being’s intention to deceive us into believing they were the outcome of evolution, which seems extremely implausible. This is not a textbook on evolution, so its purpose is not to teach the underlying principles. The reader needs to look elsewhere for detailed explanations of genetics, genomes, DNA, inheritance, population growth, genetic drift, etc, but this is the ideal book for anyone who is open-mindedly sitting on the fence, unsure as to whether or not life arose through evolution, creation or intelligent design. Coyne’s arguments are very compelling although, as he admits, “evolution raises such profound questions of purpose, morality, and meaning that [some people] just can’t accept it no matter how much evidence they see”. He illustrates this point by referring to a talk on evolution he gave in Chicago to a group of businessmen. Afterwards, he was approached by one of the delegates who said, “I found your evidence for evolution very convincing—but I still don’t believe it”."
120,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"I hesitated before buying this book because I was a little put off by the title. I already assumed evolution was ""true"" (as much as any scientific knowledge can be considered ""the truth""), and I was more interested in knowing how it works, and the history of it all, from the first micro-organisms to now. The ""how"" part is covered pretty well, and by covering the ""how"" the author addresses creationist or ""intelligent design"" arguments and provides a clear, rational, and most importantly scientific answer. To be fair, the idea of natural selection and evolution seems simple enough, but how it leads to complex devices like an eyeball seems inexplicable... until it is explained. The creationist arguments are all fair, in the sense that they are perfectly valid questions to ask- until they are answered. But a perfectly valid question isn't the same as a valid objection. The book does a very good job at answering questions and debunking creationist objections in the process of explaining how evolution works, although this isn't the main focus of the book. At points along the way the author pauses to address a creationist objection- debunks it- and moves right along. And its done with such convincing ease that by the end the question is not ""How could evolution be true?"" but ""How could it be otherwise?""I don't think this book will change a creationist's mind, because if mere logical, rational, scientific explanations were all it took, creationism (an appeal to the supernatural rather than the natural) wouldn't exist in the first place. But I don't think that was the intent with this book. The book's title isn't ""Why creationism is wrong."" There is no point in arguing with a creationist whose faith feels threatened by science. If somebody isn't threatened by science then ""more science"" isn't going to change anything. But for the rest of us, laypeople who occasionally hear a creationist argument and think ""Oh, well that seems like a good point, I wonder how Darwanism answers that?"" the answers are here. And eventually, by the end of the book, with a good understanding of how darwanism works, any creationist question no longer seems like a good question- but more of an admission of ""I don't understand how this works.""There is nothing wrong with the statement ""I don't understand how this works"" as long as it is not followed with ""Therefore it can not be true."" Is it any better than saying ""I don't understand how this works, but I'll assume it's true""? No- unless that statement is followed by ""Because I understand the method by which this conclusion was reached."" If you understand the scientific method and think that observation, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, and comparison are really good ways to arrive at a conclusion about something then you will readily accept conclusions reached by those methods without knowing the details. So by understanding and accepting this method as a valid way to understand the world, it is perfectly reasonable to accept knowledge as being ""true"" that was achieved using these methods.You can't, however, argue one way or the other for something without knowing anything about it. I believed evolution to be true because I trusted the method by which the theory was developed, but I wanted to be able to understand the theory itself, and this book did a great job of it.One final note. The author did a great job at addressing the ""Just a theory"" argument. It isn't ""just a theory"", but a ""scientific theory"" which is completely different than ""a random guess with no way of testing it"". There is no point arguing it in a book review. Suffice to say the book spells it out and does a great job. Enough so that I underlined the entire thing.If you want to understand Darwinism, don't be put off by the title. By the end of the book you will understand how it works. The books isn't a defense of the theory but an explanation that is so thorough that it defends itself.I subtracted one star because I wish there was a little more about the timeline of evolution and the different eras of the earth's history. Another chapter would have been nice. "
121,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1643812-andrew,2,"Once again a great scientific mind has stooped to the lowest common denominator; mindlessly bickering with the creationist argument. I was expecting evolution/creationist argument in the preface, maybe even in the first chapter. Unfortunately, It's littered throughout the book. I understand that some readers actually enjoy this mindless drubbing, if so, this book is for you. What I was hoping for was a deeper biological understanding of speciation and specialization, and to Coyne's credit there are anecdotes littered throughout. Sadly, Those anecdotes are merely a way for Coyne to stick out his tongue and say ""I told you so, dummy"", they offer little new insights to those with a baseline understanding of biology. If you like Dawkins,you'll like Coyne, and If you like both I offer some simple advice. Grow up, and read a book with some scientific teeth. I recommend Stephen Jay Gould. If you are like me and are interested in speciation and specialization, I recommend skipping this book, and watching Coyne's lecture. It's a condensed version of the book, that skips all the bickering, and gets right down to the good stuff: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1m4mA... "

I can't imagine how hard it is to summarize a topic as voluminous as evolution into 230 pages.Without a doubt, evolution is complicated. It is one of the most misunderstood facts, and definitely the most viciously attacked. Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of explaining some of the basic tenets of evolution to the reader in a very succinct way. It is a breath taking read; this book needs to be read more than once. If only those who are so adamant about ID would crack open this book! Evolution is a beautiful mess. But, the fact that of all the species and of all mutations over billions of years, we are the only ones who have been awarded reason and a complex brain- that, to me, is far more meaningful and beautiful than to think someone created us and ""blessed us"" with it. We managed to become who we are, through billions of years of genetic fight. We are special, and we are here. Wow. Do we really need to believe in miracles when science gives us something this mind blowing?!"

So that was a good news at the time.I remember at my very first year as a med student, my anatomy professor explaining to us the action of a muscle that was useless unless we think of its potential action for a creature who walks on four limbs, "" i am just telling u this to memorize the muscle but this is a western explanation and it's not my intention to promote it"" said my professor.I remember so many times in my education process in which i was denied a chance to learn about evolution or to be given a fair criticism of Darwinian evolution, everything i was told about evolution turned out to be false.They told me ""evolution is completely random"" ""Darwin said that man came from monkeys"" and of course the most irritating ignorant phrase ""it's just a theory""I highly recommend this book for people like me, who missed a proper teacher to tell them about one of the most important ideas that ever crossed the minds of humankind. "
124,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3547378-benjamin,5,"This book is a well-structured argument that the process of evolution has occurred and does occur. The author has a remarkably humble tone as he describes both the assertive truth of evolution as well as the ongoing process of unfinished learning of science (e.g., the study of biogenesis, the beginning of the universe, evolutionary psychology, evolution's inability to stand alone as an ethical/moral system, etc.). I believe that this book was well worth the time to read.Evolution can by no means explain everything about the world around us, but contrary to the opinions of many creationists/ID advocates, it does not presume to. This is the essence of science: the search for knowledge rather than the presumption of it.Why Evolution is True is an excellent popular treatise of evolution because it makes clear these points, and is honest about the shortcomings (both real and imagined) of modern evolutionary theory. Do yourself a service and read it!"

126,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3268791-tim,1,A real scientist would never say evolution is a fact. Have they changed a fly into a dog yet? Dan Shectman won the noble prize for chemistry. He battled against established science for years. Lost jobs and told he was stupid.

129,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,4,"Let me tell you a little story.In high school, I was taught science from a ""Creationist"" perspective. I did who-knows-how-many research projects and papers on ""Creation versus Evolution"". I became pretty knowledgeable about the subject (or so I thought). I owned a tome titled ""Science vs Evolution"", a graduation present from my biology teacher, and could give all the talking points on why Darwinism was false.Fast forward a number of years. I can't pinpoint the moment when my perspective changed. I think it started with a nagging suspicion that, despite all the Creationist videos I had watched and the articles I had read, I had never truly, actually heard the argument for evolution from evolutionary scientists themselves, and only knew the distorted interpretations of their arguments from their ""critics"".I changed my mind, ultimately, not because of a wealth of scientific rebuttals to combat every objection of Intelligent Design advocates. It came down to a simple matter of logic.That logic is this: The theory of evolution came about from the scientific process. Predictions are made, evidence is gathered, and conclusions are drawn. At every turn, for more than a century, the assumptions about evolution have been rigorously questioned, challenged, and tested under scientific scrutiny.And throughout this process, the theory of evolution has not only survived, but become stronger and more deeply understood. And it is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists.Contrast this with the idea of Intelligent Design, or Creationism. This concept does not start with predictions that can be completely questioned or re-thought at any moment; it cannot flexibly follow the evidence, wherever it leads.Creationism begins with a conclusion, and seeks evidence to support that conclusion.In other words, the theory of evolution is scientific. Creationism is not.I had become convinced of evolution from a logical perspective, but I still did not understand it. I did not have the high school education most people get on the subject. I still had all those talking points from Answers in Genesis that I knew were false, but didn't have responses for.This book, Why Evolution is True, became the perfect answer to my needs. Coyne lays out the mechanisms of and evidence for evolution in very easy-to-understand, eye-opening terms that the average, non-scientific reader can absorb and enjoy.It's also relatively short (not a difficult read), while still astonishingly robust in the power of its evidence and strength of its arguments.I came to this book already convinced of evolution; I came way fully understanding it (for the first time), and EXCITED about its awesomeness. Seriously, evolution is... REALLY COOL???I'm greatly appreciative of the author for writing this, and helping me to fill a gap in my knowledge... while also helping me discovery the pure joy and wonder that comes with knowing our origins.Buuuuuuut... he does get one tiny star bumped off, and this is for purely opinionated reasons, but in his discussions of gender he sometimes lapsed into what I can only call ""male arrogance"". The way he talked about men and women just grated on my nerves. Not what he said was untrue or anything, just written in an annoying way that felt way too comfortable with male superiority. My objection is completely non-intellectual and subjective, but hey! This is my review! I can give whatever stars I wanted!In all seriousness, this book is amazing. It will doubtlessly be my default recommendation for fence-sitters, skeptics, and other people who lacked an honest education in the fact of evolution like I did."
130,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81496242-sakshi-sinha,5,"This book is a compelling read. Learning about evolution, the process and time that goes into this makes you just respect and admire our environment and animals even more. -Firstly, Coyne discusses about creationism and evolution. He often includes antidotes throughout the book. Its so unbelievable that there are people out there who don’t believe in evolution!!There are references from Darwin’s book “The Origin”, other authors and scientists who have worked in this field. Introducing different viewpoints to us. -Then it continues with Coyne explaining different theories and concepts of evolution. This isn’t much of a rocket science. It just requires basic comprehension of species and biology and I think it’s pretty easy to grip on. -Along with facts and views, Coyne mentions alot of studies conducted on fossils and how they helped in grouping and combining the story of evolution. It’s really an engaging study and this has actually amplified my interest in fossils.-In addition to this the author addresses evolution in different aspects of wildlife such as in aquatic animals, birds, mammals etc. Coyne also describes at length natural selection , vestigial organs, genetics etc.-Altogether the book is filled with engrossing examples and it’s so amusing. There are images for references which make it easier to interpret description the author provides. -lastly, I do have a suggestion, Coyne mentions various kinds of animals, insects, birds, and not all of them have a visual representation in the book. I suggest you use google to understand their anatomy and explore various journals or articles. It might take extra time but I think this just adds another layer of knowledge to the read. This book really is an eye opener. Overall brilliant book! I would recommend it:) "
131,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25797445-eugene,5,"Why Evolution is True is a very interesting and thought provoking read. Detailed yet written for the lay person, Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of clearly laying out the evidence for Darwinian evolution from a common ancestor and why it is unanimously accepted by all scientists not already predisposed to creationism. From the fossil record and DNA sequencing to continental drift and speciation, he not only lays out the multiple lines of evidence but also shows the countless predictions that have been made using the evolutionary model, and counters each example by explaining how creationism fails these predictions and doesn't yield what we would expect to find were it the case. I have a very limited scientific background, but had no trouble understanding most of the book. On top of arguing the scientific evidence, he also does well at addressing common social and moral objections to evolution. The last chapter describes how contrary to popular (usually creationist) belief, evolution properly understood does not lend itself to racism. Races evolved to adapt better to various environments as branches spreading out on the evolutionary tree, and there is nothing to suggest any sort of racial superiority. Likewise Coyne debunks the popular but misguided argument that believing evolution will make people lose all sense of morality. Quite contrary, the more we learn about how our social behaviours evolved and how our brains developed to comprehend all these questions, the more we can appreciate the value of our lives. My only contention is how he subtly seems to slip in his anti-theist presupposition toward the end by saying appeal to the supernatural is not necessary when discussing origins. It may not be necessary, but it would be more accurate to say science and the God debate fall under seperate, non overlapping categories as one deals purely in falsifiable claims while the other does not. That being said, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious to learn more about evolution and its implications written in a very matter of fact, unbiased way."

So why, when evolution is being reconfirmed every day, and forms the backbone of modern biology, do we need a book entitled Why Evolution Is True?""It's just as the description above has said, the evidence that supporting Evolution is enormous, starting from the first life on Earth until the evolution of Homo-sapiens. Every single life is just as Darwin had predicted, you won't find a fossil that exists in the Cambrian Age in the Precambrian Age and vice versa. In fact Evolution declared a bet as the evolutionist Richard Dawkins said: ""To those who has doubts about Evolution to scratch hardly in the Rocks to find an unsuitable fossil, we challenge them to that, will they accept the bet?"" In ""Why Evolution Is True"", Jerry A Coyne takes us to a journey in the Wonders of Natural Selection. He started with what a scientific theory means and then he goes on to explain the endless evidence of evolution and connecting it with everything around us, ""Some claim that evolution is just a theory, as if it were merely an opinion. But evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact. Evolution really happened. Accepting our kinship with all life on Earth is not only solid science ... in my view it's also a soaring spiritual experience."" –Neil deGrasse TysonYour body is a proof of multiple enhancing processes that have been done over millions of years starting from your individual cells to genes to last nerve in your Brain, for example the way human born is one of the best examples that we are descending from birds, by time the human evolved the way of giving birth doesn't change, the body of the baby turned upside down and the head of the baby (which becomes significantly bigger than that of our ancestors) faced the entrance of the womb, here we have to say isn't it ridiculous for God to do something like that, I mean why would He even blueprint-ed (or design) us with something very painful and can threatened the life of the mother just to prove something nothing than His sadistic nature of enjoying the screams of the mothers. Then he talked about Mutation and how it was at first the stick that Creationists wave on the face of Evolutionists every time they started a debate, he also mentioned and shed some lights on Linski's magnificent experiment on E-coli Bacteria which took 20 years and opened the gate in front of us to witness that ""Natural Selection + Mutations + Time = Darwin was Right""After that he talked about neuroscience and that evolution also has the ability to describe Morals and that Morals are not something comes up with Religion, it's something far more than that, it's something we might inherited it but mostly we gain it by practicing (eg: The Chimpanzees experiment). Jerry also explained that evolution doesn't necessarily mean to evolve into something more sophisticated, there's also a ""Redox Evolution"" which for example the evolution of Whales from Reptiles. I know I haven't wrote much and I won't, coz if you want to know something you have to dig for it, but what I'm totally convinced about is that the evidence evolution provides are stronger, reliable and more scientific than the Ideal Design provides, and that the idea of us coming from Adam and Eve is nothing but a Myth. It's not my words it's what science told us with EVIDENCE. It's as Carl Sagan said: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” – Cosmos."

But I can at least try to dispel the misconceptions that frighten people away from evolution and from the amazing derivation of life’s staggering diversity from a single naked replicating molecule.""Such is the writing style of Jerry Coyne, an accessible and well-versed author and research professor of evolutionary biology. This landmark work should have staying power in the annals of popular science, though it is lacking in philosophical nuance and subtlety. It is not intended to be a textbook for academics but rather a treatise to persuade anyone without a background in the subject. He is strong in his convictions and forceful in his rhetoric; a blog of the same name may be consulted for further reading and development of his thinking in this area.Why Evolution Is True is a serious page-turner. Coyne has a gift for conveying complex ideas and anyone of high-school education should not have trouble following his arguments.Far easier to understand than other overviews like Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, the primary focus is the direct evidence and ever-mounting proof which we have amassed since Darwin's formulation of the theory nearly two centuries ago. If one went into this topic without any knowledge the book would serve as a comprehensive introduction to the topic and its fundamental concepts, though they will miss out on discussion of related issues, e.g. memes and extended phenotype.Coyne makes the commendable decision to anticipate objections to each of his chapters, much like Darwin did in later editions of On the Origin of Species; he knows that evolution is a contested and widely-misunderstood field and that minds tend to be closed to its authenticity. There are some questions that are oft-raised without sufficient answer in the public square: how did the eye form if not by a miracle? Of what use is half a wing to an evolving bird, and how could that possibly be selected for? He tackles these deftly and head-on, giving answers and insight that reflect his depth of knowledge.Near the end of chapter 9 we are given this summary:""Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life’s diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life... Most of us do need meaning, purpose, and moral guidance in our lives. How do we find them if we accept that evolution is the real story of our origin? That question is outside the domain of science.""He then proceeds to dismiss all answers outside of naturalism and materialism outright, which shows the limitations of his view in dialogue with contrasting opinions. Coyne does not attempt to appear as an unbiased explicator of evolutionary theory. This is a minor problem in the scope of the work, and perhaps a deserved one; he could hardly be more vindicated due to the sheer force of evidence for macroevolution. It makes me wonder if a more dispassionate approach could have been helpful. There are, despite his bewilderment, religious people who believe in evolution.He leaves us with a pithy and hopeful quote:""Evolution tells us where we came from, not where we can go.""I would definitely recommend this work to anyone who is curious about the developments in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural and sexual selection. As long as they are open to the evidence and don't mind the occasional sneer from the author, by the end there should be little doubt that evolution is, in fact, true."

Each strand of knowledge which contributes to our understanding is laid out clearly, starting in many cases with what Darwin knew or intuited when writing On The Origin Of Species. Coyne deftly takes us through the developments in areas such as the fossil record, embryology, vestigial organs, biogeography and genetics; showing how predictions can be made and how discoveries since Darwin's time have confirmed the process of evolution over and over again. Many eye-catching examples are used to demonstrate where we can expect to find fossils in geological layers; how the bodily organisation of modern creatures follows patterns laid down in ancestral forms; and how environmental pressures lead to adaptation. The example of the modern mammalian laryngeal nerve as poor design derived from ancient forms is particularly striking. The nerve is involved in speech and swallowing and connects the brain to the larynx. It wraps around the aorta (a large vessel in the heart) rather than taking a direct route. This is not an issue for an ancient fishlike creature – but in a human the nerve has to be about a foot in length to follow the same route. In a giraffe, which has the same basic body plan, the nerve is three feet long! This is obviously inefficient and may even be more prone to injury, but clearly shows the laryngeal nerve adapting to follow the evolutionary changes in the body pattern.Coyne also shows how these additions to our knowledge efficiently take down the creationist or “intelligent design” arguments. Whilst he concedes that those arguing from faith will probably not change their minds, the book is very much aimed at people who are uncertain about the science. For European readers, this frequent referencing of creationism is a little grating since it is not such a large issue in this part of the world, but it is understandable when the American audience has a much greater background of “disbelief” in evolution [1].The final chapters are devoted to recent human evolution (from the period following divergence from chimps) and an overview of some of the difficulties people have with the possible implications of evolution for human behaviour. Overall, this is an excellent text for anyone who would like to understand the principles of evolution or update their knowledge, written in an entertaining and engaging style.[1] http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313... – unfortunately this, the original article in Science, is paywalled, but you can see a mirror at http://old.richarddawkins.net/article..., including the table comparing “belief” vs “disbelief” in evolution from 34 countries in 2005.

If you are an evolutionist, you'll probably be quite pleased with the book. And there's pity. For many, the book won't be read on its merits but for whether it supports or challenges one's views on the issue of Darwinian evolutionary theory.In terms of the book itself. . . . The purpose is specified by Jerry Coyne, the author, on page xiv: ""This book lays out the main lines of evidence for evolution. For those who oppose Darwinism purely as a matter of faith, no amount of evidence will do--theirs is a belief not based on reason. But for the many who find themselves uncertain, or who accept evolution but are not sure how to argue the case, this volume gives a succinct summary of why modern science recognizes evolution as true.""The book unfolds in a straightforward fashion. Chapter 1 summarizes the nature of evolution. He discusses the essence of the concept of evolution--""a species undergoing genetic change over time"" (page 3). Also discussed is ""natural selection,"" the process by which the more ""fit"" individuals tend to be more successful in reproductive terms That is, they leave more offspring than their less fit peers).Subsequent chapters outline the evidence for evolution, including often jury-rigged adaptations (evolution makes do with the organism/species as it exists and often leaves organisms that are poorly designed--but still capable of successful reproduction: think the lower back of humans!), the fossil record, a more detailed discussion of the process of natural selection, the relationship between sex and evolution, how species arise and develop, and--always an issue that excites passion--the relevance of evolution for humankind.The book itself does well what it sets out to do. There are things that bother me. As with many, the author claims that evolution is a ""fact."" I have never understood this allegation. Neo-Darwinian theory is a THEORY--not a fact. Lots of facts support the theory. By itself, though, it is NOT a fact. I think advocates of evolution shoot themselves in the foot with such an argument. Many, of course, would rejoin, ""It's ONLY a theory."" Such folks also don't know what they're talking about. A good theory is a great thing! Not ""just."" Quantum theory is terrific; Einstein's relativity is a fine theory. And so on.All in all, if the reader wants an accessible advocacy of evolutionary theory, this book does the job nicely. If the reader does not accept it, the book, of course, will not be very compelling."
136,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36384001-yousuf,2,"Good Overview, But Contains Straw MenThis is a good summary for the pro-Evolution side if anyone is researching the evolution-creation controversy. It goes through the fossil evidence, genetic evidence, geological evidence, and more for Evolution via natural selection (and other naturalistic processes). The author writes in a clear and logical manner, and generally avoids the confrontational polemics that other writers such as Richard Dawkins are prone to.My main objection is that Coyne uses misrepresentations to attack Intelligent Design (ID). He tries to associate ID with Young Earth Creationism many times, arguing that the two are similar or have similar methods. Nothing could be further from the truth. Pro-ID people are NOT making a deduction from religious scriptures; rather they are analyzing the structure of the cell (such as the information encoded in DNA) and making inferences based on that. You might not agree with their conclusions, but you should not try to smear them in a dishonest way.Another issue that I had was that most of Coyne's objections to ID are ""theological"" in nature. What I mean is that he points to ""flaws"" in organisms and basically states: ""An intelligent designer would have done a better job of this.""But these are theological, not scientific, objections; and they have theological, not scientific, answers. Probably because the Designer made the designs bad on purpose - I dunno, perhaps this world wasn't supposed to be perfect in the first place?He admits that materialist scientists do not have an explanation for the origin of life (OOL) as well as the Cambrian Explosion. But then he brings out the stereotypical ""God-of-the-gaps! God-of-the-gaps!"" argument to rebut ID here... I was literally shaking my head out of disappointment (though I wasn't at all surprised). Also, the response to integrated complexity was vague and didn't make much sense to me.I'm currently reading Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design, which is a pro-ID account of OOL. And I can tell you, it is anything but God-of-the-gaps. The entire argument is based on what we do know in biology, not a gap of any kind.I know the above review sounds harsh, but I actually enjoyed reading this book and I do recommend it to anyone who's interested in evolution or the evolution-creation controversy."
137,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800824-michele,4,"If you aren't willing to consider evolution as a possibility, this may not make you believe. However, if you are undecided and truly interested in learning about the wealth of evidence that supports evolution as, indeed, the way (along with sea cucumbers, lichen, platypuses and blue whales) came to be, this is a wonderful book. Even if you already have a fair working knowledge of the theory (and that's theory in the scientific sense, not in the casual ""it's only a theory"" sense), you'll likely find a lot of new and fascinating details herein.All the classic evidence that you learned in school (if you're my age) is here, along with scads of new evidence in fields like microbiology, geology, paleobotany, and many others. The book avoids jargon except when it's needed in order to be specific, defines unfamiliar terms as it goes, explains how the facts in highly diverse areas support one another, points out the numerous areas where evolution would predict X and in fact science finds X, and generally lays out its case in a comprehensive and coherent manner. Happily, it also does so without either proselytizing or haranguing, leaving the reader to make his or her own decision in evaluating the range of interlocking facts presented. The last chapter discusses why certain religious sects have such difficulty accepting evolution, which was also enlightening and interesting.Highly recommended for the lay reader interested in acquiring a solid overview of the scientific evidence for evolution."

Coyne's Why Evolution Is True is a fine place to start. As his unsubtle title suggests, Coyne's purpose is to banish the arguments of creationists and their intelligent design fellow travelers. Much as Darwin did, he draws upon geology and the fossil record; biogeography, or the distribution of plants and animals; and the similarities and differences among living species. But gaps that once frustrated Darwin, such as so-called ""missing links"" in the fossil record, can now be filled. ... ... he builds a strong case for the fact of evolution, and for Darwin's theory of how it works. (That species change over time isn't theoretical; how and why the changes occur is the subject of ""evolutionary theory."") Coyne addresses many of the common creationist arguments head-on, outlining how complex systems such as eyes and biochemical pathways can evolve by natural selection. To his credit, however, the author acknowledges his strategy's fatal flaw: The refusal to accept evolution has precious little to do with reason, logic or evidence. Like the introductory college courses it too-closely resembles, Why Evolution Is True is packed with facts and clear explanations but is unlikely to change many minds."""

It's sad to think that even on this modern day, we still need books to show what is just actually is. It's always my dream to become an evolutionary anthropologist and by reading this book only ignites that passion more! This is a great book on evolution though some might find it to be dry. But the author has thoroughly described how evolution works and presented - as is the case in scientific literatures - a lot of convincing and irrefutable evidence. One thing I liked is the organization of the chapters where Coyne subtly explained the concepts and applied them first on evolution of ""lesser"" organisms, then on to human evolution. For readers who are honest-seekers, do not discount evolution until you have read this book. And for those who are already convinced, this could be a good weapon against Creationists (Intelligent Design proponents)."
140,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6019621-willard-brickey,4,"Richard Dawkins has set the bar very high for books about evolution for the layman. The Blind Watchmaker and The Ancestor's Tale are the best books of this genre I have ever read. He is a bit more detailed than Coyne, a bit more lucid, and if I may say so, a bit more exciting, even a bit more poetic.Nevertheless, at under 300 pages, Why Evolution Is True is the best short book I've ever read on the subject. The last chapter, about the implications (and lack of implications) of the theory of evolution for our own species, is very good. And Dawkins himself gives the book high praise.Well worth reading."

This is how I answer when I’m asked - as I am surprisingly often - why I bother to get up in the mornings.” This book helps in its short and concise manner lay the argument for evolution, helping us understand our place in the intricacies of this marvellous world."

146,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42147710-michael-shore,5,Coyne nailed it. A fantastic summary of the basic concepts and evidence for evolution.
147,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"To be more precise and clear, the title of the book should be ""why the modern theory of evolution is true."" Changing the title doesn't make a difference to us the believers of the theory (I'll call the theory Darwinism for short), because we usually accept it as a bundle package. But after reading the book, I realize the theory makes multi-level propositions. ""Evolution happened"" is only one of them. Coyne mentions this structure of Darwinism repeatedly, but I think he could make the book stronger by laying it out at the very beginning. In my own words, the theory of evolution proposes the following hierarchy of propositions:1. Evolutionary change (change in inheritable traits of a population through generations) happened. Not only on the micro level (change of traits within a species) but also the macro level (the transformation of one species into another)2. Natural selection explains most of the microevolutionary change, e.g., the change in beak size of birds.3. Natural selection explains most of the macroevolutionary change, e.g., the origin of birds.4. Natural selection builds complex features in nonhuman species, such as the eyes and the brain.5. Natural selection builds complex features of humans, such as language and consciousness.  Some creationists refuse all propositions above. Some admit (1) but refuse to explain it by natural selection. Others accept natural selection only to a certain level. All of them share one common belief: natural selection cannot make us human to be what we are. As a response, Coyne provides ample evidence to support Darwinism. The evidence includes the following: • Species can be classified and grouped in a tree-like way• Discovery of transitional fossils at predicted locations with the expected age.• Features that only make sense by natural selection: vestiges / atavism / dead DNA / Embryo palimpsest / bad design• Distributions of species across the globe, such as how different species fill similar roles in different areas, how certain species lack on volcanic islands but not on continental islands, and the radiations of endemic species on volcanic islands.• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by artificial selection• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by natural selection in labs and fields• Math simulations that exhibit evolutionary paths to complex features under natural selection. An important lesson I learned from Coyne's enumeration of the evidence above, is to treat the following two things differently: 1) the general evolutionary theory, and 2) individual evolutionary explanations of traits and behaviors. Darwin provides us a beautiful theory. It is so simple, yet so powerful. But beauty does not equal truth. Darwinism is generally correct because scientists have accumulated a huge amount of supporting evidence. An individual evolutionary explanation, however, must bear its own burden of proof. We should not blindly believe in a single evolutionary explanation because there are often multiple competing evolutionary explanations of a trait or behavior. Many of them are inevitable ""just-so stories."" Moreover, natural selection is not the only chisel used by nature the sculptor. Features can be generated by other mechanisms, such as genetic drift and sexual selection. I found the hypothesis explaining the existence of human appendix especially interesting: it is possible that natural selection simply can't shrink the appendix anymore, because before it disappears from shrinking, a smaller appendix gives rise to a higher risk of being blocked.  This lesson also applies to economics, another discipline that is guided by a core theory — the rational choice theory. Again, the core theory might be generally correct, but this does not mean it is correct in every context, far from it.  Coyne also reminds me that most evolutionary explanations of complex human features, no matter how elaborate, are untested and probably untestable. This is unfortunate, because the evolution of such features, especially the evolution of consciousness, seems to be the most intriguing question of all. But to quote Darwin, we should not ""positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."" Instead, we should keep searching for testable theories in the future.  Stray observation:- The book solved a big puzzle I had in high school biology class: why human embryos look so weird and go through phases of development that make no sense.- Darwin did not explain the origin of species in his same-titled book (he would explain it in later books and papers). A better title for The Origin of Species, would have been The Origin of Adaptations."
148,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23258105-dileep-n,5,"tl;dr Evolution is true. The big picture is indisputably clear. What remains is to probe the finer details of the mechanics and processes underlying it. If Coyne's primary goal in writing this book was to convince Creationists that evolution is true, it remains unfulfilled. The people he's trying to convince are precisely the kind whom no amount of evidence supporting evolution can convince. This book lacks the only thing that can convince Creationists and proponents of Intelligent Design - passages from their holy book of choice, or even better, a direct quote from their god of choice, stating evolution is true. Kidding aside, the sad truth is that it is nigh impossible to fight dogma and deeply entrenched beliefs with logic and evidence. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. This book is the result of one such attempt and it is a brilliant one at that. Kudos to Coyne for fighting the good fight. Unless you're the kind of person who relies exclusively on made-up stories from stale, antiquated texts for moral guidance and laws of the natural world, you probably already know evolution is true, or rather, that it is the best explanation we have so far for the origin of life on this planet; and I'm fairly sure you will find this book insightful and enjoyable. The book is full of interesting facts and observations that unequivocally prove that evolution is a scientific fact. Topics that are covered include discovery of fossils, particularly of intermediates; speciation and biogeography; vestigial traits and organs that along with emryology provide a window into the past; genetic drift as an alternative (although minor) engine of evolution besides Darwinian natural selection; the powers of sexual selection; and lastly, the origin of of our own species along with a brief but useful discussion on the dicey issue of race. Along with a historical overview, Coyne also details recent evidence (last three decades) supporting evolution and advances made in paleontology, molecular and evolutionary biology, and a few other fields, which I found very helpful. At one time or another, I'm sure most of us have wondered, ""Now that the pressures of natural selection are largely absent in most human societies, are we still evolving? If so, in what ways?"" I found the beginnings of an answer to this in the penultimate chapter.The crisp, clear, and no-nonsense writing style makes digesting this information-rich book painless. Coyne has also provided handy notes clarifying certain ideas, pointing out opposing viewpoints, and lisiting resources for those interested in exploring a topic further. Several of the books he has mentioned have found their way into my to to-read list.This is a cogent synthesis of facts about evolution and of coherent arguments in its favor. Not only does it satiate your curiosity and expand your mind but it also arms you with knowledge for those uncomfortable engagements with staunch Creationsists. Highly recommended!"
149,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"The title of this book bluntly states its purpose, which is to refute, head on, the claims advanced by creationists and supporters of intelligent design that evolution by natural selection cannot possibly explain how life takes the many forms that it does. Biologist Jerry Coyne convincingly addresses every conceivable argument that could be made against evolution, using numerous examples to explain how life as it exists today must have arisen through evolution. To this end, he covers evidence from:- Fossils and biogeography.- Vestigial organs (eg, our appendix). - Vestigial genes. We have around 2,000 that no longer work because evolution rendered them unnecessary. An example is our gene for the final step in the biosynthesis of vitamin C which became non-functional after we started to consume this essential substance in our diet.- Atavisms (eg, our coccyx). - Embryonic development, where the early embryos of most vertebrates bear a striking resemblance to one another. The human embryo, for example, starts looking like that of a jawless fish, before becoming reptilian, and then mammalian. - Bad design, such as the asymmetric structure of flat, side-swimming fish, such as Dover sole, or the convoluted route taken in mammals by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which covers about 15 feet in the giraffe, to join two points just one foot apart).As Coyne points out, no supreme being would have created these oddities and imperfections unless it was that being’s intention to deceive us into believing they were the outcome of evolution, which seems extremely implausible. This is not a textbook on evolution, so its purpose is not to teach the underlying principles. The reader needs to look elsewhere for detailed explanations of genetics, genomes, DNA, inheritance, population growth, genetic drift, etc, but this is the ideal book for anyone who is open-mindedly sitting on the fence, unsure as to whether or not life arose through evolution, creation or intelligent design. Coyne’s arguments are very compelling although, as he admits, “evolution raises such profound questions of purpose, morality, and meaning that [some people] just can’t accept it no matter how much evidence they see”. He illustrates this point by referring to a talk on evolution he gave in Chicago to a group of businessmen. Afterwards, he was approached by one of the delegates who said, “I found your evidence for evolution very convincing—but I still don’t believe it”."
150,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"I hesitated before buying this book because I was a little put off by the title. I already assumed evolution was ""true"" (as much as any scientific knowledge can be considered ""the truth""), and I was more interested in knowing how it works, and the history of it all, from the first micro-organisms to now. The ""how"" part is covered pretty well, and by covering the ""how"" the author addresses creationist or ""intelligent design"" arguments and provides a clear, rational, and most importantly scientific answer. To be fair, the idea of natural selection and evolution seems simple enough, but how it leads to complex devices like an eyeball seems inexplicable... until it is explained. The creationist arguments are all fair, in the sense that they are perfectly valid questions to ask- until they are answered. But a perfectly valid question isn't the same as a valid objection. The book does a very good job at answering questions and debunking creationist objections in the process of explaining how evolution works, although this isn't the main focus of the book. At points along the way the author pauses to address a creationist objection- debunks it- and moves right along. And its done with such convincing ease that by the end the question is not ""How could evolution be true?"" but ""How could it be otherwise?""I don't think this book will change a creationist's mind, because if mere logical, rational, scientific explanations were all it took, creationism (an appeal to the supernatural rather than the natural) wouldn't exist in the first place. But I don't think that was the intent with this book. The book's title isn't ""Why creationism is wrong."" There is no point in arguing with a creationist whose faith feels threatened by science. If somebody isn't threatened by science then ""more science"" isn't going to change anything. But for the rest of us, laypeople who occasionally hear a creationist argument and think ""Oh, well that seems like a good point, I wonder how Darwanism answers that?"" the answers are here. And eventually, by the end of the book, with a good understanding of how darwanism works, any creationist question no longer seems like a good question- but more of an admission of ""I don't understand how this works.""There is nothing wrong with the statement ""I don't understand how this works"" as long as it is not followed with ""Therefore it can not be true."" Is it any better than saying ""I don't understand how this works, but I'll assume it's true""? No- unless that statement is followed by ""Because I understand the method by which this conclusion was reached."" If you understand the scientific method and think that observation, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, and comparison are really good ways to arrive at a conclusion about something then you will readily accept conclusions reached by those methods without knowing the details. So by understanding and accepting this method as a valid way to understand the world, it is perfectly reasonable to accept knowledge as being ""true"" that was achieved using these methods.You can't, however, argue one way or the other for something without knowing anything about it. I believed evolution to be true because I trusted the method by which the theory was developed, but I wanted to be able to understand the theory itself, and this book did a great job of it.One final note. The author did a great job at addressing the ""Just a theory"" argument. It isn't ""just a theory"", but a ""scientific theory"" which is completely different than ""a random guess with no way of testing it"". There is no point arguing it in a book review. Suffice to say the book spells it out and does a great job. Enough so that I underlined the entire thing.If you want to understand Darwinism, don't be put off by the title. By the end of the book you will understand how it works. The books isn't a defense of the theory but an explanation that is so thorough that it defends itself.I subtracted one star because I wish there was a little more about the timeline of evolution and the different eras of the earth's history. Another chapter would have been nice. "
151,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1643812-andrew,2,"Once again a great scientific mind has stooped to the lowest common denominator; mindlessly bickering with the creationist argument. I was expecting evolution/creationist argument in the preface, maybe even in the first chapter. Unfortunately, It's littered throughout the book. I understand that some readers actually enjoy this mindless drubbing, if so, this book is for you. What I was hoping for was a deeper biological understanding of speciation and specialization, and to Coyne's credit there are anecdotes littered throughout. Sadly, Those anecdotes are merely a way for Coyne to stick out his tongue and say ""I told you so, dummy"", they offer little new insights to those with a baseline understanding of biology. If you like Dawkins,you'll like Coyne, and If you like both I offer some simple advice. Grow up, and read a book with some scientific teeth. I recommend Stephen Jay Gould. If you are like me and are interested in speciation and specialization, I recommend skipping this book, and watching Coyne's lecture.

If only those who are so adamant about ID would crack open this book! Evolution is a beautiful mess. But, the fact that of all the species and of all mutations over billions of years, we are the only ones who have been awarded reason and a complex brain- that, to me, is far more meaningful and beautiful than to think someone created us and ""blessed us"" with it.

So that was a good news at the time.I remember at my very first year as a med student, my anatomy professor explaining to us the action of a muscle that was useless unless we think of its potential action for a creature who walks on four limbs, "" i am just telling u this to memorize the muscle but this is a western explanation and it's not my intention to promote it"" said my professor.I remember so many times in my education process in which i was denied a chance to learn about evolution or to be given a fair criticism of Darwinian evolution, everything i was told about evolution turned out to be false.They told me ""evolution is completely random"" ""Darwin said that man came from monkeys"" and of course the most irritating ignorant phrase ""it's just a theory""I highly recommend this book for people like me, who missed a proper teacher to tell them about one of the most important ideas that ever crossed the minds of humankind.

154,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3547378-benjamin,5,"This book is a well-structured argument that the process of evolution has occurred and does occur. The author has a remarkably humble tone as he describes both the assertive truth of evolution as well as the ongoing process of unfinished learning of science (e.g., the study of biogenesis, the beginning of the universe, evolutionary psychology, evolution's inability to stand alone as an ethical/moral system, etc.). I believe that this book was well worth the time to read.Evolution can by no means explain everything about the world around us, but contrary to the opinions of many creationists/ID advocates, it does not presume to. This is the essence of science: the search for knowledge rather than the presumption of it.Why Evolution is True is an excellent popular treatise of evolution because it makes clear these points, and is honest about the shortcomings (both real and imagined) of modern evolutionary theory. Do yourself a service and read it!"

Dan Shectman won the noble prize for chemistry. He battled against established science for years. Lost jobs and told he was stupid. He forced scientists to reconsider their conception of the very nature of matter. To call evolution a fact is to place your mind in a box. You will never find truth that way.

159,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,4,"Let me tell you a little story.In high school, I was taught science from a ""Creationist"" perspective. I did who-knows-how-many research projects and papers on ""Creation versus Evolution"". I became pretty knowledgeable about the subject (or so I thought). I owned a tome titled ""Science vs Evolution"", a graduation present from my biology teacher, and could give all the talking points on why Darwinism was false.Fast forward a number of years. I can't pinpoint the moment when my perspective changed. I think it started with a nagging suspicion that, despite all the Creationist videos I had watched and the articles I had read, I had never truly, actually heard the argument for evolution from evolutionary scientists themselves, and only knew the distorted interpretations of their arguments from their ""critics"".I changed my mind, ultimately, not because of a wealth of scientific rebuttals to combat every objection of Intelligent Design advocates. It came down to a simple matter of logic.That logic is this: The theory of evolution came about from the scientific process. Predictions are made, evidence is gathered, and conclusions are drawn. At every turn, for more than a century, the assumptions about evolution have been rigorously questioned, challenged, and tested under scientific scrutiny.And throughout this process, the theory of evolution has not only survived, but become stronger and more deeply understood. And it is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists.Contrast this with the idea of Intelligent Design, or Creationism. This concept does not start with predictions that can be completely questioned or re-thought at any moment; it cannot flexibly follow the evidence, wherever it leads.Creationism begins with a conclusion, and seeks evidence to support that conclusion.In other words, the theory of evolution is scientific. Creationism is not.I had become convinced of evolution from a logical perspective, but I still did not understand it. I did not have the high school education most people get on the subject. I still had all those talking points from Answers in Genesis that I knew were false, but didn't have responses for.This book, Why Evolution is True, became the perfect answer to my needs. Coyne lays out the mechanisms of and evidence for evolution in very easy-to-understand, eye-opening terms that the average, non-scientific reader can absorb and enjoy.It's also relatively short (not a difficult read), while still astonishingly robust in the power of its evidence and strength of its arguments.I came to this book already convinced of evolution; I came way fully understanding it (for the first time), and EXCITED about its awesomeness. Seriously, evolution is... REALLY COOL???I'm greatly appreciative of the author for writing this, and helping me to fill a gap in my knowledge... while also helping me discovery the pure joy and wonder that comes with knowing our origins.Buuuuuuut... he does get one tiny star bumped off, and this is for purely opinionated reasons, but in his discussions of gender he sometimes lapsed into what I can only call ""male arrogance"". The way he talked about men and women just grated on my nerves. Not what he said was untrue or anything, just written in an annoying way that felt way too comfortable with male superiority. My objection is completely non-intellectual and subjective, but hey! This is my review! I can give whatever stars I wanted!In all seriousness, this book is amazing. It will doubtlessly be my default recommendation for fence-sitters, skeptics, and other people who lacked an honest education in the fact of evolution like I did."
160,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81496242-sakshi-sinha,5,"This book is a compelling read. Learning about evolution, the process and time that goes into this makes you just respect and admire our environment and animals even more. -Firstly, Coyne discusses about creationism and evolution. He often includes antidotes throughout the book. Its so unbelievable that there are people out there who don’t believe in evolution!!There are references from Darwin’s book “The Origin”, other authors and scientists who have worked in this field. Introducing different viewpoints to us. -Then it continues with Coyne explaining different theories and concepts of evolution. This isn’t much of a rocket science. It just requires basic comprehension of species and biology and I think it’s pretty easy to grip on. -Along with facts and views, Coyne mentions alot of studies conducted on fossils and how they helped in grouping and combining the story of evolution. It’s really an engaging study and this has actually amplified my interest in fossils.-In addition to this the author addresses evolution in different aspects of wildlife such as in aquatic animals, birds, mammals etc. Coyne also describes at length natural selection , vestigial organs, genetics etc.-Altogether the book is filled with engrossing examples and it’s so amusing. There are images for references which make it easier to interpret description the author provides. -lastly, I do have a suggestion, Coyne mentions various kinds of animals, insects, birds, and not all of them have a visual representation in the book. I suggest you use google to understand their anatomy and explore various journals or articles. It might take extra time but I think this just adds another layer of knowledge to the read. This book really is an eye opener. Overall brilliant book! I would recommend it:) "
161,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25797445-eugene,5,"Why Evolution is True is a very interesting and thought provoking read. Detailed yet written for the lay person, Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of clearly laying out the evidence for Darwinian evolution from a common ancestor and why it is unanimously accepted by all scientists not already predisposed to creationism. From the fossil record and DNA sequencing to continental drift and speciation, he not only lays out the multiple lines of evidence but also shows the countless predictions that have been made using the evolutionary model, and counters each example by explaining how creationism fails these predictions and doesn't yield what we would expect to find were it the case. I have a very limited scientific background, but had no trouble understanding most of the book. On top of arguing the scientific evidence, he also does well at addressing common social and moral objections to evolution. The last chapter describes how contrary to popular (usually creationist) belief, evolution properly understood does not lend itself to racism. Races evolved to adapt better to various environments as branches spreading out on the evolutionary tree, and there is nothing to suggest any sort of racial superiority. Likewise Coyne debunks the popular but misguided argument that believing evolution will make people lose all sense of morality. Quite contrary, the more we learn about how our social behaviours evolved and how our brains developed to comprehend all these questions, the more we can appreciate the value of our lives. My only contention is how he subtly seems to slip in his anti-theist presupposition toward the end by saying appeal to the supernatural is not necessary when discussing origins. It may not be necessary, but it would be more accurate to say science and the God debate fall under seperate, non overlapping categories as one deals purely in falsifiable claims while the other does not. That being said, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious to learn more about evolution and its implications written in a very matter of fact, unbiased way."

So why, when evolution is being reconfirmed every day, and forms the backbone of modern biology, do we need a book entitled Why Evolution Is True?""It's just as the description above has said, the evidence that supporting Evolution is enormous, starting from the first life on Earth until the evolution of Homo-sapiens. Every single life is just as Darwin had predicted, you won't find a fossil that exists in the Cambrian Age in the Precambrian Age and vice versa. In fact Evolution declared a bet as the evolutionist Richard Dawkins said: ""To those who has doubts about Evolution to scratch hardly in the Rocks to find an unsuitable fossil, we challenge them to that, will they accept the bet?"" In ""Why Evolution Is True"", Jerry A Coyne takes us to a journey in the Wonders of Natural Selection. He started with what a scientific theory means and then he goes on to explain the endless evidence of evolution and connecting it with everything around us, ""Some claim that evolution is just a theory, as if it were merely an opinion. But evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact. Evolution really happened. Accepting our kinship with all life on Earth is not only solid science ... in my view it's also a soaring spiritual experience."" –Neil deGrasse TysonYour body is a proof of multiple enhancing processes that have been done over millions of years starting from your individual cells to genes to last nerve in your Brain, for example the way human born is one of the best examples that we are descending from birds, by time the human evolved the way of giving birth doesn't change, the body of the baby turned upside down and the head of the baby (which becomes significantly bigger than that of our ancestors) faced the entrance of the womb, here we have to say isn't it ridiculous for God to do something like that, I mean why would He even blueprint-ed (or design) us with something very painful and can threatened the life of the mother just to prove something nothing than His sadistic nature of enjoying the screams of the mothers. Then he talked about Mutation and how it was at first the stick that Creationists wave on the face of Evolutionists every time they started a debate, he also mentioned and shed some lights on Linski's magnificent experiment on E-coli Bacteria which took 20 years and opened the gate in front of us to witness that ""Natural Selection + Mutations + Time = Darwin was Right""After that he talked about neuroscience and that evolution also has the ability to describe Morals and that Morals are not something comes up with Religion, it's something far more than that, it's something we might inherited it but mostly we gain it by practicing (eg: The Chimpanzees experiment). Jerry also explained that evolution doesn't necessarily mean to evolve into something more sophisticated, there's also a ""Redox Evolution"" which for example the evolution of Whales from Reptiles. I know I haven't wrote much and I won't, coz if you want to know something you have to dig for it, but what I'm totally convinced about is that the evidence evolution provides are stronger, reliable and more scientific than the Ideal Design provides, and that the idea of us coming from Adam and Eve is nothing but a Myth. It's not my words it's what science told us with EVIDENCE. It's as Carl Sagan said: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” – Cosmos."
163,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95929927-christian,4,"""I certainly make no claim to be the Milton of Darwinism. But I can at least try to dispel the misconceptions that frighten people away from evolution and from the amazing derivation of life’s staggering diversity from a single naked replicating molecule.""Such is the writing style of Jerry Coyne, an accessible and well-versed author and research professor of evolutionary biology. This landmark work should have staying power in the annals of popular science, though it is lacking in philosophical nuance and subtlety. It is not intended to be a textbook for academics but rather a treatise to persuade anyone without a background in the subject. He is strong in his convictions and forceful in his rhetoric; a blog of the same name may be consulted for further reading and development of his thinking in this area.Why Evolution Is True is a serious page-turner. Coyne has a gift for conveying complex ideas and anyone of high-school education should not have trouble following his arguments.Far easier to understand than other overviews like Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, the primary focus is the direct evidence and ever-mounting proof which we have amassed since Darwin's formulation of the theory nearly two centuries ago. If one went into this topic without any knowledge the book would serve as a comprehensive introduction to the topic and its fundamental concepts, though they will miss out on discussion of related issues, e.g. memes and extended phenotype.Coyne makes the commendable decision to anticipate objections to each of his chapters, much like Darwin did in later editions of On the Origin of Species; he knows that evolution is a contested and widely-misunderstood field and that minds tend to be closed to its authenticity. There are some questions that are oft-raised without sufficient answer in the public square: how did the eye form if not by a miracle? Of what use is half a wing to an evolving bird, and how could that possibly be selected for? He tackles these deftly and head-on, giving answers and insight that reflect his depth of knowledge.Near the end of chapter 9 we are given this summary:""Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life’s diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life... Most of us do need meaning, purpose, and moral guidance in our lives. How do we find them if we accept that evolution is the real story of our origin? That question is outside the domain of science.""He then proceeds to dismiss all answers outside of naturalism and materialism outright, which shows the limitations of his view in dialogue with contrasting opinions. Coyne does not attempt to appear as an unbiased explicator of evolutionary theory. This is a minor problem in the scope of the work, and perhaps a deserved one; he could hardly be more vindicated due to the sheer force of evidence for macroevolution. It makes me wonder if a more dispassionate approach could have been helpful. There are, despite his bewilderment, religious people who believe in evolution.He leaves us with a pithy and hopeful quote:""Evolution tells us where we came from, not where we can go.""I would definitely recommend this work to anyone who is curious about the developments in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural and sexual selection. As long as they are open to the evidence and don't mind the occasional sneer from the author, by the end there should be little doubt that evolution is, in fact, true."
164,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6350127-seawood,5,"Read for Coursera ""Writing in the Sciences"" and ""Genetics & Evolution"" courses.Why Evolution Is True is a love-letter to Charles Darwin; an accessible and detailed overview of the current state of evolution research. Each strand of knowledge which contributes to our understanding is laid out clearly, starting in many cases with what Darwin knew or intuited when writing On The Origin Of Species. Coyne deftly takes us through the developments in areas such as the fossil record, embryology, vestigial organs, biogeography and genetics; showing how predictions can be made and how discoveries since Darwin's time have confirmed the process of evolution over and over again. Many eye-catching examples are used to demonstrate where we can expect to find fossils in geological layers; how the bodily organisation of modern creatures follows patterns laid down in ancestral forms; and how environmental pressures lead to adaptation. The example of the modern mammalian laryngeal nerve as poor design derived from ancient forms is particularly striking. The nerve is involved in speech and swallowing and connects the brain to the larynx. It wraps around the aorta (a large vessel in the heart) rather than taking a direct route. This is not an issue for an ancient fishlike creature – but in a human the nerve has to be about a foot in length to follow the same route. In a giraffe, which has the same basic body plan, the nerve is three feet long! This is obviously inefficient and may even be more prone to injury, but clearly shows the laryngeal nerve adapting to follow the evolutionary changes in the body pattern.Coyne also shows how these additions to our knowledge efficiently take down the creationist or “intelligent design” arguments. Whilst he concedes that those arguing from faith will probably not change their minds, the book is very much aimed at people who are uncertain about the science. For European readers, this frequent referencing of creationism is a little grating since it is not such a large issue in this part of the world, but it is understandable when the American audience has a much greater background of “disbelief” in evolution [1].The final chapters are devoted to recent human evolution (from the period following divergence from chimps) and an overview of some of the difficulties people have with the possible implications of evolution for human behaviour. Overall, this is an excellent text for anyone who would like to understand the principles of evolution or update their knowledge, written in an entertaining and engaging style.[1] http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313... – unfortunately this, the original article in Science, is paywalled, but you can see a mirror at http://old.richarddawkins.net/article..., including the table comparing “belief” vs “disbelief” in evolution from 34 countries in 2005.

165,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"I read this book a while back and really enjoyed it. Note: If you are a creationist, you will doubtless NOT enjoy this. If you are an evolutionist, you'll probably be quite pleased with the book. And there's pity. For many, the book won't be read on its merits but for whether it supports or challenges one's views on the issue of Darwinian evolutionary theory.In terms of the book itself. . . . The purpose is specified by Jerry Coyne, the author, on page xiv: ""This book lays out the main lines of evidence for evolution. For those who oppose Darwinism purely as a matter of faith, no amount of evidence will do--theirs is a belief not based on reason. But for the many who find themselves uncertain, or who accept evolution but are not sure how to argue the case, this volume gives a succinct summary of why modern science recognizes evolution as true.""The book unfolds in a straightforward fashion. Chapter 1 summarizes the nature of evolution. He discusses the essence of the concept of evolution--""a species undergoing genetic change over time"" (page 3). Also discussed is ""natural selection,"" the process by which the more ""fit"" individuals tend to be more successful in reproductive terms That is, they leave more offspring than their less fit peers).Subsequent chapters outline the evidence for evolution, including often jury-rigged adaptations (evolution makes do with the organism/species as it exists and often leaves organisms that are poorly designed--but still capable of successful reproduction: think the lower back of humans!), the fossil record, a more detailed discussion of the process of natural selection, the relationship between sex and evolution, how species arise and develop, and--always an issue that excites passion--the relevance of evolution for humankind.The book itself does well what it sets out to do. There are things that bother me. As with many, the author claims that evolution is a ""fact."" I have never understood this allegation. Neo-Darwinian theory is a THEORY--not a fact. Lots of facts support the theory. By itself, though, it is NOT a fact. I think advocates of evolution shoot themselves in the foot with such an argument. Many, of course, would rejoin, ""It's ONLY a theory."" Such folks also don't know what they're talking about. A good theory is a great thing! Not ""just."" Quantum theory is terrific; Einstein's relativity is a fine theory. And so on.All in all, if the reader wants an accessible advocacy of evolutionary theory, this book does the job nicely. If the reader does not accept it, the book, of course, will not be very compelling."
166,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36384001-yousuf,2,"Good Overview, But Contains Straw MenThis is a good summary for the pro-Evolution side if anyone is researching the evolution-creation controversy. It goes through the fossil evidence, genetic evidence, geological evidence, and more for Evolution via natural selection (and other naturalistic processes). The author writes in a clear and logical manner, and generally avoids the confrontational polemics that other writers such as Richard Dawkins are prone to.My main objection is that Coyne uses misrepresentations to attack Intelligent Design (ID). He tries to associate ID with Young Earth Creationism many times, arguing that the two are similar or have similar methods. Nothing could be further from the truth. Pro-ID people are NOT making a deduction from religious scriptures; rather they are analyzing the structure of the cell (such as the information encoded in DNA) and making inferences based on that. You might not agree with their conclusions, but you should not try to smear them in a dishonest way.Another issue that I had was that most of Coyne's objections to ID are ""theological"" in nature. What I mean is that he points to ""flaws"" in organisms and basically states: ""An intelligent designer would have done a better job of this.""But these are theological, not scientific, objections; and they have theological, not scientific, answers. Probably because the Designer made the designs bad on purpose - I dunno, perhaps this world wasn't supposed to be perfect in the first place?He admits that materialist scientists do not have an explanation for the origin of life (OOL) as well as the Cambrian Explosion. But then he brings out the stereotypical ""God-of-the-gaps! God-of-the-gaps!"" argument to rebut ID here... I was literally shaking my head out of disappointment (though I wasn't at all surprised). Also, the response to integrated complexity was vague and didn't make much sense to me.I'm currently reading Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design, which is a pro-ID account of OOL. And I can tell you, it is anything but God-of-the-gaps. The entire argument is based on what we do know in biology, not a gap of any kind.I know the above review sounds harsh, but I actually enjoyed reading this book and I do recommend it to anyone who's interested in evolution or the evolution-creation controversy."

However, if you are undecided and truly interested in learning about the wealth of evidence that supports evolution as, indeed, the way (along with sea cucumbers, lichen, platypuses and blue whales) came to be, this is a wonderful book. Even if you already have a fair working knowledge of the theory (and that's theory in the scientific sense, not in the casual ""it's only a theory"" sense), you'll likely find a lot of new and fascinating details herein.All the classic evidence that you learned in school (if you're my age) is here, along with scads of new evidence in fields like microbiology, geology, paleobotany, and many others. The book avoids jargon except when it's needed in order to be specific, defines unfamiliar terms as it goes, explains how the facts in highly diverse areas support one another, points out the numerous areas where evolution would predict X and in fact science finds X, and generally lays out its case in a comprehensive and coherent manner. Happily, it also does so without either proselytizing or haranguing, leaving the reader to make his or her own decision in evaluating the range of interlocking facts presented. The last chapter discusses why certain religious sects have such difficulty accepting evolution, which was also enlightening and interesting.Highly recommended for the lay reader interested in acquiring a solid overview of the scientific evidence for evolution."

Coyne's Why Evolution Is True is a fine place to start. As his unsubtle title suggests, Coyne's purpose is to banish the arguments of creationists and their intelligent design fellow travelers. Much as Darwin did, he draws upon geology and the fossil record; biogeography, or the distribution of plants and animals; and the similarities and differences among living species. But gaps that once frustrated Darwin, such as so-called ""missing links"" in the fossil record, can now be filled. ... ... he builds a strong case for the fact of evolution, and for Darwin's theory of how it works. (That species change over time isn't theoretical; how and why the changes occur is the subject of ""evolutionary theory."") Coyne addresses many of the common creationist arguments head-on, outlining how complex systems such as eyes and biochemical pathways can evolve by natural selection. To his credit, however, the author acknowledges his strategy's fatal flaw: The refusal to accept evolution has precious little to do with reason, logic or evidence. Like the introductory college courses it too-closely resembles, Why Evolution Is True is packed with facts and clear explanations but is unlikely to change many minds."""

It's sad to think that even on this modern day, we still need books to show what is just actually is. It's always my dream to become an evolutionary anthropologist and by reading this book only ignites that passion more! This is a great book on evolution though some might find it to be dry. But the author has thoroughly described how evolution works and presented - as is the case in scientific literatures - a lot of convincing and irrefutable evidence. One thing I liked is the organization of the chapters where Coyne subtly explained the concepts and applied them first on evolution of ""lesser"" organisms, then on to human evolution. For readers who are honest-seekers, do not discount evolution until you have read this book. And for those who are already convinced, this could be a good weapon against Creationists (Intelligent Design proponents)."

He is a bit more detailed than Coyne, a bit more lucid, and if I may say so, a bit more exciting, even a bit more poetic.Nevertheless, at under 300 pages, Why Evolution Is True is the best short book I've ever read on the subject. The last chapter, about the implications (and lack of implications) of the theory of evolution for our own species, is very good. And Dawkins himself gives the book high praise.Well worth reading."

177,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"To be more precise and clear, the title of the book should be ""why the modern theory of evolution is true."" Changing the title doesn't make a difference to us the believers of the theory (I'll call the theory Darwinism for short), because we usually accept it as a bundle package. But after reading the book, I realize the theory makes multi-level propositions. ""Evolution happened"" is only one of them. Coyne mentions this structure of Darwinism repeatedly, but I think he could make the book stronger by laying it out at the very beginning. In my own words, the theory of evolution proposes the following hierarchy of propositions:1. Evolutionary change (change in inheritable traits of a population through generations) happened. Not only on the micro level (change of traits within a species) but also the macro level (the transformation of one species into another)2. Natural selection explains most of the microevolutionary change, e.g., the change in beak size of birds.3. Natural selection explains most of the macroevolutionary change, e.g., the origin of birds.4. Natural selection builds complex features in nonhuman species, such as the eyes and the brain.5. Natural selection builds complex features of humans, such as language and consciousness.  Some creationists refuse all propositions above. Some admit (1) but refuse to explain it by natural selection. Others accept natural selection only to a certain level. All of them share one common belief: natural selection cannot make us human to be what we are. As a response, Coyne provides ample evidence to support Darwinism. The evidence includes the following: • Species can be classified and grouped in a tree-like way• Discovery of transitional fossils at predicted locations with the expected age.• Features that only make sense by natural selection: vestiges / atavism / dead DNA / Embryo palimpsest / bad design• Distributions of species across the globe, such as how different species fill similar roles in different areas, how certain species lack on volcanic islands but not on continental islands, and the radiations of endemic species on volcanic islands.• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by artificial selection• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by natural selection in labs and fields• Math simulations that exhibit evolutionary paths to complex features under natural selection. An important lesson I learned from Coyne's enumeration of the evidence above, is to treat the following two things differently: 1) the general evolutionary theory, and 2) individual evolutionary explanations of traits and behaviors. Darwin provides us a beautiful theory. It is so simple, yet so powerful. But beauty does not equal truth. Darwinism is generally correct because scientists have accumulated a huge amount of supporting evidence. An individual evolutionary explanation, however, must bear its own burden of proof. We should not blindly believe in a single evolutionary explanation because there are often multiple competing evolutionary explanations of a trait or behavior. Many of them are inevitable ""just-so stories."" Moreover, natural selection is not the only chisel used by nature the sculptor. Features can be generated by other mechanisms, such as genetic drift and sexual selection. I found the hypothesis explaining the existence of human appendix especially interesting: it is possible that natural selection simply can't shrink the appendix anymore, because before it disappears from shrinking, a smaller appendix gives rise to a higher risk of being blocked.  This lesson also applies to economics, another discipline that is guided by a core theory — the rational choice theory. Again, the core theory might be generally correct, but this does not mean it is correct in every context, far from it.  Coyne also reminds me that most evolutionary explanations of complex human features, no matter how elaborate, are untested and probably untestable. This is unfortunate, because the evolution of such features, especially the evolution of consciousness, seems to be the most intriguing question of all. But to quote Darwin, we should not ""positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."" Instead, we should keep searching for testable theories in the future.  Stray observation:- The book solved a big puzzle I had in high school biology class: why human embryos look so weird and go through phases of development that make no sense.- Darwin did not explain the origin of species in his same-titled book (he would explain it in later books and papers). A better title for The Origin of Species, would have been The Origin of Adaptations."

What remains is to probe the finer details of the mechanics and processes underlying it. If Coyne's primary goal in writing this book was to convince Creationists that evolution is true, it remains unfulfilled. The people he's trying to convince are precisely the kind whom no amount of evidence supporting evolution can convince. This book lacks the only thing that can convince Creationists and proponents of Intelligent Design - passages from their holy book of choice, or even better, a direct quote from their god of choice, stating evolution is true. Kidding aside, the sad truth is that it is nigh impossible to fight dogma and deeply entrenched beliefs with logic and evidence. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. This book is the result of one such attempt and it is a brilliant one at that. Kudos to Coyne for fighting the good fight. Unless you're the kind of person who relies exclusively on made-up stories from stale, antiquated texts for moral guidance and laws of the natural world, you probably already know evolution is true, or rather, that it is the best explanation we have so far for the origin of life on this planet; and I'm fairly sure you will find this book insightful and enjoyable. The book is full of interesting facts and observations that unequivocally prove that evolution is a scientific fact. Topics that are covered include discovery of fossils, particularly of intermediates; speciation and biogeography; vestigial traits and organs that along with emryology provide a window into the past; genetic drift as an alternative (although minor) engine of evolution besides Darwinian natural selection; the powers of sexual selection; and lastly, the origin of of our own species along with a brief but useful discussion on the dicey issue of race. Along with a historical overview, Coyne also details recent evidence (last three decades) supporting evolution and advances made in paleontology, molecular and evolutionary biology, and a few other fields, which I found very helpful. At one time or another, I'm sure most of us have wondered, ""Now that the pressures of natural selection are largely absent in most human societies, are we still evolving? If so, in what ways?"" I found the beginnings of an answer to this in the penultimate chapter.The crisp, clear, and no-nonsense writing style makes digesting this information-rich book painless. Coyne has also provided handy notes clarifying certain ideas, pointing out opposing viewpoints, and lisiting resources for those interested in exploring a topic further. Several of the books he has mentioned have found their way into my to to-read list.This is a cogent synthesis of facts about evolution and of coherent arguments in its favor. Not only does it satiate your curiosity and expand your mind but it also arms you with knowledge for those uncomfortable engagements with staunch Creationsists. Highly recommended!"
179,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"The title of this book bluntly states its purpose, which is to refute, head on, the claims advanced by creationists and supporters of intelligent design that evolution by natural selection cannot possibly explain how life takes the many forms that it does. Biologist Jerry Coyne convincingly addresses every conceivable argument that could be made against evolution, using numerous examples to explain how life as it exists today must have arisen through evolution. To this end, he covers evidence from:- Fossils and biogeography.- Vestigial organs (eg, our appendix). - Vestigial genes. We have around 2,000 that no longer work because evolution rendered them unnecessary. An example is our gene for the final step in the biosynthesis of vitamin C which became non-functional after we started to consume this essential substance in our diet.- Atavisms (eg, our coccyx). - Embryonic development, where the early embryos of most vertebrates bear a striking resemblance to one another. The human embryo, for example, starts looking like that of a jawless fish, before becoming reptilian, and then mammalian. - Bad design, such as the asymmetric structure of flat, side-swimming fish, such as Dover sole, or the convoluted route taken in mammals by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which covers about 15 feet in the giraffe, to join two points just one foot apart).As Coyne points out, no supreme being would have created these oddities and imperfections unless it was that being’s intention to deceive us into believing they were the outcome of evolution, which seems extremely implausible. This is not a textbook on evolution, so its purpose is not to teach the underlying principles. The reader needs to look elsewhere for detailed explanations of genetics, genomes, DNA, inheritance, population growth, genetic drift, etc, but this is the ideal book for anyone who is open-mindedly sitting on the fence, unsure as to whether or not life arose through evolution, creation or intelligent design. Coyne’s arguments are very compelling although, as he admits, “evolution raises such profound questions of purpose, morality, and meaning that [some people] just can’t accept it no matter how much evidence they see”. He illustrates this point by referring to a talk on evolution he gave in Chicago to a group of businessmen. Afterwards, he was approached by one of the delegates who said, “I found your evidence for evolution very convincing—but I still don’t believe it”."
180,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"I hesitated before buying this book because I was a little put off by the title. I already assumed evolution was ""true"" (as much as any scientific knowledge can be considered ""the truth""), and I was more interested in knowing how it works, and the history of it all, from the first micro-organisms to now. The ""how"" part is covered pretty well, and by covering the ""how"" the author addresses creationist or ""intelligent design"" arguments and provides a clear, rational, and most importantly scientific answer. To be fair, the idea of natural selection and evolution seems simple enough, but how it leads to complex devices like an eyeball seems inexplicable... until it is explained. The creationist arguments are all fair, in the sense that they are perfectly valid questions to ask- until they are answered. But a perfectly valid question isn't the same as a valid objection. The book does a very good job at answering questions and debunking creationist objections in the process of explaining how evolution works, although this isn't the main focus of the book. At points along the way the author pauses to address a creationist objection- debunks it- and moves right along. And its done with such convincing ease that by the end the question is not ""How could evolution be true?"" but ""How could it be otherwise?""I don't think this book will change a creationist's mind, because if mere logical, rational, scientific explanations were all it took, creationism (an appeal to the supernatural rather than the natural) wouldn't exist in the first place. But I don't think that was the intent with this book. The book's title isn't ""Why creationism is wrong."" There is no point in arguing with a creationist whose faith feels threatened by science. If somebody isn't threatened by science then ""more science"" isn't going to change anything. But for the rest of us, laypeople who occasionally hear a creationist argument and think ""Oh, well that seems like a good point, I wonder how Darwanism answers that?"" the answers are here. And eventually, by the end of the book, with a good understanding of how darwanism works, any creationist question no longer seems like a good question- but more of an admission of ""I don't understand how this works.""There is nothing wrong with the statement ""I don't understand how this works"" as long as it is not followed with ""Therefore it can not be true."" Is it any better than saying ""I don't understand how this works, but I'll assume it's true""? No- unless that statement is followed by ""Because I understand the method by which this conclusion was reached."" If you understand the scientific method and think that observation, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, and comparison are really good ways to arrive at a conclusion about something then you will readily accept conclusions reached by those methods without knowing the details. So by understanding and accepting this method as a valid way to understand the world, it is perfectly reasonable to accept knowledge as being ""true"" that was achieved using these methods.You can't, however, argue one way or the other for something without knowing anything about it. I believed evolution to be true because I trusted the method by which the theory was developed, but I wanted to be able to understand the theory itself, and this book did a great job of it.One final note. The author did a great job at addressing the ""Just a theory"" argument. It isn't ""just a theory"", but a ""scientific theory"" which is completely different than ""a random guess with no way of testing it"". There is no point arguing it in a book review. Suffice to say the book spells it out and does a great job. Enough so that I underlined the entire thing.If you want to understand Darwinism, don't be put off by the title. By the end of the book you will understand how it works. The books isn't a defense of the theory but an explanation that is so thorough that it defends itself.I subtracted one star because I wish there was a little more about the timeline of evolution and the different eras of the earth's history. Another chapter would have been nice. "
181,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1643812-andrew,2,"Once again a great scientific mind has stooped to the lowest common denominator; mindlessly bickering with the creationist argument. I was expecting evolution/creationist argument in the preface, maybe even in the first chapter. Unfortunately, It's littered throughout the book. I understand that some readers actually enjoy this mindless drubbing, if so, this book is for you. What I was hoping for was a deeper biological understanding of speciation and specialization, and to Coyne's credit there are anecdotes littered throughout. Sadly, Those anecdotes are merely a way for Coyne to stick out his tongue and say ""I told you so, dummy"", they offer little new insights to those with a baseline understanding of biology. If you like Dawkins,you'll like Coyne, and If you like both I offer some simple advice. Grow up, and read a book with some scientific teeth. I recommend Stephen Jay Gould. If you are like me and are interested in speciation and specialization, I recommend skipping this book, and watching Coyne's lecture. It's a condensed version of the book, that skips all the bickering, and gets right down to the good stuff: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1m4mA... "

I can't imagine how hard it is to summarize a topic as voluminous as evolution into 230 pages.Without a doubt, evolution is complicated. It is one of the most misunderstood facts, and definitely the most viciously attacked. Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of explaining some of the basic tenets of evolution to the reader in a very succinct way. It is a breath taking read; this book needs to be read more than once. If only those who are so adamant about ID would crack open this book! Evolution is a beautiful mess. But, the fact that of all the species and of all mutations over billions of years, we are the only ones who have been awarded reason and a complex brain- that, to me, is far more meaningful and beautiful than to think someone created us and ""blessed us"" with it. We managed to become who we are, through billions of years of genetic fight. We are special, and we are here. Wow. Do we really need to believe in miracles when science gives us something this mind blowing?!"

184,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3547378-benjamin,5,"This book is a well-structured argument that the process of evolution has occurred and does occur. The author has a remarkably humble tone as he describes both the assertive truth of evolution as well as the ongoing process of unfinished learning of science (e.g., the study of biogenesis, the beginning of the universe, evolutionary psychology, evolution's inability to stand alone as an ethical/moral system, etc.). I believe that this book was well worth the time to read.Evolution can by no means explain everything about the world around us, but contrary to the opinions of many creationists/ID advocates, it does not presume to. This is the essence of science: the search for knowledge rather than the presumption of it.Why Evolution is True is an excellent popular treatise of evolution because it makes clear these points, and is honest about the shortcomings (both real and imagined) of modern evolutionary theory. Do yourself a service and read it!"

Dan Shectman won the noble prize for chemistry. He battled against established science for years. Lost jobs and told he was stupid.

189,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,4,"Let me tell you a little story.In high school, I was taught science from a ""Creationist"" perspective. I did who-knows-how-many research projects and papers on ""Creation versus Evolution"". I became pretty knowledgeable about the subject (or so I thought). I owned a tome titled ""Science vs Evolution"", a graduation present from my biology teacher, and could give all the talking points on why Darwinism was false.Fast forward a number of years. I can't pinpoint the moment when my perspective changed. I think it started with a nagging suspicion that, despite all the Creationist videos I had watched and the articles I had read, I had never truly, actually heard the argument for evolution from evolutionary scientists themselves, and only knew the distorted interpretations of their arguments from their ""critics"".I changed my mind, ultimately, not because of a wealth of scientific rebuttals to combat every objection of Intelligent Design advocates. It came down to a simple matter of logic.That logic is this: The theory of evolution came about from the scientific process. Predictions are made, evidence is gathered, and conclusions are drawn. At every turn, for more than a century, the assumptions about evolution have been rigorously questioned, challenged, and tested under scientific scrutiny.And throughout this process, the theory of evolution has not only survived, but become stronger and more deeply understood. And it is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists.Contrast this with the idea of Intelligent Design, or Creationism. This concept does not start with predictions that can be completely questioned or re-thought at any moment; it cannot flexibly follow the evidence, wherever it leads.Creationism begins with a conclusion, and seeks evidence to support that conclusion.In other words, the theory of evolution is scientific. Creationism is not.I had become convinced of evolution from a logical perspective, but I still did not understand it. I did not have the high school education most people get on the subject. I still had all those talking points from Answers in Genesis that I knew were false, but didn't have responses for.This book, Why Evolution is True, became the perfect answer to my needs. Coyne lays out the mechanisms of and evidence for evolution in very easy-to-understand, eye-opening terms that the average, non-scientific reader can absorb and enjoy.It's also relatively short (not a difficult read), while still astonishingly robust in the power of its evidence and strength of its arguments.I came to this book already convinced of evolution; I came way fully understanding it (for the first time), and EXCITED about its awesomeness. Seriously, evolution is... REALLY COOL???I'm greatly appreciative of the author for writing this, and helping me to fill a gap in my knowledge... while also helping me discovery the pure joy and wonder that comes with knowing our origins.Buuuuuuut... he does get one tiny star bumped off, and this is for purely opinionated reasons, but in his discussions of gender he sometimes lapsed into what I can only call ""male arrogance"". The way he talked about men and women just grated on my nerves. Not what he said was untrue or anything, just written in an annoying way that felt way too comfortable with male superiority. My objection is completely non-intellectual and subjective, but hey! This is my review! I can give whatever stars I wanted!In all seriousness, this book is amazing. It will doubtlessly be my default recommendation for fence-sitters, skeptics, and other people who lacked an honest education in the fact of evolution like I did."
190,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81496242-sakshi-sinha,5,"This book is a compelling read. Learning about evolution, the process and time that goes into this makes you just respect and admire our environment and animals even more. -Firstly, Coyne discusses about creationism and evolution. He often includes antidotes throughout the book. Its so unbelievable that there are people out there who don’t believe in evolution!!There are references from Darwin’s book “The Origin”, other authors and scientists who have worked in this field. Introducing different viewpoints to us. -Then it continues with Coyne explaining different theories and concepts of evolution. This isn’t much of a rocket science. It just requires basic comprehension of species and biology and I think it’s pretty easy to grip on. -Along with facts and views, Coyne mentions alot of studies conducted on fossils and how they helped in grouping and combining the story of evolution. It’s really an engaging study and this has actually amplified my interest in fossils.-In addition to this the author addresses evolution in different aspects of wildlife such as in aquatic animals, birds, mammals etc. Coyne also describes at length natural selection , vestigial organs, genetics etc.-Altogether the book is filled with engrossing examples and it’s so amusing. There are images for references which make it easier to interpret description the author provides. -lastly, I do have a suggestion, Coyne mentions various kinds of animals, insects, birds, and not all of them have a visual representation in the book. I suggest you use google to understand their anatomy and explore various journals or articles. It might take extra time but I think this just adds another layer of knowledge to the read. This book really is an eye opener. Overall brilliant book! I would recommend it:) "
191,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25797445-eugene,5,"Why Evolution is True is a very interesting and thought provoking read. Detailed yet written for the lay person, Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of clearly laying out the evidence for Darwinian evolution from a common ancestor and why it is unanimously accepted by all scientists not already predisposed to creationism. From the fossil record and DNA sequencing to continental drift and speciation, he not only lays out the multiple lines of evidence but also shows the countless predictions that have been made using the evolutionary model, and counters each example by explaining how creationism fails these predictions and doesn't yield what we would expect to find were it the case. I have a very limited scientific background, but had no trouble understanding most of the book. On top of arguing the scientific evidence, he also does well at addressing common social and moral objections to evolution. The last chapter describes how contrary to popular (usually creationist) belief, evolution properly understood does not lend itself to racism. Races evolved to adapt better to various environments as branches spreading out on the evolutionary tree, and there is nothing to suggest any sort of racial superiority. Likewise Coyne debunks the popular but misguided argument that believing evolution will make people lose all sense of morality. Quite contrary, the more we learn about how our social behaviours evolved and how our brains developed to comprehend all these questions, the more we can appreciate the value of our lives. My only contention is how he subtly seems to slip in his anti-theist presupposition toward the end by saying appeal to the supernatural is not necessary when discussing origins. It may not be necessary, but it would be more accurate to say science and the God debate fall under seperate, non overlapping categories as one deals purely in falsifiable claims while the other does not. That being said, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious to learn more about evolution and its implications written in a very matter of fact, unbiased way."

So why, when evolution is being reconfirmed every day, and forms the backbone of modern biology, do we need a book entitled Why Evolution Is True?""It's just as the description above has said, the evidence that supporting Evolution is enormous, starting from the first life on Earth until the evolution of Homo-sapiens. Every single life is just as Darwin had predicted, you won't find a fossil that exists in the Cambrian Age in the Precambrian Age and vice versa. In fact Evolution declared a bet as the evolutionist Richard Dawkins said: ""To those who has doubts about Evolution to scratch hardly in the Rocks to find an unsuitable fossil, we challenge them to that, will they accept the bet?"" In ""Why Evolution Is True"", Jerry A Coyne takes us to a journey in the Wonders of Natural Selection. He started with what a scientific theory means and then he goes on to explain the endless evidence of evolution and connecting it with everything around us, ""Some claim that evolution is just a theory, as if it were merely an opinion. But evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact. Evolution really happened. Accepting our kinship with all life on Earth is not only solid science ... in my view it's also a soaring spiritual experience."" –Neil deGrasse TysonYour body is a proof of multiple enhancing processes that have been done over millions of years starting from your individual cells to genes to last nerve in your Brain, for example the way human born is one of the best examples that we are descending from birds, by time the human evolved the way of giving birth doesn't change, the body of the baby turned upside down and the head of the baby (which becomes significantly bigger than that of our ancestors) faced the entrance of the womb, here we have to say isn't it ridiculous for God to do something like that, I mean why would He even blueprint-ed (or design) us with something very painful and can threatened the life of the mother just to prove something nothing than His sadistic nature of enjoying the screams of the mothers. Then he talked about Mutation and how it was at first the stick that Creationists wave on the face of Evolutionists every time they started a debate, he also mentioned and shed some lights on Linski's magnificent experiment on E-coli Bacteria which took 20 years and opened the gate in front of us to witness that ""Natural Selection + Mutations + Time = Darwin was Right""After that he talked about neuroscience and that evolution also has the ability to describe Morals and that Morals are not something comes up with Religion, it's something far more than that, it's something we might inherited it but mostly we gain it by practicing (eg: The Chimpanzees experiment). Jerry also explained that evolution doesn't necessarily mean to evolve into something more sophisticated, there's also a ""Redox Evolution"" which for example the evolution of Whales from Reptiles. I know I haven't wrote much and I won't, coz if you want to know something you have to dig for it, but what I'm totally convinced about is that the evidence evolution provides are stronger, reliable and more scientific than the Ideal Design provides, and that the idea of us coming from Adam and Eve is nothing but a Myth. It's not my words it's what science told us with EVIDENCE. It's as Carl Sagan said: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” – Cosmos."

But I can at least try to dispel the misconceptions that frighten people away from evolution and from the amazing derivation of life’s staggering diversity from a single naked replicating molecule.""Such is the writing style of Jerry Coyne, an accessible and well-versed author and research professor of evolutionary biology. This landmark work should have staying power in the annals of popular science, though it is lacking in philosophical nuance and subtlety. It is not intended to be a textbook for academics but rather a treatise to persuade anyone without a background in the subject. He is strong in his convictions and forceful in his rhetoric; a blog of the same name may be consulted for further reading and development of his thinking in this area.Why Evolution Is True is a serious page-turner. Coyne has a gift for conveying complex ideas and anyone of high-school education should not have trouble following his arguments.Far easier to understand than other overviews like Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, the primary focus is the direct evidence and ever-mounting proof which we have amassed since Darwin's formulation of the theory nearly two centuries ago. If one went into this topic without any knowledge the book would serve as a comprehensive introduction to the topic and its fundamental concepts, though they will miss out on discussion of related issues, e.g. memes and extended phenotype.Coyne makes the commendable decision to anticipate objections to each of his chapters, much like Darwin did in later editions of On the Origin of Species; he knows that evolution is a contested and widely-misunderstood field and that minds tend to be closed to its authenticity. There are some questions that are oft-raised without sufficient answer in the public square: how did the eye form if not by a miracle? Of what use is half a wing to an evolving bird, and how could that possibly be selected for? He tackles these deftly and head-on, giving answers and insight that reflect his depth of knowledge.Near the end of chapter 9 we are given this summary:""Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life’s diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life... Most of us do need meaning, purpose, and moral guidance in our lives. How do we find them if we accept that evolution is the real story of our origin? That question is outside the domain of science.""He then proceeds to dismiss all answers outside of naturalism and materialism outright, which shows the limitations of his view in dialogue with contrasting opinions. Coyne does not attempt to appear as an unbiased explicator of evolutionary theory. This is a minor problem in the scope of the work, and perhaps a deserved one; he could hardly be more vindicated due to the sheer force of evidence for macroevolution. It makes me wonder if a more dispassionate approach could have been helpful. There are, despite his bewilderment, religious people who believe in evolution.He leaves us with a pithy and hopeful quote:""Evolution tells us where we came from, not where we can go.""I would definitely recommend this work to anyone who is curious about the developments in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural and sexual selection. As long as they are open to the evidence and don't mind the occasional sneer from the author, by the end there should be little doubt that evolution is, in fact, true."

Each strand of knowledge which contributes to our understanding is laid out clearly, starting in many cases with what Darwin knew or intuited when writing On The Origin Of Species. Coyne deftly takes us through the developments in areas such as the fossil record, embryology, vestigial organs, biogeography and genetics; showing how predictions can be made and how discoveries since Darwin's time have confirmed the process of evolution over and over again. Many eye-catching examples are used to demonstrate where we can expect to find fossils in geological layers; how the bodily organisation of modern creatures follows patterns laid down in ancestral forms; and how environmental pressures lead to adaptation. The example of the modern mammalian laryngeal nerve as poor design derived from ancient forms is particularly striking. The nerve is involved in speech and swallowing and connects the brain to the larynx. It wraps around the aorta (a large vessel in the heart) rather than taking a direct route. This is not an issue for an ancient fishlike creature – but in a human the nerve has to be about a foot in length to follow the same route. In a giraffe, which has the same basic body plan, the nerve is three feet long! This is obviously inefficient and may even be more prone to injury, but clearly shows the laryngeal nerve adapting to follow the evolutionary changes in the body pattern.Coyne also shows how these additions to our knowledge efficiently take down the creationist or “intelligent design” arguments. Whilst he concedes that those arguing from faith will probably not change their minds, the book is very much aimed at people who are uncertain about the science. For European readers, this frequent referencing of creationism is a little grating since it is not such a large issue in this part of the world, but it is understandable when the American audience has a much greater background of “disbelief” in evolution [1].The final chapters are devoted to recent human evolution (from the period following divergence from chimps) and an overview of some of the difficulties people have with the possible implications of evolution for human behaviour. Overall, this is an excellent text for anyone who would like to understand the principles of evolution or update their knowledge, written in an entertaining and engaging style.[1] http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313... – unfortunately this, the original article in Science, is paywalled, but you can see a mirror at http://old.richarddawkins.net/article..., including the table comparing “belief” vs “disbelief” in evolution from 34 countries in 2005.

If you are an evolutionist, you'll probably be quite pleased with the book. And there's pity. For many, the book won't be read on its merits but for whether it supports or challenges one's views on the issue of Darwinian evolutionary theory.In terms of the book itself. . . . The purpose is specified by Jerry Coyne, the author, on page xiv: ""This book lays out the main lines of evidence for evolution. For those who oppose Darwinism purely as a matter of faith, no amount of evidence will do--theirs is a belief not based on reason. But for the many who find themselves uncertain, or who accept evolution but are not sure how to argue the case, this volume gives a succinct summary of why modern science recognizes evolution as true.""The book unfolds in a straightforward fashion. Chapter 1 summarizes the nature of evolution. He discusses the essence of the concept of evolution--""a species undergoing genetic change over time"" (page 3). Also discussed is ""natural selection,"" the process by which the more ""fit"" individuals tend to be more successful in reproductive terms That is, they leave more offspring than their less fit peers).Subsequent chapters outline the evidence for evolution, including often jury-rigged adaptations (evolution makes do with the organism/species as it exists and often leaves organisms that are poorly designed--but still capable of successful reproduction: think the lower back of humans!), the fossil record, a more detailed discussion of the process of natural selection, the relationship between sex and evolution, how species arise and develop, and--always an issue that excites passion--the relevance of evolution for humankind.The book itself does well what it sets out to do. There are things that bother me. As with many, the author claims that evolution is a ""fact."" I have never understood this allegation. Neo-Darwinian theory is a THEORY--not a fact. Lots of facts support the theory. By itself, though, it is NOT a fact. I think advocates of evolution shoot themselves in the foot with such an argument. Many, of course, would rejoin, ""It's ONLY a theory."" Such folks also don't know what they're talking about. A good theory is a great thing! Not ""just."" Quantum theory is terrific; Einstein's relativity is a fine theory. And so on.All in all, if the reader wants an accessible advocacy of evolutionary theory, this book does the job nicely. If the reader does not accept it, the book, of course, will not be very compelling."
196,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36384001-yousuf,2,"Good Overview, But Contains Straw MenThis is a good summary for the pro-Evolution side if anyone is researching the evolution-creation controversy. It goes through the fossil evidence, genetic evidence, geological evidence, and more for Evolution via natural selection (and other naturalistic processes). The author writes in a clear and logical manner, and generally avoids the confrontational polemics that other writers such as Richard Dawkins are prone to.My main objection is that Coyne uses misrepresentations to attack Intelligent Design (ID). He tries to associate ID with Young Earth Creationism many times, arguing that the two are similar or have similar methods. Nothing could be further from the truth. Pro-ID people are NOT making a deduction from religious scriptures; rather they are analyzing the structure of the cell (such as the information encoded in DNA) and making inferences based on that. You might not agree with their conclusions, but you should not try to smear them in a dishonest way.Another issue that I had was that most of Coyne's objections to ID are ""theological"" in nature. What I mean is that he points to ""flaws"" in organisms and basically states: ""An intelligent designer would have done a better job of this.""But these are theological, not scientific, objections; and they have theological, not scientific, answers. Probably because the Designer made the designs bad on purpose - I dunno, perhaps this world wasn't supposed to be perfect in the first place?He admits that materialist scientists do not have an explanation for the origin of life (OOL) as well as the Cambrian Explosion. But then he brings out the stereotypical ""God-of-the-gaps! God-of-the-gaps!"" argument to rebut ID here... I was literally shaking my head out of disappointment (though I wasn't at all surprised). Also, the response to integrated complexity was vague and didn't make much sense to me.I'm currently reading Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design, which is a pro-ID account of OOL. And I can tell you, it is anything but God-of-the-gaps. The entire argument is based on what we do know in biology, not a gap of any kind.I know the above review sounds harsh, but I actually enjoyed reading this book and I do recommend it to anyone who's interested in evolution or the evolution-creation controversy."

However, if you are undecided and truly interested in learning about the wealth of evidence that supports evolution as, indeed, the way (along with sea cucumbers, lichen, platypuses and blue whales) came to be, this is a wonderful book. Even if you already have a fair working knowledge of the theory (and that's theory in the scientific sense, not in the casual ""it's only a theory"" sense), you'll likely find a lot of new and fascinating details herein.All the classic evidence that you learned in school (if you're my age) is here, along with scads of new evidence in fields like microbiology, geology, paleobotany, and many others. The book avoids jargon except when it's needed in order to be specific, defines unfamiliar terms as it goes, explains how the facts in highly diverse areas support one another, points out the numerous areas where evolution would predict X and in fact science finds X, and generally lays out its case in a comprehensive and coherent manner. Happily, it also does so without either proselytizing or haranguing, leaving the reader to make his or her own decision in evaluating the range of interlocking facts presented. The last chapter discusses why certain religious sects have such difficulty accepting evolution, which was also enlightening and interesting.Highly recommended for the lay reader interested in acquiring a solid overview of the scientific evidence for evolution."

Coyne's Why Evolution Is True is a fine place to start. As his unsubtle title suggests, Coyne's purpose is to banish the arguments of creationists and their intelligent design fellow travelers. Much as Darwin did, he draws upon geology and the fossil record; biogeography, or the distribution of plants and animals; and the similarities and differences among living species. But gaps that once frustrated Darwin, such as so-called ""missing links"" in the fossil record, can now be filled. ... ... he builds a strong case for the fact of evolution, and for Darwin's theory of how it works. (That species change over time isn't theoretical; how and why the changes occur is the subject of ""evolutionary theory."") Coyne addresses many of the common creationist arguments head-on, outlining how complex systems such as eyes and biochemical pathways can evolve by natural selection. To his credit, however, the author acknowledges his strategy's fatal flaw: The refusal to accept evolution has precious little to do with reason, logic or evidence. Like the introductory college courses it too-closely resembles, Why Evolution Is True is packed with facts and clear explanations but is unlikely to change many minds."""
199,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59370311-gerald-di-o,4,"The title of the book is akin to ""Why Gravity Is True"" or ""Why Existence Of Atoms Is True"". It's sad to think that even on this modern day, we still need books to show what is just actually is. It's always my dream to become an evolutionary anthropologist and by reading this book only ignites that passion more! This is a great book on evolution though some might find it to be dry. But the author has thoroughly described how evolution works and presented - as is the case in scientific literatures - a lot of convincing and irrefutable evidence. One thing I liked is the organization of the chapters where Coyne subtly explained the concepts and applied them first on evolution of ""lesser"" organisms, then on to human evolution. For readers who are honest-seekers, do not discount evolution until you have read this book. And for those who are already convinced, this could be a good weapon against Creationists (Intelligent Design proponents)."
200,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6019621-willard-brickey,4,"Richard Dawkins has set the bar very high for books about evolution for the layman. The Blind Watchmaker and The Ancestor's Tale are the best books of this genre I have ever read. He is a bit more detailed than Coyne, a bit more lucid, and if I may say so, a bit more exciting, even a bit more poetic.Nevertheless, at under 300 pages, Why Evolution Is True is the best short book I've ever read on the subject. The last chapter, about the implications (and lack of implications) of the theory of evolution for our own species, is very good. And Dawkins himself gives the book high praise.Well worth reading."
201,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/596234-rashid,5,"One can only think of the words of Richard Dawkins, quoted in the book, where he says “after sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet, sparkling with colour, bountiful with life. Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isn’t it a noble, an enlighten way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it? This is how I answer when I’m asked - as I am surprisingly often - why I bother to get up in the mornings.” This book helps in its short and concise manner lay the argument for evolution, helping us understand our place in the intricacies of this marvellous world."

206,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42147710-michael-shore,5,Coyne nailed it. A fantastic summary of the basic concepts and evidence for evolution.
207,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"To be more precise and clear, the title of the book should be ""why the modern theory of evolution is true."" Changing the title doesn't make a difference to us the believers of the theory (I'll call the theory Darwinism for short), because we usually accept it as a bundle package. But after reading the book, I realize the theory makes multi-level propositions. ""Evolution happened"" is only one of them. Coyne mentions this structure of Darwinism repeatedly, but I think he could make the book stronger by laying it out at the very beginning. In my own words, the theory of evolution proposes the following hierarchy of propositions:1. Evolutionary change (change in inheritable traits of a population through generations) happened. Not only on the micro level (change of traits within a species) but also the macro level (the transformation of one species into another)2. Natural selection explains most of the microevolutionary change, e.g., the change in beak size of birds.3. Natural selection explains most of the macroevolutionary change, e.g., the origin of birds.4. Natural selection builds complex features in nonhuman species, such as the eyes and the brain.5. Natural selection builds complex features of humans, such as language and consciousness.  Some creationists refuse all propositions above. Some admit (1) but refuse to explain it by natural selection. Others accept natural selection only to a certain level. All of them share one common belief: natural selection cannot make us human to be what we are. As a response, Coyne provides ample evidence to support Darwinism. The evidence includes the following: • Species can be classified and grouped in a tree-like way• Discovery of transitional fossils at predicted locations with the expected age.• Features that only make sense by natural selection: vestiges / atavism / dead DNA / Embryo palimpsest / bad design• Distributions of species across the globe, such as how different species fill similar roles in different areas, how certain species lack on volcanic islands but not on continental islands, and the radiations of endemic species on volcanic islands.• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by artificial selection• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by natural selection in labs and fields• Math simulations that exhibit evolutionary paths to complex features under natural selection. An important lesson I learned from Coyne's enumeration of the evidence above, is to treat the following two things differently: 1) the general evolutionary theory, and 2) individual evolutionary explanations of traits and behaviors. Darwin provides us a beautiful theory. It is so simple, yet so powerful. But beauty does not equal truth. Darwinism is generally correct because scientists have accumulated a huge amount of supporting evidence. An individual evolutionary explanation, however, must bear its own burden of proof. We should not blindly believe in a single evolutionary explanation because there are often multiple competing evolutionary explanations of a trait or behavior. Many of them are inevitable ""just-so stories."" Moreover, natural selection is not the only chisel used by nature the sculptor. Features can be generated by other mechanisms, such as genetic drift and sexual selection. I found the hypothesis explaining the existence of human appendix especially interesting: it is possible that natural selection simply can't shrink the appendix anymore, because before it disappears from shrinking, a smaller appendix gives rise to a higher risk of being blocked.  This lesson also applies to economics, another discipline that is guided by a core theory — the rational choice theory. Again, the core theory might be generally correct, but this does not mean it is correct in every context, far from it.  Coyne also reminds me that most evolutionary explanations of complex human features, no matter how elaborate, are untested and probably untestable. This is unfortunate, because the evolution of such features, especially the evolution of consciousness, seems to be the most intriguing question of all. But to quote Darwin, we should not ""positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."" Instead, we should keep searching for testable theories in the future.  Stray observation:- The book solved a big puzzle I had in high school biology class: why human embryos look so weird and go through phases of development that make no sense.- Darwin did not explain the origin of species in his same-titled book (he would explain it in later books and papers). A better title for The Origin of Species, would have been The Origin of Adaptations."
208,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23258105-dileep-n,5,"tl;dr Evolution is true. The big picture is indisputably clear. What remains is to probe the finer details of the mechanics and processes underlying it. If Coyne's primary goal in writing this book was to convince Creationists that evolution is true, it remains unfulfilled. The people he's trying to convince are precisely the kind whom no amount of evidence supporting evolution can convince. This book lacks the only thing that can convince Creationists and proponents of Intelligent Design - passages from their holy book of choice, or even better, a direct quote from their god of choice, stating evolution is true. Kidding aside, the sad truth is that it is nigh impossible to fight dogma and deeply entrenched beliefs with logic and evidence. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. This book is the result of one such attempt and it is a brilliant one at that. Kudos to Coyne for fighting the good fight. Unless you're the kind of person who relies exclusively on made-up stories from stale, antiquated texts for moral guidance and laws of the natural world, you probably already know evolution is true, or rather, that it is the best explanation we have so far for the origin of life on this planet; and I'm fairly sure you will find this book insightful and enjoyable. The book is full of interesting facts and observations that unequivocally prove that evolution is a scientific fact. Topics that are covered include discovery of fossils, particularly of intermediates; speciation and biogeography; vestigial traits and organs that along with emryology provide a window into the past; genetic drift as an alternative (although minor) engine of evolution besides Darwinian natural selection; the powers of sexual selection; and lastly, the origin of of our own species along with a brief but useful discussion on the dicey issue of race. Along with a historical overview, Coyne also details recent evidence (last three decades) supporting evolution and advances made in paleontology, molecular and evolutionary biology, and a few other fields, which I found very helpful. At one time or another, I'm sure most of us have wondered, ""Now that the pressures of natural selection are largely absent in most human societies, are we still evolving? If so, in what ways?"" I found the beginnings of an answer to this in the penultimate chapter.The crisp, clear, and no-nonsense writing style makes digesting this information-rich book painless. Coyne has also provided handy notes clarifying certain ideas, pointing out opposing viewpoints, and lisiting resources for those interested in exploring a topic further. Several of the books he has mentioned have found their way into my to to-read list.This is a cogent synthesis of facts about evolution and of coherent arguments in its favor. Not only does it satiate your curiosity and expand your mind but it also arms you with knowledge for those uncomfortable engagements with staunch Creationsists. Highly recommended!"
209,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"The title of this book bluntly states its purpose, which is to refute, head on, the claims advanced by creationists and supporters of intelligent design that evolution by natural selection cannot possibly explain how life takes the many forms that it does. Biologist Jerry Coyne convincingly addresses every conceivable argument that could be made against evolution, using numerous examples to explain how life as it exists today must have arisen through evolution. To this end, he covers evidence from:- Fossils and biogeography.- Vestigial organs (eg, our appendix). - Vestigial genes. We have around 2,000 that no longer work because evolution rendered them unnecessary. An example is our gene for the final step in the biosynthesis of vitamin C which became non-functional after we started to consume this essential substance in our diet.- Atavisms (eg, our coccyx). - Embryonic development, where the early embryos of most vertebrates bear a striking resemblance to one another. The human embryo, for example, starts looking like that of a jawless fish, before becoming reptilian, and then mammalian. - Bad design, such as the asymmetric structure of flat, side-swimming fish, such as Dover sole, or the convoluted route taken in mammals by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which covers about 15 feet in the giraffe, to join two points just one foot apart).As Coyne points out, no supreme being would have created these oddities and imperfections unless it was that being’s intention to deceive us into believing they were the outcome of evolution, which seems extremely implausible. This is not a textbook on evolution, so its purpose is not to teach the underlying principles. The reader needs to look elsewhere for detailed explanations of genetics, genomes, DNA, inheritance, population growth, genetic drift, etc, but this is the ideal book for anyone who is open-mindedly sitting on the fence, unsure as to whether or not life arose through evolution, creation or intelligent design. Coyne’s arguments are very compelling although, as he admits, “evolution raises such profound questions of purpose, morality, and meaning that [some people] just can’t accept it no matter how much evidence they see”. He illustrates this point by referring to a talk on evolution he gave in Chicago to a group of businessmen. Afterwards, he was approached by one of the delegates who said, “I found your evidence for evolution very convincing—but I still don’t believe it”."
210,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"I hesitated before buying this book because I was a little put off by the title. I already assumed evolution was ""true"" (as much as any scientific knowledge can be considered ""the truth""), and I was more interested in knowing how it works, and the history of it all, from the first micro-organisms to now. The ""how"" part is covered pretty well, and by covering the ""how"" the author addresses creationist or ""intelligent design"" arguments and provides a clear, rational, and most importantly scientific answer. To be fair, the idea of natural selection and evolution seems simple enough, but how it leads to complex devices like an eyeball seems inexplicable... until it is explained. The creationist arguments are all fair, in the sense that they are perfectly valid questions to ask- until they are answered. But a perfectly valid question isn't the same as a valid objection. The book does a very good job at answering questions and debunking creationist objections in the process of explaining how evolution works, although this isn't the main focus of the book. At points along the way the author pauses to address a creationist objection- debunks it- and moves right along. And its done with such convincing ease that by the end the question is not ""How could evolution be true?"" but ""How could it be otherwise?""I don't think this book will change a creationist's mind, because if mere logical, rational, scientific explanations were all it took, creationism (an appeal to the supernatural rather than the natural) wouldn't exist in the first place. But I don't think that was the intent with this book. The book's title isn't ""Why creationism is wrong."" There is no point in arguing with a creationist whose faith feels threatened by science. If somebody isn't threatened by science then ""more science"" isn't going to change anything. But for the rest of us, laypeople who occasionally hear a creationist argument and think ""Oh, well that seems like a good point, I wonder how Darwanism answers that?"" the answers are here. And eventually, by the end of the book, with a good understanding of how darwanism works, any creationist question no longer seems like a good question- but more of an admission of ""I don't understand how this works.""There is nothing wrong with the statement ""I don't understand how this works"" as long as it is not followed with ""Therefore it can not be true."" Is it any better than saying ""I don't understand how this works, but I'll assume it's true""? No- unless that statement is followed by ""Because I understand the method by which this conclusion was reached."" If you understand the scientific method and think that observation, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, and comparison are really good ways to arrive at a conclusion about something then you will readily accept conclusions reached by those methods without knowing the details. So by understanding and accepting this method as a valid way to understand the world, it is perfectly reasonable to accept knowledge as being ""true"" that was achieved using these methods.You can't, however, argue one way or the other for something without knowing anything about it. I believed evolution to be true because I trusted the method by which the theory was developed, but I wanted to be able to understand the theory itself, and this book did a great job of it.One final note. The author did a great job at addressing the ""Just a theory"" argument. It isn't ""just a theory"", but a ""scientific theory"" which is completely different than ""a random guess with no way of testing it"". There is no point arguing it in a book review. Suffice to say the book spells it out and does a great job. Enough so that I underlined the entire thing.If you want to understand Darwinism, don't be put off by the title. By the end of the book you will understand how it works. The books isn't a defense of the theory but an explanation that is so thorough that it defends itself.I subtracted one star because I wish there was a little more about the timeline of evolution and the different eras of the earth's history. Another chapter would have been nice. "
211,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1643812-andrew,2,"Once again a great scientific mind has stooped to the lowest common denominator; mindlessly bickering with the creationist argument. I was expecting evolution/creationist argument in the preface, maybe even in the first chapter. Unfortunately, It's littered throughout the book. I understand that some readers actually enjoy this mindless drubbing, if so, this book is for you. What I was hoping for was a deeper biological understanding of speciation and specialization, and to Coyne's credit there are anecdotes littered throughout. Sadly, Those anecdotes are merely a way for Coyne to stick out his tongue and say ""I told you so, dummy"", they offer little new insights to those with a baseline understanding of biology. If you like Dawkins,you'll like Coyne, and If you like both I offer some simple advice. Grow up, and read a book with some scientific teeth. I recommend Stephen Jay Gould. If you are like me and are interested in speciation and specialization, I recommend skipping this book, and watching Coyne's lecture.

If only those who are so adamant about ID would crack open this book! Evolution is a beautiful mess. But, the fact that of all the species and of all mutations over billions of years, we are the only ones who have been awarded reason and a complex brain- that, to me, is far more meaningful and beautiful than to think someone created us and ""blessed us"" with it. We managed to become who we are, through billions of years of genetic fight. We are special, and we are here. Wow.

The author has a remarkably humble tone as he describes both the assertive truth of evolution as well as the ongoing process of unfinished learning of science (e.g., the study of biogenesis, the beginning of the universe, evolutionary psychology, evolution's inability to stand alone as an ethical/moral system, etc.). I believe that this book was well worth the time to read.Evolution can by no means explain everything about the world around us, but contrary to the opinions of many creationists/ID advocates, it does not presume to. This is the essence of science: the search for knowledge rather than the presumption of it.Why Evolution is True is an excellent popular treatise of evolution because it makes clear these points, and is honest about the shortcomings (both real and imagined) of modern evolutionary theory.

219,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,4,"Let me tell you a little story.In high school, I was taught science from a ""Creationist"" perspective. I did who-knows-how-many research projects and papers on ""Creation versus Evolution"". I became pretty knowledgeable about the subject (or so I thought). I owned a tome titled ""Science vs Evolution"", a graduation present from my biology teacher, and could give all the talking points on why Darwinism was false.Fast forward a number of years. I can't pinpoint the moment when my perspective changed. I think it started with a nagging suspicion that, despite all the Creationist videos I had watched and the articles I had read, I had never truly, actually heard the argument for evolution from evolutionary scientists themselves, and only knew the distorted interpretations of their arguments from their ""critics"".I changed my mind, ultimately, not because of a wealth of scientific rebuttals to combat every objection of Intelligent Design advocates. It came down to a simple matter of logic.That logic is this: The theory of evolution came about from the scientific process. Predictions are made, evidence is gathered, and conclusions are drawn. At every turn, for more than a century, the assumptions about evolution have been rigorously questioned, challenged, and tested under scientific scrutiny.And throughout this process, the theory of evolution has not only survived, but become stronger and more deeply understood. And it is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists.Contrast this with the idea of Intelligent Design, or Creationism. This concept does not start with predictions that can be completely questioned or re-thought at any moment; it cannot flexibly follow the evidence, wherever it leads.Creationism begins with a conclusion, and seeks evidence to support that conclusion.In other words, the theory of evolution is scientific. Creationism is not.I had become convinced of evolution from a logical perspective, but I still did not understand it. I did not have the high school education most people get on the subject. I still had all those talking points from Answers in Genesis that I knew were false, but didn't have responses for.This book, Why Evolution is True, became the perfect answer to my needs. Coyne lays out the mechanisms of and evidence for evolution in very easy-to-understand, eye-opening terms that the average, non-scientific reader can absorb and enjoy.It's also relatively short (not a difficult read), while still astonishingly robust in the power of its evidence and strength of its arguments.I came to this book already convinced of evolution; I came way fully understanding it (for the first time), and EXCITED about its awesomeness. Seriously, evolution is... REALLY COOL???I'm greatly appreciative of the author for writing this, and helping me to fill a gap in my knowledge... while also helping me discovery the pure joy and wonder that comes with knowing our origins.Buuuuuuut... he does get one tiny star bumped off, and this is for purely opinionated reasons, but in his discussions of gender he sometimes lapsed into what I can only call ""male arrogance"". The way he talked about men and women just grated on my nerves. Not what he said was untrue or anything, just written in an annoying way that felt way too comfortable with male superiority. My objection is completely non-intellectual and subjective, but hey! This is my review! I can give whatever stars I wanted!In all seriousness, this book is amazing. It will doubtlessly be my default recommendation for fence-sitters, skeptics, and other people who lacked an honest education in the fact of evolution like I did."
220,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81496242-sakshi-sinha,5,"This book is a compelling read. Learning about evolution, the process and time that goes into this makes you just respect and admire our environment and animals even more. -Firstly, Coyne discusses about creationism and evolution. He often includes antidotes throughout the book. Its so unbelievable that there are people out there who don’t believe in evolution!!There are references from Darwin’s book “The Origin”, other authors and scientists who have worked in this field. Introducing different viewpoints to us. -Then it continues with Coyne explaining different theories and concepts of evolution. This isn’t much of a rocket science. It just requires basic comprehension of species and biology and I think it’s pretty easy to grip on. -Along with facts and views, Coyne mentions alot of studies conducted on fossils and how they helped in grouping and combining the story of evolution. It’s really an engaging study and this has actually amplified my interest in fossils.-In addition to this the author addresses evolution in different aspects of wildlife such as in aquatic animals, birds, mammals etc. Coyne also describes at length natural selection , vestigial organs, genetics etc.-Altogether the book is filled with engrossing examples and it’s so amusing. There are images for references which make it easier to interpret description the author provides. -lastly, I do have a suggestion, Coyne mentions various kinds of animals, insects, birds, and not all of them have a visual representation in the book. I suggest you use google to understand their anatomy and explore various journals or articles. It might take extra time but I think this just adds another layer of knowledge to the read. This book really is an eye opener. Overall brilliant book! I would recommend it:) "
221,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25797445-eugene,5,"Why Evolution is True is a very interesting and thought provoking read. Detailed yet written for the lay person, Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of clearly laying out the evidence for Darwinian evolution from a common ancestor and why it is unanimously accepted by all scientists not already predisposed to creationism. From the fossil record and DNA sequencing to continental drift and speciation, he not only lays out the multiple lines of evidence but also shows the countless predictions that have been made using the evolutionary model, and counters each example by explaining how creationism fails these predictions and doesn't yield what we would expect to find were it the case. I have a very limited scientific background, but had no trouble understanding most of the book. On top of arguing the scientific evidence, he also does well at addressing common social and moral objections to evolution. The last chapter describes how contrary to popular (usually creationist) belief, evolution properly understood does not lend itself to racism. Races evolved to adapt better to various environments as branches spreading out on the evolutionary tree, and there is nothing to suggest any sort of racial superiority. Likewise Coyne debunks the popular but misguided argument that believing evolution will make people lose all sense of morality. Quite contrary, the more we learn about how our social behaviours evolved and how our brains developed to comprehend all these questions, the more we can appreciate the value of our lives. My only contention is how he subtly seems to slip in his anti-theist presupposition toward the end by saying appeal to the supernatural is not necessary when discussing origins. It may not be necessary, but it would be more accurate to say science and the God debate fall under seperate, non overlapping categories as one deals purely in falsifiable claims while the other does not. That being said, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious to learn more about evolution and its implications written in a very matter of fact, unbiased way."
222,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17013470-jamal-esam,5,"""No one would think of writing a book today on the evidence for atoms, or for the Earth going round the Sun. So why, when evolution is being reconfirmed every day, and forms the backbone of modern biology, do we need a book entitled Why Evolution Is True?""It's just as the description above has said, the evidence that supporting Evolution is enormous, starting from the first life on Earth until the evolution of Homo-sapiens. Every single life is just as Darwin had predicted, you won't find a fossil that exists in the Cambrian Age in the Precambrian Age and vice versa. In fact Evolution declared a bet as the evolutionist Richard Dawkins said: ""To those who has doubts about Evolution to scratch hardly in the Rocks to find an unsuitable fossil, we challenge them to that, will they accept the bet?"" In ""Why Evolution Is True"", Jerry A Coyne takes us to a journey in the Wonders of Natural Selection. He started with what a scientific theory means and then he goes on to explain the endless evidence of evolution and connecting it with everything around us, ""Some claim that evolution is just a theory, as if it were merely an opinion. But evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact. Evolution really happened. Accepting our kinship with all life on Earth is not only solid science ... in my view it's also a soaring spiritual experience."" –Neil deGrasse TysonYour body is a proof of multiple enhancing processes that have been done over millions of years starting from your individual cells to genes to last nerve in your Brain, for example the way human born is one of the best examples that we are descending from birds, by time the human evolved the way of giving birth doesn't change, the body of the baby turned upside down and the head of the baby (which becomes significantly bigger than that of our ancestors) faced the entrance of the womb, here we have to say isn't it ridiculous for God to do something like that, I mean why would He even blueprint-ed (or design) us with something very painful and can threatened the life of the mother just to prove something nothing than His sadistic nature of enjoying the screams of the mothers. Then he talked about Mutation and how it was at first the stick that Creationists wave on the face of Evolutionists every time they started a debate, he also mentioned and shed some lights on Linski's magnificent experiment on E-coli Bacteria which took 20 years and opened the gate in front of us to witness that ""Natural Selection + Mutations + Time = Darwin was Right""After that he talked about neuroscience and that evolution also has the ability to describe Morals and that Morals are not something comes up with Religion, it's something far more than that, it's something we might inherited it but mostly we gain it by practicing (eg: The Chimpanzees experiment). Jerry also explained that evolution doesn't necessarily mean to evolve into something more sophisticated, there's also a ""Redox Evolution"" which for example the evolution of Whales from Reptiles. I know I haven't wrote much and I won't, coz if you want to know something you have to dig for it, but what I'm totally convinced about is that the evidence evolution provides are stronger, reliable and more scientific than the Ideal Design provides, and that the idea of us coming from Adam and Eve is nothing but a Myth. It's not my words it's what science told us with EVIDENCE. It's as Carl Sagan said: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” – Cosmos."
223,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95929927-christian,4,"""I certainly make no claim to be the Milton of Darwinism. But I can at least try to dispel the misconceptions that frighten people away from evolution and from the amazing derivation of life’s staggering diversity from a single naked replicating molecule.""Such is the writing style of Jerry Coyne, an accessible and well-versed author and research professor of evolutionary biology. This landmark work should have staying power in the annals of popular science, though it is lacking in philosophical nuance and subtlety. It is not intended to be a textbook for academics but rather a treatise to persuade anyone without a background in the subject. He is strong in his convictions and forceful in his rhetoric; a blog of the same name may be consulted for further reading and development of his thinking in this area.Why Evolution Is True is a serious page-turner. Coyne has a gift for conveying complex ideas and anyone of high-school education should not have trouble following his arguments.Far easier to understand than other overviews like Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, the primary focus is the direct evidence and ever-mounting proof which we have amassed since Darwin's formulation of the theory nearly two centuries ago. If one went into this topic without any knowledge the book would serve as a comprehensive introduction to the topic and its fundamental concepts, though they will miss out on discussion of related issues, e.g. memes and extended phenotype.Coyne makes the commendable decision to anticipate objections to each of his chapters, much like Darwin did in later editions of On the Origin of Species; he knows that evolution is a contested and widely-misunderstood field and that minds tend to be closed to its authenticity. There are some questions that are oft-raised without sufficient answer in the public square: how did the eye form if not by a miracle? Of what use is half a wing to an evolving bird, and how could that possibly be selected for? He tackles these deftly and head-on, giving answers and insight that reflect his depth of knowledge.Near the end of chapter 9 we are given this summary:""Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life’s diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life... Most of us do need meaning, purpose, and moral guidance in our lives. How do we find them if we accept that evolution is the real story of our origin? That question is outside the domain of science.""He then proceeds to dismiss all answers outside of naturalism and materialism outright, which shows the limitations of his view in dialogue with contrasting opinions. Coyne does not attempt to appear as an unbiased explicator of evolutionary theory. This is a minor problem in the scope of the work, and perhaps a deserved one; he could hardly be more vindicated due to the sheer force of evidence for macroevolution. It makes me wonder if a more dispassionate approach could have been helpful. There are, despite his bewilderment, religious people who believe in evolution.He leaves us with a pithy and hopeful quote:""Evolution tells us where we came from, not where we can go.""I would definitely recommend this work to anyone who is curious about the developments in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural and sexual selection. As long as they are open to the evidence and don't mind the occasional sneer from the author, by the end there should be little doubt that evolution is, in fact, true."
224,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6350127-seawood,5,"Read for Coursera ""Writing in the Sciences"" and ""Genetics & Evolution"" courses.Why Evolution Is True is a love-letter to Charles Darwin; an accessible and detailed overview of the current state of evolution research. Each strand of knowledge which contributes to our understanding is laid out clearly, starting in many cases with what Darwin knew or intuited when writing On The Origin Of Species. Coyne deftly takes us through the developments in areas such as the fossil record, embryology, vestigial organs, biogeography and genetics; showing how predictions can be made and how discoveries since Darwin's time have confirmed the process of evolution over and over again. Many eye-catching examples are used to demonstrate where we can expect to find fossils in geological layers; how the bodily organisation of modern creatures follows patterns laid down in ancestral forms; and how environmental pressures lead to adaptation. The example of the modern mammalian laryngeal nerve as poor design derived from ancient forms is particularly striking. The nerve is involved in speech and swallowing and connects the brain to the larynx. It wraps around the aorta (a large vessel in the heart) rather than taking a direct route. This is not an issue for an ancient fishlike creature – but in a human the nerve has to be about a foot in length to follow the same route. In a giraffe, which has the same basic body plan, the nerve is three feet long! This is obviously inefficient and may even be more prone to injury, but clearly shows the laryngeal nerve adapting to follow the evolutionary changes in the body pattern.Coyne also shows how these additions to our knowledge efficiently take down the creationist or “intelligent design” arguments. Whilst he concedes that those arguing from faith will probably not change their minds, the book is very much aimed at people who are uncertain about the science. For European readers, this frequent referencing of creationism is a little grating since it is not such a large issue in this part of the world, but it is understandable when the American audience has a much greater background of “disbelief” in evolution [1].The final chapters are devoted to recent human evolution (from the period following divergence from chimps) and an overview of some of the difficulties people have with the possible implications of evolution for human behaviour. Overall, this is an excellent text for anyone who would like to understand the principles of evolution or update their knowledge, written in an entertaining and engaging style.[1] http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313... – unfortunately this, the original article in Science, is paywalled, but you can see a mirror at http://old.richarddawkins.net/article..., including the table comparing “belief” vs “disbelief” in evolution from 34 countries in 2005.

225,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"I read this book a while back and really enjoyed it. Note: If you are a creationist, you will doubtless NOT enjoy this. If you are an evolutionist, you'll probably be quite pleased with the book. And there's pity. For many, the book won't be read on its merits but for whether it supports or challenges one's views on the issue of Darwinian evolutionary theory.In terms of the book itself. . . . The purpose is specified by Jerry Coyne, the author, on page xiv: ""This book lays out the main lines of evidence for evolution. For those who oppose Darwinism purely as a matter of faith, no amount of evidence will do--theirs is a belief not based on reason. But for the many who find themselves uncertain, or who accept evolution but are not sure how to argue the case, this volume gives a succinct summary of why modern science recognizes evolution as true.""The book unfolds in a straightforward fashion. Chapter 1 summarizes the nature of evolution. He discusses the essence of the concept of evolution--""a species undergoing genetic change over time"" (page 3). Also discussed is ""natural selection,"" the process by which the more ""fit"" individuals tend to be more successful in reproductive terms That is, they leave more offspring than their less fit peers).Subsequent chapters outline the evidence for evolution, including often jury-rigged adaptations (evolution makes do with the organism/species as it exists and often leaves organisms that are poorly designed--but still capable of successful reproduction: think the lower back of humans!), the fossil record, a more detailed discussion of the process of natural selection, the relationship between sex and evolution, how species arise and develop, and--always an issue that excites passion--the relevance of evolution for humankind.The book itself does well what it sets out to do. There are things that bother me. As with many, the author claims that evolution is a ""fact."" I have never understood this allegation. Neo-Darwinian theory is a THEORY--not a fact. Lots of facts support the theory. By itself, though, it is NOT a fact. I think advocates of evolution shoot themselves in the foot with such an argument. Many, of course, would rejoin, ""It's ONLY a theory."" Such folks also don't know what they're talking about. A good theory is a great thing! Not ""just."" Quantum theory is terrific; Einstein's relativity is a fine theory. And so on.All in all, if the reader wants an accessible advocacy of evolutionary theory, this book does the job nicely. If the reader does not accept it, the book, of course, will not be very compelling."
226,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36384001-yousuf,2,"Good Overview, But Contains Straw MenThis is a good summary for the pro-Evolution side if anyone is researching the evolution-creation controversy. It goes through the fossil evidence, genetic evidence, geological evidence, and more for Evolution via natural selection (and other naturalistic processes). The author writes in a clear and logical manner, and generally avoids the confrontational polemics that other writers such as Richard Dawkins are prone to.My main objection is that Coyne uses misrepresentations to attack Intelligent Design (ID). He tries to associate ID with Young Earth Creationism many times, arguing that the two are similar or have similar methods. Nothing could be further from the truth. Pro-ID people are NOT making a deduction from religious scriptures; rather they are analyzing the structure of the cell (such as the information encoded in DNA) and making inferences based on that. You might not agree with their conclusions, but you should not try to smear them in a dishonest way.Another issue that I had was that most of Coyne's objections to ID are ""theological"" in nature. What I mean is that he points to ""flaws"" in organisms and basically states: ""An intelligent designer would have done a better job of this.""But these are theological, not scientific, objections; and they have theological, not scientific, answers. Probably because the Designer made the designs bad on purpose - I dunno, perhaps this world wasn't supposed to be perfect in the first place?He admits that materialist scientists do not have an explanation for the origin of life (OOL) as well as the Cambrian Explosion. But then he brings out the stereotypical ""God-of-the-gaps! God-of-the-gaps!"" argument to rebut ID here... I was literally shaking my head out of disappointment (though I wasn't at all surprised). Also, the response to integrated complexity was vague and didn't make much sense to me.I'm currently reading Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design, which is a pro-ID account of OOL. And I can tell you, it is anything but God-of-the-gaps. The entire argument is based on what we do know in biology, not a gap of any kind.I know the above review sounds harsh, but I actually enjoyed reading this book and I do recommend it to anyone who's interested in evolution or the evolution-creation controversy."

However, if you are undecided and truly interested in learning about the wealth of evidence that supports evolution as, indeed, the way (along with sea cucumbers, lichen, platypuses and blue whales) came to be, this is a wonderful book. Even if you already have a fair working knowledge of the theory (and that's theory in the scientific sense, not in the casual ""it's only a theory"" sense), you'll likely find a lot of new and fascinating details herein.All the classic evidence that you learned in school (if you're my age) is here, along with scads of new evidence in fields like microbiology, geology, paleobotany, and many others. The book avoids jargon except when it's needed in order to be specific, defines unfamiliar terms as it goes, explains how the facts in highly diverse areas support one another, points out the numerous areas where evolution would predict X and in fact science finds X, and generally lays out its case in a comprehensive and coherent manner. Happily, it also does so without either proselytizing or haranguing, leaving the reader to make his or her own decision in evaluating the range of interlocking facts presented. The last chapter discusses why certain religious sects have such difficulty accepting evolution, which was also enlightening and interesting.Highly recommended for the lay reader interested in acquiring a solid overview of the scientific evidence for evolution."

Coyne's Why Evolution Is True is a fine place to start. As his unsubtle title suggests, Coyne's purpose is to banish the arguments of creationists and their intelligent design fellow travelers. Much as Darwin did, he draws upon geology and the fossil record; biogeography, or the distribution of plants and animals; and the similarities and differences among living species. But gaps that once frustrated Darwin, such as so-called ""missing links"" in the fossil record, can now be filled. ... ... he builds a strong case for the fact of evolution, and for Darwin's theory of how it works. (That species change over time isn't theoretical; how and why the changes occur is the subject of ""evolutionary theory."") Coyne addresses many of the common creationist arguments head-on, outlining how complex systems such as eyes and biochemical pathways can evolve by natural selection. To his credit, however, the author acknowledges his strategy's fatal flaw: The refusal to accept evolution has precious little to do with reason, logic or evidence.

It's sad to think that even on this modern day, we still need books to show what is just actually is. It's always my dream to become an evolutionary anthropologist and by reading this book only ignites that passion more! This is a great book on evolution though some might find it to be dry. But the author has thoroughly described how evolution works and presented - as is the case in scientific literatures - a lot of convincing and irrefutable evidence. One thing I liked is the organization of the chapters where Coyne subtly explained the concepts and applied them first on evolution of ""lesser"" organisms, then on to human evolution. For readers who are honest-seekers, do not discount evolution until you have read this book. And for those who are already convinced, this could be a good weapon against Creationists (Intelligent Design proponents)."

He is a bit more detailed than Coyne, a bit more lucid, and if I may say so, a bit more exciting, even a bit more poetic.Nevertheless, at under 300 pages, Why Evolution Is True is the best short book I've ever read on the subject. The last chapter, about the implications (and lack of implications) of the theory of evolution for our own species, is very good. And Dawkins himself gives the book high praise.Well worth reading."

237,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"To be more precise and clear, the title of the book should be ""why the modern theory of evolution is true."" Changing the title doesn't make a difference to us the believers of the theory (I'll call the theory Darwinism for short), because we usually accept it as a bundle package. But after reading the book, I realize the theory makes multi-level propositions. ""Evolution happened"" is only one of them. Coyne mentions this structure of Darwinism repeatedly, but I think he could make the book stronger by laying it out at the very beginning. In my own words, the theory of evolution proposes the following hierarchy of propositions:1. Evolutionary change (change in inheritable traits of a population through generations) happened. Not only on the micro level (change of traits within a species) but also the macro level (the transformation of one species into another)2. Natural selection explains most of the microevolutionary change, e.g., the change in beak size of birds.3. Natural selection explains most of the macroevolutionary change, e.g., the origin of birds.4. Natural selection builds complex features in nonhuman species, such as the eyes and the brain.5. Natural selection builds complex features of humans, such as language and consciousness.  Some creationists refuse all propositions above. Some admit (1) but refuse to explain it by natural selection. Others accept natural selection only to a certain level. All of them share one common belief: natural selection cannot make us human to be what we are. As a response, Coyne provides ample evidence to support Darwinism. The evidence includes the following: • Species can be classified and grouped in a tree-like way• Discovery of transitional fossils at predicted locations with the expected age.• Features that only make sense by natural selection: vestiges / atavism / dead DNA / Embryo palimpsest / bad design• Distributions of species across the globe, such as how different species fill similar roles in different areas, how certain species lack on volcanic islands but not on continental islands, and the radiations of endemic species on volcanic islands.• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by artificial selection• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by natural selection in labs and fields• Math simulations that exhibit evolutionary paths to complex features under natural selection. An important lesson I learned from Coyne's enumeration of the evidence above, is to treat the following two things differently: 1) the general evolutionary theory, and 2) individual evolutionary explanations of traits and behaviors. Darwin provides us a beautiful theory. It is so simple, yet so powerful. But beauty does not equal truth. Darwinism is generally correct because scientists have accumulated a huge amount of supporting evidence. An individual evolutionary explanation, however, must bear its own burden of proof. We should not blindly believe in a single evolutionary explanation because there are often multiple competing evolutionary explanations of a trait or behavior. Many of them are inevitable ""just-so stories."" Moreover, natural selection is not the only chisel used by nature the sculptor. Features can be generated by other mechanisms, such as genetic drift and sexual selection. I found the hypothesis explaining the existence of human appendix especially interesting: it is possible that natural selection simply can't shrink the appendix anymore, because before it disappears from shrinking, a smaller appendix gives rise to a higher risk of being blocked.  This lesson also applies to economics, another discipline that is guided by a core theory — the rational choice theory. Again, the core theory might be generally correct, but this does not mean it is correct in every context, far from it.  Coyne also reminds me that most evolutionary explanations of complex human features, no matter how elaborate, are untested and probably untestable. This is unfortunate, because the evolution of such features, especially the evolution of consciousness, seems to be the most intriguing question of all. But to quote Darwin, we should not ""positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."" Instead, we should keep searching for testable theories in the future.  Stray observation:- The book solved a big puzzle I had in high school biology class: why human embryos look so weird and go through phases of development that make no sense.- Darwin did not explain the origin of species in his same-titled book (he would explain it in later books and papers).

What remains is to probe the finer details of the mechanics and processes underlying it. If Coyne's primary goal in writing this book was to convince Creationists that evolution is true, it remains unfulfilled. The people he's trying to convince are precisely the kind whom no amount of evidence supporting evolution can convince. This book lacks the only thing that can convince Creationists and proponents of Intelligent Design - passages from their holy book of choice, or even better, a direct quote from their god of choice, stating evolution is true. Kidding aside, the sad truth is that it is nigh impossible to fight dogma and deeply entrenched beliefs with logic and evidence. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. This book is the result of one such attempt and it is a brilliant one at that. Kudos to Coyne for fighting the good fight. Unless you're the kind of person who relies exclusively on made-up stories from stale, antiquated texts for moral guidance and laws of the natural world, you probably already know evolution is true, or rather, that it is the best explanation we have so far for the origin of life on this planet; and I'm fairly sure you will find this book insightful and enjoyable. The book is full of interesting facts and observations that unequivocally prove that evolution is a scientific fact. Topics that are covered include discovery of fossils, particularly of intermediates; speciation and biogeography; vestigial traits and organs that along with emryology provide a window into the past; genetic drift as an alternative (although minor) engine of evolution besides Darwinian natural selection; the powers of sexual selection; and lastly, the origin of of our own species along with a brief but useful discussion on the dicey issue of race. Along with a historical overview, Coyne also details recent evidence (last three decades) supporting evolution and advances made in paleontology, molecular and evolutionary biology, and a few other fields, which I found very helpful. At one time or another, I'm sure most of us have wondered, ""Now that the pressures of natural selection are largely absent in most human societies, are we still evolving? If so, in what ways?"" I found the beginnings of an answer to this in the penultimate chapter.The crisp, clear, and no-nonsense writing style makes digesting this information-rich book painless. Coyne has also provided handy notes clarifying certain ideas, pointing out opposing viewpoints, and lisiting resources for those interested in exploring a topic further. Several of the books he has mentioned have found their way into my to to-read list.This is a cogent synthesis of facts about evolution and of coherent arguments in its favor. Not only does it satiate your curiosity and expand your mind but it also arms you with knowledge for those uncomfortable engagements with staunch Creationsists. Highly recommended!"
239,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"The title of this book bluntly states its purpose, which is to refute, head on, the claims advanced by creationists and supporters of intelligent design that evolution by natural selection cannot possibly explain how life takes the many forms that it does. Biologist Jerry Coyne convincingly addresses every conceivable argument that could be made against evolution, using numerous examples to explain how life as it exists today must have arisen through evolution. To this end, he covers evidence from:- Fossils and biogeography.- Vestigial organs (eg, our appendix). - Vestigial genes. We have around 2,000 that no longer work because evolution rendered them unnecessary. An example is our gene for the final step in the biosynthesis of vitamin C which became non-functional after we started to consume this essential substance in our diet.- Atavisms (eg, our coccyx). - Embryonic development, where the early embryos of most vertebrates bear a striking resemblance to one another. The human embryo, for example, starts looking like that of a jawless fish, before becoming reptilian, and then mammalian. - Bad design, such as the asymmetric structure of flat, side-swimming fish, such as Dover sole, or the convoluted route taken in mammals by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which covers about 15 feet in the giraffe, to join two points just one foot apart).As Coyne points out, no supreme being would have created these oddities and imperfections unless it was that being’s intention to deceive us into believing they were the outcome of evolution, which seems extremely implausible. This is not a textbook on evolution, so its purpose is not to teach the underlying principles. The reader needs to look elsewhere for detailed explanations of genetics, genomes, DNA, inheritance, population growth, genetic drift, etc, but this is the ideal book for anyone who is open-mindedly sitting on the fence, unsure as to whether or not life arose through evolution, creation or intelligent design. Coyne’s arguments are very compelling although, as he admits, “evolution raises such profound questions of purpose, morality, and meaning that [some people] just can’t accept it no matter how much evidence they see”. He illustrates this point by referring to a talk on evolution he gave in Chicago to a group of businessmen. Afterwards, he was approached by one of the delegates who said, “I found your evidence for evolution very convincing—but I still don’t believe it”."
240,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"I hesitated before buying this book because I was a little put off by the title. I already assumed evolution was ""true"" (as much as any scientific knowledge can be considered ""the truth""), and I was more interested in knowing how it works, and the history of it all, from the first micro-organisms to now. The ""how"" part is covered pretty well, and by covering the ""how"" the author addresses creationist or ""intelligent design"" arguments and provides a clear, rational, and most importantly scientific answer. To be fair, the idea of natural selection and evolution seems simple enough, but how it leads to complex devices like an eyeball seems inexplicable... until it is explained. The creationist arguments are all fair, in the sense that they are perfectly valid questions to ask- until they are answered. But a perfectly valid question isn't the same as a valid objection. The book does a very good job at answering questions and debunking creationist objections in the process of explaining how evolution works, although this isn't the main focus of the book. At points along the way the author pauses to address a creationist objection- debunks it- and moves right along. And its done with such convincing ease that by the end the question is not ""How could evolution be true?"" but ""How could it be otherwise?""I don't think this book will change a creationist's mind, because if mere logical, rational, scientific explanations were all it took, creationism (an appeal to the supernatural rather than the natural) wouldn't exist in the first place. But I don't think that was the intent with this book. The book's title isn't ""Why creationism is wrong."" There is no point in arguing with a creationist whose faith feels threatened by science. If somebody isn't threatened by science then ""more science"" isn't going to change anything. But for the rest of us, laypeople who occasionally hear a creationist argument and think ""Oh, well that seems like a good point, I wonder how Darwanism answers that?"" the answers are here. And eventually, by the end of the book, with a good understanding of how darwanism works, any creationist question no longer seems like a good question- but more of an admission of ""I don't understand how this works.""There is nothing wrong with the statement ""I don't understand how this works"" as long as it is not followed with ""Therefore it can not be true."" Is it any better than saying ""I don't understand how this works, but I'll assume it's true""? No- unless that statement is followed by ""Because I understand the method by which this conclusion was reached."" If you understand the scientific method and think that observation, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, and comparison are really good ways to arrive at a conclusion about something then you will readily accept conclusions reached by those methods without knowing the details. So by understanding and accepting this method as a valid way to understand the world, it is perfectly reasonable to accept knowledge as being ""true"" that was achieved using these methods.You can't, however, argue one way or the other for something without knowing anything about it. I believed evolution to be true because I trusted the method by which the theory was developed, but I wanted to be able to understand the theory itself, and this book did a great job of it.One final note. The author did a great job at addressing the ""Just a theory"" argument. It isn't ""just a theory"", but a ""scientific theory"" which is completely different than ""a random guess with no way of testing it"". There is no point arguing it in a book review. Suffice to say the book spells it out and does a great job. Enough so that I underlined the entire thing.If you want to understand Darwinism, don't be put off by the title. By the end of the book you will understand how it works. The books isn't a defense of the theory but an explanation that is so thorough that it defends itself.I subtracted one star because I wish there was a little more about the timeline of evolution and the different eras of the earth's history. Another chapter would have been nice. "
241,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1643812-andrew,2,"Once again a great scientific mind has stooped to the lowest common denominator; mindlessly bickering with the creationist argument. I was expecting evolution/creationist argument in the preface, maybe even in the first chapter. Unfortunately, It's littered throughout the book. I understand that some readers actually enjoy this mindless drubbing, if so, this book is for you. What I was hoping for was a deeper biological understanding of speciation and specialization, and to Coyne's credit there are anecdotes littered throughout. Sadly, Those anecdotes are merely a way for Coyne to stick out his tongue and say ""I told you so, dummy"", they offer little new insights to those with a baseline understanding of biology. If you like Dawkins,you'll like Coyne, and If you like both I offer some simple advice. Grow up, and read a book with some scientific teeth. I recommend Stephen Jay Gould. If you are like me and are interested in speciation and specialization, I recommend skipping this book, and watching Coyne's lecture. It's a condensed version of the book, that skips all the bickering, and gets right down to the good stuff: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1m4mA... "

I can't imagine how hard it is to summarize a topic as voluminous as evolution into 230 pages.Without a doubt, evolution is complicated. It is one of the most misunderstood facts, and definitely the most viciously attacked. Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of explaining some of the basic tenets of evolution to the reader in a very succinct way. It is a breath taking read; this book needs to be read more than once. If only those who are so adamant about ID would crack open this book! Evolution is a beautiful mess. But, the fact that of all the species and of all mutations over billions of years, we are the only ones who have been awarded reason and a complex brain- that, to me, is far more meaningful and beautiful than to think someone created us and ""blessed us"" with it. We managed to become who we are, through billions of years of genetic fight. We are special, and we are here. Wow. Do we really need to believe in miracles when science gives us something this mind blowing?!"

So that was a good news at the time.I remember at my very first year as a med student, my anatomy professor explaining to us the action of a muscle that was useless unless we think of its potential action for a creature who walks on four limbs, "" i am just telling u this to memorize the muscle but this is a western explanation and it's not my intention to promote it"" said my professor.I remember so many times in my education process in which i was denied a chance to learn about evolution or to be given a fair criticism of Darwinian evolution, everything i was told about evolution turned out to be false.They told me ""evolution is completely random"" ""Darwin said that man came from monkeys"" and of course the most irritating ignorant phrase ""it's just a theory""I highly recommend this book for people like me, who missed a proper teacher to tell them about one of the most important ideas that ever crossed the minds of humankind.

244,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3547378-benjamin,5,"This book is a well-structured argument that the process of evolution has occurred and does occur. The author has a remarkably humble tone as he describes both the assertive truth of evolution as well as the ongoing process of unfinished learning of science (e.g., the study of biogenesis, the beginning of the universe, evolutionary psychology, evolution's inability to stand alone as an ethical/moral system, etc.). I believe that this book was well worth the time to read.Evolution can by no means explain everything about the world around us, but contrary to the opinions of many creationists/ID advocates, it does not presume to. This is the essence of science: the search for knowledge rather than the presumption of it.Why Evolution is True is an excellent popular treatise of evolution because it makes clear these points, and is honest about the shortcomings (both real and imagined) of modern evolutionary theory. Do yourself a service and read it!"

246,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3268791-tim,1,A real scientist would never say evolution is a fact. Have they changed a fly into a dog yet? Dan Shectman won the noble prize for chemistry. He battled against established science for years. Lost jobs and told he was stupid. He forced scientists to reconsider their conception of the very nature of matter. To call evolution a fact is to place your mind in a box. You will never find truth that way.

249,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,4,"Let me tell you a little story.In high school, I was taught science from a ""Creationist"" perspective. I did who-knows-how-many research projects and papers on ""Creation versus Evolution"". I became pretty knowledgeable about the subject (or so I thought). I owned a tome titled ""Science vs Evolution"", a graduation present from my biology teacher, and could give all the talking points on why Darwinism was false.Fast forward a number of years. I can't pinpoint the moment when my perspective changed. I think it started with a nagging suspicion that, despite all the Creationist videos I had watched and the articles I had read, I had never truly, actually heard the argument for evolution from evolutionary scientists themselves, and only knew the distorted interpretations of their arguments from their ""critics"".I changed my mind, ultimately, not because of a wealth of scientific rebuttals to combat every objection of Intelligent Design advocates. It came down to a simple matter of logic.That logic is this: The theory of evolution came about from the scientific process. Predictions are made, evidence is gathered, and conclusions are drawn. At every turn, for more than a century, the assumptions about evolution have been rigorously questioned, challenged, and tested under scientific scrutiny.And throughout this process, the theory of evolution has not only survived, but become stronger and more deeply understood. And it is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists.Contrast this with the idea of Intelligent Design, or Creationism. This concept does not start with predictions that can be completely questioned or re-thought at any moment; it cannot flexibly follow the evidence, wherever it leads.Creationism begins with a conclusion, and seeks evidence to support that conclusion.In other words, the theory of evolution is scientific. Creationism is not.I had become convinced of evolution from a logical perspective, but I still did not understand it. I did not have the high school education most people get on the subject. I still had all those talking points from Answers in Genesis that I knew were false, but didn't have responses for.This book, Why Evolution is True, became the perfect answer to my needs. Coyne lays out the mechanisms of and evidence for evolution in very easy-to-understand, eye-opening terms that the average, non-scientific reader can absorb and enjoy.It's also relatively short (not a difficult read), while still astonishingly robust in the power of its evidence and strength of its arguments.I came to this book already convinced of evolution; I came way fully understanding it (for the first time), and EXCITED about its awesomeness. Seriously, evolution is... REALLY COOL???I'm greatly appreciative of the author for writing this, and helping me to fill a gap in my knowledge... while also helping me discovery the pure joy and wonder that comes with knowing our origins.Buuuuuuut... he does get one tiny star bumped off, and this is for purely opinionated reasons, but in his discussions of gender he sometimes lapsed into what I can only call ""male arrogance"". The way he talked about men and women just grated on my nerves. Not what he said was untrue or anything, just written in an annoying way that felt way too comfortable with male superiority. My objection is completely non-intellectual and subjective, but hey! This is my review! I can give whatever stars I wanted!In all seriousness, this book is amazing. It will doubtlessly be my default recommendation for fence-sitters, skeptics, and other people who lacked an honest education in the fact of evolution like I did."
250,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81496242-sakshi-sinha,5,"This book is a compelling read. Learning about evolution, the process and time that goes into this makes you just respect and admire our environment and animals even more. -Firstly, Coyne discusses about creationism and evolution. He often includes antidotes throughout the book. Its so unbelievable that there are people out there who don’t believe in evolution!!There are references from Darwin’s book “The Origin”, other authors and scientists who have worked in this field. Introducing different viewpoints to us. -Then it continues with Coyne explaining different theories and concepts of evolution. This isn’t much of a rocket science. It just requires basic comprehension of species and biology and I think it’s pretty easy to grip on. -Along with facts and views, Coyne mentions alot of studies conducted on fossils and how they helped in grouping and combining the story of evolution. It’s really an engaging study and this has actually amplified my interest in fossils.-In addition to this the author addresses evolution in different aspects of wildlife such as in aquatic animals, birds, mammals etc. Coyne also describes at length natural selection , vestigial organs, genetics etc.-Altogether the book is filled with engrossing examples and it’s so amusing. There are images for references which make it easier to interpret description the author provides. -lastly, I do have a suggestion, Coyne mentions various kinds of animals, insects, birds, and not all of them have a visual representation in the book. I suggest you use google to understand their anatomy and explore various journals or articles. It might take extra time but I think this just adds another layer of knowledge to the read. This book really is an eye opener. Overall brilliant book! I would recommend it:) "
251,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25797445-eugene,5,"Why Evolution is True is a very interesting and thought provoking read. Detailed yet written for the lay person, Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of clearly laying out the evidence for Darwinian evolution from a common ancestor and why it is unanimously accepted by all scientists not already predisposed to creationism. From the fossil record and DNA sequencing to continental drift and speciation, he not only lays out the multiple lines of evidence but also shows the countless predictions that have been made using the evolutionary model, and counters each example by explaining how creationism fails these predictions and doesn't yield what we would expect to find were it the case. I have a very limited scientific background, but had no trouble understanding most of the book. On top of arguing the scientific evidence, he also does well at addressing common social and moral objections to evolution. The last chapter describes how contrary to popular (usually creationist) belief, evolution properly understood does not lend itself to racism. Races evolved to adapt better to various environments as branches spreading out on the evolutionary tree, and there is nothing to suggest any sort of racial superiority. Likewise Coyne debunks the popular but misguided argument that believing evolution will make people lose all sense of morality. Quite contrary, the more we learn about how our social behaviours evolved and how our brains developed to comprehend all these questions, the more we can appreciate the value of our lives. My only contention is how he subtly seems to slip in his anti-theist presupposition toward the end by saying appeal to the supernatural is not necessary when discussing origins. It may not be necessary, but it would be more accurate to say science and the God debate fall under seperate, non overlapping categories as one deals purely in falsifiable claims while the other does not. That being said, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious to learn more about evolution and its implications written in a very matter of fact, unbiased way."

So why, when evolution is being reconfirmed every day, and forms the backbone of modern biology, do we need a book entitled Why Evolution Is True?""It's just as the description above has said, the evidence that supporting Evolution is enormous, starting from the first life on Earth until the evolution of Homo-sapiens. Every single life is just as Darwin had predicted, you won't find a fossil that exists in the Cambrian Age in the Precambrian Age and vice versa. In fact Evolution declared a bet as the evolutionist Richard Dawkins said: ""To those who has doubts about Evolution to scratch hardly in the Rocks to find an unsuitable fossil, we challenge them to that, will they accept the bet?"" In ""Why Evolution Is True"", Jerry A Coyne takes us to a journey in the Wonders of Natural Selection. He started with what a scientific theory means and then he goes on to explain the endless evidence of evolution and connecting it with everything around us, ""Some claim that evolution is just a theory, as if it were merely an opinion. But evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact. Evolution really happened. Accepting our kinship with all life on Earth is not only solid science ... in my view it's also a soaring spiritual experience."" –Neil deGrasse TysonYour body is a proof of multiple enhancing processes that have been done over millions of years starting from your individual cells to genes to last nerve in your Brain, for example the way human born is one of the best examples that we are descending from birds, by time the human evolved the way of giving birth doesn't change, the body of the baby turned upside down and the head of the baby (which becomes significantly bigger than that of our ancestors) faced the entrance of the womb, here we have to say isn't it ridiculous for God to do something like that, I mean why would He even blueprint-ed (or design) us with something very painful and can threatened the life of the mother just to prove something nothing than His sadistic nature of enjoying the screams of the mothers. Then he talked about Mutation and how it was at first the stick that Creationists wave on the face of Evolutionists every time they started a debate, he also mentioned and shed some lights on Linski's magnificent experiment on E-coli Bacteria which took 20 years and opened the gate in front of us to witness that ""Natural Selection + Mutations + Time = Darwin was Right""After that he talked about neuroscience and that evolution also has the ability to describe Morals and that Morals are not something comes up with Religion, it's something far more than that, it's something we might inherited it but mostly we gain it by practicing (eg: The Chimpanzees experiment). Jerry also explained that evolution doesn't necessarily mean to evolve into something more sophisticated, there's also a ""Redox Evolution"" which for example the evolution of Whales from Reptiles. I know I haven't wrote much and I won't, coz if you want to know something you have to dig for it, but what I'm totally convinced about is that the evidence evolution provides are stronger, reliable and more scientific than the Ideal Design provides, and that the idea of us coming from Adam and Eve is nothing but a Myth. It's not my words it's what science told us with EVIDENCE. It's as Carl Sagan said: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” – Cosmos."

But I can at least try to dispel the misconceptions that frighten people away from evolution and from the amazing derivation of life’s staggering diversity from a single naked replicating molecule.""Such is the writing style of Jerry Coyne, an accessible and well-versed author and research professor of evolutionary biology. This landmark work should have staying power in the annals of popular science, though it is lacking in philosophical nuance and subtlety. It is not intended to be a textbook for academics but rather a treatise to persuade anyone without a background in the subject. He is strong in his convictions and forceful in his rhetoric; a blog of the same name may be consulted for further reading and development of his thinking in this area.Why Evolution Is True is a serious page-turner. Coyne has a gift for conveying complex ideas and anyone of high-school education should not have trouble following his arguments.Far easier to understand than other overviews like Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, the primary focus is the direct evidence and ever-mounting proof which we have amassed since Darwin's formulation of the theory nearly two centuries ago. If one went into this topic without any knowledge the book would serve as a comprehensive introduction to the topic and its fundamental concepts, though they will miss out on discussion of related issues, e.g. memes and extended phenotype.Coyne makes the commendable decision to anticipate objections to each of his chapters, much like Darwin did in later editions of On the Origin of Species; he knows that evolution is a contested and widely-misunderstood field and that minds tend to be closed to its authenticity. There are some questions that are oft-raised without sufficient answer in the public square: how did the eye form if not by a miracle? Of what use is half a wing to an evolving bird, and how could that possibly be selected for? He tackles these deftly and head-on, giving answers and insight that reflect his depth of knowledge.Near the end of chapter 9 we are given this summary:""Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life’s diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life... Most of us do need meaning, purpose, and moral guidance in our lives. How do we find them if we accept that evolution is the real story of our origin? That question is outside the domain of science.""He then proceeds to dismiss all answers outside of naturalism and materialism outright, which shows the limitations of his view in dialogue with contrasting opinions. Coyne does not attempt to appear as an unbiased explicator of evolutionary theory. This is a minor problem in the scope of the work, and perhaps a deserved one; he could hardly be more vindicated due to the sheer force of evidence for macroevolution. It makes me wonder if a more dispassionate approach could have been helpful. There are, despite his bewilderment, religious people who believe in evolution.He leaves us with a pithy and hopeful quote:""Evolution tells us where we came from, not where we can go.""I would definitely recommend this work to anyone who is curious about the developments in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural and sexual selection. As long as they are open to the evidence and don't mind the occasional sneer from the author, by the end there should be little doubt that evolution is, in fact, true."
254,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6350127-seawood,5,"Read for Coursera ""Writing in the Sciences"" and ""Genetics & Evolution"" courses.Why Evolution Is True is a love-letter to Charles Darwin; an accessible and detailed overview of the current state of evolution research. Each strand of knowledge which contributes to our understanding is laid out clearly, starting in many cases with what Darwin knew or intuited when writing On The Origin Of Species. Coyne deftly takes us through the developments in areas such as the fossil record, embryology, vestigial organs, biogeography and genetics; showing how predictions can be made and how discoveries since Darwin's time have confirmed the process of evolution over and over again. Many eye-catching examples are used to demonstrate where we can expect to find fossils in geological layers; how the bodily organisation of modern creatures follows patterns laid down in ancestral forms; and how environmental pressures lead to adaptation. The example of the modern mammalian laryngeal nerve as poor design derived from ancient forms is particularly striking. The nerve is involved in speech and swallowing and connects the brain to the larynx. It wraps around the aorta (a large vessel in the heart) rather than taking a direct route. This is not an issue for an ancient fishlike creature – but in a human the nerve has to be about a foot in length to follow the same route. In a giraffe, which has the same basic body plan, the nerve is three feet long! This is obviously inefficient and may even be more prone to injury, but clearly shows the laryngeal nerve adapting to follow the evolutionary changes in the body pattern.Coyne also shows how these additions to our knowledge efficiently take down the creationist or “intelligent design” arguments. Whilst he concedes that those arguing from faith will probably not change their minds, the book is very much aimed at people who are uncertain about the science. For European readers, this frequent referencing of creationism is a little grating since it is not such a large issue in this part of the world, but it is understandable when the American audience has a much greater background of “disbelief” in evolution [1].The final chapters are devoted to recent human evolution (from the period following divergence from chimps) and an overview of some of the difficulties people have with the possible implications of evolution for human behaviour. Overall, this is an excellent text for anyone who would like to understand the principles of evolution or update their knowledge, written in an entertaining and engaging style.[1] http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313... – unfortunately this, the original article in Science, is paywalled, but you can see a mirror at http://old.richarddawkins.net/article..., including the table comparing “belief” vs “disbelief” in evolution from 34 countries in 2005.

If you are an evolutionist, you'll probably be quite pleased with the book. And there's pity. For many, the book won't be read on its merits but for whether it supports or challenges one's views on the issue of Darwinian evolutionary theory.In terms of the book itself. . . . The purpose is specified by Jerry Coyne, the author, on page xiv: ""This book lays out the main lines of evidence for evolution. For those who oppose Darwinism purely as a matter of faith, no amount of evidence will do--theirs is a belief not based on reason. But for the many who find themselves uncertain, or who accept evolution but are not sure how to argue the case, this volume gives a succinct summary of why modern science recognizes evolution as true.""The book unfolds in a straightforward fashion. Chapter 1 summarizes the nature of evolution. He discusses the essence of the concept of evolution--""a species undergoing genetic change over time"" (page 3). Also discussed is ""natural selection,"" the process by which the more ""fit"" individuals tend to be more successful in reproductive terms That is, they leave more offspring than their less fit peers).Subsequent chapters outline the evidence for evolution, including often jury-rigged adaptations (evolution makes do with the organism/species as it exists and often leaves organisms that are poorly designed--but still capable of successful reproduction: think the lower back of humans!), the fossil record, a more detailed discussion of the process of natural selection, the relationship between sex and evolution, how species arise and develop, and--always an issue that excites passion--the relevance of evolution for humankind.The book itself does well what it sets out to do. There are things that bother me. As with many, the author claims that evolution is a ""fact."" I have never understood this allegation. Neo-Darwinian theory is a THEORY--not a fact. Lots of facts support the theory. By itself, though, it is NOT a fact. I think advocates of evolution shoot themselves in the foot with such an argument. Many, of course, would rejoin, ""It's ONLY a theory."" Such folks also don't know what they're talking about. A good theory is a great thing! Not ""just."" Quantum theory is terrific; Einstein's relativity is a fine theory. And so on.All in all, if the reader wants an accessible advocacy of evolutionary theory, this book does the job nicely. If the reader does not accept it, the book, of course, will not be very compelling."

It goes through the fossil evidence, genetic evidence, geological evidence, and more for Evolution via natural selection (and other naturalistic processes). The author writes in a clear and logical manner, and generally avoids the confrontational polemics that other writers such as Richard Dawkins are prone to.My main objection is that Coyne uses misrepresentations to attack Intelligent Design (ID). He tries to associate ID with Young Earth Creationism many times, arguing that the two are similar or have similar methods. Nothing could be further from the truth. Pro-ID people are NOT making a deduction from religious scriptures; rather they are analyzing the structure of the cell (such as the information encoded in DNA) and making inferences based on that. You might not agree with their conclusions, but you should not try to smear them in a dishonest way.Another issue that I had was that most of Coyne's objections to ID are ""theological"" in nature. What I mean is that he points to ""flaws"" in organisms and basically states: ""An intelligent designer would have done a better job of this.""But these are theological, not scientific, objections; and they have theological, not scientific, answers. Probably because the Designer made the designs bad on purpose - I dunno, perhaps this world wasn't supposed to be perfect in the first place?He admits that materialist scientists do not have an explanation for the origin of life (OOL) as well as the Cambrian Explosion. But then he brings out the stereotypical ""God-of-the-gaps! God-of-the-gaps!"" argument to rebut ID here... I was literally shaking my head out of disappointment (though I wasn't at all surprised). Also, the response to integrated complexity was vague and didn't make much sense to me.I'm currently reading Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design, which is a pro-ID account of OOL. And I can tell you, it is anything but God-of-the-gaps. The entire argument is based on what we do know in biology, not a gap of any kind.I know the above review sounds harsh, but I actually enjoyed reading this book and I do recommend it to anyone who's interested in evolution or the evolution-creation controversy."

However, if you are undecided and truly interested in learning about the wealth of evidence that supports evolution as, indeed, the way (along with sea cucumbers, lichen, platypuses and blue whales) came to be, this is a wonderful book. Even if you already have a fair working knowledge of the theory (and that's theory in the scientific sense, not in the casual ""it's only a theory"" sense), you'll likely find a lot of new and fascinating details herein.All the classic evidence that you learned in school (if you're my age) is here, along with scads of new evidence in fields like microbiology, geology, paleobotany, and many others. The book avoids jargon except when it's needed in order to be specific, defines unfamiliar terms as it goes, explains how the facts in highly diverse areas support one another, points out the numerous areas where evolution would predict X and in fact science finds X, and generally lays out its case in a comprehensive and coherent manner. Happily, it also does so without either proselytizing or haranguing, leaving the reader to make his or her own decision in evaluating the range of interlocking facts presented. The last chapter discusses why certain religious sects have such difficulty accepting evolution, which was also enlightening and interesting.Highly recommended for the lay reader interested in acquiring a solid overview of the scientific evidence for evolution."

Coyne's Why Evolution Is True is a fine place to start. As his unsubtle title suggests, Coyne's purpose is to banish the arguments of creationists and their intelligent design fellow travelers. Much as Darwin did, he draws upon geology and the fossil record; biogeography, or the distribution of plants and animals; and the similarities and differences among living species. But gaps that once frustrated Darwin, such as so-called ""missing links"" in the fossil record, can now be filled. ... ... he builds a strong case for the fact of evolution, and for Darwin's theory of how it works. (That species change over time isn't theoretical; how and why the changes occur is the subject of ""evolutionary theory."") Coyne addresses many of the common creationist arguments head-on, outlining how complex systems such as eyes and biochemical pathways can evolve by natural selection. To his credit, however, the author acknowledges his strategy's fatal flaw: The refusal to accept evolution has precious little to do with reason, logic or evidence. Like the introductory college courses it too-closely resembles, Why Evolution Is True is packed with facts and clear explanations but is unlikely to change many minds."""

It's sad to think that even on this modern day, we still need books to show what is just actually is. It's always my dream to become an evolutionary anthropologist and by reading this book only ignites that passion more! This is a great book on evolution though some might find it to be dry. But the author has thoroughly described how evolution works and presented - as is the case in scientific literatures - a lot of convincing and irrefutable evidence. One thing I liked is the organization of the chapters where Coyne subtly explained the concepts and applied them first on evolution of ""lesser"" organisms, then on to human evolution. For readers who are honest-seekers, do not discount evolution until you have read this book. And for those who are already convinced, this could be a good weapon against Creationists (Intelligent Design proponents)."

The Blind Watchmaker and The Ancestor's Tale are the best books of this genre I have ever read. He is a bit more detailed than Coyne, a bit more lucid, and if I may say so, a bit more exciting, even a bit more poetic.Nevertheless, at under 300 pages, Why Evolution Is True is the best short book I've ever read on the subject. The last chapter, about the implications (and lack of implications) of the theory of evolution for our own species, is very good. And Dawkins himself gives the book high praise.Well worth reading."

This is how I answer when I’m asked - as I am surprisingly often - why I bother to get up in the mornings.” This book helps in its short and concise manner lay the argument for evolution, helping us understand our place in the intricacies of this marvellous world."

266,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42147710-michael-shore,5,Coyne nailed it. A fantastic summary of the basic concepts and evidence for evolution.
267,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"To be more precise and clear, the title of the book should be ""why the modern theory of evolution is true."" Changing the title doesn't make a difference to us the believers of the theory (I'll call the theory Darwinism for short), because we usually accept it as a bundle package. But after reading the book, I realize the theory makes multi-level propositions. ""Evolution happened"" is only one of them. Coyne mentions this structure of Darwinism repeatedly, but I think he could make the book stronger by laying it out at the very beginning. In my own words, the theory of evolution proposes the following hierarchy of propositions:1. Evolutionary change (change in inheritable traits of a population through generations) happened. Not only on the micro level (change of traits within a species) but also the macro level (the transformation of one species into another)2. Natural selection explains most of the microevolutionary change, e.g., the change in beak size of birds.3. Natural selection explains most of the macroevolutionary change, e.g., the origin of birds.4. Natural selection builds complex features in nonhuman species, such as the eyes and the brain.5. Natural selection builds complex features of humans, such as language and consciousness.  Some creationists refuse all propositions above. Some admit (1) but refuse to explain it by natural selection. Others accept natural selection only to a certain level. All of them share one common belief: natural selection cannot make us human to be what we are. As a response, Coyne provides ample evidence to support Darwinism. The evidence includes the following: • Species can be classified and grouped in a tree-like way• Discovery of transitional fossils at predicted locations with the expected age.• Features that only make sense by natural selection: vestiges / atavism / dead DNA / Embryo palimpsest / bad design• Distributions of species across the globe, such as how different species fill similar roles in different areas, how certain species lack on volcanic islands but not on continental islands, and the radiations of endemic species on volcanic islands.• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by artificial selection• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by natural selection in labs and fields• Math simulations that exhibit evolutionary paths to complex features under natural selection. An important lesson I learned from Coyne's enumeration of the evidence above, is to treat the following two things differently: 1) the general evolutionary theory, and 2) individual evolutionary explanations of traits and behaviors. Darwin provides us a beautiful theory. It is so simple, yet so powerful. But beauty does not equal truth. Darwinism is generally correct because scientists have accumulated a huge amount of supporting evidence. An individual evolutionary explanation, however, must bear its own burden of proof. We should not blindly believe in a single evolutionary explanation because there are often multiple competing evolutionary explanations of a trait or behavior. Many of them are inevitable ""just-so stories."" Moreover, natural selection is not the only chisel used by nature the sculptor. Features can be generated by other mechanisms, such as genetic drift and sexual selection. I found the hypothesis explaining the existence of human appendix especially interesting: it is possible that natural selection simply can't shrink the appendix anymore, because before it disappears from shrinking, a smaller appendix gives rise to a higher risk of being blocked.  This lesson also applies to economics, another discipline that is guided by a core theory — the rational choice theory. Again, the core theory might be generally correct, but this does not mean it is correct in every context, far from it.  Coyne also reminds me that most evolutionary explanations of complex human features, no matter how elaborate, are untested and probably untestable. This is unfortunate, because the evolution of such features, especially the evolution of consciousness, seems to be the most intriguing question of all. But to quote Darwin, we should not ""positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."" Instead, we should keep searching for testable theories in the future.  Stray observation:- The book solved a big puzzle I had in high school biology class: why human embryos look so weird and go through phases of development that make no sense.- Darwin did not explain the origin of species in his same-titled book (he would explain it in later books and papers). A better title for The Origin of Species, would have been The Origin of Adaptations."
268,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23258105-dileep-n,5,"tl;dr Evolution is true. The big picture is indisputably clear. What remains is to probe the finer details of the mechanics and processes underlying it. If Coyne's primary goal in writing this book was to convince Creationists that evolution is true, it remains unfulfilled. The people he's trying to convince are precisely the kind whom no amount of evidence supporting evolution can convince. This book lacks the only thing that can convince Creationists and proponents of Intelligent Design - passages from their holy book of choice, or even better, a direct quote from their god of choice, stating evolution is true. Kidding aside, the sad truth is that it is nigh impossible to fight dogma and deeply entrenched beliefs with logic and evidence. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. This book is the result of one such attempt and it is a brilliant one at that. Kudos to Coyne for fighting the good fight. Unless you're the kind of person who relies exclusively on made-up stories from stale, antiquated texts for moral guidance and laws of the natural world, you probably already know evolution is true, or rather, that it is the best explanation we have so far for the origin of life on this planet; and I'm fairly sure you will find this book insightful and enjoyable. The book is full of interesting facts and observations that unequivocally prove that evolution is a scientific fact. Topics that are covered include discovery of fossils, particularly of intermediates; speciation and biogeography; vestigial traits and organs that along with emryology provide a window into the past; genetic drift as an alternative (although minor) engine of evolution besides Darwinian natural selection; the powers of sexual selection; and lastly, the origin of of our own species along with a brief but useful discussion on the dicey issue of race. Along with a historical overview, Coyne also details recent evidence (last three decades) supporting evolution and advances made in paleontology, molecular and evolutionary biology, and a few other fields, which I found very helpful. At one time or another, I'm sure most of us have wondered, ""Now that the pressures of natural selection are largely absent in most human societies, are we still evolving? If so, in what ways?"" I found the beginnings of an answer to this in the penultimate chapter.The crisp, clear, and no-nonsense writing style makes digesting this information-rich book painless. Coyne has also provided handy notes clarifying certain ideas, pointing out opposing viewpoints, and lisiting resources for those interested in exploring a topic further. Several of the books he has mentioned have found their way into my to to-read list.This is a cogent synthesis of facts about evolution and of coherent arguments in its favor. Not only does it satiate your curiosity and expand your mind but it also arms you with knowledge for those uncomfortable engagements with staunch Creationsists. Highly recommended!"
269,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21177142-roger,5,"The title of this book bluntly states its purpose, which is to refute, head on, the claims advanced by creationists and supporters of intelligent design that evolution by natural selection cannot possibly explain how life takes the many forms that it does. Biologist Jerry Coyne convincingly addresses every conceivable argument that could be made against evolution, using numerous examples to explain how life as it exists today must have arisen through evolution. To this end, he covers evidence from:- Fossils and biogeography.- Vestigial organs (eg, our appendix). - Vestigial genes. We have around 2,000 that no longer work because evolution rendered them unnecessary. An example is our gene for the final step in the biosynthesis of vitamin C which became non-functional after we started to consume this essential substance in our diet.- Atavisms (eg, our coccyx). - Embryonic development, where the early embryos of most vertebrates bear a striking resemblance to one another. The human embryo, for example, starts looking like that of a jawless fish, before becoming reptilian, and then mammalian. - Bad design, such as the asymmetric structure of flat, side-swimming fish, such as Dover sole, or the convoluted route taken in mammals by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which covers about 15 feet in the giraffe, to join two points just one foot apart).As Coyne points out, no supreme being would have created these oddities and imperfections unless it was that being’s intention to deceive us into believing they were the outcome of evolution, which seems extremely implausible. This is not a textbook on evolution, so its purpose is not to teach the underlying principles. The reader needs to look elsewhere for detailed explanations of genetics, genomes, DNA, inheritance, population growth, genetic drift, etc, but this is the ideal book for anyone who is open-mindedly sitting on the fence, unsure as to whether or not life arose through evolution, creation or intelligent design. Coyne’s arguments are very compelling although, as he admits, “evolution raises such profound questions of purpose, morality, and meaning that [some people] just can’t accept it no matter how much evidence they see”. He illustrates this point by referring to a talk on evolution he gave in Chicago to a group of businessmen. Afterwards, he was approached by one of the delegates who said, “I found your evidence for evolution very convincing—but I still don’t believe it”."
270,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10329028-gary,4,"I hesitated before buying this book because I was a little put off by the title. I already assumed evolution was ""true"" (as much as any scientific knowledge can be considered ""the truth""), and I was more interested in knowing how it works, and the history of it all, from the first micro-organisms to now. The ""how"" part is covered pretty well, and by covering the ""how"" the author addresses creationist or ""intelligent design"" arguments and provides a clear, rational, and most importantly scientific answer. To be fair, the idea of natural selection and evolution seems simple enough, but how it leads to complex devices like an eyeball seems inexplicable... until it is explained. The creationist arguments are all fair, in the sense that they are perfectly valid questions to ask- until they are answered. But a perfectly valid question isn't the same as a valid objection. The book does a very good job at answering questions and debunking creationist objections in the process of explaining how evolution works, although this isn't the main focus of the book. At points along the way the author pauses to address a creationist objection- debunks it- and moves right along. And its done with such convincing ease that by the end the question is not ""How could evolution be true?"" but ""How could it be otherwise?""I don't think this book will change a creationist's mind, because if mere logical, rational, scientific explanations were all it took, creationism (an appeal to the supernatural rather than the natural) wouldn't exist in the first place. But I don't think that was the intent with this book. The book's title isn't ""Why creationism is wrong."" There is no point in arguing with a creationist whose faith feels threatened by science. If somebody isn't threatened by science then ""more science"" isn't going to change anything. But for the rest of us, laypeople who occasionally hear a creationist argument and think ""Oh, well that seems like a good point, I wonder how Darwanism answers that?"" the answers are here. And eventually, by the end of the book, with a good understanding of how darwanism works, any creationist question no longer seems like a good question- but more of an admission of ""I don't understand how this works.""There is nothing wrong with the statement ""I don't understand how this works"" as long as it is not followed with ""Therefore it can not be true."" Is it any better than saying ""I don't understand how this works, but I'll assume it's true""? No- unless that statement is followed by ""Because I understand the method by which this conclusion was reached."" If you understand the scientific method and think that observation, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, and comparison are really good ways to arrive at a conclusion about something then you will readily accept conclusions reached by those methods without knowing the details. So by understanding and accepting this method as a valid way to understand the world, it is perfectly reasonable to accept knowledge as being ""true"" that was achieved using these methods.You can't, however, argue one way or the other for something without knowing anything about it. I believed evolution to be true because I trusted the method by which the theory was developed, but I wanted to be able to understand the theory itself, and this book did a great job of it.One final note. The author did a great job at addressing the ""Just a theory"" argument. It isn't ""just a theory"", but a ""scientific theory"" which is completely different than ""a random guess with no way of testing it"". There is no point arguing it in a book review. Suffice to say the book spells it out and does a great job. Enough so that I underlined the entire thing.If you want to understand Darwinism, don't be put off by the title. By the end of the book you will understand how it works. The books isn't a defense of the theory but an explanation that is so thorough that it defends itself.I subtracted one star because I wish there was a little more about the timeline of evolution and the different eras of the earth's history. Another chapter would have been nice. "
271,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1643812-andrew,2,"Once again a great scientific mind has stooped to the lowest common denominator; mindlessly bickering with the creationist argument. I was expecting evolution/creationist argument in the preface, maybe even in the first chapter. Unfortunately, It's littered throughout the book. I understand that some readers actually enjoy this mindless drubbing, if so, this book is for you. What I was hoping for was a deeper biological understanding of speciation and specialization, and to Coyne's credit there are anecdotes littered throughout. Sadly, Those anecdotes are merely a way for Coyne to stick out his tongue and say ""I told you so, dummy"", they offer little new insights to those with a baseline understanding of biology. If you like Dawkins,you'll like Coyne, and If you like both I offer some simple advice. Grow up, and read a book with some scientific teeth. I recommend Stephen Jay Gould. If you are like me and are interested in speciation and specialization, I recommend skipping this book, and watching Coyne's lecture.

If only those who are so adamant about ID would crack open this book! Evolution is a beautiful mess. But, the fact that of all the species and of all mutations over billions of years, we are the only ones who have been awarded reason and a complex brain- that, to me, is far more meaningful and beautiful than to think someone created us and ""blessed us"" with it. We managed to become who we are, through billions of years of genetic fight. We are special, and we are here. Wow.

The author has a remarkably humble tone as he describes both the assertive truth of evolution as well as the ongoing process of unfinished learning of science (e.g., the study of biogenesis, the beginning of the universe, evolutionary psychology, evolution's inability to stand alone as an ethical/moral system, etc.). I believe that this book was well worth the time to read.Evolution can by no means explain everything about the world around us, but contrary to the opinions of many creationists/ID advocates, it does not presume to. This is the essence of science: the search for knowledge rather than the presumption of it.Why Evolution is True is an excellent popular treatise of evolution because it makes clear these points, and is honest about the shortcomings (both real and imagined) of modern evolutionary theory.

279,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,4,"Let me tell you a little story.In high school, I was taught science from a ""Creationist"" perspective. I did who-knows-how-many research projects and papers on ""Creation versus Evolution"". I became pretty knowledgeable about the subject (or so I thought). I owned a tome titled ""Science vs Evolution"", a graduation present from my biology teacher, and could give all the talking points on why Darwinism was false.Fast forward a number of years. I can't pinpoint the moment when my perspective changed. I think it started with a nagging suspicion that, despite all the Creationist videos I had watched and the articles I had read, I had never truly, actually heard the argument for evolution from evolutionary scientists themselves, and only knew the distorted interpretations of their arguments from their ""critics"".I changed my mind, ultimately, not because of a wealth of scientific rebuttals to combat every objection of Intelligent Design advocates. It came down to a simple matter of logic.That logic is this: The theory of evolution came about from the scientific process. Predictions are made, evidence is gathered, and conclusions are drawn. At every turn, for more than a century, the assumptions about evolution have been rigorously questioned, challenged, and tested under scientific scrutiny.And throughout this process, the theory of evolution has not only survived, but become stronger and more deeply understood. And it is overwhelmingly accepted by scientists.Contrast this with the idea of Intelligent Design, or Creationism. This concept does not start with predictions that can be completely questioned or re-thought at any moment; it cannot flexibly follow the evidence, wherever it leads.Creationism begins with a conclusion, and seeks evidence to support that conclusion.In other words, the theory of evolution is scientific. Creationism is not.I had become convinced of evolution from a logical perspective, but I still did not understand it. I did not have the high school education most people get on the subject. I still had all those talking points from Answers in Genesis that I knew were false, but didn't have responses for.This book, Why Evolution is True, became the perfect answer to my needs. Coyne lays out the mechanisms of and evidence for evolution in very easy-to-understand, eye-opening terms that the average, non-scientific reader can absorb and enjoy.It's also relatively short (not a difficult read), while still astonishingly robust in the power of its evidence and strength of its arguments.I came to this book already convinced of evolution; I came way fully understanding it (for the first time), and EXCITED about its awesomeness. Seriously, evolution is... REALLY COOL???I'm greatly appreciative of the author for writing this, and helping me to fill a gap in my knowledge... while also helping me discovery the pure joy and wonder that comes with knowing our origins.Buuuuuuut... he does get one tiny star bumped off, and this is for purely opinionated reasons, but in his discussions of gender he sometimes lapsed into what I can only call ""male arrogance"". The way he talked about men and women just grated on my nerves. Not what he said was untrue or anything, just written in an annoying way that felt way too comfortable with male superiority. My objection is completely non-intellectual and subjective, but hey! This is my review! I can give whatever stars I wanted!In all seriousness, this book is amazing. It will doubtlessly be my default recommendation for fence-sitters, skeptics, and other people who lacked an honest education in the fact of evolution like I did."

Learning about evolution, the process and time that goes into this makes you just respect and admire our environment and animals even more. -Firstly, Coyne discusses about creationism and evolution. He often includes antidotes throughout the book. Its so unbelievable that there are people out there who don’t believe in evolution!!There are references from Darwin’s book “The Origin”, other authors and scientists who have worked in this field. Introducing different viewpoints to us. -Then it continues with Coyne explaining different theories and concepts of evolution. This isn’t much of a rocket science. It just requires basic comprehension of species and biology and I think it’s pretty easy to grip on. -Along with facts and views, Coyne mentions alot of studies conducted on fossils and how they helped in grouping and combining the story of evolution. It’s really an engaging study and this has actually amplified my interest in fossils.-In addition to this the author addresses evolution in different aspects of wildlife such as in aquatic animals, birds, mammals etc. Coyne also describes at length natural selection , vestigial organs, genetics etc.-Altogether the book is filled with engrossing examples and it’s so amusing. There are images for references which make it easier to interpret description the author provides. -lastly, I do have a suggestion, Coyne mentions various kinds of animals, insects, birds, and not all of them have a visual representation in the book. I suggest you use google to understand their anatomy and explore various journals or articles. It might take extra time but I think this just adds another layer of knowledge to the read. This book really is an eye opener. Overall brilliant book! I would recommend it:) "
281,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25797445-eugene,5,"Why Evolution is True is a very interesting and thought provoking read. Detailed yet written for the lay person, Jerry Coyne does a phenomenal job of clearly laying out the evidence for Darwinian evolution from a common ancestor and why it is unanimously accepted by all scientists not already predisposed to creationism. From the fossil record and DNA sequencing to continental drift and speciation, he not only lays out the multiple lines of evidence but also shows the countless predictions that have been made using the evolutionary model, and counters each example by explaining how creationism fails these predictions and doesn't yield what we would expect to find were it the case. I have a very limited scientific background, but had no trouble understanding most of the book. On top of arguing the scientific evidence, he also does well at addressing common social and moral objections to evolution. The last chapter describes how contrary to popular (usually creationist) belief, evolution properly understood does not lend itself to racism. Races evolved to adapt better to various environments as branches spreading out on the evolutionary tree, and there is nothing to suggest any sort of racial superiority. Likewise Coyne debunks the popular but misguided argument that believing evolution will make people lose all sense of morality. Quite contrary, the more we learn about how our social behaviours evolved and how our brains developed to comprehend all these questions, the more we can appreciate the value of our lives. My only contention is how he subtly seems to slip in his anti-theist presupposition toward the end by saying appeal to the supernatural is not necessary when discussing origins. It may not be necessary, but it would be more accurate to say science and the God debate fall under seperate, non overlapping categories as one deals purely in falsifiable claims while the other does not. That being said, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is curious to learn more about evolution and its implications written in a very matter of fact, unbiased way."

So why, when evolution is being reconfirmed every day, and forms the backbone of modern biology, do we need a book entitled Why Evolution Is True?""It's just as the description above has said, the evidence that supporting Evolution is enormous, starting from the first life on Earth until the evolution of Homo-sapiens. Every single life is just as Darwin had predicted, you won't find a fossil that exists in the Cambrian Age in the Precambrian Age and vice versa. In fact Evolution declared a bet as the evolutionist Richard Dawkins said: ""To those who has doubts about Evolution to scratch hardly in the Rocks to find an unsuitable fossil, we challenge them to that, will they accept the bet?"" In ""Why Evolution Is True"", Jerry A Coyne takes us to a journey in the Wonders of Natural Selection. He started with what a scientific theory means and then he goes on to explain the endless evidence of evolution and connecting it with everything around us, ""Some claim that evolution is just a theory, as if it were merely an opinion. But evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact. Evolution really happened. Accepting our kinship with all life on Earth is not only solid science ... in my view it's also a soaring spiritual experience."" –Neil deGrasse TysonYour body is a proof of multiple enhancing processes that have been done over millions of years starting from your individual cells to genes to last nerve in your Brain, for example the way human born is one of the best examples that we are descending from birds, by time the human evolved the way of giving birth doesn't change, the body of the baby turned upside down and the head of the baby (which becomes significantly bigger than that of our ancestors) faced the entrance of the womb, here we have to say isn't it ridiculous for God to do something like that, I mean why would He even blueprint-ed (or design) us with something very painful and can threatened the life of the mother just to prove something nothing than His sadistic nature of enjoying the screams of the mothers. Then he talked about Mutation and how it was at first the stick that Creationists wave on the face of Evolutionists every time they started a debate, he also mentioned and shed some lights on Linski's magnificent experiment on E-coli Bacteria which took 20 years and opened the gate in front of us to witness that ""Natural Selection + Mutations + Time = Darwin was Right""After that he talked about neuroscience and that evolution also has the ability to describe Morals and that Morals are not something comes up with Religion, it's something far more than that, it's something we might inherited it but mostly we gain it by practicing (eg: The Chimpanzees experiment). Jerry also explained that evolution doesn't necessarily mean to evolve into something more sophisticated, there's also a ""Redox Evolution"" which for example the evolution of Whales from Reptiles. I know I haven't wrote much and I won't, coz if you want to know something you have to dig for it, but what I'm totally convinced about is that the evidence evolution provides are stronger, reliable and more scientific than the Ideal Design provides, and that the idea of us coming from Adam and Eve is nothing but a Myth. It's not my words it's what science told us with EVIDENCE. It's as Carl Sagan said: “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.” – Cosmos."
283,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95929927-christian,4,"""I certainly make no claim to be the Milton of Darwinism. But I can at least try to dispel the misconceptions that frighten people away from evolution and from the amazing derivation of life’s staggering diversity from a single naked replicating molecule.""Such is the writing style of Jerry Coyne, an accessible and well-versed author and research professor of evolutionary biology. This landmark work should have staying power in the annals of popular science, though it is lacking in philosophical nuance and subtlety. It is not intended to be a textbook for academics but rather a treatise to persuade anyone without a background in the subject. He is strong in his convictions and forceful in his rhetoric; a blog of the same name may be consulted for further reading and development of his thinking in this area.Why Evolution Is True is a serious page-turner. Coyne has a gift for conveying complex ideas and anyone of high-school education should not have trouble following his arguments.Far easier to understand than other overviews like Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, the primary focus is the direct evidence and ever-mounting proof which we have amassed since Darwin's formulation of the theory nearly two centuries ago. If one went into this topic without any knowledge the book would serve as a comprehensive introduction to the topic and its fundamental concepts, though they will miss out on discussion of related issues, e.g. memes and extended phenotype.Coyne makes the commendable decision to anticipate objections to each of his chapters, much like Darwin did in later editions of On the Origin of Species; he knows that evolution is a contested and widely-misunderstood field and that minds tend to be closed to its authenticity. There are some questions that are oft-raised without sufficient answer in the public square: how did the eye form if not by a miracle? Of what use is half a wing to an evolving bird, and how could that possibly be selected for? He tackles these deftly and head-on, giving answers and insight that reflect his depth of knowledge.Near the end of chapter 9 we are given this summary:""Evolution is simply a theory about the process and patterns of life’s diversification, not a grand philosophical scheme about the meaning of life... Most of us do need meaning, purpose, and moral guidance in our lives. How do we find them if we accept that evolution is the real story of our origin? That question is outside the domain of science.""He then proceeds to dismiss all answers outside of naturalism and materialism outright, which shows the limitations of his view in dialogue with contrasting opinions. Coyne does not attempt to appear as an unbiased explicator of evolutionary theory. This is a minor problem in the scope of the work, and perhaps a deserved one; he could hardly be more vindicated due to the sheer force of evidence for macroevolution. It makes me wonder if a more dispassionate approach could have been helpful. There are, despite his bewilderment, religious people who believe in evolution.He leaves us with a pithy and hopeful quote:""Evolution tells us where we came from, not where we can go.""I would definitely recommend this work to anyone who is curious about the developments in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural and sexual selection. As long as they are open to the evidence and don't mind the occasional sneer from the author, by the end there should be little doubt that evolution is, in fact, true."
284,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6350127-seawood,5,"Read for Coursera ""Writing in the Sciences"" and ""Genetics & Evolution"" courses.Why Evolution Is True is a love-letter to Charles Darwin; an accessible and detailed overview of the current state of evolution research. Each strand of knowledge which contributes to our understanding is laid out clearly, starting in many cases with what Darwin knew or intuited when writing On The Origin Of Species. Coyne deftly takes us through the developments in areas such as the fossil record, embryology, vestigial organs, biogeography and genetics; showing how predictions can be made and how discoveries since Darwin's time have confirmed the process of evolution over and over again. Many eye-catching examples are used to demonstrate where we can expect to find fossils in geological layers; how the bodily organisation of modern creatures follows patterns laid down in ancestral forms; and how environmental pressures lead to adaptation. The example of the modern mammalian laryngeal nerve as poor design derived from ancient forms is particularly striking. The nerve is involved in speech and swallowing and connects the brain to the larynx. It wraps around the aorta (a large vessel in the heart) rather than taking a direct route. This is not an issue for an ancient fishlike creature – but in a human the nerve has to be about a foot in length to follow the same route. In a giraffe, which has the same basic body plan, the nerve is three feet long! This is obviously inefficient and may even be more prone to injury, but clearly shows the laryngeal nerve adapting to follow the evolutionary changes in the body pattern.Coyne also shows how these additions to our knowledge efficiently take down the creationist or “intelligent design” arguments. Whilst he concedes that those arguing from faith will probably not change their minds, the book is very much aimed at people who are uncertain about the science. For European readers, this frequent referencing of creationism is a little grating since it is not such a large issue in this part of the world, but it is understandable when the American audience has a much greater background of “disbelief” in evolution [1].The final chapters are devoted to recent human evolution (from the period following divergence from chimps) and an overview of some of the difficulties people have with the possible implications of evolution for human behaviour. Overall, this is an excellent text for anyone who would like to understand the principles of evolution or update their knowledge, written in an entertaining and engaging style.[1] http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313... – unfortunately this, the original article in Science, is paywalled, but you can see a mirror at http://old.richarddawkins.net/article..., including the table comparing “belief” vs “disbelief” in evolution from 34 countries in 2005.

285,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson,4,"I read this book a while back and really enjoyed it. Note: If you are a creationist, you will doubtless NOT enjoy this. If you are an evolutionist, you'll probably be quite pleased with the book. And there's pity. For many, the book won't be read on its merits but for whether it supports or challenges one's views on the issue of Darwinian evolutionary theory.In terms of the book itself. . . . The purpose is specified by Jerry Coyne, the author, on page xiv: ""This book lays out the main lines of evidence for evolution. For those who oppose Darwinism purely as a matter of faith, no amount of evidence will do--theirs is a belief not based on reason. But for the many who find themselves uncertain, or who accept evolution but are not sure how to argue the case, this volume gives a succinct summary of why modern science recognizes evolution as true.""The book unfolds in a straightforward fashion. Chapter 1 summarizes the nature of evolution. He discusses the essence of the concept of evolution--""a species undergoing genetic change over time"" (page 3). Also discussed is ""natural selection,"" the process by which the more ""fit"" individuals tend to be more successful in reproductive terms That is, they leave more offspring than their less fit peers).Subsequent chapters outline the evidence for evolution, including often jury-rigged adaptations (evolution makes do with the organism/species as it exists and often leaves organisms that are poorly designed--but still capable of successful reproduction: think the lower back of humans!), the fossil record, a more detailed discussion of the process of natural selection, the relationship between sex and evolution, how species arise and develop, and--always an issue that excites passion--the relevance of evolution for humankind.The book itself does well what it sets out to do. There are things that bother me. As with many, the author claims that evolution is a ""fact."" I have never understood this allegation. Neo-Darwinian theory is a THEORY--not a fact. Lots of facts support the theory. By itself, though, it is NOT a fact. I think advocates of evolution shoot themselves in the foot with such an argument. Many, of course, would rejoin, ""It's ONLY a theory."" Such folks also don't know what they're talking about. A good theory is a great thing! Not ""just."" Quantum theory is terrific; Einstein's relativity is a fine theory. And so on.All in all, if the reader wants an accessible advocacy of evolutionary theory, this book does the job nicely. If the reader does not accept it, the book, of course, will not be very compelling."
286,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36384001-yousuf,2,"Good Overview, But Contains Straw MenThis is a good summary for the pro-Evolution side if anyone is researching the evolution-creation controversy. It goes through the fossil evidence, genetic evidence, geological evidence, and more for Evolution via natural selection (and other naturalistic processes). The author writes in a clear and logical manner, and generally avoids the confrontational polemics that other writers such as Richard Dawkins are prone to.My main objection is that Coyne uses misrepresentations to attack Intelligent Design (ID). He tries to associate ID with Young Earth Creationism many times, arguing that the two are similar or have similar methods. Nothing could be further from the truth. Pro-ID people are NOT making a deduction from religious scriptures; rather they are analyzing the structure of the cell (such as the information encoded in DNA) and making inferences based on that. You might not agree with their conclusions, but you should not try to smear them in a dishonest way.Another issue that I had was that most of Coyne's objections to ID are ""theological"" in nature. What I mean is that he points to ""flaws"" in organisms and basically states: ""An intelligent designer would have done a better job of this.""But these are theological, not scientific, objections; and they have theological, not scientific, answers. Probably because the Designer made the designs bad on purpose - I dunno, perhaps this world wasn't supposed to be perfect in the first place?He admits that materialist scientists do not have an explanation for the origin of life (OOL) as well as the Cambrian Explosion. But then he brings out the stereotypical ""God-of-the-gaps! God-of-the-gaps!"" argument to rebut ID here... I was literally shaking my head out of disappointment (though I wasn't at all surprised). Also, the response to integrated complexity was vague and didn't make much sense to me.I'm currently reading Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design, which is a pro-ID account of OOL. And I can tell you, it is anything but God-of-the-gaps. The entire argument is based on what we do know in biology, not a gap of any kind.I know the above review sounds harsh, but I actually enjoyed reading this book and I do recommend it to anyone who's interested in evolution or the evolution-creation controversy."

However, if you are undecided and truly interested in learning about the wealth of evidence that supports evolution as, indeed, the way (along with sea cucumbers, lichen, platypuses and blue whales) came to be, this is a wonderful book. Even if you already have a fair working knowledge of the theory (and that's theory in the scientific sense, not in the casual ""it's only a theory"" sense), you'll likely find a lot of new and fascinating details herein.All the classic evidence that you learned in school (if you're my age) is here, along with scads of new evidence in fields like microbiology, geology, paleobotany, and many others. The book avoids jargon except when it's needed in order to be specific, defines unfamiliar terms as it goes, explains how the facts in highly diverse areas support one another, points out the numerous areas where evolution would predict X and in fact science finds X, and generally lays out its case in a comprehensive and coherent manner. Happily, it also does so without either proselytizing or haranguing, leaving the reader to make his or her own decision in evaluating the range of interlocking facts presented. The last chapter discusses why certain religious sects have such difficulty accepting evolution, which was also enlightening and interesting.Highly recommended for the lay reader interested in acquiring a solid overview of the scientific evidence for evolution."

Coyne's Why Evolution Is True is a fine place to start. As his unsubtle title suggests, Coyne's purpose is to banish the arguments of creationists and their intelligent design fellow travelers. Much as Darwin did, he draws upon geology and the fossil record; biogeography, or the distribution of plants and animals; and the similarities and differences among living species. But gaps that once frustrated Darwin, such as so-called ""missing links"" in the fossil record, can now be filled. ... ... he builds a strong case for the fact of evolution, and for Darwin's theory of how it works. (That species change over time isn't theoretical; how and why the changes occur is the subject of ""evolutionary theory."") Coyne addresses many of the common creationist arguments head-on, outlining how complex systems such as eyes and biochemical pathways can evolve by natural selection. To his credit, however, the author acknowledges his strategy's fatal flaw: The refusal to accept evolution has precious little to do with reason, logic or evidence. Like the introductory college courses it too-closely resembles, Why Evolution Is True is packed with facts and clear explanations but is unlikely to change many minds."""

It's sad to think that even on this modern day, we still need books to show what is just actually is. It's always my dream to become an evolutionary anthropologist and by reading this book only ignites that passion more! This is a great book on evolution though some might find it to be dry. But the author has thoroughly described how evolution works and presented - as is the case in scientific literatures - a lot of convincing and irrefutable evidence. One thing I liked is the organization of the chapters where Coyne subtly explained the concepts and applied them first on evolution of ""lesser"" organisms, then on to human evolution. For readers who are honest-seekers, do not discount evolution until you have read this book. And for those who are already convinced, this could be a good weapon against Creationists (Intelligent Design proponents)."

The Blind Watchmaker and The Ancestor's Tale are the best books of this genre I have ever read. He is a bit more detailed than Coyne, a bit more lucid, and if I may say so, a bit more exciting, even a bit more poetic.Nevertheless, at under 300 pages, Why Evolution Is True is the best short book I've ever read on the subject. The last chapter, about the implications (and lack of implications) of the theory of evolution for our own species, is very good. And Dawkins himself gives the book high praise.Well worth reading."

296,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42147710-michael-shore,5,Coyne nailed it. A fantastic summary of the basic concepts and evidence for evolution.
297,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86576157-minervas-owl,4,"To be more precise and clear, the title of the book should be ""why the modern theory of evolution is true."" Changing the title doesn't make a difference to us the believers of the theory (I'll call the theory Darwinism for short), because we usually accept it as a bundle package. But after reading the book, I realize the theory makes multi-level propositions. ""Evolution happened"" is only one of them. Coyne mentions this structure of Darwinism repeatedly, but I think he could make the book stronger by laying it out at the very beginning. In my own words, the theory of evolution proposes the following hierarchy of propositions:1. Evolutionary change (change in inheritable traits of a population through generations) happened. Not only on the micro level (change of traits within a species) but also the macro level (the transformation of one species into another)2. Natural selection explains most of the microevolutionary change, e.g., the change in beak size of birds.3. Natural selection explains most of the macroevolutionary change, e.g., the origin of birds.4. Natural selection builds complex features in nonhuman species, such as the eyes and the brain.5. Natural selection builds complex features of humans, such as language and consciousness.  Some creationists refuse all propositions above. Some admit (1) but refuse to explain it by natural selection. Others accept natural selection only to a certain level. All of them share one common belief: natural selection cannot make us human to be what we are. As a response, Coyne provides ample evidence to support Darwinism. The evidence includes the following: • Species can be classified and grouped in a tree-like way• Discovery of transitional fossils at predicted locations with the expected age.• Features that only make sense by natural selection: vestiges / atavism / dead DNA / Embryo palimpsest / bad design• Distributions of species across the globe, such as how different species fill similar roles in different areas, how certain species lack on volcanic islands but not on continental islands, and the radiations of endemic species on volcanic islands.• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by artificial selection• Speed and capacity of adaption caused by natural selection in labs and fields• Math simulations that exhibit evolutionary paths to complex features under natural selection. An important lesson I learned from Coyne's enumeration of the evidence above, is to treat the following two things differently: 1) the general evolutionary theory, and 2) individual evolutionary explanations of traits and behaviors. Darwin provides us a beautiful theory. It is so simple, yet so powerful. But beauty does not equal truth. Darwinism is generally correct because scientists have accumulated a huge amount of supporting evidence. An individual evolutionary explanation, however, must bear its own burden of proof. We should not blindly believe in a single evolutionary explanation because there are often multiple competing evolutionary explanations of a trait or behavior. Many of them are inevitable ""just-so stories."" Moreover, natural selection is not the only chisel used by nature the sculptor. Features can be generated by other mechanisms, such as genetic drift and sexual selection. I found the hypothesis explaining the existence of human appendix especially interesting: it is possible that natural selection simply can't shrink the appendix anymore, because before it disappears from shrinking, a smaller appendix gives rise to a higher risk of being blocked.  This lesson also applies to economics, another discipline that is guided by a core theory — the rational choice theory. Again, the core theory might be generally correct, but this does not mean it is correct in every context, far from it.  Coyne also reminds me that most evolutionary explanations of complex human features, no matter how elaborate, are untested and probably untestable. This is unfortunate, because the evolution of such features, especially the evolution of consciousness, seems to be the most intriguing question of all. But to quote Darwin, we should not ""positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science."" Instead, we should keep searching for testable theories in the future.  Stray observation:- The book solved a big puzzle I had in high school biology class: why human embryos look so weird and go through phases of development that make no sense.- Darwin did not explain the origin of species in his same-titled book (he would explain it in later books and papers). A better title for The Origin of Species, would have been The Origin of Adaptations."
298,0670020532,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23258105-dileep-n,5,"tl;dr Evolution is true. The big picture is indisputably clear. What remains is to probe the finer details of the mechanics and processes underlying it. If Coyne's primary goal in writing this book was to convince Creationists that evolution is true, it remains unfulfilled. The people he's trying to convince are precisely the kind whom no amount of evidence supporting evolution can convince. This book lacks the only thing that can convince Creationists and proponents of Intelligent Design - passages from their holy book of choice, or even better, a direct quote from their god of choice, stating evolution is true. Kidding aside, the sad truth is that it is nigh impossible to fight dogma and deeply entrenched beliefs with logic and evidence. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. This book is the result of one such attempt and it is a brilliant one at that. Kudos to Coyne for fighting the good fight. Unless you're the kind of person who relies exclusively on made-up stories from stale, antiquated texts for moral guidance and laws of the natural world, you probably already know evolution is true, or rather, that it is the best explanation we have so far for the origin of life on this planet; and I'm fairly sure you will find this book insightful and enjoyable. The book is full of interesting facts and observations that unequivocally prove that evolution is a scientific fact. Topics that are covered include discovery of fossils, particularly of intermediates; speciation and biogeography; vestigial traits and organs that along with emryology provide a window into the past; genetic drift as an alternative (although minor) engine of evolution besides Darwinian natural selection; the powers of sexual selection; and lastly, the origin of of our own species along with a brief but useful discussion on the dicey issue of race. Along with a historical overview, Coyne also details recent evidence (last three decades) supporting evolution and advances made in paleontology, molecular and evolutionary biology, and a few other fields, which I found very helpful. At one time or another, I'm sure most of us have wondered, ""Now that the pressures of natural selection are largely absent in most human societies, are we still evolving? If so, in what ways?"" I found the beginnings of an answer to this in the penultimate chapter.The crisp, clear, and no-nonsense writing style makes digesting this information-rich book painless. Coyne has also provided handy notes clarifying certain ideas, pointing out opposing viewpoints, and lisiting resources for those interested in exploring a topic further. Several of the books he has mentioned have found their way into my to to-read list.This is a cogent synthesis of facts about evolution and of coherent arguments in its favor. Not only does it satiate your curiosity and expand your mind but it also arms you with knowledge for those uncomfortable engagements with staunch Creationsists. Highly recommended!"

Biologist Jerry Coyne convincingly addresses every conceivable argument that could be made against evolution, using numerous examples to explain how life as it exists today must have arisen through evolution. To this end, he covers evidence from:- Fossils and biogeography.- Vestigial organs (eg, our appendix). - Vestigial genes. We have around 2,000 that no longer work because evolution rendered them unnecessary. An example is our gene for the final step in the biosynthesis of vitamin C which became non-functional after we started to consume this essential substance in our diet.- Atavisms (eg, our coccyx). - Embryonic development, where the early embryos of most vertebrates bear a striking resemblance to one another. The human embryo, for example, starts looking like that of a jawless fish, before becoming reptilian, and then mammalian. - Bad design, such as the asymmetric structure of flat, side-swimming fish, such as Dover sole, or the convoluted route taken in mammals by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which covers about 15 feet in the giraffe, to join two points just one foot apart).As Coyne points out, no supreme being would have created these oddities and imperfections unless it was that being’s intention to deceive us into believing they were the outcome of evolution, which seems extremely implausible. This is not a textbook on evolution, so its purpose is not to teach the underlying principles. The reader needs to look elsewhere for detailed explanations of genetics, genomes, DNA, inheritance, population growth, genetic drift, etc, but this is the ideal book for anyone who is open-mindedly sitting on the fence, unsure as to whether or not life arose through evolution, creation or intelligent design. Coyne’s arguments are very compelling although, as he admits, “evolution raises such profound questions of purpose, morality, and meaning that [some people] just can’t accept it no matter how much evidence they see”. He illustrates this point by referring to a talk on evolution he gave in Chicago to a group of businessmen. Afterwards, he was approached by one of the delegates who said, “I found your evidence for evolution very convincing—but I still don’t believe it”."
