Look for yourself. This is the concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz. This is where people were turned into numbers. Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some four million people. And that was not done by gas. It was done by arrogance, it was done by dogma, it was done by ignorance. When people believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality, this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods.Science is a very human form of knowledge. We are always at the brink of the known; we always feel forward for what is to be hoped. Every judgment in science stands on the edge of error and is personal. Science is a tribute to what we can know although we are fallible. In the end, the words were said by Oliver Cromwell: ""I beseech you in the bowels of Christ: Think it possible you may be mistaken.""I owe it as a scientist to my friend Leo Szilard, I owe it as a human being to the many members of my family who died here, to stand here as a survivor and a witness. We have to cure ourselves of the itch for absolute knowledge and power. We have to close the distance between the push-button order and the human act. We have to touch people."" — 
The Ascent of Man
"

Fifty years from now, if an understanding of man’s origins, his evolution, his history, his progress is not in the common place of the school books, we shall not exist.
I watched this series right after finishing Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation, as I’d heard The Ascent of Man described as a companion piece. So like my review of Clark’s work, this review is about the documentary and not the book (though since the book is just a transcription of the series, I’m sure it applies to both).  The Ascent of Man is a remarkable program. I had doubts that anyone could produce a series to match Civilisation, but Bronowski made something that might even be better. Bronowski was a polymath: he did work in mathematics, biology, physics, history, and even poetry. In this program, his topic is the history of science. Yet for Bronowski, the word “science” not only refers to the modern scientific method, but rather encompasses all of humanity’s efforts to understand and manipulate the natural world.  We thus begin with Homo erectus, learning how to chip away stone to make tools. As Bronowski notes, this simple ability, to chip away at a stone until a cutting edge is left, is a remarkable indication of human uniqueness. Since the behavior is learned and is not an instinct, it requires a preconception of what the toolmaker wants to create, a certain amount of imagination is required to picture the goal before it is realized. What’s more, creating a stone tool requires a sense of the structural properties of the rock. (I’ve actually tried making stone tools with various types of rock, and let me tell you that it’s not so easy. Even with an archaeologist giving me advice, I was only able to create stone tools of the sophistication of an Australopithecus—randomly beating the stone until a sharp edge was created.) Thus both our creative drive and our knowledge are involved in this quintessentially human activity. “Every animal leaves traces of what he was. Man alone leaves traces of what he created.” This brings Bronowski to one of his main points, one of the themes of this series: that art and science are not fundamentally different; rather, they are two manifestations of the human spirit. What is this human spirit? It is a composite of many qualities, what Bronowski calls “a jigsaw of human faculties,” which include our wide behavioral flexibility, our capacity to play, our need to create, our curiosity about the natural world, our sense of adventure, our love of variety. Indeed, these can be pithily described by saying that humans retain many childlike characteristics throughout their lives. The name of the last episode is “The Long Childhood.” One of my favorite sequences in this documentary is when Bronowski takes the viewer from the posts and lintels of the Greek temples, to the arches in the Roman aqueduct in Segovia, to the somewhat prettier arches in the Mezquita in Cordoba, to the cathedral at Reims with its magnificent flying buttresses. Each of these structures, he explains, is a more sophisticated solution to this problem: how do you create a covered space out of stone? The lintel and post system used by the Greeks leads to a forest of columns, and the Mezquita, although less crowded, is still filled with arches. The Medieval Christians achieved a magnificent solution by placing the buttresses on the outside, thus leading to the towering, open interior of Reims. We’re used to thinking of this development as an architectural triumph, but as Bronowski points out, it was also an intellectual triumph. This progression represents better and better understandings of the structural properties of stone, of the force of gravity, and of the distribution of weight. And when you see it play out in front of your eyes, it’s hard to shake the impression that these marvelous works are also progressively more elegant solutions to a mathematical puzzle. This is just one example of Bronowski’s talent: to see the artistic in the scientific and the scientific in the artistic; and he does this by seeing the human spirit in all of it. Here’s another example. Bronowski wants to talk about how humanity has come to understand space, and how this understanding of space underpins our knowledge of structure. How does he do it? He goes to the Alhambra, and analyzes the symmetry in the tiles of the Moorish Palace. Then, he bends down and spreads a bunch of crystals on the ground, and begins to talk about the molecular symmetry that gave rise to them. It’s such a stunning juxtaposition. How many people would think to compare Moorish architecture with modern chemistry? But it’s so appropriate and so revealing that I couldn’t help but be awed. As the title suggests, this series is not simply about science (or art), but about science through history. Bronowski aims to show how humanity, once freed from the constraints of instinct, used a combination of logic and imagination to achieve ever-deeper conceptions of our place in the universe. This is the Ascent of Man: a quest for self knowledge. It’s sometimes hard for us moderns to grasp this, but consider that we are living in one of the brief times in history that we can explain the formation of the earth, the origin of our species, and even the workings of our own brains. Imagine not knowing any of that. It’s hard to envy former ages when you consider that their sense of their place of the universe was based on myth supported by authority, or was simply a mystery. I’m sure (and I earnestly hope) that future generations will believe the same about us.  Bronowski’s final message is a plea to continue this ascent. This means spreading a understanding and an appreciation of science, as his programs tries to do. This strikes me as terribly important. I’ve met so many people who say things like “Science is a form of faith” or “Science can’t solve every problem” or “Science is dehumanizing and arrogant.” It’s sad to hear intelligent people say things like this, for it simply isn’t true. It’s an abuse of language to call science a faith; then what isn’t? And yes, of course science can’t solve every problem and can’t answer every question; but can anything? Science can solve some problems, and can do so very well. And science, as Bronowski points out, is the very opposite of dehumanizing and arrogant. Science is a most human form of knowledge, born of humility of our intellectual powers, based on repeated mistakes and guesses, always pressing forward into the unknown, always revising its opinions based on evidence. Atrocities are committed, not by people who are trained to question their own beliefs, but by ideologues who are convinced they are right. This is Bronowski’s essential message. But like in any good story, the telling is half of it. As I’ve mentioned above, Bronowski and his team are brilliant at finding unexpected ways to illustrate abstract ideas. This series is full of wonderful and striking visual illustrations of Bronowski’s points. On top of this, the man is a natural storyteller, and effectively brings to life many of this series’ heroes: Newton, Galileo, Alfred Russell Wallace, Mendel. He’s also a poet; one of his books is a study of William Blake’s poetry. This not only gives him a knack for similes, but helps him to explain how science is fundamentally creative. One of my favorite scenes is when Bronowski compares abstract portraits of a man to the ways that various scientific instruments—radar, infrared, cameras, X-rays—detect the man’s face. As he explains, both the portrait and these readings are interpretations of their subjects.The cinematography is also excellent. There are some sequences in this documentary that are still impressive, saturated as we are with CGI. There are even some quite psychedelic sections. One of my favorite of these was a sequence of microscopic shots of human cells with Pink Floyd (who contributed music) jamming chaotically in the background. Unlike in Clark’s Civilisation, which uses exclusively ‘classical’ music and is devoid of special effects, the style of this documentary is surprisingly modern and even edgy. Another thing Bronowski does that Clark doesn’t, is include some information on non-Western cultures, from Meso-America, Japan, China, and Easter Island. Yes, there are some parts of this that are outdated. Most obviously, much of the scientific information is no longer accurate—particularly the information on human evolution in the first episode. This is unavoidable, and is in fact a tribute to the ideals Bronowski championed. More jarring is Bronowski’s somewhat negative assessments of the culture of Easter Island and the lifestyle of nomadic peoples. Less controversially, he also has some negative words to say about Hegel. (Did you know Hegel published an absurd thesis when he was young about how the distance of the orbits of the planets had to conform to a number series?) Another mark of this program’s age is that Bronowski several times shows nudity and even a human birth. This would never fly on television today, at least not in the States. But these signs of age are minor, and the program remains a tremendous accomplishment. The Ascent of Man is a landmark in the history of science education and of documentary making, and a stirring vision of the progress of humanity by an brilliant and sympathetic man. I hope you get a chance to watch it."

What is explained by the man, is nothing short of crystal clear descriptions of Humankind's physical, scientific, sociological and theological discoveries from the very first roaming tribes to our modern era. It is presented, stripped of the wordy, overly philosophical ramblings and data heavy meanderings found in other books that cover similar subject matter. Concise, endearing, earthy, genius. A must for anybody who needs a refresher course on general science, anthropology, physics etc."
3,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12006755-paul-brogan,2,"There are two things to remember about this book. First, it was published in 1973: it is surprising how, in the course of only 40 years, our knowledge of our evolutionary history has advanced. Second, it was originally a TV series made by the BBC: the book is arranged into 13 essays, I assume based on the original episodes.The book starts logically enough at our roots in east Africa five million years ago. Bronowski doesn’t make nearly enough of how touch-and-go it was, not only then but at several points later when we could easily have gone extinct. I think this is mainly because much of what we have learned about the tenuousness of our evolution we have done so quite recently. Indeed, several human branches did die out, including the Neanderthal, and if a new book on this topic were to be written, I’d like to see more attention paid to the possible reasons for these demises.He does make the valid point that our weakness, as well as our strength, lay in the fact that we were not nearly as shaped by our environment as other animals were, honed over time into a perfect fit with those things we ate and those that would eat us. Rather, it is the brain-hand relationship of the human that caused us rather to shape our environment. While this was an eventual advantage, is was not always so; things like climate change forced us to migrate or face annihilation.It is also interesting how in 1973 the main source of our information concerning how both Homo erectus and Homo sapiens migrated across the globe was blood groups. DNA analysis was then still a young science, but blood groups allowed us a very good guess at the process. For example, it enabled us to determine that humans crossed the Bering Strait into North America, not in one but in two separate migrations, something confirmed by DNA analysis, albeit with more precision.The next chapter deals with the transition from a nomad culture, tracking the paths of animal herds, to one of agriculture. This, according to Bronowski, started 12,000 years ago, which leaves an enormous gap from the appearance of Homo sapiens 150,000 years ago, even earlier in the case of Homo erectus, in which it is assumed our ancestors happily continued their hunting and gathering lifestyle. What evidence we have, especially here in Africa, indeed points in that direction, but it is sparse. It’s as if several chapters are missing from the human story, the bit between the development of tools and the domestication of both animals and plants. Again, I should have liked a more thorough attempt at fleshing out the gaps.The ensuing chapters spend time on particular human achievements, such as mathematics, architecture, music, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and so on. This read like a history book. While it was interesting, it was not so much about the ascent of man — some may say that he had already ascended when he founded his first city, his first enclosure against the vagaries of the elements — as it was about his applying the finishing touches to a remarkable project that had started five million years before, that was not always assured of success, and that would forever be a work in progress.Summarizing, I enjoyed the book, but knowledge moves on, man continues to ascend, and an update would be welcome."
4,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"I never thought I'd say this, but this book would be better if it had been written by an anthropologist rather than a mathematician.The Ascent of Man is the companion book to the 1973 BBC documentary of the same name; I didn't realise this when I bought it (I haven't seen it), but I remembered I knew of its existence upon reading the introduction. It certainly reads like a BBC documentary, with a tediously slow and pompous prose that works better for television narration by David Attenborough or indeed Jacob Bronowski than for a book.It sets out to give an overview of the whole of human history, briefly going over our biological evolution, and then covering in some detail our cultural evolution.It's worth noting that Bronowski isn't, despite what seems to be a sincere effort, a biologist, historian, or anthropologist, but a mathematician with a background in physics. Maybe this is why his discussion of our evolutionary origins is often too sloppy (for instance, he explains that he does not like the name Australopithecus because it means ``southern ape'', which is confusing for something that ``for the first time was not an ape'', which is obviously wrong; I considered that probably to be an artefact of his native Polish, which, like most languages, does not have a colloquial distinction between monkeys and apes but does have one between monkeys and non-human apes on the one hand (małpa) and humans on the other, but Bronowski made it clear later on that he doesn't speak a word of Polish anymore), and his discussion of history just repeats a whole lot of layperson misconceptions and ancient canards (starting with the idea that nomadic cultures are culturally arid, because nomads don't have time to create artifacts that aren't strictly practical or the ability to cart them around with them, and just continuing on from there until he reaches the 20th century).Or maybe it's just because the book was written in 1973, before many of the things we now know were well-known (for instance, the reason the New World lagged behind the Old in terms of technology; Bronowski suggests it's because it was colonised later, around the end of the last ice age, ignoring his earlier statement that that's also the time period cultural evolution began in earnest in the Old World as well) and when the kind of cultural condescension he exhibits (casually referring to Europe as ``the civilised world'', completely disregarding China and ``the Mohammedans'' (though he calls Mohammed ``Mahomet'') even as he patronisingly praises the latter for their Golden Age mathematics elsewhere) was more acceptable. I don't know.Either way, and high-profile accolades notwithstanding (Dawkins, Sagan, Singh), The Ascent of Man could be a lot better than it is. Bronowski should have gotten a historian to punch him in the chest from time to time."
5,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27637045-simon-hollway,5,"Powerful stuff...consistently sublime segues between chapters, historical periods and theories. At least a dozen phenomenal insights into several anthropological mainstays. A manner of metaphor and analogy that distills entire theses into a single, resonant sentence. Humility of expression and thought twinned with a generosity of spirit keep the subject in the spotlight throughout whilst the narrator discretely maintains the tempo unseen, offstage.As suitable for the adept as it is for either the dilettante or the debutante. Bronowski unveils his formidable, but never alienating, intellect. Top marks."
6,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113906-jee-koh,4,"Based on the BBC television series of the same name, The Ascent of Man charts the development of human civilization through the lens of scientific progress. Though clearly intended to be only an introduction to its subjects, the book is tremendously wide in scope, taking in paleontology, architecture, alchemy, industrialization, quantum physics and genetics; noticeably, it has little to say about psychology. It is organised in powerful thematic chapters that are also more or less chronological. So it begins by looking at human fossils in Chapter 1 Lower than the Angels, and ends by discussing John von Neumann and game theory in Chapter 13 The Long Childhood. Since the book was published in 1973, I expect its discussion of contemporary science (and perhaps historical events and figures) needs updating. But, as the chapter titles suggest, the book is not so much concerned with presenting up-to-date facts as with creating ""a philosophy for the twentieth century which shall be all of one piece"" (from the Foreword). It is a philosophy that puts man at the center of things. He is, in this book, the seeker of knowledge, and seek using the tools of observation, reasoning, and conversation. I guess the philosophy can be called scientific rationalism. And one of the many achievements of this lucid and learned book is to restore the viability of this view. It does so by not ignoring the fall-out from technological progress, whether it be the harsh factories of the Industrial Revolution or the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagaski. It does so also by reminding us of the responsible actions taken by some industrialists and innovators in their respective situations, and so proves its point that science was not to blame, but man's uses of it were. Related to this, Bronowski deplores what he calls ""the aristocracy of the intellect,"" scientists who move away from the needs of people, and into the arms of government, industry and corporations. Bronowski calls for, instead, ""a democracy of the intellect."" By that he means a society that not only allows the specialist to do specialist things, but also educates the non-specialists like us on how nature works. Jacob Bronowski was a British mathematician, biologist, poet and playwright. In reflection of the different facets of his mind, his prose is clear, organizing, poetic, with a strong feel for the dramatic illustration or detail. I read all 438 pages of the book in the course of two leisurely days. The accompanying pictures are often revelatory as well. At his death in 1974, a year after the publication of the book, he was a Fellow of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California."
7,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/293948-seizure-romero,4,"This book was assigned for a college course I took about a thousand years ago. The instructor was obsessed with Jacob Bronowski, so he played many, if not all of the documentary episodes that went along with the book, probably so he could sit in the corner and hide his boner (c'mon, the course was called ""The Ascent of Man"" fer chrissakes. It should have been called ""The Life and Times of Jacob Bronowski Plus Some Stuff That Might Make You Ungrateful Wankers Appreciate Not Living in Mud Huts."" The guy was way too into it. And don't even act like you never had to hide a boner in college). So anyway, I payed very close attention to the movies and left my copy of the book in its plastic wrap and managed to get a better grade than my friends (neener). Years later, when those cheap bastards at Half-Price Books offered me a quarter for my still-in-plastic-$16.95-cover-price copy, I counter-offered a few suggestions as to what they could do with their quarter and went home and finally opened it and read the damned thing. It was alright."
8,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1336573-charles,1,"I did not finish this book so I won't officially count it in my own stats as read. But there's no real way to indicate that here. They need an ""abandoned"" choice. The reason why I'm reviewing it is because there are numerous errors in the first chapter that make this a problematic read. That's as far as I got. These errors have to do with human evolution. This book was originally published in 1973 so that explains some of the mistakes, but not all. And the mistakes that would not be blamed on the time of writing made me unable to feel comfortable with what else I might find in the book, perhaps errors that I didn't recognize as errors.An added disappointment is that there is a foreword by Richard Dawkins written in 2011. Dawkins certainly would have recognized these errors, which makes me suspect that he didn't actually read the book. I cannot recommend this book."
9,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461746-joan-colby,5,"A marvelous study of man’s rise shown through the lens of scientific discoveries. Written for the intelligent layman, and the basis of the lauded TV series, this is an essential book for anyone interested in the evolution of science."
10,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62412030-nubero,3,"Very good passages here and there and definitely worth reading. Still, most of the time a strange mix of philosophy and science in which neither gets to bloom the way that it could have. Probably better to watch it as the TV show (of which this book is the almost 1:1 transcript)."
11,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4852482-dick-edwards,5,"This is an excellent book. It is a broad-brush survey of man’s cultural evolution, although his biological evolution is covered in the first chapter. It is just JB’s opinion as to what is important in man’s journey to where we are today, and his background as a physicist shows in what he describes. Since the book was written in 1973, there obviously has been much learned on the subject since then, especially in biological evolution. What is most impressive about this book is the demonstration of JB’s wide-ranging overview of his subject matter. I can remember seeing the series on TV and being impressed with JB’s breadth of knowledge. I would give this book a 9 out of 10 on my personal rating system."
12,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35643641-andr-s-astudillo,5,"Definitely, I know why Carl Sagan recommended it. The book is an ode to scientific progress, thus human civilization. Bronowski, I feel he doesn't share the concept of misanthropy, however, he really points out the fact that there are demons to hunt, those that are inside our heads, human heads. The book is a mix between history and science. Everyone who loves a little bit about science is going to love it. He writes so passionately about the ancient man, and every little achievement that ever took place, mostly because every thing that happened, sometimes even by accident, managed to give man tools to construct a civilization.There are more than twelve chapters, each one of them connected to each other; it is easy to read, and we can all get a glimpse of Bronowski's tender and detailed writing. If you are a science reader, this book must be in one of your shelves."
13,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105487148-masoudt,5,"This non-fiction book is written based on the groundbreaking BBC television series with the same name. First published in 1973, is considered on the first works of popular science. It illuminates the historical and social development of human beings with a scientific attitude toward this long pace of life on earth.The story is a personal view of Dr Bronowski, with his highly accessible style and powerful words. He discusses the human invention of flint tools, animal and wheat domestication, geometry, alchemy, Renascence Industrial Revolution, Theory of Relativity, etc. showing the ability of man to control nature.I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see the ascent of humans from the beginning of civilization through a scientific lens."

15,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69348187-xavier,4,"The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski is a wonderful book about the beginnings of the human species and all of the fascinating and incredible leaps and bounds in knowledge and technology we have made.There are 12 chapters and they touch upon so many different subjects. Our story begins in the savannas of Africa, where our ancestors were once tree dwellers and eventually began to walk upright. Humans transformed stones into tools and became hunter-gatherers, ultimately bringing forth the Neolithic Revolution. As time moved on, we learned to tame the land by planting seeds and growing crops. Humans disciplined the ox, mules and horses for battle and farming. By building canals we controlled the flow of water. The discovery of metals thrust us into the Copper and Iron Ages.Mathematics skyrocketed intellectual thinking and we began to apply that thinking to shapes and geometry. Galileo Galilie turned the telescope towards the Moon and left humanity in awe. Sir Isaac Newton gave motion to the planets by inventing calculus and Albert Einstein gave the speed light and the slowing of time a definition -- the Theory of Relativity.The discovery of quantum physics and the subatomic world expanded our way of thinking. The Theory of Evolution by Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace lifted the veil of nature's mysterious ways.It was a delightful trip learning about all the amazing things humans have achieved. To learn about how we moved up the intellectual ladder was inspiring. Bronowski points out the importance of the continual push for knowledge and how to maintain that goal for future generations. Who knows where the human race will end up if we do."
16,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"This book is based on a television documentary series produced in 1973 by the BBC in association with Time-Life Films. The title alludes to The Descent of Man by Charles Darwin. The book traces the development of human society through its understanding of science.The book is written in a rather odd and stilted style which I found completely bizarre at times. Here's an example:""The role of women in nomad tribes is narrowly defined. Above all, the function of women is to produce men-children; too many she-children are an immediate misfortune, because in the long run they threaten disaster. Apart from that, their duties lie in preparing food and clothes. For example, the women among the Bakhtiari bake bread .... ""In the middle of the paragraph Bronowski makes a stunning statement - having lots of girls is both an immediate and long term disaster to these tribes. Setting aside, for the moment, the convoluted logic that something creates an immediate misfortune, because of the fact that it is a long term misfortune (what?!?). As a reader, the statement itself raises a lot of questions and begs follow up: why, how, what type of disaster?? You'd expect this sentence to be backed up and evidence discussed. Instead, he just tosses it out there, then moves on to women baking bread. Perhaps this style of writing is a result of the book being modeled on the spoken transcript of the televison show. But it's really quite strange and makes the text hard to read initially. Once you get used to it, the book is pretty good."
17,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish,4,"Originally published on my blog here in August 2001.Like Kenneth Clarke's Civilisation, The Ascent of Man is a series looked up to by every producer of factual, educational TV programmes. It probably wouldn't get made today, as its broad canvas is not really fashionable, and it is not about ordinary people. Its subject is the history of science, far removed from the pseudo-anthropology of ""Reality TV"".The arrangement of material is a little unusual; it is basically thematic, each chapter tracking a particular subject (evolution, or the structure of matter, say) to modern times. The coverage of each theme is also slightly idiosyncratic and yet is exceptionally clear, even when not accompanied by the TV picture (the text sometimes refers to footage, which can be slightly confusing).After thirty years, a fair amount is out of date, but much remains to form an excellent introduction to basic modern scientific ideas, including some of the best explanations of relativistic travel and a wonderful demonstration of Pythagoras' Theorem. "
18,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2275388-sin,4,"I really liked this book. It's full of fascinating facts and stories from our past. It consists of many episodes but it is essentially one long story. It's our story. How did we, human beings, rise from the animal world and become what we are today.I will always remember the story about the appearance of first hybrid wheat in the Middle East and raise of agricultural societies.There is also a lot of interesting stories about scientists. I’ve heard about all of them but I found so many amazing details from their lives and how they all were connected.I give the book 4 stars because at some moments you realise that the book was not really written as a book but as material for the TV series. At several moments I felt that he should have gone into more details and better explain his ideas.Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to anybody interested in history of the mankind and our civilization."
19,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny,5,"Excellent book about the story of mankind not too dissimilar from Jared diamonds guns germs and steel. the book starts off with the evolution of man from basic mini monkey types like the Limur (king Julian!) through to homo erectus, Neanderthal and finally homo sapien around 100,000 years ago. Then the book really begins by exploring a whole whose of subjects like: food, nomad cultures, structures and architecture, fire, metals, numbers, islam and the rise of Europe through the renaissance and the industrial revolution. It then goes into a lot of science which I didn’t have the brains to digest so admit to skipping lots of it but there were some interesting stories and examples around Albert OneStone. There is lots more that I have missed no doubt a really really interesting book that was made into a BBC series also and definitely worth a read. Lots of pictures also to keep you amused and though it’s quite a large book you do fly through it. "

With a book like this one I like to read and give thought and analysis what I have read. It is just the way my thinking works, I guess I'm not that ""quick"".The Ascent of Man is our scientific development from the start using small ancient hand tools and the emergence of our humanity through the development of quantum physics, DNA, cognitive science, artificial intelligence. and beyond.I like that Bronowski connects science, art, philosophy and history together. I do remember seeing parts of the show which was on PBS back in the seventies, but it didn't hold my interest at my age then.A definite recommended read if you interest is history, science or just knowledge about us.

21,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,5,"Enormous in scope and celebratory in tone: this is The Story of Man. The narrator does not speak so much as proclaim. The writing here really gets you excited to learn the history of Mankind, the development of Civilization, the discoveries of Science, and to be a part of their future. Bronowski strikes a beautiful balance between his personal voice and hard data, between narrative flair and historical fact. It's a delight to read, at once universal and intimate. Really, it's one of the best works of non-fiction imaginable: both authoritative and flexible, acknowledging what we've learned and yet how many gaps remain.5 stars."

The Ascent of Man
"
31,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,5,"
Fifty years from now, if an understanding of man’s origins, his evolution, his history, his progress is not in the common place of the school books, we shall not exist.
I watched this series right after finishing Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation, as I’d heard The Ascent of Man described as a companion piece. So like my review of Clark’s work, this review is about the documentary and not the book (though since the book is just a transcription of the series, I’m sure it applies to both).  The Ascent of Man is a remarkable program. I had doubts that anyone could produce a series to match Civilisation, but Bronowski made something that might even be better. Bronowski was a polymath: he did work in mathematics, biology, physics, history, and even poetry. In this program, his topic is the history of science. Yet for Bronowski, the word “science” not only refers to the modern scientific method, but rather encompasses all of humanity’s efforts to understand and manipulate the natural world.  We thus begin with Homo erectus, learning how to chip away stone to make tools. As Bronowski notes, this simple ability, to chip away at a stone until a cutting edge is left, is a remarkable indication of human uniqueness. Since the behavior is learned and is not an instinct, it requires a preconception of what the toolmaker wants to create, a certain amount of imagination is required to picture the goal before it is realized. What’s more, creating a stone tool requires a sense of the structural properties of the rock. (I’ve actually tried making stone tools with various types of rock, and let me tell you that it’s not so easy. Even with an archaeologist giving me advice, I was only able to create stone tools of the sophistication of an Australopithecus—randomly beating the stone until a sharp edge was created.) Thus both our creative drive and our knowledge are involved in this quintessentially human activity. “Every animal leaves traces of what he was. Man alone leaves traces of what he created.” This brings Bronowski to one of his main points, one of the themes of this series: that art and science are not fundamentally different; rather, they are two manifestations of the human spirit. What is this human spirit? It is a composite of many qualities, what Bronowski calls “a jigsaw of human faculties,” which include our wide behavioral flexibility, our capacity to play, our need to create, our curiosity about the natural world, our sense of adventure, our love of variety. Indeed, these can be pithily described by saying that humans retain many childlike characteristics throughout their lives. The name of the last episode is “The Long Childhood.” One of my favorite sequences in this documentary is when Bronowski takes the viewer from the posts and lintels of the Greek temples, to the arches in the Roman aqueduct in Segovia, to the somewhat prettier arches in the Mezquita in Cordoba, to the cathedral at Reims with its magnificent flying buttresses. Each of these structures, he explains, is a more sophisticated solution to this problem: how do you create a covered space out of stone? The lintel and post system used by the Greeks leads to a forest of columns, and the Mezquita, although less crowded, is still filled with arches. The Medieval Christians achieved a magnificent solution by placing the buttresses on the outside, thus leading to the towering, open interior of Reims. We’re used to thinking of this development as an architectural triumph, but as Bronowski points out, it was also an intellectual triumph. This progression represents better and better understandings of the structural properties of stone, of the force of gravity, and of the distribution of weight. And when you see it play out in front of your eyes, it’s hard to shake the impression that these marvelous works are also progressively more elegant solutions to a mathematical puzzle. This is just one example of Bronowski’s talent: to see the artistic in the scientific and the scientific in the artistic; and he does this by seeing the human spirit in all of it. Here’s another example. Bronowski wants to talk about how humanity has come to understand space, and how this understanding of space underpins our knowledge of structure. How does he do it? He goes to the Alhambra, and analyzes the symmetry in the tiles of the Moorish Palace. Then, he bends down and spreads a bunch of crystals on the ground, and begins to talk about the molecular symmetry that gave rise to them. It’s such a stunning juxtaposition. How many people would think to compare Moorish architecture with modern chemistry? But it’s so appropriate and so revealing that I couldn’t help but be awed. As the title suggests, this series is not simply about science (or art), but about science through history. Bronowski aims to show how humanity, once freed from the constraints of instinct, used a combination of logic and imagination to achieve ever-deeper conceptions of our place in the universe. This is the Ascent of Man: a quest for self knowledge. It’s sometimes hard for us moderns to grasp this, but consider that we are living in one of the brief times in history that we can explain the formation of the earth, the origin of our species, and even the workings of our own brains. Imagine not knowing any of that. It’s hard to envy former ages when you consider that their sense of their place of the universe was based on myth supported by authority, or was simply a mystery. I’m sure (and I earnestly hope) that future generations will believe the same about us.  Bronowski’s final message is a plea to continue this ascent. This means spreading a understanding and an appreciation of science, as his programs tries to do. This strikes me as terribly important. I’ve met so many people who say things like “Science is a form of faith” or “Science can’t solve every problem” or “Science is dehumanizing and arrogant.” It’s sad to hear intelligent people say things like this, for it simply isn’t true. It’s an abuse of language to call science a faith; then what isn’t? And yes, of course science can’t solve every problem and can’t answer every question; but can anything? Science can solve some problems, and can do so very well. And science, as Bronowski points out, is the very opposite of dehumanizing and arrogant. Science is a most human form of knowledge, born of humility of our intellectual powers, based on repeated mistakes and guesses, always pressing forward into the unknown, always revising its opinions based on evidence. Atrocities are committed, not by people who are trained to question their own beliefs, but by ideologues who are convinced they are right. This is Bronowski’s essential message. But like in any good story, the telling is half of it. As I’ve mentioned above, Bronowski and his team are brilliant at finding unexpected ways to illustrate abstract ideas. This series is full of wonderful and striking visual illustrations of Bronowski’s points. On top of this, the man is a natural storyteller, and effectively brings to life many of this series’ heroes: Newton, Galileo, Alfred Russell Wallace, Mendel. He’s also a poet; one of his books is a study of William Blake’s poetry. This not only gives him a knack for similes, but helps him to explain how science is fundamentally creative. One of my favorite scenes is when Bronowski compares abstract portraits of a man to the ways that various scientific instruments—radar, infrared, cameras, X-rays—detect the man’s face. As he explains, both the portrait and these readings are interpretations of their subjects.The cinematography is also excellent. There are some sequences in this documentary that are still impressive, saturated as we are with CGI. There are even some quite psychedelic sections. One of my favorite of these was a sequence of microscopic shots of human cells with Pink Floyd (who contributed music) jamming chaotically in the background. Unlike in Clark’s Civilisation, which uses exclusively ‘classical’ music and is devoid of special effects, the style of this documentary is surprisingly modern and even edgy. Another thing Bronowski does that Clark doesn’t, is include some information on non-Western cultures, from Meso-America, Japan, China, and Easter Island. Yes, there are some parts of this that are outdated. Most obviously, much of the scientific information is no longer accurate—particularly the information on human evolution in the first episode. This is unavoidable, and is in fact a tribute to the ideals Bronowski championed. More jarring is Bronowski’s somewhat negative assessments of the culture of Easter Island and the lifestyle of nomadic peoples. Less controversially, he also has some negative words to say about Hegel. (Did you know Hegel published an absurd thesis when he was young about how the distance of the orbits of the planets had to conform to a number series?) Another mark of this program’s age is that Bronowski several times shows nudity and even a human birth. This would never fly on television today, at least not in the States. But these signs of age are minor, and the program remains a tremendous accomplishment. The Ascent of Man is a landmark in the history of science education and of documentary making, and a stirring vision of the progress of humanity by an brilliant and sympathetic man. I hope you get a chance to watch it."

What is explained by the man, is nothing short of crystal clear descriptions of Humankind's physical, scientific, sociological and theological discoveries from the very first roaming tribes to our modern era. It is presented, stripped of the wordy, overly philosophical ramblings and data heavy meanderings found in other books that cover similar subject matter. Concise, endearing, earthy, genius. A must for anybody who needs a refresher course on general science, anthropology, physics etc."
33,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12006755-paul-brogan,2,"There are two things to remember about this book. First, it was published in 1973: it is surprising how, in the course of only 40 years, our knowledge of our evolutionary history has advanced. Second, it was originally a TV series made by the BBC: the book is arranged into 13 essays, I assume based on the original episodes.The book starts logically enough at our roots in east Africa five million years ago. Bronowski doesn’t make nearly enough of how touch-and-go it was, not only then but at several points later when we could easily have gone extinct. I think this is mainly because much of what we have learned about the tenuousness of our evolution we have done so quite recently. Indeed, several human branches did die out, including the Neanderthal, and if a new book on this topic were to be written, I’d like to see more attention paid to the possible reasons for these demises.He does make the valid point that our weakness, as well as our strength, lay in the fact that we were not nearly as shaped by our environment as other animals were, honed over time into a perfect fit with those things we ate and those that would eat us. Rather, it is the brain-hand relationship of the human that caused us rather to shape our environment. While this was an eventual advantage, is was not always so; things like climate change forced us to migrate or face annihilation.It is also interesting how in 1973 the main source of our information concerning how both Homo erectus and Homo sapiens migrated across the globe was blood groups. DNA analysis was then still a young science, but blood groups allowed us a very good guess at the process. For example, it enabled us to determine that humans crossed the Bering Strait into North America, not in one but in two separate migrations, something confirmed by DNA analysis, albeit with more precision.The next chapter deals with the transition from a nomad culture, tracking the paths of animal herds, to one of agriculture. This, according to Bronowski, started 12,000 years ago, which leaves an enormous gap from the appearance of Homo sapiens 150,000 years ago, even earlier in the case of Homo erectus, in which it is assumed our ancestors happily continued their hunting and gathering lifestyle. What evidence we have, especially here in Africa, indeed points in that direction, but it is sparse. It’s as if several chapters are missing from the human story, the bit between the development of tools and the domestication of both animals and plants. Again, I should have liked a more thorough attempt at fleshing out the gaps.The ensuing chapters spend time on particular human achievements, such as mathematics, architecture, music, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and so on. This read like a history book. While it was interesting, it was not so much about the ascent of man — some may say that he had already ascended when he founded his first city, his first enclosure against the vagaries of the elements — as it was about his applying the finishing touches to a remarkable project that had started five million years before, that was not always assured of success, and that would forever be a work in progress.Summarizing, I enjoyed the book, but knowledge moves on, man continues to ascend, and an update would be welcome."
34,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"I never thought I'd say this, but this book would be better if it had been written by an anthropologist rather than a mathematician.The Ascent of Man is the companion book to the 1973 BBC documentary of the same name; I didn't realise this when I bought it (I haven't seen it), but I remembered I knew of its existence upon reading the introduction. It certainly reads like a BBC documentary, with a tediously slow and pompous prose that works better for television narration by David Attenborough or indeed Jacob Bronowski than for a book.It sets out to give an overview of the whole of human history, briefly going over our biological evolution, and then covering in some detail our cultural evolution.It's worth noting that Bronowski isn't, despite what seems to be a sincere effort, a biologist, historian, or anthropologist, but a mathematician with a background in physics. Maybe this is why his discussion of our evolutionary origins is often too sloppy (for instance, he explains that he does not like the name Australopithecus because it means ``southern ape'', which is confusing for something that ``for the first time was not an ape'', which is obviously wrong; I considered that probably to be an artefact of his native Polish, which, like most languages, does not have a colloquial distinction between monkeys and apes but does have one between monkeys and non-human apes on the one hand (małpa) and humans on the other, but Bronowski made it clear later on that he doesn't speak a word of Polish anymore), and his discussion of history just repeats a whole lot of layperson misconceptions and ancient canards (starting with the idea that nomadic cultures are culturally arid, because nomads don't have time to create artifacts that aren't strictly practical or the ability to cart them around with them, and just continuing on from there until he reaches the 20th century).Or maybe it's just because the book was written in 1973, before many of the things we now know were well-known (for instance, the reason the New World lagged behind the Old in terms of technology; Bronowski suggests it's because it was colonised later, around the end of the last ice age, ignoring his earlier statement that that's also the time period cultural evolution began in earnest in the Old World as well) and when the kind of cultural condescension he exhibits (casually referring to Europe as ``the civilised world'', completely disregarding China and ``the Mohammedans'' (though he calls Mohammed ``Mahomet'') even as he patronisingly praises the latter for their Golden Age mathematics elsewhere) was more acceptable. I don't know.Either way, and high-profile accolades notwithstanding (Dawkins, Sagan, Singh), The Ascent of Man could be a lot better than it is. Bronowski should have gotten a historian to punch him in the chest from time to time."

At least a dozen phenomenal insights into several anthropological mainstays. A manner of metaphor and analogy that distills entire theses into a single, resonant sentence. Humility of expression and thought twinned with a generosity of spirit keep the subject in the spotlight throughout whilst the narrator discretely maintains the tempo unseen, offstage.As suitable for the adept as it is for either the dilettante or the debutante. Bronowski unveils his formidable, but never alienating, intellect. Top marks."
36,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113906-jee-koh,4,"Based on the BBC television series of the same name, The Ascent of Man charts the development of human civilization through the lens of scientific progress. Though clearly intended to be only an introduction to its subjects, the book is tremendously wide in scope, taking in paleontology, architecture, alchemy, industrialization, quantum physics and genetics; noticeably, it has little to say about psychology. It is organised in powerful thematic chapters that are also more or less chronological. So it begins by looking at human fossils in Chapter 1 Lower than the Angels, and ends by discussing John von Neumann and game theory in Chapter 13 The Long Childhood. Since the book was published in 1973, I expect its discussion of contemporary science (and perhaps historical events and figures) needs updating. But, as the chapter titles suggest, the book is not so much concerned with presenting up-to-date facts as with creating ""a philosophy for the twentieth century which shall be all of one piece"" (from the Foreword). It is a philosophy that puts man at the center of things. He is, in this book, the seeker of knowledge, and seek using the tools of observation, reasoning, and conversation. I guess the philosophy can be called scientific rationalism. And one of the many achievements of this lucid and learned book is to restore the viability of this view. It does so by not ignoring the fall-out from technological progress, whether it be the harsh factories of the Industrial Revolution or the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagaski. It does so also by reminding us of the responsible actions taken by some industrialists and innovators in their respective situations, and so proves its point that science was not to blame, but man's uses of it were. Related to this, Bronowski deplores what he calls ""the aristocracy of the intellect,"" scientists who move away from the needs of people, and into the arms of government, industry and corporations. Bronowski calls for, instead, ""a democracy of the intellect."" By that he means a society that not only allows the specialist to do specialist things, but also educates the non-specialists like us on how nature works. Jacob Bronowski was a British mathematician, biologist, poet and playwright. In reflection of the different facets of his mind, his prose is clear, organizing, poetic, with a strong feel for the dramatic illustration or detail. I read all 438 pages of the book in the course of two leisurely days. The accompanying pictures are often revelatory as well. At his death in 1974, a year after the publication of the book, he was a Fellow of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California."
37,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/293948-seizure-romero,4,"This book was assigned for a college course I took about a thousand years ago. The instructor was obsessed with Jacob Bronowski, so he played many, if not all of the documentary episodes that went along with the book, probably so he could sit in the corner and hide his boner (c'mon, the course was called ""The Ascent of Man"" fer chrissakes. It should have been called ""The Life and Times of Jacob Bronowski Plus Some Stuff That Might Make You Ungrateful Wankers Appreciate Not Living in Mud Huts."" The guy was way too into it. And don't even act like you never had to hide a boner in college). So anyway, I payed very close attention to the movies and left my copy of the book in its plastic wrap and managed to get a better grade than my friends (neener). Years later, when those cheap bastards at Half-Price Books offered me a quarter for my still-in-plastic-$16.95-cover-price copy, I counter-offered a few suggestions as to what they could do with their quarter and went home and finally opened it and read the damned thing. It was alright."

They need an ""abandoned"" choice. The reason why I'm reviewing it is because there are numerous errors in the first chapter that make this a problematic read. That's as far as I got. These errors have to do with human evolution. This book was originally published in 1973 so that explains some of the mistakes, but not all. And the mistakes that would not be blamed on the time of writing made me unable to feel comfortable with what else I might find in the book, perhaps errors that I didn't recognize as errors.An added disappointment is that there is a foreword by Richard Dawkins written in 2011. Dawkins certainly would have recognized these errors, which makes me suspect that he didn't actually read the book. I cannot recommend this book."

It is a broad-brush survey of man’s cultural evolution, although his biological evolution is covered in the first chapter. It is just JB’s opinion as to what is important in man’s journey to where we are today, and his background as a physicist shows in what he describes. Since the book was written in 1973, there obviously has been much learned on the subject since then, especially in biological evolution. What is most impressive about this book is the demonstration of JB’s wide-ranging overview of his subject matter. I can remember seeing the series on TV and being impressed with JB’s breadth of knowledge. I would give this book a 9 out of 10 on my personal rating system."

Bronowski, I feel he doesn't share the concept of misanthropy, however, he really points out the fact that there are demons to hunt, those that are inside our heads, human heads. The book is a mix between history and science. Everyone who loves a little bit about science is going to love it. He writes so passionately about the ancient man, and every little achievement that ever took place, mostly because every thing that happened, sometimes even by accident, managed to give man tools to construct a civilization.There are more than twelve chapters, each one of them connected to each other; it is easy to read, and we can all get a glimpse of Bronowski's tender and detailed writing.

He discusses the human invention of flint tools, animal and wheat domestication, geometry, alchemy, Renascence Industrial Revolution, Theory of Relativity, etc. showing the ability of man to control nature.I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see the ascent of humans from the beginning of civilization through a scientific lens."

Our story begins in the savannas of Africa, where our ancestors were once tree dwellers and eventually began to walk upright. Humans transformed stones into tools and became hunter-gatherers, ultimately bringing forth the Neolithic Revolution. As time moved on, we learned to tame the land by planting seeds and growing crops. Humans disciplined the ox, mules and horses for battle and farming. By building canals we controlled the flow of water. The discovery of metals thrust us into the Copper and Iron Ages.Mathematics skyrocketed intellectual thinking and we began to apply that thinking to shapes and geometry. Galileo Galilie turned the telescope towards the Moon and left humanity in awe. Sir Isaac Newton gave motion to the planets by inventing calculus and Albert Einstein gave the speed light and the slowing of time a definition -- the Theory of Relativity.The discovery of quantum physics and the subatomic world expanded our way of thinking. The Theory of Evolution by Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace lifted the veil of nature's mysterious ways.It was a delightful trip learning about all the amazing things humans have achieved. To learn about how we moved up the intellectual ladder was inspiring. Bronowski points out the importance of the continual push for knowledge and how to maintain that goal for future generations.

The title alludes to The Descent of Man by Charles Darwin. The book traces the development of human society through its understanding of science.The book is written in a rather odd and stilted style which I found completely bizarre at times. Here's an example:""The role of women in nomad tribes is narrowly defined. Above all, the function of women is to produce men-children; too many she-children are an immediate misfortune, because in the long run they threaten disaster. Apart from that, their duties lie in preparing food and clothes. For example, the women among the Bakhtiari bake bread .... ""In the middle of the paragraph Bronowski makes a stunning statement - having lots of girls is both an immediate and long term disaster to these tribes. Setting aside, for the moment, the convoluted logic that something creates an immediate misfortune, because of the fact that it is a long term misfortune (what?!?). As a reader, the statement itself raises a lot of questions and begs follow up: why, how, what type of disaster?? You'd expect this sentence to be backed up and evidence discussed. Instead, he just tosses it out there, then moves on to women baking bread. Perhaps this style of writing is a result of the book being modeled on the spoken transcript of the televison show. But it's really quite strange and makes the text hard to read initially. Once you get used to it, the book is pretty good."

It probably wouldn't get made today, as its broad canvas is not really fashionable, and it is not about ordinary people. Its subject is the history of science, far removed from the pseudo-anthropology of ""Reality TV"".The arrangement of material is a little unusual; it is basically thematic, each chapter tracking a particular subject (evolution, or the structure of matter, say) to modern times. The coverage of each theme is also slightly idiosyncratic and yet is exceptionally clear, even when not accompanied by the TV picture (the text sometimes refers to footage, which can be slightly confusing).After thirty years, a fair amount is out of date, but much remains to form an excellent introduction to basic modern scientific ideas, including some of the best explanations of relativistic travel and a wonderful demonstration of Pythagoras' Theorem.

It consists of many episodes but it is essentially one long story. It's our story. How did we, human beings, rise from the animal world and become what we are today.I will always remember the story about the appearance of first hybrid wheat in the Middle East and raise of agricultural societies.There is also a lot of interesting stories about scientists. I’ve heard about all of them but I found so many amazing details from their lives and how they all were connected.I give the book 4 stars because at some moments you realise that the book was not really written as a book but as material for the TV series. At several moments I felt that he should have gone into more details and better explain his ideas.Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to anybody interested in history of the mankind and our civilization."
49,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny,5,"Excellent book about the story of mankind not too dissimilar from Jared diamonds guns germs and steel. the book starts off with the evolution of man from basic mini monkey types like the Limur (king Julian!) through to homo erectus, Neanderthal and finally homo sapien around 100,000 years ago. Then the book really begins by exploring a whole whose of subjects like: food, nomad cultures, structures and architecture, fire, metals, numbers, islam and the rise of Europe through the renaissance and the industrial revolution. It then goes into a lot of science which I didn’t have the brains to digest so admit to skipping lots of it but there were some interesting stories and examples around Albert OneStone. There is lots more that I have missed no doubt a really really interesting book that was made into a BBC series also and definitely worth a read. Lots of pictures also to keep you amused and though it’s quite a large book you do fly through it. "

With a book like this one I like to read and give thought and analysis what I have read. It is just the way my thinking works, I guess I'm not that ""quick"".The Ascent of Man is our scientific development from the start using small ancient hand tools and the emergence of our humanity through the development of quantum physics, DNA, cognitive science, artificial intelligence. and beyond.I like that Bronowski connects science, art, philosophy and history together. I do remember seeing parts of the show which was on PBS back in the seventies, but it didn't hold my interest at my age then.A definite recommended read if you interest is history, science or just knowledge about us.

The writing here really gets you excited to learn the history of Mankind, the development of Civilization, the discoveries of Science, and to be a part of their future. Bronowski strikes a beautiful balance between his personal voice and hard data, between narrative flair and historical fact. It's a delight to read, at once universal and intimate.

64,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2784348-grady-ormsby,4,"The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski “traces the development of human society through our understanding of science.” The book was designed to accompany the 1973 BBC documentaries of the same name. Narrated by Bronowski and filmed in various locations around the world, the series focuses on the development of humanity through various sciences, history, art, culture, anthropology, literature and philosophy. Touching on the greatest and most influential people and events the reader (or viewer) is taken on a journey from the beginning of Homo sapiens through the stages of hunter/gatherers, herders, farmers, and building of cities with the accompanying specialization of skills and trade. The next giant steps look at not the earliest use of fire for cooking and warmth but its use in the making of metals and the leaps brought about by the of development of tools and weapons. Fire was also essential in the transition of alchemy into chemistry. From that came the scientific revolution powered by new insights into mathematics, astronomy and physics. Other revolutions followed: political and industrial. Revolution led to evolution with Darwin’s new view of the interrelatedness and connectivity of all things. The growth of understanding of genetics helped to achieve a greater understanding of those relationships. The unity of things, however, did not determine sameness, for soon there was the understanding that all was relative and usually uncertain. The basic idea of evolution quickly went beyond the taxonomic structure of kingdom, classes, genera and species into the realization that everything seems to evolve: geology, social structures and relationships, cultural and societal bonds, and even, according to the view of some, the spiritual growth of all of us both individually and as a species.As much as anything reading The Ascent of Man gave me an opportunity to take a long view, to back away from the current irrationality of contemporary politics and social trends and to reestablish a saner perspective on life and the world."
65,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17443744-noah,3,"A pretty good, sweeping survey of human history in regards to human evolution and technological development, filled with lots of illustrations and photos. I imagine much of this work is outdated now, as the stuff about the origin and evolution of man in particular is at least half a century old, and I’m sure a lot of progress has been made past what was talked about in here. I found parts of the book kind of dry from my perspective, maybe because I’m more into socio-political histories than I am technical and scientific ones; this is also probably why I enjoyed the last chapters of the book the most, where the author, drawing on the previous topics explored, touched on some of the social issues that had risen up during and after WWII. While taking an outdated and Eurocentric view in some of his ideas, others were interesting and somewhat enlightening; in particular, his warnings that we must not let there become a massive division between the educated and uneducated, where the intelligentsia-- with their better schools and more enlightened way of thinking-- live separately from the less educated common folk. He warned that this trend could threaten the stability of our societies, as well as being bad as it would put intelligent individuals living far outside of these highly educated areas at a major disadvantage. This seems very prophetic, as at least in America, there is a growing separation between highly-educated populations concentrated in urbanized areas and poorly-educated ones living in rural ones, which further perpetuates an increasingly divisive political atmosphere where the educated and uneducated support increasingly differentiated socio-economic causes. Just this insight alone, and how prophetic it seems to me in regards to our contemporary social issues, made this book worthwhile. "
66,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"Though somewhat dated this is an outstanding book. Bronowski takes us on a journey through time and shows us his view of how man became Man. Man has the hands of a tool maker and the mind of a sage. On top of this he/she is the archetype of the social animal. Man loves to build and discover. He takes amazing pleasure in his own skills. I think it is clear that Bronowski sees Science as the Mount Everest of Man's skill set and mathematics is the language used on this mountain. The Ascent of Man is Man climbing this mountain.Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Mendel, Mendeleev, Boltzmann, Plank, Gauss, Born, Heisenberg and of course Einstein ... these are just a few of the ""great sages of history"" as Bronowski see it. They are among the greatest of mountain climbers.I will end with a quote from Bronowski that gives me pause in regard to humankind today. I will not get political. But I suspect you can image how this quote elucidates today's world:“Knowledge is not a loose-leaf notebook of facts. Above all, it is a responsibility for integrity of what we are, primarily of what we are as ethical creatures. You cannot possibly maintain that informed integrity if you let other people run the world for you while you yourself continue to live out of a ragbag of morals that come from past beliefs.”"
67,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44540721-albert-strong,3,"This book was a fun read however not exactly what I expected. I did not see the PBS special but heard it highly praised at one time. This is the Companion book. It is one long essay on the ascent of man from the prospective of developing scientific discovery and the contributions of said science to the development of civilization. I suppose the title made me think of Darwin's Decent of Man and predisposed me to expect the book to be about biological evolution. It is about the evolution of science and civilization. There are chapters at the end of the book dealing with evolution, and they fit neatly into the premise of the book, however they are not the main thrust of the essays.The book was published in 1972 and although science has progressed a great deal since then, I did not notice any place where the science was dated or superseded by recent discovers or research. So from a layman's perspective, which I am, it was well done and left one with a great deal to think about."
68,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1615120-josh,3,"J. Bronowski takes us through the history of humanity by focusing on some of the major developments that have entered society. It's a fun read at the beginning as he discusses processes that developed over generations like sculpture, agriculture, and steel, but towards the middle, as individuals start playing a larger role through scientific achievement, the book starts to read as a bunch of biographies. These biographies offer some insight and telling anecdotes, but it was more of a slog for me at this point. One of his arguments stays with me, and I will continue to ponder it. He claims that the repetitive nature of Easter Island statues represent a culture that ""failed to take the first step on the ascent of rational knowledge."" Humans like to do difficult things, like build giant stone heads, but sometimes they don't carry out a critique of their activity. Are there ""empty repetitions"" in our own culture that we fail to recognize. I read the hardcover version which had a lot of nice pictures in it. "

The first few chapters describe prehistory, development of first tools, agriculture, the use of animals to perform work and of other early inventions. As it moves to more modern times, the book turns into a history of science, mainly focusing on physics, covering Galileo, Newton, Einstein and atomic physics, and on evolutionary biology, covering Darwin, Mendel and Watson. The chapters are mainly a transcript of what was said in the TV show and it shows - I enjoyed the book mainly as a reminder of the show which I watched with great pleasure some years ago. Judged by its own merits the book is OK but not great, simply because everything is covered in a rather cursory way, which was made up in TV by the very interesting visual material. I would recommend skipping this book in favor of the TV show, and to follow up the watching of the show by reading a standalone survey book of history of science, and another book on prehistory. "

It was one of his last works; he passed away in 1974.The title of this book is a play on Darwin's book from 1871, ""The Descent of Man"". Bronowski gives his ""personal view"" of the evolution of humankind, from two million years ago right up to the discovery of the DNA structure and method of cell division in the 1960s. The book feels fairly up-to-date, even today in 2019. In my view it is only missing the space age and the personal computer Internet age.Bronowski's view is modern, fresh and insightful. It is communicated through examples taken from anthropology, architecture, art, science, literature... Some of which are the fruit of his own work as a scientist. He explains why humans are different from animals; why our evolution is cultural, not physical.I've learnt so much from reading this book, and it was so pleasant, not heavy at all.

This overview was created almost 50 years ago for the BBC, so the very most recent elements in this ""ascent"" are not included. Nevertheless, one cannot fail to be stimulated by his insights and perspectives, even if they provoke occasional disagreement. In our age of myopic over-specialization, we often miss the opportunity to step back from our individual specialties to absorb the diversity of knowledge and thought that a liberal arts education once provided. Mr. Bronowski provides an excellent opportunity to rectify that trend."

The book is a fascinating journey , written in a style that illuminates the darkest and distant passages of time with lucidity and foresight.Still at times I thought it was going to be an interesting discussion on man's evolution of thought process and his evolution in general.

You need to realize that Bronowski was a mathematician, not an anthropologist. You also must overlook some of his discussion of primate anthropology, which has been overtaken by DNA studies. Bronowski's reverent, even ebullient, faith in the potential of mankind to rise to new and greater scientific and artistic achievements has never been more refreshing.

He warned that this trend could threaten the stability of our societies, as well as being bad as it would put intelligent individuals living far outside of these highly educated areas at a major disadvantage. This seems very prophetic, as at least in America, there is a growing separation between highly-educated populations concentrated in urbanized areas and poorly-educated ones living in rural ones, which further perpetuates an increasingly divisive political atmosphere where the educated and uneducated support increasingly differentiated socio-economic causes.

The fossil skull belongs to the lemur family Adapis, and was found in chalky deposits outside Paris.”“That is the essence of science: ask an impertinent question, and you are on the way to the pertinent answer.”“Alexander Pope, who was sixteen when Newton published In the Opticks, was surely a less sensuous poet than Shakespeare, yet he uses three or four times as many colour words as Shakespeare, and uses them about ten times as often.”“Power is a new preoccupation, in a sense a new idea, in science. The Industrial Revolution, the English revolution, turned out to be the great discoverer of power. Sources of energy were sought in nature: wind, sun, water, steam, coal. And a question suddenly became concrete: Why are they all one? What relation exists between them? That had never been asked before.”“The Renaissance established the dignity of man. The Industrial Revolution established the unity of nature.”“Niels Bohr was a man with a taste for contemplation and leisure. When he won the Nobel Prize he spent the money on buying a house in the country. His taste for the arts also ran to poetry. He said to Heisenberg, 'When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images'. That is an unexpected thought: when it comes to atoms, language is not describing facts but creating images. But it is so. What lies below the visible world is always imaginary, in the literal sense: a play of images. There is no other way to talk about the invisible – in nature, in art, or in science.”“All information is imperfect. We have to treat it with humility. That is the human condition; and that is what quantum physics says. I mean that literally.”“Man is unique not because he does science, and he is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvellous plasticity of mind. And the Mona Lisa is a very good example, because after all what did Leonardo do for much of his life? He drew anatomical pictures, such as the baby in the womb in the Royal Collection at Windsor. And the brain and the baby is exactly where the plasticity of human behaviour begins.”"
154,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2784348-grady-ormsby,4,"The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski “traces the development of human society through our understanding of science.” The book was designed to accompany the 1973 BBC documentaries of the same name. Narrated by Bronowski and filmed in various locations around the world, the series focuses on the development of humanity through various sciences, history, art, culture, anthropology, literature and philosophy. Touching on the greatest and most influential people and events the reader (or viewer) is taken on a journey from the beginning of Homo sapiens through the stages of hunter/gatherers, herders, farmers, and building of cities with the accompanying specialization of skills and trade. The next giant steps look at not the earliest use of fire for cooking and warmth but its use in the making of metals and the leaps brought about by the of development of tools and weapons. Fire was also essential in the transition of alchemy into chemistry. From that came the scientific revolution powered by new insights into mathematics, astronomy and physics. Other revolutions followed: political and industrial. Revolution led to evolution with Darwin’s new view of the interrelatedness and connectivity of all things. The growth of understanding of genetics helped to achieve a greater understanding of those relationships. The unity of things, however, did not determine sameness, for soon there was the understanding that all was relative and usually uncertain. The basic idea of evolution quickly went beyond the taxonomic structure of kingdom, classes, genera and species into the realization that everything seems to evolve: geology, social structures and relationships, cultural and societal bonds, and even, according to the view of some, the spiritual growth of all of us both individually and as a species.As much as anything reading The Ascent of Man gave me an opportunity to take a long view, to back away from the current irrationality of contemporary politics and social trends and to reestablish a saner perspective on life and the world."
155,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17443744-noah,3,"A pretty good, sweeping survey of human history in regards to human evolution and technological development, filled with lots of illustrations and photos. I imagine much of this work is outdated now, as the stuff about the origin and evolution of man in particular is at least half a century old, and I’m sure a lot of progress has been made past what was talked about in here. I found parts of the book kind of dry from my perspective, maybe because I’m more into socio-political histories than I am technical and scientific ones; this is also probably why I enjoyed the last chapters of the book the most, where the author, drawing on the previous topics explored, touched on some of the social issues that had risen up during and after WWII. While taking an outdated and Eurocentric view in some of his ideas, others were interesting and somewhat enlightening; in particular, his warnings that we must not let there become a massive division between the educated and uneducated, where the intelligentsia-- with their better schools and more enlightened way of thinking-- live separately from the less educated common folk. He warned that this trend could threaten the stability of our societies, as well as being bad as it would put intelligent individuals living far outside of these highly educated areas at a major disadvantage. This seems very prophetic, as at least in America, there is a growing separation between highly-educated populations concentrated in urbanized areas and poorly-educated ones living in rural ones, which further perpetuates an increasingly divisive political atmosphere where the educated and uneducated support increasingly differentiated socio-economic causes. Just this insight alone, and how prophetic it seems to me in regards to our contemporary social issues, made this book worthwhile. "
156,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"Though somewhat dated this is an outstanding book. Bronowski takes us on a journey through time and shows us his view of how man became Man. Man has the hands of a tool maker and the mind of a sage. On top of this he/she is the archetype of the social animal. Man loves to build and discover. He takes amazing pleasure in his own skills. I think it is clear that Bronowski sees Science as the Mount Everest of Man's skill set and mathematics is the language used on this mountain. The Ascent of Man is Man climbing this mountain.Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Mendel, Mendeleev, Boltzmann, Plank, Gauss, Born, Heisenberg and of course Einstein ... these are just a few of the ""great sages of history"" as Bronowski see it. They are among the greatest of mountain climbers.I will end with a quote from Bronowski that gives me pause in regard to humankind today. I will not get political. But I suspect you can image how this quote elucidates today's world:“Knowledge is not a loose-leaf notebook of facts. Above all, it is a responsibility for integrity of what we are, primarily of what we are as ethical creatures. You cannot possibly maintain that informed integrity if you let other people run the world for you while you yourself continue to live out of a ragbag of morals that come from past beliefs.”"
157,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44540721-albert-strong,3,"This book was a fun read however not exactly what I expected. I did not see the PBS special but heard it highly praised at one time. This is the Companion book. It is one long essay on the ascent of man from the prospective of developing scientific discovery and the contributions of said science to the development of civilization. I suppose the title made me think of Darwin's Decent of Man and predisposed me to expect the book to be about biological evolution. It is about the evolution of science and civilization. There are chapters at the end of the book dealing with evolution, and they fit neatly into the premise of the book, however they are not the main thrust of the essays.The book was published in 1972 and although science has progressed a great deal since then, I did not notice any place where the science was dated or superseded by recent discovers or research. So from a layman's perspective, which I am, it was well done and left one with a great deal to think about."
158,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1615120-josh,3,"J. Bronowski takes us through the history of humanity by focusing on some of the major developments that have entered society. It's a fun read at the beginning as he discusses processes that developed over generations like sculpture, agriculture, and steel, but towards the middle, as individuals start playing a larger role through scientific achievement, the book starts to read as a bunch of biographies. These biographies offer some insight and telling anecdotes, but it was more of a slog for me at this point. One of his arguments stays with me, and I will continue to ponder it. He claims that the repetitive nature of Easter Island statues represent a culture that ""failed to take the first step on the ascent of rational knowledge."" Humans like to do difficult things, like build giant stone heads, but sometimes they don't carry out a critique of their activity. Are there ""empty repetitions"" in our own culture that we fail to recognize. I read the hardcover version which had a lot of nice pictures in it. "
159,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988988-jaros-aw-rzesz-tko,3,"History of civilization based on TV series with the same title. The first few chapters describe prehistory, development of first tools, agriculture, the use of animals to perform work and of other early inventions. As it moves to more modern times, the book turns into a history of science, mainly focusing on physics, covering Galileo, Newton, Einstein and atomic physics, and on evolutionary biology, covering Darwin, Mendel and Watson. The chapters are mainly a transcript of what was said in the TV show and it shows - I enjoyed the book mainly as a reminder of the show which I watched with great pleasure some years ago. Judged by its own merits the book is OK but not great, simply because everything is covered in a rather cursory way, which was made up in TV by the very interesting visual material. I would recommend skipping this book in favor of the TV show, and to follow up the watching of the show by reading a standalone survey book of history of science, and another book on prehistory. "

It was one of his last works; he passed away in 1974.The title of this book is a play on Darwin's book from 1871, ""The Descent of Man"". Bronowski gives his ""personal view"" of the evolution of humankind, from two million years ago right up to the discovery of the DNA structure and method of cell division in the 1960s. The book feels fairly up-to-date, even today in 2019. In my view it is only missing the space age and the personal computer Internet age.Bronowski's view is modern, fresh and insightful. It is communicated through examples taken from anthropology, architecture, art, science, literature... Some of which are the fruit of his own work as a scientist. He explains why humans are different from animals; why our evolution is cultural, not physical.I've learnt so much from reading this book, and it was so pleasant, not heavy at all.

This overview was created almost 50 years ago for the BBC, so the very most recent elements in this ""ascent"" are not included. Nevertheless, one cannot fail to be stimulated by his insights and perspectives, even if they provoke occasional disagreement. In our age of myopic over-specialization, we often miss the opportunity to step back from our individual specialties to absorb the diversity of knowledge and thought that a liberal arts education once provided.

The Industrial Revolution, the English revolution, turned out to be the great discoverer of power. Sources of energy were sought in nature: wind, sun, water, steam, coal. And a question suddenly became concrete: Why are they all one? What relation exists between them? That had never been asked before.”“The Renaissance established the dignity of man. The Industrial Revolution established the unity of nature.”“Niels Bohr was a man with a taste for contemplation and leisure. When he won the Nobel Prize he spent the money on buying a house in the country. His taste for the arts also ran to poetry. He said to Heisenberg, 'When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images'. That is an unexpected thought: when it comes to atoms, language is not describing facts but creating images. But it is so. What lies below the visible world is always imaginary, in the literal sense: a play of images. There is no other way to talk about the invisible – in nature, in art, or in science.”“All information is imperfect. We have to treat it with humility. That is the human condition; and that is what quantum physics says. I mean that literally.”“Man is unique not because he does science, and he is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvellous plasticity of mind. And the Mona Lisa is a very good example, because after all what did Leonardo do for much of his life? He drew anatomical pictures, such as the baby in the womb in the Royal Collection at Windsor. And the brain and the baby is exactly where the plasticity of human behaviour begins.”"

Narrated by Bronowski and filmed in various locations around the world, the series focuses on the development of humanity through various sciences, history, art, culture, anthropology, literature and philosophy. Touching on the greatest and most influential people and events the reader (or viewer) is taken on a journey from the beginning of Homo sapiens through the stages of hunter/gatherers, herders, farmers, and building of cities with the accompanying specialization of skills and trade. The next giant steps look at not the earliest use of fire for cooking and warmth but its use in the making of metals and the leaps brought about by the of development of tools and weapons. Fire was also essential in the transition of alchemy into chemistry. From that came the scientific revolution powered by new insights into mathematics, astronomy and physics. Other revolutions followed: political and industrial. Revolution led to evolution with Darwin’s new view of the interrelatedness and connectivity of all things. The growth of understanding of genetics helped to achieve a greater understanding of those relationships. The unity of things, however, did not determine sameness, for soon there was the understanding that all was relative and usually uncertain. The basic idea of evolution quickly went beyond the taxonomic structure of kingdom, classes, genera and species into the realization that everything seems to evolve: geology, social structures and relationships, cultural and societal bonds, and even, according to the view of some, the spiritual growth of all of us both individually and as a species.As much as anything reading The Ascent of Man gave me an opportunity to take a long view, to back away from the current irrationality of contemporary politics and social trends and to reestablish a saner perspective on life and the world."

I imagine much of this work is outdated now, as the stuff about the origin and evolution of man in particular is at least half a century old, and I’m sure a lot of progress has been made past what was talked about in here. I found parts of the book kind of dry from my perspective, maybe because I’m more into socio-political histories than I am technical and scientific ones; this is also probably why I enjoyed the last chapters of the book the most, where the author, drawing on the previous topics explored, touched on some of the social issues that had risen up during and after WWII. While taking an outdated and Eurocentric view in some of his ideas, others were interesting and somewhat enlightening; in particular, his warnings that we must not let there become a massive division between the educated and uneducated, where the intelligentsia-- with their better schools and more enlightened way of thinking-- live separately from the less educated common folk. He warned that this trend could threaten the stability of our societies, as well as being bad as it would put intelligent individuals living far outside of these highly educated areas at a major disadvantage. This seems very prophetic, as at least in America, there is a growing separation between highly-educated populations concentrated in urbanized areas and poorly-educated ones living in rural ones, which further perpetuates an increasingly divisive political atmosphere where the educated and uneducated support increasingly differentiated socio-economic causes. Just this insight alone, and how prophetic it seems to me in regards to our contemporary social issues, made this book worthwhile. "

Bronowski takes us on a journey through time and shows us his view of how man became Man. Man has the hands of a tool maker and the mind of a sage. On top of this he/she is the archetype of the social animal. Man loves to build and discover. He takes amazing pleasure in his own skills. I think it is clear that Bronowski sees Science as the Mount Everest of Man's skill set and mathematics is the language used on this mountain. The Ascent of Man is Man climbing this mountain.Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Mendel, Mendeleev, Boltzmann, Plank, Gauss, Born, Heisenberg and of course Einstein ... these are just a few of the ""great sages of history"" as Bronowski see it. They are among the greatest of mountain climbers.I will end with a quote from Bronowski that gives me pause in regard to humankind today. I will not get political. But I suspect you can image how this quote elucidates today's world:“Knowledge is not a loose-leaf notebook of facts. Above all, it is a responsibility for integrity of what we are, primarily of what we are as ethical creatures. You cannot possibly maintain that informed integrity if you let other people run the world for you while you yourself continue to live out of a ragbag of morals that come from past beliefs.”"

I suppose the title made me think of Darwin's Decent of Man and predisposed me to expect the book to be about biological evolution. It is about the evolution of science and civilization.

The first few chapters describe prehistory, development of first tools, agriculture, the use of animals to perform work and of other early inventions. As it moves to more modern times, the book turns into a history of science, mainly focusing on physics, covering Galileo, Newton, Einstein and atomic physics, and on evolutionary biology, covering Darwin, Mendel and Watson. The chapters are mainly a transcript of what was said in the TV show and it shows - I enjoyed the book mainly as a reminder of the show which I watched with great pleasure some years ago. Judged by its own merits the book is OK but not great, simply because everything is covered in a rather cursory way, which was made up in TV by the very interesting visual material. I would recommend skipping this book in favor of the TV show, and to follow up the watching of the show by reading a standalone survey book of history of science, and another book on prehistory. "
190,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/106196538-jean-fran-ois-c-lemay,5,"After having created and presented the thirteen episodes of ""The Ascent of Man"" on the BBC in 1973, Jacob Bronowski wrote this book in thirteen corresponding chapters. It was one of his last works; he passed away in 1974.The title of this book is a play on Darwin's book from 1871, ""The Descent of Man"". Bronowski gives his ""personal view"" of the evolution of humankind, from two million years ago right up to the discovery of the DNA structure and method of cell division in the 1960s. The book feels fairly up-to-date, even today in 2019. In my view it is only missing the space age and the personal computer Internet age.Bronowski's view is modern, fresh and insightful. It is communicated through examples taken from anthropology, architecture, art, science, literature... Some of which are the fruit of his own work as a scientist. He explains why humans are different from animals; why our evolution is cultural, not physical.I've learnt so much from reading this book, and it was so pleasant, not heavy at all. I recommend it to everyone."
191,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77479990-stephanie-kuchner,5,"As impossible as it might seem to condense the historical/scientific/cultural development of human beings in only 13 hours of TV (or 13 chapters in a book), Mr. Bronowski does so in a sensitive and provocative manner. This overview was created almost 50 years ago for the BBC, so the very most recent elements in this ""ascent"" are not included. Nevertheless, one cannot fail to be stimulated by his insights and perspectives, even if they provoke occasional disagreement. In our age of myopic over-specialization, we often miss the opportunity to step back from our individual specialties to absorb the diversity of knowledge and thought that a liberal arts education once provided. Mr. Bronowski provides an excellent opportunity to rectify that trend."
192,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18897242-mbm,4,"One of my all time favorite books from college that is definitely a keeper and still relevent after all these years. If you read each chapter and view the corresponding video text it produce sa truly amazing insight into the development of mankinds knowledge. Similiar in style to ""Connections"" it is quite possibly more engrossing. The book is a fascinating journey , written in a style that illuminates the darkest and distant passages of time with lucidity and foresight.Still at times I thought it was going to be an interesting discussion on man's evolution of thought process and his evolution in general. It was an old guy sounding aristocratic blowing his own horn thinking he was so smart. I wish he had a better editor and pictures in the book are pointless. It needs an updated look and editing. Does not stand up as well as Civilization with Kenneth Clark"
193,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39305467-richard-cox,5,"I was mesmerized by the BBC series when I was a child, and I was just as engrossed reading the companion book (mostly a literal transcription of the program) some 45 years later. You need to realize that Bronowski was a mathematician, not an anthropologist. You also must overlook some of his discussion of primate anthropology, which has been overtaken by DNA studies. Bronowski's reverent, even ebullient, faith in the potential of mankind to rise to new and greater scientific and artistic achievements has never been more refreshing. His warning against the drive for absolute knowledge and absolute power just as timeless as ever."
194,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19345473-sethukumar-ramachandran,4,"A good account of how humans progressed from the beginning based on evidences, logical reasoning with support of accepted scientific tools and principles and methodologies that is not biased towards any myths or belief systems. Bronowski was a mathematician and well aware of the importance reasoning over myths to be used on perspectives regarding historical events. Afterall science is another belief system but probably the only one which can be questioned and collect evidences in support or against."
195,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40954422-matt,5,"Very interesting look at the history of science and innovation. The book is a little dated (1979) but interesting none the less. I would love to see a re-write or sequel to this book that included the last 35 years, as the book as written, missed some of the space age, the end of the cold-war, the information age (rise of computers), microbiology and medicine advancements, etc. I would love to know the authors thoughts on how the last 35+ years have fit into the ascent of mankind.

196,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63387128-derek-young,5,"Really interesting book. I thought the interplay between the history of science and history of art were really interesting.

Many intersting arguments about the importance of freedom and diversity to ensure the continousity of the human evolution.The only thing which bored me sometime was the dip-diving into a very specific topic technically, which I thought was not very necessary for the overall flow of the book."

Although some facts are not completely true, the book stands out as one of the first popular science texts that was made into a television series. Bronowski is one of the few renaissance men of our time. He weaves a splendid story filled with hope and insight to the human condition. I can only say -- that I will be reading it again to gain further nuggets of wisdom. A must read for those of us who wish to gain knowledge of humanity's quest for better tomorrow... Splendid!"

A little outdated since it was written a while back, but I still got some interesting facts and ideas from it. The main complaint I have is that it seems this was directly copied from the original TV series with very little or no editing. A few passages are clearly referring to something that was being shown on the TV, and were not edited for the book. There are definitely better, more updated books like this (Harari's Sapiens and Homo Deus come to mind)."

Like Sagan's Cosmos, this should be required reading.An incredible run through some of the key highlights from man's scientific history. Although the topics covered are varied, in every essay you can almost feel the beating of Brownowski's heart. He was an incredible human and an incredible storyteller. His vision of human history is intensely coloured by his own humanity."

The fossil skull belongs to the lemur family Adapis, and was found in chalky deposits outside Paris.”“That is the essence of science: ask an impertinent question, and you are on the way to the pertinent answer.”“Alexander Pope, who was sixteen when Newton published In the Opticks, was surely a less sensuous poet than Shakespeare, yet he uses three or four times as many colour words as Shakespeare, and uses them about ten times as often.”“Power is a new preoccupation, in a sense a new idea, in science. The Industrial Revolution, the English revolution, turned out to be the great discoverer of power. Sources of energy were sought in nature: wind, sun, water, steam, coal. And a question suddenly became concrete: Why are they all one? What relation exists between them? That had never been asked before.”“The Renaissance established the dignity of man. The Industrial Revolution established the unity of nature.”“Niels Bohr was a man with a taste for contemplation and leisure. When he won the Nobel Prize he spent the money on buying a house in the country. His taste for the arts also ran to poetry. He said to Heisenberg, 'When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images'. That is an unexpected thought: when it comes to atoms, language is not describing facts but creating images. But it is so. What lies below the visible world is always imaginary, in the literal sense: a play of images. There is no other way to talk about the invisible – in nature, in art, or in science.”“All information is imperfect. We have to treat it with humility. That is the human condition; and that is what quantum physics says. I mean that literally.”“Man is unique not because he does science, and he is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvellous plasticity of mind. And the Mona Lisa is a very good example, because after all what did Leonardo do for much of his life? He drew anatomical pictures, such as the baby in the womb in the Royal Collection at Windsor. And the brain and the baby is exactly where the plasticity of human behaviour begins.”"
244,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2784348-grady-ormsby,4,"The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski “traces the development of human society through our understanding of science.” The book was designed to accompany the 1973 BBC documentaries of the same name. Narrated by Bronowski and filmed in various locations around the world, the series focuses on the development of humanity through various sciences, history, art, culture, anthropology, literature and philosophy. Touching on the greatest and most influential people and events the reader (or viewer) is taken on a journey from the beginning of Homo sapiens through the stages of hunter/gatherers, herders, farmers, and building of cities with the accompanying specialization of skills and trade. The next giant steps look at not the earliest use of fire for cooking and warmth but its use in the making of metals and the leaps brought about by the of development of tools and weapons. Fire was also essential in the transition of alchemy into chemistry. From that came the scientific revolution powered by new insights into mathematics, astronomy and physics. Other revolutions followed: political and industrial. Revolution led to evolution with Darwin’s new view of the interrelatedness and connectivity of all things. The growth of understanding of genetics helped to achieve a greater understanding of those relationships. The unity of things, however, did not determine sameness, for soon there was the understanding that all was relative and usually uncertain. The basic idea of evolution quickly went beyond the taxonomic structure of kingdom, classes, genera and species into the realization that everything seems to evolve: geology, social structures and relationships, cultural and societal bonds, and even, according to the view of some, the spiritual growth of all of us both individually and as a species.As much as anything reading The Ascent of Man gave me an opportunity to take a long view, to back away from the current irrationality of contemporary politics and social trends and to reestablish a saner perspective on life and the world."
245,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17443744-noah,3,"A pretty good, sweeping survey of human history in regards to human evolution and technological development, filled with lots of illustrations and photos. I imagine much of this work is outdated now, as the stuff about the origin and evolution of man in particular is at least half a century old, and I’m sure a lot of progress has been made past what was talked about in here. I found parts of the book kind of dry from my perspective, maybe because I’m more into socio-political histories than I am technical and scientific ones; this is also probably why I enjoyed the last chapters of the book the most, where the author, drawing on the previous topics explored, touched on some of the social issues that had risen up during and after WWII. While taking an outdated and Eurocentric view in some of his ideas, others were interesting and somewhat enlightening; in particular, his warnings that we must not let there become a massive division between the educated and uneducated, where the intelligentsia-- with their better schools and more enlightened way of thinking-- live separately from the less educated common folk. He warned that this trend could threaten the stability of our societies, as well as being bad as it would put intelligent individuals living far outside of these highly educated areas at a major disadvantage. This seems very prophetic, as at least in America, there is a growing separation between highly-educated populations concentrated in urbanized areas and poorly-educated ones living in rural ones, which further perpetuates an increasingly divisive political atmosphere where the educated and uneducated support increasingly differentiated socio-economic causes. Just this insight alone, and how prophetic it seems to me in regards to our contemporary social issues, made this book worthwhile. "
246,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"Though somewhat dated this is an outstanding book. Bronowski takes us on a journey through time and shows us his view of how man became Man. Man has the hands of a tool maker and the mind of a sage. On top of this he/she is the archetype of the social animal. Man loves to build and discover. He takes amazing pleasure in his own skills. I think it is clear that Bronowski sees Science as the Mount Everest of Man's skill set and mathematics is the language used on this mountain. The Ascent of Man is Man climbing this mountain.Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Mendel, Mendeleev, Boltzmann, Plank, Gauss, Born, Heisenberg and of course Einstein ... these are just a few of the ""great sages of history"" as Bronowski see it. They are among the greatest of mountain climbers.I will end with a quote from Bronowski that gives me pause in regard to humankind today. I will not get political. But I suspect you can image how this quote elucidates today's world:“Knowledge is not a loose-leaf notebook of facts. Above all, it is a responsibility for integrity of what we are, primarily of what we are as ethical creatures. You cannot possibly maintain that informed integrity if you let other people run the world for you while you yourself continue to live out of a ragbag of morals that come from past beliefs.”"
247,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44540721-albert-strong,3,"This book was a fun read however not exactly what I expected. I did not see the PBS special but heard it highly praised at one time. This is the Companion book. It is one long essay on the ascent of man from the prospective of developing scientific discovery and the contributions of said science to the development of civilization. I suppose the title made me think of Darwin's Decent of Man and predisposed me to expect the book to be about biological evolution. It is about the evolution of science and civilization. There are chapters at the end of the book dealing with evolution, and they fit neatly into the premise of the book, however they are not the main thrust of the essays.The book was published in 1972 and although science has progressed a great deal since then, I did not notice any place where the science was dated or superseded by recent discovers or research. So from a layman's perspective, which I am, it was well done and left one with a great deal to think about."

It's a fun read at the beginning as he discusses processes that developed over generations like sculpture, agriculture, and steel, but towards the middle, as individuals start playing a larger role through scientific achievement, the book starts to read as a bunch of biographies. These biographies offer some insight and telling anecdotes, but it was more of a slog for me at this point. One of his arguments stays with me, and I will continue to ponder it. He claims that the repetitive nature of Easter Island statues represent a culture that ""failed to take the first step on the ascent of rational knowledge."" Humans like to do difficult things, like build giant stone heads, but sometimes they don't carry out a critique of their activity. Are there ""empty repetitions"" in our own culture that we fail to recognize. I read the hardcover version which had a lot of nice pictures in it. "

The fossil skull belongs to the lemur family Adapis, and was found in chalky deposits outside Paris.”“That is the essence of science: ask an impertinent question, and you are on the way to the pertinent answer.”“Alexander Pope, who was sixteen when Newton published In the Opticks, was surely a less sensuous poet than Shakespeare, yet he uses three or four times as many colour words as Shakespeare, and uses them about ten times as often.”“Power is a new preoccupation, in a sense a new idea, in science. The Industrial Revolution, the English revolution, turned out to be the great discoverer of power. Sources of energy were sought in nature: wind, sun, water, steam, coal. And a question suddenly became concrete: Why are they all one? What relation exists between them? That had never been asked before.”“The Renaissance established the dignity of man. The Industrial Revolution established the unity of nature.”“Niels Bohr was a man with a taste for contemplation and leisure. When he won the Nobel Prize he spent the money on buying a house in the country. His taste for the arts also ran to poetry. He said to Heisenberg, 'When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images'. That is an unexpected thought: when it comes to atoms, language is not describing facts but creating images. But it is so. What lies below the visible world is always imaginary, in the literal sense: a play of images. There is no other way to talk about the invisible – in nature, in art, or in science.”“All information is imperfect. We have to treat it with humility. That is the human condition; and that is what quantum physics says. I mean that literally.”“Man is unique not because he does science, and he is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvellous plasticity of mind. And the Mona Lisa is a very good example, because after all what did Leonardo do for much of his life? He drew anatomical pictures, such as the baby in the womb in the Royal Collection at Windsor. And the brain and the baby is exactly where the plasticity of human behaviour begins.”"
274,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2784348-grady-ormsby,4,"The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski “traces the development of human society through our understanding of science.” The book was designed to accompany the 1973 BBC documentaries of the same name. Narrated by Bronowski and filmed in various locations around the world, the series focuses on the development of humanity through various sciences, history, art, culture, anthropology, literature and philosophy. Touching on the greatest and most influential people and events the reader (or viewer) is taken on a journey from the beginning of Homo sapiens through the stages of hunter/gatherers, herders, farmers, and building of cities with the accompanying specialization of skills and trade. The next giant steps look at not the earliest use of fire for cooking and warmth but its use in the making of metals and the leaps brought about by the of development of tools and weapons. Fire was also essential in the transition of alchemy into chemistry. From that came the scientific revolution powered by new insights into mathematics, astronomy and physics. Other revolutions followed: political and industrial. Revolution led to evolution with Darwin’s new view of the interrelatedness and connectivity of all things. The growth of understanding of genetics helped to achieve a greater understanding of those relationships. The unity of things, however, did not determine sameness, for soon there was the understanding that all was relative and usually uncertain. The basic idea of evolution quickly went beyond the taxonomic structure of kingdom, classes, genera and species into the realization that everything seems to evolve: geology, social structures and relationships, cultural and societal bonds, and even, according to the view of some, the spiritual growth of all of us both individually and as a species.As much as anything reading The Ascent of Man gave me an opportunity to take a long view, to back away from the current irrationality of contemporary politics and social trends and to reestablish a saner perspective on life and the world."
275,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17443744-noah,3,"A pretty good, sweeping survey of human history in regards to human evolution and technological development, filled with lots of illustrations and photos. I imagine much of this work is outdated now, as the stuff about the origin and evolution of man in particular is at least half a century old, and I’m sure a lot of progress has been made past what was talked about in here. I found parts of the book kind of dry from my perspective, maybe because I’m more into socio-political histories than I am technical and scientific ones; this is also probably why I enjoyed the last chapters of the book the most, where the author, drawing on the previous topics explored, touched on some of the social issues that had risen up during and after WWII. While taking an outdated and Eurocentric view in some of his ideas, others were interesting and somewhat enlightening; in particular, his warnings that we must not let there become a massive division between the educated and uneducated, where the intelligentsia-- with their better schools and more enlightened way of thinking-- live separately from the less educated common folk. He warned that this trend could threaten the stability of our societies, as well as being bad as it would put intelligent individuals living far outside of these highly educated areas at a major disadvantage. This seems very prophetic, as at least in America, there is a growing separation between highly-educated populations concentrated in urbanized areas and poorly-educated ones living in rural ones, which further perpetuates an increasingly divisive political atmosphere where the educated and uneducated support increasingly differentiated socio-economic causes. Just this insight alone, and how prophetic it seems to me in regards to our contemporary social issues, made this book worthwhile. "
276,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/513697-kim-marshall,5,"Though somewhat dated this is an outstanding book. Bronowski takes us on a journey through time and shows us his view of how man became Man. Man has the hands of a tool maker and the mind of a sage. On top of this he/she is the archetype of the social animal. Man loves to build and discover. He takes amazing pleasure in his own skills. I think it is clear that Bronowski sees Science as the Mount Everest of Man's skill set and mathematics is the language used on this mountain. The Ascent of Man is Man climbing this mountain.Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Mendel, Mendeleev, Boltzmann, Plank, Gauss, Born, Heisenberg and of course Einstein ... these are just a few of the ""great sages of history"" as Bronowski see it. They are among the greatest of mountain climbers.I will end with a quote from Bronowski that gives me pause in regard to humankind today. I will not get political. But I suspect you can image how this quote elucidates today's world:“Knowledge is not a loose-leaf notebook of facts. Above all, it is a responsibility for integrity of what we are, primarily of what we are as ethical creatures. You cannot possibly maintain that informed integrity if you let other people run the world for you while you yourself continue to live out of a ragbag of morals that come from past beliefs.”"
277,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44540721-albert-strong,3,"This book was a fun read however not exactly what I expected. I did not see the PBS special but heard it highly praised at one time. This is the Companion book. It is one long essay on the ascent of man from the prospective of developing scientific discovery and the contributions of said science to the development of civilization. I suppose the title made me think of Darwin's Decent of Man and predisposed me to expect the book to be about biological evolution. It is about the evolution of science and civilization. There are chapters at the end of the book dealing with evolution, and they fit neatly into the premise of the book, however they are not the main thrust of the essays.The book was published in 1972 and although science has progressed a great deal since then, I did not notice any place where the science was dated or superseded by recent discovers or research. So from a layman's perspective, which I am, it was well done and left one with a great deal to think about."
278,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1615120-josh,3,"J. Bronowski takes us through the history of humanity by focusing on some of the major developments that have entered society. It's a fun read at the beginning as he discusses processes that developed over generations like sculpture, agriculture, and steel, but towards the middle, as individuals start playing a larger role through scientific achievement, the book starts to read as a bunch of biographies. These biographies offer some insight and telling anecdotes, but it was more of a slog for me at this point. One of his arguments stays with me, and I will continue to ponder it. He claims that the repetitive nature of Easter Island statues represent a culture that ""failed to take the first step on the ascent of rational knowledge."" Humans like to do difficult things, like build giant stone heads, but sometimes they don't carry out a critique of their activity. Are there ""empty repetitions"" in our own culture that we fail to recognize. I read the hardcover version which had a lot of nice pictures in it. "
279,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5988988-jaros-aw-rzesz-tko,3,"History of civilization based on TV series with the same title. The first few chapters describe prehistory, development of first tools, agriculture, the use of animals to perform work and of other early inventions. As it moves to more modern times, the book turns into a history of science, mainly focusing on physics, covering Galileo, Newton, Einstein and atomic physics, and on evolutionary biology, covering Darwin, Mendel and Watson. The chapters are mainly a transcript of what was said in the TV show and it shows - I enjoyed the book mainly as a reminder of the show which I watched with great pleasure some years ago. Judged by its own merits the book is OK but not great, simply because everything is covered in a rather cursory way, which was made up in TV by the very interesting visual material. I would recommend skipping this book in favor of the TV show, and to follow up the watching of the show by reading a standalone survey book of history of science, and another book on prehistory. "

It was one of his last works; he passed away in 1974.The title of this book is a play on Darwin's book from 1871, ""The Descent of Man"". Bronowski gives his ""personal view"" of the evolution of humankind, from two million years ago right up to the discovery of the DNA structure and method of cell division in the 1960s. The book feels fairly up-to-date, even today in 2019. In my view it is only missing the space age and the personal computer Internet age.Bronowski's view is modern, fresh and insightful. It is communicated through examples taken from anthropology, architecture, art, science, literature... Some of which are the fruit of his own work as a scientist. He explains why humans are different from animals; why our evolution is cultural, not physical.I've learnt so much from reading this book, and it was so pleasant, not heavy at all. I recommend it to everyone."
281,0316109339,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77479990-stephanie-kuchner,5,"As impossible as it might seem to condense the historical/scientific/cultural development of human beings in only 13 hours of TV (or 13 chapters in a book), Mr. Bronowski does so in a sensitive and provocative manner. This overview was created almost 50 years ago for the BBC, so the very most recent elements in this ""ascent"" are not included. Nevertheless, one cannot fail to be stimulated by his insights and perspectives, even if they provoke occasional disagreement. In our age of myopic over-specialization, we often miss the opportunity to step back from our individual specialties to absorb the diversity of knowledge and thought that a liberal arts education once provided. Mr. Bronowski provides an excellent opportunity to rectify that trend."

If you read each chapter and view the corresponding video text it produce sa truly amazing insight into the development of mankinds knowledge. Similiar in style to ""Connections"" it is quite possibly more engrossing. The book is a fascinating journey , written in a style that illuminates the darkest and distant passages of time with lucidity and foresight.Still at times I thought it was going to be an interesting discussion on man's evolution of thought process and his evolution in general. It was an old guy sounding aristocratic blowing his own horn thinking he was so smart. I wish he had a better editor and pictures in the book are pointless. It needs an updated look and editing.

You need to realize that Bronowski was a mathematician, not an anthropologist. You also must overlook some of his discussion of primate anthropology, which has been overtaken by DNA studies. Bronowski's reverent, even ebullient, faith in the potential of mankind to rise to new and greater scientific and artistic achievements has never been more refreshing. His warning against the drive for absolute knowledge and absolute power just as timeless as ever."
