0,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,2,"I’m not sure if this book quite worked out what it wanted to be. Besides getting to say, ‘and that is the power of zero’, over and over again it wasn’t quite sure where it should pitch itself and the guy writing it was never quite certain how much back knowledge he could rely on his audience actually having. This meant subjects were generally treated too cursory so I was left thinking ‘wait a second, what happened there?’. His discussion of Gauss was very complicated and hard to follow (not nearly as interesting as Euclid's Window The Story of Geometry from Parallel Lines to Hyperspace – A book I mentally compared this to throughout) but then, bizarrely, he went into a fairly detailed description of the Doppler effect, for instance. This book would have benefited from being edited by someone who knew virtually nothing about science. And they could have written on the sides of the page either ‘oh, I see’ or ‘WTF?’There are many interesting little bits to all this that made it worthwhile, though – the stuff on Pythagoras was interesting – I didn’t know he didn’t eat beans because they make people fart and because they look like little genitals (I’ve never really looked closely enough at beans to notice this resemblance, to be honest, but it does sound as good a reason for a food aversion as any other, I guess). I also didn’t know he was killed because he refused to cross a field of beans (makes my rantings about only going into McDonalds to use their toilets – I only make deposits, no withdrawals - sound perfectly enlightened, if you ask me).There were also interesting bits about vanishing points being zeros and therefore the relationship between space and zero being something non-trivial – but all of that stuff is handled much more interestingly in The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace A History of Space from Dante to the Internet (even if I still have problems with the last bits of that book).Look, it wasn’t a bad book – but I felt it struggled due to feeling it had to make zero the core concept of all of science. This is a trend in this sort of book – you know, pick something (nutmeg or coffee or space) and show it as the nexus through which all strands of the universe can be understood. Generally, this is handled better than it has been handled here though.PS - I hadn't realised this is the same guy who wrote Decoding the Universe How the New Science of Information Is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes - suddenly, things make much more sense."
1,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57709-gene,5,"A book about numbers that had me laughing out loud while I was on vacation. My wife could not understand how a book about math could make me laugh so much...But any book that shows the horrible mistake that not having a Year 0 (i.e., 1 BC and 1 AD are adjancent) would have on history as well as subtraction mistakes, how infinity is really is zero's tricky friend, and make almost understandable the reason why the amazing equation ""e ^ (pi * i) = -1"" is true is pretty fantastic.I laughed, I cried. Amazing book."
2,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24133187-usha,4,"It's a fascinating and an affirming read. It's difficult to understand any regiment of mathematics and physics without the number zero. Seife reveals, how it's acceptance took time, overcoming of religious and cultural preconceptions and other serious appraisals and tribulations. Without zero, there be no calculus, algebra, astronomy, quantum physics nor understanding of space, beginning and end of the universe, black holes, vacuum and the list goes on into infinity."
3,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2938614-tania,4,"Zero is quite an undertaking - the author attacks this microhistory with an ambitious goal: to explain how zero came to be, and how it has factored into math and science, and even the dawn of the universe, from the beginning of time. That's a lot to cover. I respect Seife's attempts to make the text more interesting to the layman, but in my opinion the infused excitement is a bit much. Still, there's a ton of information to be found in this book, and it is pretty interesting to see how drastically math and science changed over the centuries."
4,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/669573-kathrynn,5,"Wow! A tremendous amount of information is packed between the cover pages of this little book. I had no idea zero created such controversy--in religion and math/science. Fascinating facts about how our calendar system is ahead by a year BECAUSE we should have begun with year zero, not one. So, when December 31, 1999 came around, true mathematicians didn't celebrate the millenium until December 31, 2000. The Mayan's had the calendar system figured out. They started with zero, but didn't call it that. Interesting, because we do consider some things as zero, i.e., babies are not born and then automatically considered to be 1 year old. They are 1 month, 6 months, etc, then they are 1. Makes sense.I enjoyed how the author used examples that I could relate to when explaining thermodynamics, quantum physics, time-travel, black holes (wormholes), etc. Enjoyed the e (calculus), too. A lot of historical information about our number system is enclosed in this book, e.g., where the word Algebra came from. There are also names, theories, dates and some interesting stories to help bring the time period(s) to life. Appendix E: How to Make Your Own Wormhole (time machine) was humorous. The last chapters dove into physics, time-travel, black holes, our galaxy, how the star distances were measured, how the universe came to be (big bang theory) and how it may end, how we can travel vast distances on little fuel. It was very complicated, but I now understand why we haven't been able to do it yet. The universe is still expanding. Some galaxies are speeding further away from us. There are still large hunks of nothing in space. The author goes into what is going on with our sun. Einstein and his theories are throughout the book, too. Interestingly, all this ties right into zero. A black hole is zero. Vast nothingness. How zero and God correlate. Great book!5 Star Favorite!"
5,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34236-jeb,3,"Zero is the story of the number, the time that elapsed before its acceptance, and how the ideas behind it (the void and its opposite, infinity) shook the ideals of religion and science across the globe. The book advances through time chronologically, from the Greek philosophers through Renaissance paintings through Einstein's relativity, ending with speculations on string theory. And yes, all of this is fantasia on the theme of the number zero.I didn't expect this book to be so math-heavy and sort of resented the reintroduction to the Rule of L'Hopital. But overall I found this to be an enjoyable read. My favorite parts were the discoveries of the old Greek musicians and the artists who moonlighted as math dudes. The first section of the book reminded me of that one Donald Duck cartoon [(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_i...)].In my opinion, the ideal audience for this book is kids who are just about to take calculus, because Zero makes the math is both applicable and fun. But also an interesting read for adults. Just be warned that part of this book involves a journey back to high school math equations."
6,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46422-tk-keanini,5,"I agree that this was a great book. When I was reading it, I thought what a wonderful experience it would be if the walls between Mathmatics, History, Social Science, and English weren't so high, this type of learning could take place in a middle school setting. If I had read this book when i was in middle school, I would have been wagging my tail in math class every day."
7,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67130556-prakriti-regmi,4,"The range of the book, BRILLIANT! It opened with the use of numbers, logics for tallying, and closed with mankind’s attempt to better understand the cosmos. And every chapter, reasonably, screamed the power of zero. It's substantiality in solving some ground-breaking scientific theories to the ability to sabotage a whole branch in science! A descriptive and fascinating read. "
8,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7206839-jenny,4,"Another one of the best books that I've read recently. Seife does an excellent job of turning zero into a subject. It is a number, and it is an idea; it is a troublemaker, and it is a problem solver. The biography is very interesting, beginning with history and philosophy and ending with science and the modern age.I enjoyed the actual writing of the book: clear and easy to follow, slightly humorous at times (in a Stephen Hawking kind of way), and clever. I like the chapter titles (beginning with Chapter Zero and ending with Chapter Infinity) and the fact that Seife is not biased. He simply conveys historical and scientific fact, not allowing his opinions to leak through his words. I don't like when scientists make it obvious that they're not only proving theories but also trying to disprove God. Seife never does that--he just presents ideas and explains how zero went from being reviled and feared to respected to something that needs to be erased once more. My only critique is that the first part of the book is very easy to understand, but during the second half when Seife discusses modern mathematics and science, the narrative becomes more difficult to follow if the reader isn't a calculus major or a physicist (neither of which I am...). Still, there are nice illustrations that make Seife's points clearer.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the idea of zero, its origins and usefulness, its place in the world, or to anyone who loves math and science."
9,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/718298-david,4,This book made me want to actually learn calculus. At least until the brain fever wore off. :)
10,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5818175-huydx,5,"Very cool book, it covers many interesting facts."
11,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109401913-maximilian-wolf,5,It is not a book for scientists and engineers only.All people with a curious and open mind should read it and spread their views on the world and universe.I did enjoy it.
12,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,4,"My grade 11 math teacher gave this to me, and I remember reading it and loving it. Here I am, three years later, returning to Zero for a second read. No longer the gullible high school student (now a gullible university student!), I'm apt to be more critical of Zero. Nevertheless, it stands up to a second reading and both inspires and informs.Imagining a world without zero is probably difficult for most people. It was especially difficult for me, as a mathematician who grew up learning calculus and understanding that zero is just another number. Even with Charles Seife leading the way in the first chapter, I still have trouble comprehending this idea that entire civilizations rose and fell—and achieved great things in between—without the concept of a mathematical zero.In that respect, Zero acts as a history of the development of an idea, one that began in Babylonia and spread, via Alexander the Great, to India, where it flourished. Seife's history is necessarily balanced between East and West in this case, as it's impossible to discuss mathematics without discussing India. That being said, I would have liked to learn about how China regarded zero, even if Chinese mathematicians contributed no new developments to the number's importance as their absence from this book seems to imply. This one oversight overlooked, Zero is not your typical history book that starts in ancient Egypt or Greece and insists everything we know flows from there.What's admirable about Zero is Seife's ability to focus on zero. The story intersects with the lives of many famous mathematicians, but the obvious slimness of this book testifies that Seife managed to distill only what was necessary about their lives in his quest to explain the mystery of zero. I'm not trying to imply, ""Short books are easier for non-mathematical people to understand,"" but that's part of the attraction. Although it's heavier on the equations than I remembered, I would still feel comfortable recommending Zero to my non-mathematically-inclined friends. Firstly, Seife's writing is accessible, even when loaded with equations. As long as you have some basic arithmetic left over from high school, you can follow along. And I'd definitely recommend this book to high school students, like I was when I first read it: it's one of those books that opens the mind. Secondly, the narrow focus acts like a window into the history of mathematics. I have 
A History of Mathematics
 sitting next to Zero on my desk, and while the former is more complete, I somehow suspect the latter is more appropriate for a general audience. In other words, Zero is a good gateway drug.Where Zero starts to show its seams is in Seife's rhetorical ability, which stretches itself thin even over so thin a volume. He's too dramatic for my taste, especially as he recounted the attitudes and fate of the Pythagoreans. And he's always eager to remind us of how ""powerful"" zero is. While I agree that zero is a pretty cool number, the constant refrain felt somewhat forced after a while, pulling me out of the book instead of keeping me comfortably ensconced in this little tutorial. Seife devotes only cursory glances at the philosophical arguments offered for or against the acceptance of zero; he tells us about Aristotle's rejection of zero but goes into little detail. While I'm sure he wanted to avoid turning the book into a text on Aristotelian philosophy, I feel like there are gaps here that, if not filled, could have been covered with a more attractive carpet.Not perfect, not as mind-blowing as some mathematical literature I've read, Zero makes it mark because it's adequate at explanation without going overboard. I'm not sure what else to say: if you're interested in the subject, this is a good place to start. And even if you're not, hey, it's only 250 pages. What have you got to lose? Nothing. Zero!"
13,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/253027-drea,2,"Well, well, well, math. So we meet again. I have done a fantastic job avoiding you for the last ten years, but I knew it couldn't last forever. Still, I wasn't expecting you to come for me in the guise of a pick for our book club. Well played, math. Well. Played. Basically, I think this is probably a fine book and worthy of more than the ""It was okay"" rating I am giving. It has lots of pictures and illustrations and appendices, and I am assuming that they mean something. One of them, in theory, even explains how through the power of the dangerous zero, you can make an equation that proves Winston Churchill is a carrot. I would have truly liked to understand that! However, nowhere in this book does Donald Duck leap out of the pages and explain the The Golden Ratio to you a la Mathmagic Land, and that proved to be the downfall of this book and me. Not gonna lie--when I got to the section about calculus, I was overcome by the the old feeling of having a test the next day and not knowing what a differential equation was, and maybe Mr. Taylor would make it a group test and I could force my ex-boyfriend to be my partner and not have to know? God, that's going be a hard email to write. STRESS. STRESS. Where was I? Oh yes. All that said, the early chapters did come with some interesting history sprinkled around all of the equations. I never really noticed the links of old-school Judeo-Christian thought to Aristotle and his rejection of the infinite or the void. I also never realized that the Catholic Church was actually embracing new thinkers until Martin Luther decided to upset the apple cart and they went scrambling back to their traditions and finger-pointing at heretics. These sections were a little textbookish and occasionally hyperbolic (""Zero is dangerous! Zero will ROCK YOUR WORLD. Zero may kill your children!"") but I think the info will stick with me. But, in the end, if a=level of book enjoyment, and b=feelings of stupidity, and c=interesting tidbits, then A = c-b will probably give you a negative number . . . which I know we only have thanks to Eastern thought! Also, Winston Churchill is a carrot. "
14,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2057893-tim,4,"Seife, a science writer, leads us down the rabbit hole we term 'zero'. The mathematical history of the number follows a convoluted path, early on a place-holder in counting systems or a much-feared void forbidden by belief on pain of death. Eventually the path leads to infinity which, like its twin zero, figures the limit of human experience. For Seife this means that nature - described in its native language of mathematics - breaks completely with possible human experience at zero and infinity. Yet the need to confront these limits and by increments bring them within the space of the humanly possible is the impulse behind this book. Short as it is, the first two thirds of the work provide an engaging survey of the development and application of 'zero' in mathematics. A substantial part of its current conception is bound up in the development of the calculus which underlies so much of mathematical physics. Relativity theory and the development of thermodynamics spurred further application of the concept in theories of nature. Nonetheless, singularities represent limits to what we know and perhaps can know, as well as what we can do. Zero's enigmatic presence in our thoughts is a gateway to the speculative, sometimes nearly mystical suppositions in a scientific vein that take up the final third of the work. Zero, in Seife's account, is a main character in a story about mathematics and physical science. But his account of the concept as an artifact of culture and of language may offer some additional insight. For example, in common English usage, zero is nothing apart from comparison. The activity of comparing and by extension of measuring is part of this odd number which happens to be even. "
15,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5526830-melissa-jeanette,5,"One of the most fascinating books I've read. After reading the first two chapters, I knew I wanted to own it, and I will definitely be buying a copy. I never thought I'd say this about any book having to do with science or math, but this is one of those books that I could turn around and re-read immediately after finishing it. In fact, I might wait a couple days before returning it to the library just so I can read at least the first couple chapters again. As a side note, toward the end of The Age of Wonder: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science, the author says that he believes students learning about science should also learn about the people behind the discoveries of science and how they made their discoveries. I wholeheartedly agree. For one thing, I've found that learning the reasons why people wanted answers to scientific questions has made the science much more interesting. The stories behind the science are also often quite dramatic or even tragic and therefore memorable. These stories give the scientific data a context that makes it easier to remember. And this isn't really too surprising, is it? After all, we've been storytellers for nearly as long as we've been walking upright. We make sense of the world through storytelling, so storytelling seems like an easy way to help make sense of science. "
16,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24332650-philip-mann,5,"You have to love a book that has a section giving instructions on how to build your own wormhole-time machine. All you need to do is build a wormhole and attach one end of it to something very heavy and attach the other end to something travelling at 90% of the speed of light. It gets easier from there, although you do have to wait forty six years and haul the thing to another planet. The author takes a seemingly simple topic, then tells us how incredibly complex it really is, and then simplifies it again. Yes, there are pages of equations, some of which I actually understood. But it was a fun read, and he shows how the infinite can be unimaginably large or infinitely small, and how they need each other. The author tells us how this mathematical debate becomes one with the religious debate about the nature of God, and whether He has limits. We see how the ancients Greeks took their debates seriously indeed, and the price of having an unpopular opinion was far worse that getting hateful text messages. Seife tells us about that ancient riddle, about some creature walking one half the distance to a certain point, one jaunt at a time, and in theory can never reach the end, and shows us the single flaw in that argument. Otherwise, we could never get anywhere. As I said, this is a very entertaining book, and the equations shouldn't stop the curious reader."
17,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/271190-michele,5,The science geek in me absolutely loved this book. It was fascinating to see how the idea of zero could have such incredible effects on everything from religion to art to physics. I also thought the author did an excellent job of writing this in a way that is accessible to the non-scientific mind. Definitely glad I picked it up!
18,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3955370-megan,2,"An intriguing topic but not a particularly well-told story. The author clearly believes that zero and infinity are somehow dangerous and mystical, and I guess there's some evidence that mathematical philosophers have felt the same way over time. But for the most part, the general vibe of this book was, ""Ooh, zero, how *mysterious*,"" and I wasn't really into that."
19,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2844127-vicki-cline,3,"The first chapters about how the idea of zero came into being were quite interesting. A farmer or herdsman doesn't need a number for no carrots or no sheep. The Babylonians created it as a placeholder for their numerical system, as we use it today to distinguish 41 from 401. Contemplating zero leads eventually to its inverse, infinity. Most of the book deals with the uses of zero and infinity in physics, astronomy and other sciences and I didn't find that as interesting."
20,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/763514-tung,2,"Winner of the PEN/Martha Albrand Award honoring debut nonfiction from American authors, this book traces the history of the number zero from its initial appearances in Babylonian and Mayan mathematics to its widespread acceptance during the Renaissance to its role in advanced sciences. In addition to detailing the history of the number’s usage in the mathematics systems of various cultures, the book attempts to tie the concept of zero to more fundamental philosophical struggles that have accompanied the mathematical changes – Aristotelian ethics to Hinduism to the Catholic Church/Copernicus/Galileo debates. The prose does a pretty good job of simplifying major philosophies and major mathematics concepts for the general reader, although about two-thirds of the way through, the history of zero reaches imaginary numbers and proceeds to quantum mechanics, and from then on, the concepts become fairly technical. The biggest problem with the book is that I think Seife doesn’t do an adequate job of convincing me that the number zero is as directly tied to the philosophical struggles of the times as he asserts. He makes the number zero synonymous with “void” and infinity synonymous with “eternity” and therefore mathematical arguments over zero and infinity are the same thing as religious debates over the creation of the universe and eternal destination. It is an extremely large jump that doesn’t come off as convincing. And the last third of the book is more focused on quantum mechanics and cosmology and sort of forgets about the philosophical struggles. An interesting history of the most important number, but not as dangerous an idea as Seife is trying to intimate. Recommended for those who enjoy pop math books."
21,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2670571-kaion,4,"0 + ( It's a book about math. And I read it. ) - ( It took me nine months. )= 0For three weeks after I finished Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea, its central figure looked out ominously at me. In that way, Charles Seife was entirely successful in this piece of pop-nonfiction, weaving together the creation of the ""zero"", its role in history of mathematical theory, its religious controversies, its philosophical significance and ultimately, its true place at the heart of the universe. It's to Seife's credit that he manages to weave out of these eclectic approaches a coherent story that borders at times upon the epic... while never being too important not to include an irreverent tangent about Pythagoras's acute dislike of beans.If anything, Seife trends too sprightly at times. Though I admire his stance in neither dumbing down the material nor making it intimidating for the casual reader, at some point, no matter how breezily one explains black holes or the Casimir effect- there's no disguising that there are some vast concepts being covered. As it is, I believe you definitely have to at least of heard of some of these ideas (particularly in the last third) to enjoy the new contexts he weaves for them in his narrative. Myself, I sort of managed alright with some first year Calculus and Physics schooling. I can't say I ever turned down the chance for more trivia, and Zero delivered in spades. Also, know this: the first appendix details a mathematical proof on why Winston Churchill is a carrot. Rating: 4 stars"
22,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,5,"Amazing book, especially when it gets to the topic of the significance of zero in mathematics and physics. The only improvement that would have made it better is if there were more known about the origin of zero, in particular the ancient Mayan and ancient Indian perspective on the number. Of course, we know that the information on the Mayan perspective was most likely burned by the Spaniards and as for the Indian perspective, perhaps it lies in an ancient scroll somewhere."

27,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,4,"4.25/5 stars""Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea"" by Charles Seife is more than just a math book; it's a history of zero and infinity, which the author constantly reminds readers of their resemblances from their birth, the controversial, and the indecisiveness of mathematicians, scientists, philosopher and theologians.To theologians who unquestionably accepted Aristotlean concepts of nature, God or gods created the integers and fractions that appear in our everyday life from the golden ratio, pi, e, harmonic sequences, etc. So, when the concept of zero and infinity appeared, it didn't make any sense to them because God or gods are something, which mean nothing is nothing nor infinite; therefore they, the theologians, discouraged the usage of the concepts of zero and infinity, preventing them from reaching other scholars.To many generations of mathematicians since the ancient Greece, they had been struggled to solve Zeno's paradoxes, which involve the concept of infinity, for many century until they realized that they could avoid the problem of infinity because there wasn't just one kind of infinity, but many: some divergence and some convergence. However, zero appeared once again in limit as zero decided by zero. Rather than ignoring the problem, they embraced zero and infinity as we learn in calculus, especially integration: the method of adding infinite zeroes to reach a finite number.To physicists, astrophysicists and cosmologists, concept of zero and/or infinity appeared in thermodynamics, ultraviolet catastrophe, black hole, expending universe and the Big Bang. However, their fates are not like that of mathematicians. Physicists won't be able to reach absolute zero no matter how modern their technology will become: astrophysicists still have no clue what is happening inside black hole's singularity where enormous mass is embedded in an unimaginably small point in space, cosmologists [and theoretical physicists] still haven't found the theory of everything, whose goal is to combine Einstein's general theory of relativity with quantum mechanics. Without such theory, we would not be able to understand what happened at the instant of the Big Bang, the origin of our Universe and in the singularity of black hole.I find this book surprisingly fascinating as I ventured into it expecting less than what it would give me. ""Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea,"" is not only recommended to those who like maths, but also those who don't since one does not need to like math in order to enjoy reading it because the book provides you much more than just boring math equations that you always avoided in school.More book reviews at: https://menglongstarstuff.wordpress.com :')"
28,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81059674-riley-reinhard,5,"This book is intended for all calculus and physics lovers who want to dive into the origins of every formula and concept they are familiar with. If one is not familiar with any calculus or physics concepts, they should not read this book. An avid calculus or physics student reading this book is sure to recognize everything from lessons in class, but this book ties it all together with mind-boggling explanations and a little humor on the side. For example, the reader will find that the actual meaning for calculus comes from the Greek word for ""pebble,"" and this book explains why. Everything about this book was extremely deep, philosophical, and at times very hard to understand. This is why the diagrams and situational story problems are helpful. The book catches the reader off guard from the start with a very capturing introduction about the USS Yorktown's defeat and leaves the reader with butterflies in their stomach, aching to find out more about zero's powers. In addition to learning of these mathematical concepts, Zero also incorporates a great deal of historical stories and characteristics associated with ancient areas and different people of the world. This book requires avid (not passive) reading, meaning the reader should probably keep a spare pencil and paper on hand or take notes directly into the book in order to not fall behind or forget concepts. This book is extremely well-written, it provides information in chronological order, and it never gets boring."
29,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10639187-amanda,5,"This is a wildly interesting book about the number zero and some mathematical history in general. I have to admit that I started getting a little lost around the halfway point (where the book moves into more complicated math), but I still found it to be a good read. It's educational but also very entertaining."

Unfortunately, Zero is a little TOO pop-math - it hits on the same ""interesting"" math and physics tidbits that so many other pop-math and science books do. And while it relates all of its ideas to zero, it's not really about zero.The first half does talk about the historical context of the concept of zero, but it is mostly about philosophy - how the concepts of zero and infinity affected science and religion of the time. Just when I was hoping for some math, the book switches to a by-discipline survery of, again, math and phyiscs all-star fun factoids, including Fibonacci sequences, the golden ratio, set theory, numbers larger than infinity, wormholes, etc., etc. There were some ideas in there I had not read about before, like projective geometry, but for the most part, Hawking, Bryson, and popular math authors have covered this.So, for me, it was rehash. If you have not read much pop-math, this book is very interesting, although it definitely requires a late-high school understanding of algebra and physics to make sense. If you are familiar with the genre, you've seen most of it before."

We had 1000s of years without. Look around there is nothing zero, zero was invented for practical reasons. Greeks and many others hated it but mathematically they had a problem with long numbers. Zero is a dangerous idea, got converted to philosophy and find a way to enter also theology. The biography is rather complete with parts that are difficult mathematics but covers rather okish the part of philosophy and religion. Life is never zero so start searching what philosophies and policies are linked to maths and you will realize that everything is math, just avoid zero-sum games. Nihilism anyone? "
32,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4901122-cara,4,"I read this at the same time I was reading Amir Aczel's Finding Zero: A Mathematician's Odyssey to Uncover the Origins of Numbers, which are similar in subject but really completely different in style. The latter is more of a travelogue/social history of zero (which has its charms), but I think I prefer this one better because it is a little more concrete. The author does at times try to squeeze some philosophical insights out of zero, which I found annoying, but for the most part it's pretty straightforward. "
33,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/357069-tj,3,"Mind-blowing mathematical literature. That is, if you don't mind having your brain fellated formulaically. Okay, stupid joke aside; this book meets minimum prose competency for making the story of zero, and mathematics, interesting and engaging. After finishing the book, I actually spent two hours giving myself basic algebra problems to see if I could still solve them. This is a good book to read on a whim, any intentions for it more serious will result in disappointment. (In other words, it's like a really good one-hour History Channel program.)"
34,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"This book has a great title. It’s one word, loaded with the essence of the cosmos. That essence lies within gravity, the force that governs the large agglomerations of matter and energy.Gravity pulls energy and matter into itself, to a point, a singularity, seen in black holes and in the pre-Big Bang moment. The logic of gravitational force takes this collapse of everything into one point where, mathematically, the increased density continues into infinity. The sole break to this “bottomless” conclusion is through the mathematical addition of zero. Zero is nothing (i.e., nothing that can be further subdivided). (1)Zero works at the smallest of the small as well. This is the quantum world where particles and sub-particles break down into formless energy, which is a “singularity” of a different sort. (2) The “many” particles and sub-particles lose identity and morph into some yet-to-be-identified “oneness,”collapsing to a point, which is a “zero” point, beyond which there is or can be nothing more. (3)Then Seife unites gravity and the quantum world. Energy collapses further and further, to the point of a singularity, which is where matter itself collapses into oneness (a formless One). Singularities are mathematical realities that continue forever unless a zero point is added to stop the infinite regress. And zero means that the cosmos, at the macro and micro levels, is ultimately, nothing. (4)This is all mind-blowing stuff. Seife anchors all of this in the philosophical thinking of the East and West (5). The latter did not have the concept of zero for philosophical reasons and struggled scientifically with its absence. It was only after zero was imported from the East that Western science could incorporate its significance into cosmological discussions. I struggled to follow his various lines of thought in this regard. On the whole, though, the book is a philosophical inspiration. As Seife has it, zero-nothing unites philosophy and physics. Cosmic energy is a fixed amount (the conservation of energy, which is also an eternal notion). But that amount changes form and moves perpetually from high to low and from low to high, seeking its equilibrium – a point which is, and can only be, temporary, because energy changes forms and creates differences that in turn creates disequilibrium anew. It’s the Tao. It’s yang and yin. And it’s the three scenarios about the ultimate fate of the cosmos. (1) Zero also works at the opposite end of gravitational force as well. Zero is about a balance of energy. If the energy from the big bang expends itself, gravity pulls cosmic energy back into itself, the zero point (Big Crunch). If energy escapes the zero point, the cosmos expands and continues to the point of heat death, which is another zero point because there’s no energy differential (high to low energy). If cosmic expansion is stopped by gravity, stasis (equilibrium state) is zero as well.(2) Seife doesn’t use this word here but it seems to apply. (3) “A zero in quantum mechanics means that the entire universe – including the vacuum – is filled with an infinite amount of energy: the zero-point energy. This, in turn, leads to the most bizarre zero in the universe: the phantom force of nothing.” (4) Seife quotes Feynman who writes “The problem is, when we try to calculate all the way down to zero distance, the equation blows up in our face and gives us meaningless answers – things like infinity.” String theory is a way out of this dilemma because it sees, Seife writes, “every particle as a vibrating string rather than as a dot…In string theory, zero has been banished from the universe; there is no such thing as zero distance or zero time. This solves all the infinity problems of quantum mechanics.”(5) In the East, “The goal of the Hindu,” Seife writes, “is to free the Atman entirely from the cycle of rebirth, to stop wandering from death to death. The way to achieve the ultimate liberation through lifelessness is to cease paying heed to the illusion of reality. ‘The body, the house of the spirit, is under the power of pleasure and pain,’ explains a god. ‘And if a man is ruled by his body then this man can never be free.’ But once you are able to separate yourself from the whims of the flesh and embrace the silence and nothingness of your soul, you will be liberated. Your Atman will fly from the web of human desire and join the collective consciousness – the infinite soul that suffuses the universe at once everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It is infinity, and it is nothing. So India, as a society that actively explored the void and the infinite, accepted zero.” In the West, the Greeks “didn’t have the concept of a limit because they didn’t believe in zero.” An infinite series “seemed to get smaller and smaller without any particular end in sight. As a result, the Greeks couldn’t handle the infinite. They pondered the concept of the void but rejected zero as a number, and they toyed with the concept of the infinite but refused to allow infinity – numbers that are infinitely small and infinitely large – anywhere near the realm of numbers.” This resistance was tied up with a religious worldview. The infinite regressed into a bottomless void, without a beginning. That notion conflicted with God as the beginning point of creation and movement in the world. Zero allowed the void, nothing, to exist. That removed God and it was, therefore, atheistic. "

39,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21160019-sudeep,4,"I’m becoming more and more convinced of the power of teaching science and philosophy as a history - The progression of thought is for all to see; Human endeavour and collaboration more clearly visible. Contrast that with how science is usually thought in schools, where it seems like some genius just discovered/invented things in isolation, without any context or need. Students are not even sure why the scientist was working on that problem, and is colossally boring.Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea is presented in a similar vein. I loved the progression of chapters and how the history of science, mathematics and even philosophy was on show here. However, the concept of zero seemed to be forcefully injected and mixed with the major historical points, and that remains my only complaint of the book. If you can tolerate that (and I believe one can), it’s a very rewarding read.Here’s a brief history of Zero:* Initially mathematics was closely linked to practicality (counting sheep for example), and there was no need for the number zero in practical matters. Although the Egyptians and the Greeks progressed significantly in geometry, there was no use for the number zero in measuring dimensions of geometric objects. So, zero remained outside of mathematics.* The Greeks abhorred the concept of void and infinite. They were stumped with the paradox of Zeno. (The author even goes on to say not accepting zero was the “only thing that kept the Greeks from discovering calculus” - seems like a stretch for me).* Once the Roman empire fell, the dark ages started. The medieval scholars rather than looking at their peers for ideas, turned to the Greeks - Aristotle and Neoplatonists. Apart from other philosophical ideas (like the glorification of idealism), they inherited their fear for zero and infinity.Zero was still not on the numeric scale, and explains why we get a “jump” from 1 BC to 1 AD.* Zero goes East: After being rejected by the West for years, zero finally reached India (via Alexander’s invasion). The Indian mathematicians readily accepted the Babylonian numeral system (which had no special standalone symbol for zero, but zero was still used to distinguish 1 from 10 from 100 etc.)Aryabhatta is said to have positioned zero on the numeral system, from which our present day base-10 numeral system is derived.* Islamic invasion of India: Islam would take zero from India - and it was readily adopted in Italy, thanks to a one famous mathematician Fibonacci. Italian merchants were quick to seize upon the new numeral system (Arabic numbers), which allowed them to get rid of counting boards and make things simpler. Florence banned the Arabic numerals, but it was not so easy to dispense with; The Italian merchants continued using it, and the government had to relent in the face of commercial pressure.* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: Vanishing pointsThe Italian architect, Filippo, created a realistic painting using a vanishing point. A vanishing point is essentially a single dot, a zero, which contains the rest of the universe.* Introductions of zero in art and science: Cartesian coordinate systemRene Descartes introduces his Cartesian coordinate system, which is the first systematic link between Euclidean geometry and algebra. The points for a particular curve on such a system are the “zeros” for a particular equation: (x,y) for which f(x,y) = 0* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: VacuumVacuum has been a point of debate since Greeks. But Evangelista Torricelli is the first to study it empirically. He created the first laboratory vacuum - the torricellian vacuum, by filling a long glass tube filled to one end by mercury, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury.Pascal proves that it wasn’t nature’s abhorrence of vacuum that pushes the mercury up the tube, but rather atmospheric pressure. Vacuums don’t suck, atmosphere pushes. Pascal’s simple experiment demolished Aristotle’s assertion that nature abhors the vacuum. * Infidel Mathematics : The useful infinitesimalsInfinitesimals (extremely small numbers) starts making its way into mathematics. Kepler, in his attempt to calculate the volume of a crudely shaped wine barrel, chopped up the barrels - in his mind--into an infinite number of infinitely small pieces, and then added them back together to get the volume.Mathematicians use this infinitesimals to solve the problem of tangents - a line that just kisses a curve. It had important implications in studying motion - for example, you are swinging a ball tied to a thread above your head, if you cut off the string abruptly, the ball flies off into a tangent. Building on the idea of infinitesimals, Newton and Leibniz discover/invent calculus. The mathematicians are still grappling with the logical and philosophical problems of infinitesimals, but because of its accuracy and practical purpose, they accept it.It was finally with L’Hospital’s rule that trouble of 0/0, which plagued calculus could be resolved (though partially). The key was to make the infinitesimals carefully “tend towards zero”. Clever manipulations allowed one to resolve other odd expressions like ∞/∞, 00 and ∞0.It was finally with d’Alembert’s idea of limits that solved caculus’s problem with zeroes. He also resolved the Zeno’s paradox by boiling it down to a a sum of infinite number of ever-diminishing quantities. * Two sides of the same coin: IntroductionAlgebraic equations have roots - points where the value of the equation equals 0. Descartes refused to accept negative numbers as roots of an equation, calling them false roots. He also never extended his coordinate system beyond zero. He was even more disgusted by square roots of negative numbers, giving them a scornful name - imaginary numbers.Two developments here bridge the gap between zero and inifinity - projective geometry and the complex plane.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Projective geometryJean-Victor Poncelet was a mathematician in the Napoleon’s army, and was captured by Russia. In prison he found a new discipline: projective geometry. His work was the culmination of the work done by artists like Filippo and Da Vinci - learning to project 3d images on 2d planes, making use of, among other things, the vanishing point.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: The Complex PlaneGauss, an 18th century Mathematics prodigy was able to map out complex numbers on cartesian plane (which is called complex plane) - the vertical axis represents the imaginary numbers, while the horizontal axis represents real number. He also figured that operations like multiplication, addition etc. have geometric implications in the complex plane. For instance, multiplying a point by i, causes it turn anti-clockwise by 90 degrees. This was the second big advance.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Reimann SphereRiemann, a student of Gauss, married the ideas of projective geometry and complex plane and “…all of a sudden lines became circles, circles become lines, and zero and infinity became the poles on a globe full of numbers.” Gauss figures out that all infinities are not the same - the infinity of real numbers (uncountable infinity) is much greater than the infinity of rational numbers (countable infinity).* Zero (and infinity) in Physics (I'll rush on this)From here on the rest of the book talks about occurrences of zero (or infinity) in physics - zero kelvin (minimum possible temperature), or black holes, the Casimir effect (forces applied by a vacuum), string theory, the big bang, and the fate of the universe (via heat death)."

Following this model, students could use the ""My____History"" (Gallagher 79) or the '""You Should Know"" (Gallagher 88) Biographical Paper' strategies. Students could write their own stories, detailing where they came from, how they have impacted others in their lives, and the impact they are currently having. Or, students could choose a person or perhaps a topic (such as zero) to practice writing a history of how that topic came into being, again how others have reacted to it or been impacted by it, and how its existence is affecting the world today.Pairing this text with the above strategies would not only allow students to learn new information about the technology they are immersed in, but would also allow them to reflect on and write about their own sense of identities."
41,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63312978-ben-jackson,2,"For full transparency, I read about 3/4 of this book and put it down. The book is a thoroughly researched and well written historical account of the history of zero, but more broadly the history of mathematics. We take zero for granted, but for most of human history we were unaware of its existence, and until only recently we denied its existence. Zero has many unusual properties and became the key to unlocking complicated mathematics like calculus and physics and indeed our understanding of the earth and the heavens. The first half was most interesting.So why did I give up? The book becomes intensely technical about halfway through, to a degree that only mathematicians can truly appreciate. It couldn’t hold my interest. I recommend this book for true math nerds. For casual math nerds, I instead recommend Jordan Ellenberg’s _How Not to be Wrong_, which Bill Gates describes as “a love letter to math.”"
42,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54161476-alexander-thomas,3,"I enjoyed the book and got through it fairly quickly. The first part of the book nicely brings about how the number zero moved from east to west and the impact of the idea on western philosophy and mathematics. Seife then explains how integration and differentiation solve tricky problems where zero is involved to make sense out of equations. The final third of the book is about singularities and the big bang - zero from a cosmological perspective. Good book, and I'd have give it 4 stars, but I docked one star because of a couple of things - Seife's breathless commentary: ""zero holds the secret to our existance"", ""the ultimate fate of the cosmos lies in zero"" and Seife's insistence to treat the vacuum and the void as regions of zero activity despite (as he also later writes) the abundance of virtual particles (meaning it's clearly non-zero). Seife also, in the first part of the book, stand on a pedestal to sniffily chastise the Aristotelian view of the universe without showing enough sympathy to the fact that they (the Aristotelians) were products of their time. Perhaps Seife should realise that he's not on a pedestal, but on the shoulders of giants."

I read a lot of that genre in high school, for whatever strange reason, so I am reasonably familiar with it. In the years since high school, I have moved on from being a pop scientist to a pop historian, and I think for that reason I preferred the historical half of this book, as opposed to the latter half, which is a whistle-stop tour of the most complex mathematical and physics advances of the twentieth-century. Seife pulled off this second half just fine, considering these topics are basically impossible to explain in any intuitive or comprehensible way to the armchair physicists like me."

The association between infinity and zero is something that I hadn't thought about prior to reading it. It also does a great job of explaining things like black holes and absolute zero temperature. The book seems, though, to switch about two thirds through, at first the book is a delightful romp in which zero is a character, a funny little imp that historically was either ignored or minimized. However once zero is introduced and history catches up with the 20th century, zero puts its big-boy pants on and gets down to business in modern physics. Some of the physics at the end of the book was a bit beyond me, but I liked the books premise that zero and its pal infinity are not just useful constructs but are necessary, and indeed absolutely essential, to our understand of the universe. The book makes you think. High praise indeed. Zero (the book) is not for everyone but if you enjoy thinking about the scientific/mathematical enterprise and how it has developed over time, I would recommend it."

54,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5986736-ashwini-nocaste,4,"Thanks to the mathematics of zero and infinity, Pascal concluded that one should assume that God exists – from Zero : The Biography of a Dangerous IdeaGod’s Debris – by Scott Adams is an interesting novella that tries to in a way put out a belief model where the universe and its constituents are explained as “God’s Debris” – the primordial sea of pre-big bang existence that got sprinkled into living existence as we perceive it today. No one knows or can easily surmise as to what exactly happened one second before the big bang took place. In the book “Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea” – author Charles Seife attempts to explain the suffusion of the idea of zero throughout our existence and hints at the possibility of zero being at the beginning as well as at the end of our existence.If one accepts the universe as a sprinkling of God’s Dust formed out of the primordial sea that existed pre-big bang (which in Charles Seife’s view is nothing but something as close to what Zero signifies), then it can be taken as granted that all forms in perceivable existence today are representations of constituents which when trussed together will be an exact replica of the pre-big bang primordial sea. But as Charles Seife indicates that zero must have existed before and at the beginning of big bang – it leads me to a hypothetical assumption that the sum total of the entire universe must be equal to what Zero signifies – an idea which takes into account the anti-matter argument posed by Stephen Hawkings in “A Brief History of Time” – where the positive matter resulted in the observable universe and the negative matter – i.e., anti-matter exists as non-existence, a concept not easily graspable by our faculties.Any number divided by Zero can result in infinity. As an example, suppose a packet of 50 toffies is to be distributed. If it is to be distributed to 25 people, then the number 50 is to be divided by 25 to result in 2 toffies in the hands of each individual. But if 0 toffies were to be distributed, then one can go on distributing 50 toffies to as many people as possible (of course in this case, no one will get anything in their hands). Thus a number divided by zero tends to infinity. But Zero is also a number – so can it be argued that 0/0 is equal to infinity? An absurd conclusion of course – because it seems that nothing divided by nothing results in everything : an absurd conclusion – but something which is very close to the nature of existence as we understand it today. We know that the universe is expanding and the discovery of that fact by Hubble led one to the conclusion that the universe was once closely packed into a primordial soup – but what could have caused the explosion and whether the universe will infinitely expand or will there be a limit? An external source of energy or force acting on the primordial soup? Well it would be naïve to argue that propulsion of the primordial soup into an expanding universe is owed to the agency of an external force – since that is a physical law steeped in our earthly surroundings – and which might not have existed in operation at all during pre-big bang. So does that imply, the initiative must have come from within? If the initiative had come from within, then why at that point of time only – and why it all had to come about in the first place? It could have continued as a dense primordial soup?Could Zero be God? An exact assimilation of the sum-total consciousness in the pre-big bang arrangement but which has got scattered round the universe and now exists as a harmless looking Zero? This concept is not new and thinkers of lore have attempted to discover God in the concept of Zero. In my opinion, offered merely as a thought and not as firm conviction, what Zero signified in the pre-big bang set-up lost its power and energy as it suffused out across the length and breadth of the universe-so much so that it now became worthy of only a concept that exists as a human thought – which leads one to the natural question – whether zero as a concept, not as a numerical entity, but as a thought representing the void – also graspable by animals?Another interesting thought that can there be is – What value to give to Zero? Should it signify a void – a nothingness? Has Zero been devised to signify a void only because our perceptions of existence imply “not nothingness”. What if the pre-big bang moment is not the Zeroth hour but just another point among several points as denoted by numbers on a numberline? As a personal belief, it is difficult for me to grasp that there was a big bang – but I do not shy away from believing in the possibility of an inter-dimensional change from a certain dimension to the other. As to whether the Universe is infinite or finite, the riddle lies in the resolution of the concept of Time; but Time as we have been thoroughly ingrained to accept is the Solar notion of time based on earth’s rotation/revolution around the Sun. Time as it really exists devoid of a reference point is a difficult concept for me to conjure."

They are equal and opposite, yin and yang. They are equally paradoxical and troubling. The biggest questions in science and religion are about nothingness and eternity, the void and the infinite, zero and infinity.ZERO: POWERFUL ENOUGH TO STOP A WARSHIP- Zero hit the USS Yorktown like a torpedo. On September 21, 1997, while cruising off the coast of Virginia, the billion-dollar missile cruiser shuddered to a halt.- The Yorktown’s computers had just received new software that was controlling the engines. Unfortunately, nobody had spotted the time bomb lurking in the code, a zero that engineers were supposed to remove while installing the software.- When the Yorktown’s computer system tried to divide by zero, 80,000 horsepower instantly became worthless.LEARNING TO COUNT- In the very beginning of mathematics, it seems that people could only distinguish between one and many.- Over time, primitive languages evolved to distinguish between one, two, and many, and eventually one, two, three, many, but didn’t have terms for higher numbers.TALLYING UP LARGER GROUPS OF NUMBERS- The early Greeks, for instance, used the word “fiving” to describe the process of tallying.- In English, eleven and twelve seem to be derived from “one over [ten]” and “two over [ten],” while thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and so on are contractions of “three and ten,” “four and ten,” and “five and ten.”GEOMETRY CREATED BECAUSE THE NILE FLOODED- The bad news was that the river destroyed many of the boundary markers, erasing all of the landmarks that told farmers which land was theirs to cultivate. (The Egyptians took property rights very seriously.- The ancient pharaohs assigned surveyors to assess the damage and reset the boundary markers, and thus geometry was born.- Egyptians were of a practical bent. They never progressed beyond measuring volumes and counting days and hours. Mathematics wasn’t used for anything impractical, except their system of astrology.FROM THE EGYPTIANS TO THE GREEKS- The Greeks were different; they embraced the abstract and the philosophical, and brought mathematics to its highest point in ancient times.- Instead of using pictures to represent numbers as the Egyptians did, the Greeks used letters.ZERO ENTERS THE EQUATION- Babylonian style of counting. And thanks to this system, zero finally appeared in the East, in the Fertile Crescent of present-day Iraq.ZERO STARTS OUT AS MERELY A PLACEHOLDER- Zero was born out of the need to give any given sequence of Babylonian digits a unique, permanent meaning.- Though zero was useful, it was only a placeholder. It was merely a symbol for a blank place in the abacus, a column where all the stones were at the bottom. It did little more than make sure digits fell in the right places; it didn’t really have a numerical value of its own.- Zero was a digit, not a number. It had no value.MANY WESTERNERS FOUND ZERO (AND INFINITY) TO BE SCARY- It is hard to imagine being afraid of a number. Yet zero was inexorably linked with the void—with nothing. There was a primal fear of void and chaos. There was also a fear of zero. Most ancient peoples believed that only emptiness and chaos were present before the universe came to be.- Multiplying by zero collapses the number line. But dividing by zero destroys the entire framework of mathematics.- The Greek universe, created by Pythagoras, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, survived long after the collapse of Greek civilization. In that universe there is no such thing as nothing. There is no zero. Because of this, the West could not accept zero for nearly two millennia.- This is the biggest failure in Greek mathematics, and it is the only thing that kept them from discovering calculus.- Aristotle just wished infinity away by stating that it is simply a construct of the human mind.INDIA- Hinduism was steeped in the symbolism of duality.- Indian mathematicians did more than simply accept zero. They transformed it, changing its role from mere placeholder to number. This reincarnation was what gave zero its power.- Our numbers evolved from the symbols that the Indians used; by rights they should be called Indian numerals rather than Arabic ones- Instead, they saw the interplay of numerals—numbers stripped of their geometric significance. This was the birth of what we now know as algebra.- Once numbers shed their geometric significance, mathematicians no longer had to worry about mathematical operations making geometric sense...You can’t remove a three-acre swath from a two-acre field, but nothing prevents you from subtracting three from two. Nowadays we recognize that 2 – 3=–1: negative one.ZERO BECOMES A NUMBER AND NO LONGER JUST A PLACE HOLDER- Just as 2 – 3 was now a number, so was 2 – 2. It was zero. Not just a mere placeholder zero that represents an empty space on the abacus, but zero the number.MUSLIMS LEARN FROM INDIA- Along the way to China, the Muslims conquered India. And there the Arabs learned about Indian numerals.- one of its first scholars was the mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi. Al-Khowarizmi wrote several important books, like Al-jabr wa’l muqabala, a treatise on how to solve elementary equations; the Al-jabr in the title (which means something like “completion”) gave us the term algebra.- algorithms, the tricks for multiplying and dividing Hindu numerals quickly...the word algorithm was a corruption of al-Khowarizmi’s name.MANY IN THE WEST STILL RELUCTANT TO ADOPT ZERO- In 1299, Florence banned Arabic numerals...Italian merchants continued to use them, and even used them to send encrypted messages—which is how the word cipher came to mean “secret code.”ZERO ENTERS INTO WESTERN ART- It was an Italian architect, Filippo Brunelleschi, who first demonstrated the power of an infinite zero: he created a realistic painting by using a vanishing point.- A point is a zero-dimensional object...This zero-dimensional object, the vanishing point, is an infinitesimal dot on the canvas that represents a spot infinitely far away from the viewer- It is no coincidence that zero and infinity are linked in the vanishing point. Just as multiplying by zero causes the number line to collapse into a point, the vanishing point has caused most of the universe to sit in a tiny dot. This is a singularity, a concept that became very important later in the history of science—ZERO AND COORDINATES- “I am in a sense something intermediate between God and nought.” —RENÉ DESCARTES, DISCOURSE ON METHOD- Descartes was a mathematician-philosopher; perhaps his most lasting legacy was a mathematical invention—what we now call Cartesian coordinates.- Descartes realized that he could not start his two reference lines, or axes, with the number 1.- Descartes quickly realized how powerful his coordinate system was. He used it to turn figures and shapes into equations and numbers; with Cartesian coordinates every geometric object—squares, triangles, wavy lines—could be represented by an equation, a mathematical relationship.- No longer were the Western art of geometry and the Eastern art of algebra separate domains.INFINITY- This is the definition of the infinite: it is something that can stay the same size even when you subtract from it.ZERO- Zero is behind all of the big puzzles in physics. The infinite density of the black hole is a division by zero. The big bang creation from the void is a division by zero. The infinite energy of the vacuum is a division by zero. Yet dividing by zero destroys the fabric of mathematics and the framework of logic—and threatens to undermine the very basis of science.- All that scientists know is the cosmos was spawned from nothing, and will return to the nothing from whence it came. The universe begins and ends with zero.PHYSICS- [Note: The second half of the book deals with how zero and infinity correspond to physics topics such as black holes, string theory, etc. Although interesting, I chose not to share too many excerpts.]*** *** *** *** ***HAHA- The Reformation was begun by Martin Luther while he was on the toilet (he suffered from chronic constipation): https://www.smh.com.au/world/toilet-w...- Estimated temperatures of heaven and hell (based on physics): http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/...FACTOIDS- 10,000—the myriad, the biggest grouping in the Greek system.- The Babylonians, like many different cultures, had invented machines that helped them count. The most famous was the abacus...The words calculate, calculus, and calcium all come from the Latin word for pebble: calculus.- In modern schools, children learn of Pythagoras for his famed theorem: the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. However, this was in fact ancient news. It was known more than 1,000 years before Pythagoras’s time.- stadium (the standard Greek unit of long distance)- (Our word noon comes from the word nones, the midday prayer service of medieval clergy.)- The Indian name for zero was sunya, meaning “empty,” which the Arabs turned into sifr. When some Western scholars described the new number to their colleagues, they turned sifr into a Latin-sounding word, yielding zephirus, which is the root of our word zero. Other Western mathematicians didn’t change the word so heavily and called zero cifra, which became cipher. Zero was so important to the new set of numbers that people started calling all numbers ciphers, which gave the French their term chiffre, digit.- The Germans called the counting board a Rechenbank, which is why we call moneylenders banks.- Not only did they use counting boards, they used tally sticks to record loans: a money value was written along the stick’s side, and it was split in two. The lender kept the biggest piece, the stock. After all, he was the stockholder.- Descartes thought that these numbers were even worse than negative numbers; he came up with a scornful name for the square roots of negatives: imaginary numbers. The name stuck, and eventually, the symbol for the square root of –1 became i.BONUS- The numbers cult of Pythagoras: https://youtu.be/9_DHBf_koGE- Zeno’s paradox - Achilles and the turtle: https://youtu.be/3vNlf2zGLaE- Archimedes principle: https://youtu.be/ijj58xD5fDI- Aristotle - History’s most influential thinker: https://youtu.be/qD5O3vXj9eU- Fibonacci’s rabbit problem: https://youtu.be/sjQlW6cH3Ko- Vacuums: https://youtu.be/EkDhlzA-lwI- Pascaline (world’s first calculator): https://youtu.be/5wB80HzF8sM- The Casimir Effect: https://youtu.be/nDxW9ZF5wGs- Pauli’s exclusion principle: https://youtu.be/GZku6bBaufs- What is a singularity?: https://youtu.be/24T58gXCUW8"

A step above textbook-level dryness but a step below pop-science narrative, this one stops being pleasurable to read after about 75 pages when it begins to retread similar ground (how zero was/wasn't explored as a concept in various ancient civilizations). Later the author shifts from cultural history and towards summaries of much drier mathematical concepts and their development, at which point we're really straining the use of ""biography"" in the title.

But for the time being, it appears that nothing will come of nothing.” (p. 189)“Zero dwells at the juxtaposition of quantum mechanics and relativity; zero lives where the two theories meet, and zero causes the two theories to clash. A black hole is a zero in the equations of general relativity; the energy of the vacuum is a zero in the mathematics of quantum theory. The big bang, the most puzzling event in the history of the universe, is a zero in both theories. The universe came from nothing – and both theories break down when they try to explain the origin of the cosmos.” (p. 192)"

Unfortunately, Zero is a little TOO pop-math - it hits on the same ""interesting"" math and physics tidbits that so many other pop-math and science books do. And while it relates all of its ideas to zero, it's not really about zero.The first half does talk about the historical context of the concept of zero, but it is mostly about philosophy - how the concepts of zero and infinity affected science and religion of the time. Just when I was hoping for some math, the book switches to a by-discipline survery of, again, math and phyiscs all-star fun factoids, including Fibonacci sequences, the golden ratio, set theory, numbers larger than infinity, wormholes, etc., etc. There were some ideas in there I had not read about before, like projective geometry, but for the most part, Hawking, Bryson, and popular math authors have covered this.So, for me, it was rehash. If you have not read much pop-math, this book is very interesting, although it definitely requires a late-high school understanding of algebra and physics to make sense. If you are familiar with the genre, you've seen most of it before."
61,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16896341-sotiris-makrygiannis,3,"First I start by changing my score criteria and start scoring lower, than higher.This is a good book on the history of Zero. We had 1000s of years without. Look around there is nothing zero, zero was invented for practical reasons. Greeks and many others hated it but mathematically they had a problem with long numbers. Zero is a dangerous idea, got converted to philosophy and find a way to enter also theology. The biography is rather complete with parts that are difficult mathematics but covers rather okish the part of philosophy and religion. Life is never zero so start searching what philosophies and policies are linked to maths and you will realize that everything is math, just avoid zero-sum games. Nihilism anyone? "

The latter is more of a travelogue/social history of zero (which has its charms), but I think I prefer this one better because it is a little more concrete. The author does at times try to squeeze some philosophical insights out of zero, which I found annoying, but for the most part it's pretty straightforward. "

64,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"This book has a great title. It’s one word, loaded with the essence of the cosmos. That essence lies within gravity, the force that governs the large agglomerations of matter and energy.Gravity pulls energy and matter into itself, to a point, a singularity, seen in black holes and in the pre-Big Bang moment. The logic of gravitational force takes this collapse of everything into one point where, mathematically, the increased density continues into infinity. The sole break to this “bottomless” conclusion is through the mathematical addition of zero. Zero is nothing (i.e., nothing that can be further subdivided). (1)Zero works at the smallest of the small as well. This is the quantum world where particles and sub-particles break down into formless energy, which is a “singularity” of a different sort. (2) The “many” particles and sub-particles lose identity and morph into some yet-to-be-identified “oneness,”collapsing to a point, which is a “zero” point, beyond which there is or can be nothing more. (3)Then Seife unites gravity and the quantum world. Energy collapses further and further, to the point of a singularity, which is where matter itself collapses into oneness (a formless One). Singularities are mathematical realities that continue forever unless a zero point is added to stop the infinite regress. And zero means that the cosmos, at the macro and micro levels, is ultimately, nothing. (4)This is all mind-blowing stuff. Seife anchors all of this in the philosophical thinking of the East and West (5). The latter did not have the concept of zero for philosophical reasons and struggled scientifically with its absence. It was only after zero was imported from the East that Western science could incorporate its significance into cosmological discussions. I struggled to follow his various lines of thought in this regard. On the whole, though, the book is a philosophical inspiration. As Seife has it, zero-nothing unites philosophy and physics. Cosmic energy is a fixed amount (the conservation of energy, which is also an eternal notion). But that amount changes form and moves perpetually from high to low and from low to high, seeking its equilibrium – a point which is, and can only be, temporary, because energy changes forms and creates differences that in turn creates disequilibrium anew. It’s the Tao. It’s yang and yin. And it’s the three scenarios about the ultimate fate of the cosmos. (1) Zero also works at the opposite end of gravitational force as well. Zero is about a balance of energy. If the energy from the big bang expends itself, gravity pulls cosmic energy back into itself, the zero point (Big Crunch). If energy escapes the zero point, the cosmos expands and continues to the point of heat death, which is another zero point because there’s no energy differential (high to low energy). If cosmic expansion is stopped by gravity, stasis (equilibrium state) is zero as well.(2) Seife doesn’t use this word here but it seems to apply. (3) “A zero in quantum mechanics means that the entire universe – including the vacuum – is filled with an infinite amount of energy: the zero-point energy. This, in turn, leads to the most bizarre zero in the universe: the phantom force of nothing.” (4) Seife quotes Feynman who writes “The problem is, when we try to calculate all the way down to zero distance, the equation blows up in our face and gives us meaningless answers – things like infinity.” String theory is a way out of this dilemma because it sees, Seife writes, “every particle as a vibrating string rather than as a dot…In string theory, zero has been banished from the universe; there is no such thing as zero distance or zero time. This solves all the infinity problems of quantum mechanics.”(5) In the East, “The goal of the Hindu,” Seife writes, “is to free the Atman entirely from the cycle of rebirth, to stop wandering from death to death. The way to achieve the ultimate liberation through lifelessness is to cease paying heed to the illusion of reality. ‘The body, the house of the spirit, is under the power of pleasure and pain,’ explains a god. ‘And if a man is ruled by his body then this man can never be free.’ But once you are able to separate yourself from the whims of the flesh and embrace the silence and nothingness of your soul, you will be liberated. Your Atman will fly from the web of human desire and join the collective consciousness – the infinite soul that suffuses the universe at once everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It is infinity, and it is nothing. So India, as a society that actively explored the void and the infinite, accepted zero.” In the West, the Greeks “didn’t have the concept of a limit because they didn’t believe in zero.” An infinite series “seemed to get smaller and smaller without any particular end in sight. As a result, the Greeks couldn’t handle the infinite. They pondered the concept of the void but rejected zero as a number, and they toyed with the concept of the infinite but refused to allow infinity – numbers that are infinitely small and infinitely large – anywhere near the realm of numbers.” This resistance was tied up with a religious worldview. The infinite regressed into a bottomless void, without a beginning. That notion conflicted with God as the beginning point of creation and movement in the world. Zero allowed the void, nothing, to exist. That removed God and it was, therefore, atheistic. "

69,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21160019-sudeep,4,"I’m becoming more and more convinced of the power of teaching science and philosophy as a history - The progression of thought is for all to see; Human endeavour and collaboration more clearly visible. Contrast that with how science is usually thought in schools, where it seems like some genius just discovered/invented things in isolation, without any context or need. Students are not even sure why the scientist was working on that problem, and is colossally boring.Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea is presented in a similar vein. I loved the progression of chapters and how the history of science, mathematics and even philosophy was on show here. However, the concept of zero seemed to be forcefully injected and mixed with the major historical points, and that remains my only complaint of the book. If you can tolerate that (and I believe one can), it’s a very rewarding read.Here’s a brief history of Zero:* Initially mathematics was closely linked to practicality (counting sheep for example), and there was no need for the number zero in practical matters. Although the Egyptians and the Greeks progressed significantly in geometry, there was no use for the number zero in measuring dimensions of geometric objects. So, zero remained outside of mathematics.* The Greeks abhorred the concept of void and infinite. They were stumped with the paradox of Zeno. (The author even goes on to say not accepting zero was the “only thing that kept the Greeks from discovering calculus” - seems like a stretch for me).* Once the Roman empire fell, the dark ages started. The medieval scholars rather than looking at their peers for ideas, turned to the Greeks - Aristotle and Neoplatonists. Apart from other philosophical ideas (like the glorification of idealism), they inherited their fear for zero and infinity.Zero was still not on the numeric scale, and explains why we get a “jump” from 1 BC to 1 AD.* Zero goes East: After being rejected by the West for years, zero finally reached India (via Alexander’s invasion). The Indian mathematicians readily accepted the Babylonian numeral system (which had no special standalone symbol for zero, but zero was still used to distinguish 1 from 10 from 100 etc.)Aryabhatta is said to have positioned zero on the numeral system, from which our present day base-10 numeral system is derived.* Islamic invasion of India: Islam would take zero from India - and it was readily adopted in Italy, thanks to a one famous mathematician Fibonacci. Italian merchants were quick to seize upon the new numeral system (Arabic numbers), which allowed them to get rid of counting boards and make things simpler. Florence banned the Arabic numerals, but it was not so easy to dispense with; The Italian merchants continued using it, and the government had to relent in the face of commercial pressure.* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: Vanishing pointsThe Italian architect, Filippo, created a realistic painting using a vanishing point. A vanishing point is essentially a single dot, a zero, which contains the rest of the universe.* Introductions of zero in art and science: Cartesian coordinate systemRene Descartes introduces his Cartesian coordinate system, which is the first systematic link between Euclidean geometry and algebra. The points for a particular curve on such a system are the “zeros” for a particular equation: (x,y) for which f(x,y) = 0* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: VacuumVacuum has been a point of debate since Greeks. But Evangelista Torricelli is the first to study it empirically. He created the first laboratory vacuum - the torricellian vacuum, by filling a long glass tube filled to one end by mercury, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury.Pascal proves that it wasn’t nature’s abhorrence of vacuum that pushes the mercury up the tube, but rather atmospheric pressure. Vacuums don’t suck, atmosphere pushes. Pascal’s simple experiment demolished Aristotle’s assertion that nature abhors the vacuum. * Infidel Mathematics : The useful infinitesimalsInfinitesimals (extremely small numbers) starts making its way into mathematics. Kepler, in his attempt to calculate the volume of a crudely shaped wine barrel, chopped up the barrels - in his mind--into an infinite number of infinitely small pieces, and then added them back together to get the volume.Mathematicians use this infinitesimals to solve the problem of tangents - a line that just kisses a curve. It had important implications in studying motion - for example, you are swinging a ball tied to a thread above your head, if you cut off the string abruptly, the ball flies off into a tangent. Building on the idea of infinitesimals, Newton and Leibniz discover/invent calculus. The mathematicians are still grappling with the logical and philosophical problems of infinitesimals, but because of its accuracy and practical purpose, they accept it.It was finally with L’Hospital’s rule that trouble of 0/0, which plagued calculus could be resolved (though partially). The key was to make the infinitesimals carefully “tend towards zero”. Clever manipulations allowed one to resolve other odd expressions like ∞/∞, 00 and ∞0.It was finally with d’Alembert’s idea of limits that solved caculus’s problem with zeroes. He also resolved the Zeno’s paradox by boiling it down to a a sum of infinite number of ever-diminishing quantities. * Two sides of the same coin: IntroductionAlgebraic equations have roots - points where the value of the equation equals 0. Descartes refused to accept negative numbers as roots of an equation, calling them false roots. He also never extended his coordinate system beyond zero. He was even more disgusted by square roots of negative numbers, giving them a scornful name - imaginary numbers.Two developments here bridge the gap between zero and inifinity - projective geometry and the complex plane.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Projective geometryJean-Victor Poncelet was a mathematician in the Napoleon’s army, and was captured by Russia. In prison he found a new discipline: projective geometry. His work was the culmination of the work done by artists like Filippo and Da Vinci - learning to project 3d images on 2d planes, making use of, among other things, the vanishing point.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: The Complex PlaneGauss, an 18th century Mathematics prodigy was able to map out complex numbers on cartesian plane (which is called complex plane) - the vertical axis represents the imaginary numbers, while the horizontal axis represents real number. He also figured that operations like multiplication, addition etc. have geometric implications in the complex plane. For instance, multiplying a point by i, causes it turn anti-clockwise by 90 degrees. This was the second big advance.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Reimann SphereRiemann, a student of Gauss, married the ideas of projective geometry and complex plane and “…all of a sudden lines became circles, circles become lines, and zero and infinity became the poles on a globe full of numbers.” Gauss figures out that all infinities are not the same - the infinity of real numbers (uncountable infinity) is much greater than the infinity of rational numbers (countable infinity).* Zero (and infinity) in Physics (I'll rush on this)From here on the rest of the book talks about occurrences of zero (or infinity) in physics - zero kelvin (minimum possible temperature), or black holes, the Casimir effect (forces applied by a vacuum), string theory, the big bang, and the fate of the universe (via heat death)."

Following this model, students could use the ""My____History"" (Gallagher 79) or the '""You Should Know"" (Gallagher 88) Biographical Paper' strategies. Students could write their own stories, detailing where they came from, how they have impacted others in their lives, and the impact they are currently having. Or, students could choose a person or perhaps a topic (such as zero) to practice writing a history of how that topic came into being, again how others have reacted to it or been impacted by it, and how its existence is affecting the world today.Pairing this text with the above strategies would not only allow students to learn new information about the technology they are immersed in, but would also allow them to reflect on and write about their own sense of identities."

The book is a thoroughly researched and well written historical account of the history of zero, but more broadly the history of mathematics. We take zero for granted, but for most of human history we were unaware of its existence, and until only recently we denied its existence. Zero has many unusual properties and became the key to unlocking complicated mathematics like calculus and physics and indeed our understanding of the earth and the heavens. The first half was most interesting.So why did I give up? The book becomes intensely technical about halfway through, to a degree that only mathematicians can truly appreciate. It couldn’t hold my interest. I recommend this book for true math nerds. For casual math nerds, I instead recommend Jordan Ellenberg’s _How Not to be Wrong_, which Bill Gates describes as “a love letter to math.”"

The first part of the book nicely brings about how the number zero moved from east to west and the impact of the idea on western philosophy and mathematics. Seife then explains how integration and differentiation solve tricky problems where zero is involved to make sense out of equations. The final third of the book is about singularities and the big bang - zero from a cosmological perspective. Good book, and I'd have give it 4 stars, but I docked one star because of a couple of things - Seife's breathless commentary: ""zero holds the secret to our existance"", ""the ultimate fate of the cosmos lies in zero"" and Seife's insistence to treat the vacuum and the void as regions of zero activity despite (as he also later writes) the abundance of virtual particles (meaning it's clearly non-zero). Seife also, in the first part of the book, stand on a pedestal to sniffily chastise the Aristotelian view of the universe without showing enough sympathy to the fact that they (the Aristotelians) were products of their time. Perhaps Seife should realise that he's not on a pedestal, but on the shoulders of giants."

I read a lot of that genre in high school, for whatever strange reason, so I am reasonably familiar with it. In the years since high school, I have moved on from being a pop scientist to a pop historian, and I think for that reason I preferred the historical half of this book, as opposed to the latter half, which is a whistle-stop tour of the most complex mathematical and physics advances of the twentieth-century. Seife pulled off this second half just fine, considering these topics are basically impossible to explain in any intuitive or comprehensible way to the armchair physicists like me."

The association between infinity and zero is something that I hadn't thought about prior to reading it. It also does a great job of explaining things like black holes and absolute zero temperature. The book seems, though, to switch about two thirds through, at first the book is a delightful romp in which zero is a character, a funny little imp that historically was either ignored or minimized. However once zero is introduced and history catches up with the 20th century, zero puts its big-boy pants on and gets down to business in modern physics. Some of the physics at the end of the book was a bit beyond me, but I liked the books premise that zero and its pal infinity are not just useful constructs but are necessary, and indeed absolutely essential, to our understand of the universe. The book makes you think. High praise indeed. Zero (the book) is not for everyone but if you enjoy thinking about the scientific/mathematical enterprise and how it has developed over time, I would recommend it."

It's so interesting to think about a time when people didn't conceive of the number zero. As the book progressed, I got increasingly more confused, however, and by the final chapter (a lot about String Theory) I was really just going through the motions. Except: I found out the answer to Robert Frost's poem ""Fire and Ice,"" so now I know how the world is going to end! (Hint: It's either by fire or by ice.)"

84,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5986736-ashwini-nocaste,4,"Thanks to the mathematics of zero and infinity, Pascal concluded that one should assume that God exists – from Zero : The Biography of a Dangerous IdeaGod’s Debris – by Scott Adams is an interesting novella that tries to in a way put out a belief model where the universe and its constituents are explained as “God’s Debris” – the primordial sea of pre-big bang existence that got sprinkled into living existence as we perceive it today. No one knows or can easily surmise as to what exactly happened one second before the big bang took place. In the book “Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea” – author Charles Seife attempts to explain the suffusion of the idea of zero throughout our existence and hints at the possibility of zero being at the beginning as well as at the end of our existence.If one accepts the universe as a sprinkling of God’s Dust formed out of the primordial sea that existed pre-big bang (which in Charles Seife’s view is nothing but something as close to what Zero signifies), then it can be taken as granted that all forms in perceivable existence today are representations of constituents which when trussed together will be an exact replica of the pre-big bang primordial sea. But as Charles Seife indicates that zero must have existed before and at the beginning of big bang – it leads me to a hypothetical assumption that the sum total of the entire universe must be equal to what Zero signifies – an idea which takes into account the anti-matter argument posed by Stephen Hawkings in “A Brief History of Time” – where the positive matter resulted in the observable universe and the negative matter – i.e., anti-matter exists as non-existence, a concept not easily graspable by our faculties.Any number divided by Zero can result in infinity. As an example, suppose a packet of 50 toffies is to be distributed. If it is to be distributed to 25 people, then the number 50 is to be divided by 25 to result in 2 toffies in the hands of each individual. But if 0 toffies were to be distributed, then one can go on distributing 50 toffies to as many people as possible (of course in this case, no one will get anything in their hands). Thus a number divided by zero tends to infinity. But Zero is also a number – so can it be argued that 0/0 is equal to infinity? An absurd conclusion of course – because it seems that nothing divided by nothing results in everything : an absurd conclusion – but something which is very close to the nature of existence as we understand it today. We know that the universe is expanding and the discovery of that fact by Hubble led one to the conclusion that the universe was once closely packed into a primordial soup – but what could have caused the explosion and whether the universe will infinitely expand or will there be a limit? An external source of energy or force acting on the primordial soup? Well it would be naïve to argue that propulsion of the primordial soup into an expanding universe is owed to the agency of an external force – since that is a physical law steeped in our earthly surroundings – and which might not have existed in operation at all during pre-big bang. So does that imply, the initiative must have come from within? If the initiative had come from within, then why at that point of time only – and why it all had to come about in the first place? It could have continued as a dense primordial soup?Could Zero be God? An exact assimilation of the sum-total consciousness in the pre-big bang arrangement but which has got scattered round the universe and now exists as a harmless looking Zero? This concept is not new and thinkers of lore have attempted to discover God in the concept of Zero. In my opinion, offered merely as a thought and not as firm conviction, what Zero signified in the pre-big bang set-up lost its power and energy as it suffused out across the length and breadth of the universe-so much so that it now became worthy of only a concept that exists as a human thought – which leads one to the natural question – whether zero as a concept, not as a numerical entity, but as a thought representing the void – also graspable by animals?Another interesting thought that can there be is – What value to give to Zero? Should it signify a void – a nothingness? Has Zero been devised to signify a void only because our perceptions of existence imply “not nothingness”. What if the pre-big bang moment is not the Zeroth hour but just another point among several points as denoted by numbers on a numberline? As a personal belief, it is difficult for me to grasp that there was a big bang – but I do not shy away from believing in the possibility of an inter-dimensional change from a certain dimension to the other. As to whether the Universe is infinite or finite, the riddle lies in the resolution of the concept of Time; but Time as we have been thoroughly ingrained to accept is the Solar notion of time based on earth’s rotation/revolution around the Sun. Time as it really exists devoid of a reference point is a difficult concept for me to conjure."

They are equal and opposite, yin and yang. They are equally paradoxical and troubling. The biggest questions in science and religion are about nothingness and eternity, the void and the infinite, zero and infinity.ZERO: POWERFUL ENOUGH TO STOP A WARSHIP- Zero hit the USS Yorktown like a torpedo. On September 21, 1997, while cruising off the coast of Virginia, the billion-dollar missile cruiser shuddered to a halt.- The Yorktown’s computers had just received new software that was controlling the engines. Unfortunately, nobody had spotted the time bomb lurking in the code, a zero that engineers were supposed to remove while installing the software.- When the Yorktown’s computer system tried to divide by zero, 80,000 horsepower instantly became worthless.LEARNING TO COUNT- In the very beginning of mathematics, it seems that people could only distinguish between one and many.- Over time, primitive languages evolved to distinguish between one, two, and many, and eventually one, two, three, many, but didn’t have terms for higher numbers.TALLYING UP LARGER GROUPS OF NUMBERS- The early Greeks, for instance, used the word “fiving” to describe the process of tallying.- In English, eleven and twelve seem to be derived from “one over [ten]” and “two over [ten],” while thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and so on are contractions of “three and ten,” “four and ten,” and “five and ten.”GEOMETRY CREATED BECAUSE THE NILE FLOODED- The bad news was that the river destroyed many of the boundary markers, erasing all of the landmarks that told farmers which land was theirs to cultivate. (The Egyptians took property rights very seriously.- The ancient pharaohs assigned surveyors to assess the damage and reset the boundary markers, and thus geometry was born.- Egyptians were of a practical bent. They never progressed beyond measuring volumes and counting days and hours. Mathematics wasn’t used for anything impractical, except their system of astrology.FROM THE EGYPTIANS TO THE GREEKS- The Greeks were different; they embraced the abstract and the philosophical, and brought mathematics to its highest point in ancient times.- Instead of using pictures to represent numbers as the Egyptians did, the Greeks used letters.ZERO ENTERS THE EQUATION- Babylonian style of counting. And thanks to this system, zero finally appeared in the East, in the Fertile Crescent of present-day Iraq.ZERO STARTS OUT AS MERELY A PLACEHOLDER- Zero was born out of the need to give any given sequence of Babylonian digits a unique, permanent meaning.- Though zero was useful, it was only a placeholder. It was merely a symbol for a blank place in the abacus, a column where all the stones were at the bottom. It did little more than make sure digits fell in the right places; it didn’t really have a numerical value of its own.- Zero was a digit, not a number. It had no value.MANY WESTERNERS FOUND ZERO (AND INFINITY) TO BE SCARY- It is hard to imagine being afraid of a number. Yet zero was inexorably linked with the void—with nothing. There was a primal fear of void and chaos. There was also a fear of zero. Most ancient peoples believed that only emptiness and chaos were present before the universe came to be.- Multiplying by zero collapses the number line. But dividing by zero destroys the entire framework of mathematics.- The Greek universe, created by Pythagoras, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, survived long after the collapse of Greek civilization. In that universe there is no such thing as nothing. There is no zero. Because of this, the West could not accept zero for nearly two millennia.- This is the biggest failure in Greek mathematics, and it is the only thing that kept them from discovering calculus.- Aristotle just wished infinity away by stating that it is simply a construct of the human mind.INDIA- Hinduism was steeped in the symbolism of duality.- Indian mathematicians did more than simply accept zero. They transformed it, changing its role from mere placeholder to number. This reincarnation was what gave zero its power.- Our numbers evolved from the symbols that the Indians used; by rights they should be called Indian numerals rather than Arabic ones- Instead, they saw the interplay of numerals—numbers stripped of their geometric significance. This was the birth of what we now know as algebra.- Once numbers shed their geometric significance, mathematicians no longer had to worry about mathematical operations making geometric sense...You can’t remove a three-acre swath from a two-acre field, but nothing prevents you from subtracting three from two. Nowadays we recognize that 2 – 3=–1: negative one.ZERO BECOMES A NUMBER AND NO LONGER JUST A PLACE HOLDER- Just as 2 – 3 was now a number, so was 2 – 2. It was zero. Not just a mere placeholder zero that represents an empty space on the abacus, but zero the number.MUSLIMS LEARN FROM INDIA- Along the way to China, the Muslims conquered India. And there the Arabs learned about Indian numerals.- one of its first scholars was the mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi. Al-Khowarizmi wrote several important books, like Al-jabr wa’l muqabala, a treatise on how to solve elementary equations; the Al-jabr in the title (which means something like “completion”) gave us the term algebra.- algorithms, the tricks for multiplying and dividing Hindu numerals quickly...the word algorithm was a corruption of al-Khowarizmi’s name.MANY IN THE WEST STILL RELUCTANT TO ADOPT ZERO- In 1299, Florence banned Arabic numerals...Italian merchants continued to use them, and even used them to send encrypted messages—which is how the word cipher came to mean “secret code.”ZERO ENTERS INTO WESTERN ART- It was an Italian architect, Filippo Brunelleschi, who first demonstrated the power of an infinite zero: he created a realistic painting by using a vanishing point.- A point is a zero-dimensional object...This zero-dimensional object, the vanishing point, is an infinitesimal dot on the canvas that represents a spot infinitely far away from the viewer- It is no coincidence that zero and infinity are linked in the vanishing point. Just as multiplying by zero causes the number line to collapse into a point, the vanishing point has caused most of the universe to sit in a tiny dot. This is a singularity, a concept that became very important later in the history of science—ZERO AND COORDINATES- “I am in a sense something intermediate between God and nought.” —RENÉ DESCARTES, DISCOURSE ON METHOD- Descartes was a mathematician-philosopher; perhaps his most lasting legacy was a mathematical invention—what we now call Cartesian coordinates.- Descartes realized that he could not start his two reference lines, or axes, with the number 1.- Descartes quickly realized how powerful his coordinate system was. He used it to turn figures and shapes into equations and numbers; with Cartesian coordinates every geometric object—squares, triangles, wavy lines—could be represented by an equation, a mathematical relationship.- No longer were the Western art of geometry and the Eastern art of algebra separate domains.INFINITY- This is the definition of the infinite: it is something that can stay the same size even when you subtract from it.ZERO- Zero is behind all of the big puzzles in physics. The infinite density of the black hole is a division by zero. The big bang creation from the void is a division by zero. The infinite energy of the vacuum is a division by zero. Yet dividing by zero destroys the fabric of mathematics and the framework of logic—and threatens to undermine the very basis of science.- All that scientists know is the cosmos was spawned from nothing, and will return to the nothing from whence it came. The universe begins and ends with zero.PHYSICS- [Note: The second half of the book deals with how zero and infinity correspond to physics topics such as black holes, string theory, etc. Although interesting, I chose not to share too many excerpts.]*** *** *** *** ***HAHA- The Reformation was begun by Martin Luther while he was on the toilet (he suffered from chronic constipation): https://www.smh.com.au/world/toilet-w...- Estimated temperatures of heaven and hell (based on physics): http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/...FACTOIDS- 10,000—the myriad, the biggest grouping in the Greek system.- The Babylonians, like many different cultures, had invented machines that helped them count. The most famous was the abacus...The words calculate, calculus, and calcium all come from the Latin word for pebble: calculus.- In modern schools, children learn of Pythagoras for his famed theorem: the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. However, this was in fact ancient news. It was known more than 1,000 years before Pythagoras’s time.- stadium (the standard Greek unit of long distance)- (Our word noon comes from the word nones, the midday prayer service of medieval clergy.)- The Indian name for zero was sunya, meaning “empty,” which the Arabs turned into sifr. When some Western scholars described the new number to their colleagues, they turned sifr into a Latin-sounding word, yielding zephirus, which is the root of our word zero. Other Western mathematicians didn’t change the word so heavily and called zero cifra, which became cipher. Zero was so important to the new set of numbers that people started calling all numbers ciphers, which gave the French their term chiffre, digit.- The Germans called the counting board a Rechenbank, which is why we call moneylenders banks.- Not only did they use counting boards, they used tally sticks to record loans: a money value was written along the stick’s side, and it was split in two. The lender kept the biggest piece, the stock. After all, he was the stockholder.- Descartes thought that these numbers were even worse than negative numbers; he came up with a scornful name for the square roots of negatives: imaginary numbers.

Unfortunately, Zero is a little TOO pop-math - it hits on the same ""interesting"" math and physics tidbits that so many other pop-math and science books do. And while it relates all of its ideas to zero, it's not really about zero.The first half does talk about the historical context of the concept of zero, but it is mostly about philosophy - how the concepts of zero and infinity affected science and religion of the time. Just when I was hoping for some math, the book switches to a by-discipline survery of, again, math and phyiscs all-star fun factoids, including Fibonacci sequences, the golden ratio, set theory, numbers larger than infinity, wormholes, etc., etc. There were some ideas in there I had not read about before, like projective geometry, but for the most part, Hawking, Bryson, and popular math authors have covered this.So, for me, it was rehash.

We had 1000s of years without. Look around there is nothing zero, zero was invented for practical reasons. Greeks and many others hated it but mathematically they had a problem with long numbers. Zero is a dangerous idea, got converted to philosophy and find a way to enter also theology. The biography is rather complete with parts that are difficult mathematics but covers rather okish the part of philosophy and religion. Life is never zero so start searching what philosophies and policies are linked to maths and you will realize that everything is math, just avoid zero-sum games. Nihilism anyone? "

94,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"This book has a great title. It’s one word, loaded with the essence of the cosmos. That essence lies within gravity, the force that governs the large agglomerations of matter and energy.Gravity pulls energy and matter into itself, to a point, a singularity, seen in black holes and in the pre-Big Bang moment. The logic of gravitational force takes this collapse of everything into one point where, mathematically, the increased density continues into infinity. The sole break to this “bottomless” conclusion is through the mathematical addition of zero. Zero is nothing (i.e., nothing that can be further subdivided). (1)Zero works at the smallest of the small as well. This is the quantum world where particles and sub-particles break down into formless energy, which is a “singularity” of a different sort. (2) The “many” particles and sub-particles lose identity and morph into some yet-to-be-identified “oneness,”collapsing to a point, which is a “zero” point, beyond which there is or can be nothing more. (3)Then Seife unites gravity and the quantum world. Energy collapses further and further, to the point of a singularity, which is where matter itself collapses into oneness (a formless One). Singularities are mathematical realities that continue forever unless a zero point is added to stop the infinite regress. And zero means that the cosmos, at the macro and micro levels, is ultimately, nothing. (4)This is all mind-blowing stuff. Seife anchors all of this in the philosophical thinking of the East and West (5). The latter did not have the concept of zero for philosophical reasons and struggled scientifically with its absence. It was only after zero was imported from the East that Western science could incorporate its significance into cosmological discussions. I struggled to follow his various lines of thought in this regard. On the whole, though, the book is a philosophical inspiration. As Seife has it, zero-nothing unites philosophy and physics. Cosmic energy is a fixed amount (the conservation of energy, which is also an eternal notion). But that amount changes form and moves perpetually from high to low and from low to high, seeking its equilibrium – a point which is, and can only be, temporary, because energy changes forms and creates differences that in turn creates disequilibrium anew. It’s the Tao. It’s yang and yin. And it’s the three scenarios about the ultimate fate of the cosmos. (1) Zero also works at the opposite end of gravitational force as well. Zero is about a balance of energy. If the energy from the big bang expends itself, gravity pulls cosmic energy back into itself, the zero point (Big Crunch). If energy escapes the zero point, the cosmos expands and continues to the point of heat death, which is another zero point because there’s no energy differential (high to low energy). If cosmic expansion is stopped by gravity, stasis (equilibrium state) is zero as well.(2) Seife doesn’t use this word here but it seems to apply. (3) “A zero in quantum mechanics means that the entire universe – including the vacuum – is filled with an infinite amount of energy: the zero-point energy. This, in turn, leads to the most bizarre zero in the universe: the phantom force of nothing.” (4) Seife quotes Feynman who writes “The problem is, when we try to calculate all the way down to zero distance, the equation blows up in our face and gives us meaningless answers – things like infinity.” String theory is a way out of this dilemma because it sees, Seife writes, “every particle as a vibrating string rather than as a dot…In string theory, zero has been banished from the universe; there is no such thing as zero distance or zero time. This solves all the infinity problems of quantum mechanics.”(5) In the East, “The goal of the Hindu,” Seife writes, “is to free the Atman entirely from the cycle of rebirth, to stop wandering from death to death. The way to achieve the ultimate liberation through lifelessness is to cease paying heed to the illusion of reality. ‘The body, the house of the spirit, is under the power of pleasure and pain,’ explains a god. ‘And if a man is ruled by his body then this man can never be free.’ But once you are able to separate yourself from the whims of the flesh and embrace the silence and nothingness of your soul, you will be liberated. Your Atman will fly from the web of human desire and join the collective consciousness – the infinite soul that suffuses the universe at once everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It is infinity, and it is nothing. So India, as a society that actively explored the void and the infinite, accepted zero.” In the West, the Greeks “didn’t have the concept of a limit because they didn’t believe in zero.” An infinite series “seemed to get smaller and smaller without any particular end in sight. As a result, the Greeks couldn’t handle the infinite. They pondered the concept of the void but rejected zero as a number, and they toyed with the concept of the infinite but refused to allow infinity – numbers that are infinitely small and infinitely large – anywhere near the realm of numbers.” This resistance was tied up with a religious worldview. The infinite regressed into a bottomless void, without a beginning. That notion conflicted with God as the beginning point of creation and movement in the world. Zero allowed the void, nothing, to exist. That removed God and it was, therefore, atheistic. "

99,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21160019-sudeep,4,"I’m becoming more and more convinced of the power of teaching science and philosophy as a history - The progression of thought is for all to see; Human endeavour and collaboration more clearly visible. Contrast that with how science is usually thought in schools, where it seems like some genius just discovered/invented things in isolation, without any context or need. Students are not even sure why the scientist was working on that problem, and is colossally boring.Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea is presented in a similar vein. I loved the progression of chapters and how the history of science, mathematics and even philosophy was on show here. However, the concept of zero seemed to be forcefully injected and mixed with the major historical points, and that remains my only complaint of the book. If you can tolerate that (and I believe one can), it’s a very rewarding read.Here’s a brief history of Zero:* Initially mathematics was closely linked to practicality (counting sheep for example), and there was no need for the number zero in practical matters. Although the Egyptians and the Greeks progressed significantly in geometry, there was no use for the number zero in measuring dimensions of geometric objects. So, zero remained outside of mathematics.* The Greeks abhorred the concept of void and infinite. They were stumped with the paradox of Zeno. (The author even goes on to say not accepting zero was the “only thing that kept the Greeks from discovering calculus” - seems like a stretch for me).* Once the Roman empire fell, the dark ages started. The medieval scholars rather than looking at their peers for ideas, turned to the Greeks - Aristotle and Neoplatonists. Apart from other philosophical ideas (like the glorification of idealism), they inherited their fear for zero and infinity.Zero was still not on the numeric scale, and explains why we get a “jump” from 1 BC to 1 AD.* Zero goes East: After being rejected by the West for years, zero finally reached India (via Alexander’s invasion). The Indian mathematicians readily accepted the Babylonian numeral system (which had no special standalone symbol for zero, but zero was still used to distinguish 1 from 10 from 100 etc.)Aryabhatta is said to have positioned zero on the numeral system, from which our present day base-10 numeral system is derived.* Islamic invasion of India: Islam would take zero from India - and it was readily adopted in Italy, thanks to a one famous mathematician Fibonacci. Italian merchants were quick to seize upon the new numeral system (Arabic numbers), which allowed them to get rid of counting boards and make things simpler. Florence banned the Arabic numerals, but it was not so easy to dispense with; The Italian merchants continued using it, and the government had to relent in the face of commercial pressure.* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: Vanishing pointsThe Italian architect, Filippo, created a realistic painting using a vanishing point. A vanishing point is essentially a single dot, a zero, which contains the rest of the universe.* Introductions of zero in art and science: Cartesian coordinate systemRene Descartes introduces his Cartesian coordinate system, which is the first systematic link between Euclidean geometry and algebra. The points for a particular curve on such a system are the “zeros” for a particular equation: (x,y) for which f(x,y) = 0* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: VacuumVacuum has been a point of debate since Greeks. But Evangelista Torricelli is the first to study it empirically. He created the first laboratory vacuum - the torricellian vacuum, by filling a long glass tube filled to one end by mercury, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury.Pascal proves that it wasn’t nature’s abhorrence of vacuum that pushes the mercury up the tube, but rather atmospheric pressure. Vacuums don’t suck, atmosphere pushes. Pascal’s simple experiment demolished Aristotle’s assertion that nature abhors the vacuum. * Infidel Mathematics : The useful infinitesimalsInfinitesimals (extremely small numbers) starts making its way into mathematics. Kepler, in his attempt to calculate the volume of a crudely shaped wine barrel, chopped up the barrels - in his mind--into an infinite number of infinitely small pieces, and then added them back together to get the volume.Mathematicians use this infinitesimals to solve the problem of tangents - a line that just kisses a curve. It had important implications in studying motion - for example, you are swinging a ball tied to a thread above your head, if you cut off the string abruptly, the ball flies off into a tangent. Building on the idea of infinitesimals, Newton and Leibniz discover/invent calculus. The mathematicians are still grappling with the logical and philosophical problems of infinitesimals, but because of its accuracy and practical purpose, they accept it.It was finally with L’Hospital’s rule that trouble of 0/0, which plagued calculus could be resolved (though partially). The key was to make the infinitesimals carefully “tend towards zero”. Clever manipulations allowed one to resolve other odd expressions like ∞/∞, 00 and ∞0.It was finally with d’Alembert’s idea of limits that solved caculus’s problem with zeroes. He also resolved the Zeno’s paradox by boiling it down to a a sum of infinite number of ever-diminishing quantities. * Two sides of the same coin: IntroductionAlgebraic equations have roots - points where the value of the equation equals 0. Descartes refused to accept negative numbers as roots of an equation, calling them false roots. He also never extended his coordinate system beyond zero. He was even more disgusted by square roots of negative numbers, giving them a scornful name - imaginary numbers.Two developments here bridge the gap between zero and inifinity - projective geometry and the complex plane.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Projective geometryJean-Victor Poncelet was a mathematician in the Napoleon’s army, and was captured by Russia. In prison he found a new discipline: projective geometry. His work was the culmination of the work done by artists like Filippo and Da Vinci - learning to project 3d images on 2d planes, making use of, among other things, the vanishing point.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: The Complex PlaneGauss, an 18th century Mathematics prodigy was able to map out complex numbers on cartesian plane (which is called complex plane) - the vertical axis represents the imaginary numbers, while the horizontal axis represents real number. He also figured that operations like multiplication, addition etc. have geometric implications in the complex plane. For instance, multiplying a point by i, causes it turn anti-clockwise by 90 degrees. This was the second big advance.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Reimann SphereRiemann, a student of Gauss, married the ideas of projective geometry and complex plane and “…all of a sudden lines became circles, circles become lines, and zero and infinity became the poles on a globe full of numbers.” Gauss figures out that all infinities are not the same - the infinity of real numbers (uncountable infinity) is much greater than the infinity of rational numbers (countable infinity).* Zero (and infinity) in Physics (I'll rush on this)From here on the rest of the book talks about occurrences of zero (or infinity) in physics - zero kelvin (minimum possible temperature), or black holes, the Casimir effect (forces applied by a vacuum), string theory, the big bang, and the fate of the universe (via heat death)."

Following this model, students could use the ""My____History"" (Gallagher 79) or the '""You Should Know"" (Gallagher 88) Biographical Paper' strategies. Students could write their own stories, detailing where they came from, how they have impacted others in their lives, and the impact they are currently having. Or, students could choose a person or perhaps a topic (such as zero) to practice writing a history of how that topic came into being, again how others have reacted to it or been impacted by it, and how its existence is affecting the world today.Pairing this text with the above strategies would not only allow students to learn new information about the technology they are immersed in, but would also allow them to reflect on and write about their own sense of identities."

The book is a thoroughly researched and well written historical account of the history of zero, but more broadly the history of mathematics. We take zero for granted, but for most of human history we were unaware of its existence, and until only recently we denied its existence. Zero has many unusual properties and became the key to unlocking complicated mathematics like calculus and physics and indeed our understanding of the earth and the heavens. The first half was most interesting.So why did I give up? The book becomes intensely technical about halfway through, to a degree that only mathematicians can truly appreciate. It couldn’t hold my interest. I recommend this book for true math nerds. For casual math nerds, I instead recommend Jordan Ellenberg’s _How Not to be Wrong_, which Bill Gates describes as “a love letter to math.”"

The first part of the book nicely brings about how the number zero moved from east to west and the impact of the idea on western philosophy and mathematics. Seife then explains how integration and differentiation solve tricky problems where zero is involved to make sense out of equations. The final third of the book is about singularities and the big bang - zero from a cosmological perspective. Good book, and I'd have give it 4 stars, but I docked one star because of a couple of things - Seife's breathless commentary: ""zero holds the secret to our existance"", ""the ultimate fate of the cosmos lies in zero"" and Seife's insistence to treat the vacuum and the void as regions of zero activity despite (as he also later writes) the abundance of virtual particles (meaning it's clearly non-zero). Seife also, in the first part of the book, stand on a pedestal to sniffily chastise the Aristotelian view of the universe without showing enough sympathy to the fact that they (the Aristotelians) were products of their time. Perhaps Seife should realise that he's not on a pedestal, but on the shoulders of giants."

I read a lot of that genre in high school, for whatever strange reason, so I am reasonably familiar with it. In the years since high school, I have moved on from being a pop scientist to a pop historian, and I think for that reason I preferred the historical half of this book, as opposed to the latter half, which is a whistle-stop tour of the most complex mathematical and physics advances of the twentieth-century. Seife pulled off this second half just fine, considering these topics are basically impossible to explain in any intuitive or comprehensible way to the armchair physicists like me."

The association between infinity and zero is something that I hadn't thought about prior to reading it. It also does a great job of explaining things like black holes and absolute zero temperature. The book seems, though, to switch about two thirds through, at first the book is a delightful romp in which zero is a character, a funny little imp that historically was either ignored or minimized. However once zero is introduced and history catches up with the 20th century, zero puts its big-boy pants on and gets down to business in modern physics. Some of the physics at the end of the book was a bit beyond me, but I liked the books premise that zero and its pal infinity are not just useful constructs but are necessary, and indeed absolutely essential, to our understand of the universe. The book makes you think. High praise indeed. Zero (the book) is not for everyone but if you enjoy thinking about the scientific/mathematical enterprise and how it has developed over time, I would recommend it."

114,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5986736-ashwini-nocaste,4,"Thanks to the mathematics of zero and infinity, Pascal concluded that one should assume that God exists – from Zero : The Biography of a Dangerous IdeaGod’s Debris – by Scott Adams is an interesting novella that tries to in a way put out a belief model where the universe and its constituents are explained as “God’s Debris” – the primordial sea of pre-big bang existence that got sprinkled into living existence as we perceive it today. No one knows or can easily surmise as to what exactly happened one second before the big bang took place. In the book “Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea” – author Charles Seife attempts to explain the suffusion of the idea of zero throughout our existence and hints at the possibility of zero being at the beginning as well as at the end of our existence.If one accepts the universe as a sprinkling of God’s Dust formed out of the primordial sea that existed pre-big bang (which in Charles Seife’s view is nothing but something as close to what Zero signifies), then it can be taken as granted that all forms in perceivable existence today are representations of constituents which when trussed together will be an exact replica of the pre-big bang primordial sea. But as Charles Seife indicates that zero must have existed before and at the beginning of big bang – it leads me to a hypothetical assumption that the sum total of the entire universe must be equal to what Zero signifies – an idea which takes into account the anti-matter argument posed by Stephen Hawkings in “A Brief History of Time” – where the positive matter resulted in the observable universe and the negative matter – i.e., anti-matter exists as non-existence, a concept not easily graspable by our faculties.Any number divided by Zero can result in infinity. As an example, suppose a packet of 50 toffies is to be distributed. If it is to be distributed to 25 people, then the number 50 is to be divided by 25 to result in 2 toffies in the hands of each individual. But if 0 toffies were to be distributed, then one can go on distributing 50 toffies to as many people as possible (of course in this case, no one will get anything in their hands). Thus a number divided by zero tends to infinity. But Zero is also a number – so can it be argued that 0/0 is equal to infinity? An absurd conclusion of course – because it seems that nothing divided by nothing results in everything : an absurd conclusion – but something which is very close to the nature of existence as we understand it today. We know that the universe is expanding and the discovery of that fact by Hubble led one to the conclusion that the universe was once closely packed into a primordial soup – but what could have caused the explosion and whether the universe will infinitely expand or will there be a limit? An external source of energy or force acting on the primordial soup? Well it would be naïve to argue that propulsion of the primordial soup into an expanding universe is owed to the agency of an external force – since that is a physical law steeped in our earthly surroundings – and which might not have existed in operation at all during pre-big bang. So does that imply, the initiative must have come from within? If the initiative had come from within, then why at that point of time only – and why it all had to come about in the first place? It could have continued as a dense primordial soup?Could Zero be God? An exact assimilation of the sum-total consciousness in the pre-big bang arrangement but which has got scattered round the universe and now exists as a harmless looking Zero? This concept is not new and thinkers of lore have attempted to discover God in the concept of Zero. In my opinion, offered merely as a thought and not as firm conviction, what Zero signified in the pre-big bang set-up lost its power and energy as it suffused out across the length and breadth of the universe-so much so that it now became worthy of only a concept that exists as a human thought – which leads one to the natural question – whether zero as a concept, not as a numerical entity, but as a thought representing the void – also graspable by animals?Another interesting thought that can there be is – What value to give to Zero? Should it signify a void – a nothingness? Has Zero been devised to signify a void only because our perceptions of existence imply “not nothingness”. What if the pre-big bang moment is not the Zeroth hour but just another point among several points as denoted by numbers on a numberline? As a personal belief, it is difficult for me to grasp that there was a big bang – but I do not shy away from believing in the possibility of an inter-dimensional change from a certain dimension to the other. As to whether the Universe is infinite or finite, the riddle lies in the resolution of the concept of Time; but Time as we have been thoroughly ingrained to accept is the Solar notion of time based on earth’s rotation/revolution around the Sun. Time as it really exists devoid of a reference point is a difficult concept for me to conjure."

They are equal and opposite, yin and yang. They are equally paradoxical and troubling. The biggest questions in science and religion are about nothingness and eternity, the void and the infinite, zero and infinity.ZERO: POWERFUL ENOUGH TO STOP A WARSHIP- Zero hit the USS Yorktown like a torpedo. On September 21, 1997, while cruising off the coast of Virginia, the billion-dollar missile cruiser shuddered to a halt.- The Yorktown’s computers had just received new software that was controlling the engines. Unfortunately, nobody had spotted the time bomb lurking in the code, a zero that engineers were supposed to remove while installing the software.- When the Yorktown’s computer system tried to divide by zero, 80,000 horsepower instantly became worthless.LEARNING TO COUNT- In the very beginning of mathematics, it seems that people could only distinguish between one and many.- Over time, primitive languages evolved to distinguish between one, two, and many, and eventually one, two, three, many, but didn’t have terms for higher numbers.TALLYING UP LARGER GROUPS OF NUMBERS- The early Greeks, for instance, used the word “fiving” to describe the process of tallying.- In English, eleven and twelve seem to be derived from “one over [ten]” and “two over [ten],” while thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and so on are contractions of “three and ten,” “four and ten,” and “five and ten.”GEOMETRY CREATED BECAUSE THE NILE FLOODED- The bad news was that the river destroyed many of the boundary markers, erasing all of the landmarks that told farmers which land was theirs to cultivate. (The Egyptians took property rights very seriously.- The ancient pharaohs assigned surveyors to assess the damage and reset the boundary markers, and thus geometry was born.- Egyptians were of a practical bent. They never progressed beyond measuring volumes and counting days and hours. Mathematics wasn’t used for anything impractical, except their system of astrology.FROM THE EGYPTIANS TO THE GREEKS- The Greeks were different; they embraced the abstract and the philosophical, and brought mathematics to its highest point in ancient times.- Instead of using pictures to represent numbers as the Egyptians did, the Greeks used letters.ZERO ENTERS THE EQUATION- Babylonian style of counting. And thanks to this system, zero finally appeared in the East, in the Fertile Crescent of present-day Iraq.ZERO STARTS OUT AS MERELY A PLACEHOLDER- Zero was born out of the need to give any given sequence of Babylonian digits a unique, permanent meaning.- Though zero was useful, it was only a placeholder. It was merely a symbol for a blank place in the abacus, a column where all the stones were at the bottom. It did little more than make sure digits fell in the right places; it didn’t really have a numerical value of its own.- Zero was a digit, not a number. It had no value.MANY WESTERNERS FOUND ZERO (AND INFINITY) TO BE SCARY- It is hard to imagine being afraid of a number. Yet zero was inexorably linked with the void—with nothing. There was a primal fear of void and chaos. There was also a fear of zero. Most ancient peoples believed that only emptiness and chaos were present before the universe came to be.- Multiplying by zero collapses the number line. But dividing by zero destroys the entire framework of mathematics.- The Greek universe, created by Pythagoras, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, survived long after the collapse of Greek civilization. In that universe there is no such thing as nothing. There is no zero. Because of this, the West could not accept zero for nearly two millennia.- This is the biggest failure in Greek mathematics, and it is the only thing that kept them from discovering calculus.- Aristotle just wished infinity away by stating that it is simply a construct of the human mind.INDIA- Hinduism was steeped in the symbolism of duality.- Indian mathematicians did more than simply accept zero. They transformed it, changing its role from mere placeholder to number. This reincarnation was what gave zero its power.- Our numbers evolved from the symbols that the Indians used; by rights they should be called Indian numerals rather than Arabic ones- Instead, they saw the interplay of numerals—numbers stripped of their geometric significance. This was the birth of what we now know as algebra.- Once numbers shed their geometric significance, mathematicians no longer had to worry about mathematical operations making geometric sense...You can’t remove a three-acre swath from a two-acre field, but nothing prevents you from subtracting three from two. Nowadays we recognize that 2 – 3=–1: negative one.ZERO BECOMES A NUMBER AND NO LONGER JUST A PLACE HOLDER- Just as 2 – 3 was now a number, so was 2 – 2. It was zero. Not just a mere placeholder zero that represents an empty space on the abacus, but zero the number.MUSLIMS LEARN FROM INDIA- Along the way to China, the Muslims conquered India. And there the Arabs learned about Indian numerals.- one of its first scholars was the mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi. Al-Khowarizmi wrote several important books, like Al-jabr wa’l muqabala, a treatise on how to solve elementary equations; the Al-jabr in the title (which means something like “completion”) gave us the term algebra.- algorithms, the tricks for multiplying and dividing Hindu numerals quickly...the word algorithm was a corruption of al-Khowarizmi’s name.MANY IN THE WEST STILL RELUCTANT TO ADOPT ZERO- In 1299, Florence banned Arabic numerals...Italian merchants continued to use them, and even used them to send encrypted messages—which is how the word cipher came to mean “secret code.”ZERO ENTERS INTO WESTERN ART- It was an Italian architect, Filippo Brunelleschi, who first demonstrated the power of an infinite zero: he created a realistic painting by using a vanishing point.- A point is a zero-dimensional object...This zero-dimensional object, the vanishing point, is an infinitesimal dot on the canvas that represents a spot infinitely far away from the viewer- It is no coincidence that zero and infinity are linked in the vanishing point. Just as multiplying by zero causes the number line to collapse into a point, the vanishing point has caused most of the universe to sit in a tiny dot. This is a singularity, a concept that became very important later in the history of science—ZERO AND COORDINATES- “I am in a sense something intermediate between God and nought.” —RENÉ DESCARTES, DISCOURSE ON METHOD- Descartes was a mathematician-philosopher; perhaps his most lasting legacy was a mathematical invention—what we now call Cartesian coordinates.- Descartes realized that he could not start his two reference lines, or axes, with the number 1.- Descartes quickly realized how powerful his coordinate system was. He used it to turn figures and shapes into equations and numbers; with Cartesian coordinates every geometric object—squares, triangles, wavy lines—could be represented by an equation, a mathematical relationship.- No longer were the Western art of geometry and the Eastern art of algebra separate domains.INFINITY- This is the definition of the infinite: it is something that can stay the same size even when you subtract from it.ZERO- Zero is behind all of the big puzzles in physics. The infinite density of the black hole is a division by zero. The big bang creation from the void is a division by zero. The infinite energy of the vacuum is a division by zero. Yet dividing by zero destroys the fabric of mathematics and the framework of logic—and threatens to undermine the very basis of science.- All that scientists know is the cosmos was spawned from nothing, and will return to the nothing from whence it came. The universe begins and ends with zero.PHYSICS- [Note: The second half of the book deals with how zero and infinity correspond to physics topics such as black holes, string theory, etc. Although interesting, I chose not to share too many excerpts.]*** *** *** *** ***HAHA- The Reformation was begun by Martin Luther while he was on the toilet (he suffered from chronic constipation): https://www.smh.com.au/world/toilet-w...- Estimated temperatures of heaven and hell (based on physics): http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/...FACTOIDS- 10,000—the myriad, the biggest grouping in the Greek system.- The Babylonians, like many different cultures, had invented machines that helped them count. The most famous was the abacus...The words calculate, calculus, and calcium all come from the Latin word for pebble: calculus.- In modern schools, children learn of Pythagoras for his famed theorem: the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. However, this was in fact ancient news. It was known more than 1,000 years before Pythagoras’s time.- stadium (the standard Greek unit of long distance)- (Our word noon comes from the word nones, the midday prayer service of medieval clergy.)- The Indian name for zero was sunya, meaning “empty,” which the Arabs turned into sifr. When some Western scholars described the new number to their colleagues, they turned sifr into a Latin-sounding word, yielding zephirus, which is the root of our word zero. Other Western mathematicians didn’t change the word so heavily and called zero cifra, which became cipher. Zero was so important to the new set of numbers that people started calling all numbers ciphers, which gave the French their term chiffre, digit.- The Germans called the counting board a Rechenbank, which is why we call moneylenders banks.- Not only did they use counting boards, they used tally sticks to record loans: a money value was written along the stick’s side, and it was split in two. The lender kept the biggest piece, the stock. After all, he was the stockholder.- Descartes thought that these numbers were even worse than negative numbers; he came up with a scornful name for the square roots of negatives: imaginary numbers.

And while it relates all of its ideas to zero, it's not really about zero.The first half does talk about the historical context of the concept of zero, but it is mostly about philosophy - how the concepts of zero and infinity affected science and religion of the time. Just when I was hoping for some math, the book switches to a by-discipline survery of, again, math and phyiscs all-star fun factoids, including Fibonacci sequences, the golden ratio, set theory, numbers larger than infinity, wormholes, etc., etc. There were some ideas in there I had not read about before, like projective geometry, but for the most part, Hawking, Bryson, and popular math authors have covered this.So, for me, it was rehash. If you have not read much pop-math, this book is very interesting, although it definitely requires a late-high school understanding of algebra and physics to make sense. If you are familiar with the genre, you've seen most of it before."

We had 1000s of years without. Look around there is nothing zero, zero was invented for practical reasons. Greeks and many others hated it but mathematically they had a problem with long numbers. Zero is a dangerous idea, got converted to philosophy and find a way to enter also theology. The biography is rather complete with parts that are difficult mathematics but covers rather okish the part of philosophy and religion. Life is never zero so start searching what philosophies and policies are linked to maths and you will realize that everything is math, just avoid zero-sum games. Nihilism anyone? "

The latter is more of a travelogue/social history of zero (which has its charms), but I think I prefer this one better because it is a little more concrete. The author does at times try to squeeze some philosophical insights out of zero, which I found annoying, but for the most part it's pretty straightforward. "

Okay, stupid joke aside; this book meets minimum prose competency for making the story of zero, and mathematics, interesting and engaging. After finishing the book, I actually spent two hours giving myself basic algebra problems to see if I could still solve them. This is a good book to read on a whim, any intentions for it more serious will result in disappointment. (In other words, it's like a really good one-hour History Channel program.)"
124,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"This book has a great title. It’s one word, loaded with the essence of the cosmos. That essence lies within gravity, the force that governs the large agglomerations of matter and energy.Gravity pulls energy and matter into itself, to a point, a singularity, seen in black holes and in the pre-Big Bang moment. The logic of gravitational force takes this collapse of everything into one point where, mathematically, the increased density continues into infinity. The sole break to this “bottomless” conclusion is through the mathematical addition of zero. Zero is nothing (i.e., nothing that can be further subdivided). (1)Zero works at the smallest of the small as well. This is the quantum world where particles and sub-particles break down into formless energy, which is a “singularity” of a different sort. (2) The “many” particles and sub-particles lose identity and morph into some yet-to-be-identified “oneness,”collapsing to a point, which is a “zero” point, beyond which there is or can be nothing more. (3)Then Seife unites gravity and the quantum world. Energy collapses further and further, to the point of a singularity, which is where matter itself collapses into oneness (a formless One). Singularities are mathematical realities that continue forever unless a zero point is added to stop the infinite regress. And zero means that the cosmos, at the macro and micro levels, is ultimately, nothing. (4)This is all mind-blowing stuff. Seife anchors all of this in the philosophical thinking of the East and West (5). The latter did not have the concept of zero for philosophical reasons and struggled scientifically with its absence. It was only after zero was imported from the East that Western science could incorporate its significance into cosmological discussions. I struggled to follow his various lines of thought in this regard. On the whole, though, the book is a philosophical inspiration. As Seife has it, zero-nothing unites philosophy and physics. Cosmic energy is a fixed amount (the conservation of energy, which is also an eternal notion). But that amount changes form and moves perpetually from high to low and from low to high, seeking its equilibrium – a point which is, and can only be, temporary, because energy changes forms and creates differences that in turn creates disequilibrium anew. It’s the Tao. It’s yang and yin. And it’s the three scenarios about the ultimate fate of the cosmos. (1) Zero also works at the opposite end of gravitational force as well. Zero is about a balance of energy. If the energy from the big bang expends itself, gravity pulls cosmic energy back into itself, the zero point (Big Crunch). If energy escapes the zero point, the cosmos expands and continues to the point of heat death, which is another zero point because there’s no energy differential (high to low energy). If cosmic expansion is stopped by gravity, stasis (equilibrium state) is zero as well.(2) Seife doesn’t use this word here but it seems to apply. (3) “A zero in quantum mechanics means that the entire universe – including the vacuum – is filled with an infinite amount of energy: the zero-point energy. This, in turn, leads to the most bizarre zero in the universe: the phantom force of nothing.” (4) Seife quotes Feynman who writes “The problem is, when we try to calculate all the way down to zero distance, the equation blows up in our face and gives us meaningless answers – things like infinity.” String theory is a way out of this dilemma because it sees, Seife writes, “every particle as a vibrating string rather than as a dot…In string theory, zero has been banished from the universe; there is no such thing as zero distance or zero time. This solves all the infinity problems of quantum mechanics.”(5) In the East, “The goal of the Hindu,” Seife writes, “is to free the Atman entirely from the cycle of rebirth, to stop wandering from death to death. The way to achieve the ultimate liberation through lifelessness is to cease paying heed to the illusion of reality. ‘The body, the house of the spirit, is under the power of pleasure and pain,’ explains a god. ‘And if a man is ruled by his body then this man can never be free.’ But once you are able to separate yourself from the whims of the flesh and embrace the silence and nothingness of your soul, you will be liberated. Your Atman will fly from the web of human desire and join the collective consciousness – the infinite soul that suffuses the universe at once everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It is infinity, and it is nothing. So India, as a society that actively explored the void and the infinite, accepted zero.” In the West, the Greeks “didn’t have the concept of a limit because they didn’t believe in zero.” An infinite series “seemed to get smaller and smaller without any particular end in sight. As a result, the Greeks couldn’t handle the infinite. They pondered the concept of the void but rejected zero as a number, and they toyed with the concept of the infinite but refused to allow infinity – numbers that are infinitely small and infinitely large – anywhere near the realm of numbers.” This resistance was tied up with a religious worldview. The infinite regressed into a bottomless void, without a beginning. That notion conflicted with God as the beginning point of creation and movement in the world. Zero allowed the void, nothing, to exist. That removed God and it was, therefore, atheistic. "

129,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21160019-sudeep,4,"I’m becoming more and more convinced of the power of teaching science and philosophy as a history - The progression of thought is for all to see; Human endeavour and collaboration more clearly visible. Contrast that with how science is usually thought in schools, where it seems like some genius just discovered/invented things in isolation, without any context or need. Students are not even sure why the scientist was working on that problem, and is colossally boring.Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea is presented in a similar vein. I loved the progression of chapters and how the history of science, mathematics and even philosophy was on show here. However, the concept of zero seemed to be forcefully injected and mixed with the major historical points, and that remains my only complaint of the book. If you can tolerate that (and I believe one can), it’s a very rewarding read.Here’s a brief history of Zero:* Initially mathematics was closely linked to practicality (counting sheep for example), and there was no need for the number zero in practical matters. Although the Egyptians and the Greeks progressed significantly in geometry, there was no use for the number zero in measuring dimensions of geometric objects. So, zero remained outside of mathematics.* The Greeks abhorred the concept of void and infinite. They were stumped with the paradox of Zeno. (The author even goes on to say not accepting zero was the “only thing that kept the Greeks from discovering calculus” - seems like a stretch for me).* Once the Roman empire fell, the dark ages started. The medieval scholars rather than looking at their peers for ideas, turned to the Greeks - Aristotle and Neoplatonists. Apart from other philosophical ideas (like the glorification of idealism), they inherited their fear for zero and infinity.Zero was still not on the numeric scale, and explains why we get a “jump” from 1 BC to 1 AD.* Zero goes East: After being rejected by the West for years, zero finally reached India (via Alexander’s invasion). The Indian mathematicians readily accepted the Babylonian numeral system (which had no special standalone symbol for zero, but zero was still used to distinguish 1 from 10 from 100 etc.)Aryabhatta is said to have positioned zero on the numeral system, from which our present day base-10 numeral system is derived.* Islamic invasion of India: Islam would take zero from India - and it was readily adopted in Italy, thanks to a one famous mathematician Fibonacci. Italian merchants were quick to seize upon the new numeral system (Arabic numbers), which allowed them to get rid of counting boards and make things simpler. Florence banned the Arabic numerals, but it was not so easy to dispense with; The Italian merchants continued using it, and the government had to relent in the face of commercial pressure.* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: Vanishing pointsThe Italian architect, Filippo, created a realistic painting using a vanishing point. A vanishing point is essentially a single dot, a zero, which contains the rest of the universe.* Introductions of zero in art and science: Cartesian coordinate systemRene Descartes introduces his Cartesian coordinate system, which is the first systematic link between Euclidean geometry and algebra. The points for a particular curve on such a system are the “zeros” for a particular equation: (x,y) for which f(x,y) = 0* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: VacuumVacuum has been a point of debate since Greeks. But Evangelista Torricelli is the first to study it empirically. He created the first laboratory vacuum - the torricellian vacuum, by filling a long glass tube filled to one end by mercury, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury.Pascal proves that it wasn’t nature’s abhorrence of vacuum that pushes the mercury up the tube, but rather atmospheric pressure. Vacuums don’t suck, atmosphere pushes. Pascal’s simple experiment demolished Aristotle’s assertion that nature abhors the vacuum. * Infidel Mathematics : The useful infinitesimalsInfinitesimals (extremely small numbers) starts making its way into mathematics. Kepler, in his attempt to calculate the volume of a crudely shaped wine barrel, chopped up the barrels - in his mind--into an infinite number of infinitely small pieces, and then added them back together to get the volume.Mathematicians use this infinitesimals to solve the problem of tangents - a line that just kisses a curve. It had important implications in studying motion - for example, you are swinging a ball tied to a thread above your head, if you cut off the string abruptly, the ball flies off into a tangent. Building on the idea of infinitesimals, Newton and Leibniz discover/invent calculus. The mathematicians are still grappling with the logical and philosophical problems of infinitesimals, but because of its accuracy and practical purpose, they accept it.It was finally with L’Hospital’s rule that trouble of 0/0, which plagued calculus could be resolved (though partially). The key was to make the infinitesimals carefully “tend towards zero”. Clever manipulations allowed one to resolve other odd expressions like ∞/∞, 00 and ∞0.It was finally with d’Alembert’s idea of limits that solved caculus’s problem with zeroes. He also resolved the Zeno’s paradox by boiling it down to a a sum of infinite number of ever-diminishing quantities. * Two sides of the same coin: IntroductionAlgebraic equations have roots - points where the value of the equation equals 0. Descartes refused to accept negative numbers as roots of an equation, calling them false roots. He also never extended his coordinate system beyond zero. He was even more disgusted by square roots of negative numbers, giving them a scornful name - imaginary numbers.Two developments here bridge the gap between zero and inifinity - projective geometry and the complex plane.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Projective geometryJean-Victor Poncelet was a mathematician in the Napoleon’s army, and was captured by Russia. In prison he found a new discipline: projective geometry. His work was the culmination of the work done by artists like Filippo and Da Vinci - learning to project 3d images on 2d planes, making use of, among other things, the vanishing point.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: The Complex PlaneGauss, an 18th century Mathematics prodigy was able to map out complex numbers on cartesian plane (which is called complex plane) - the vertical axis represents the imaginary numbers, while the horizontal axis represents real number. He also figured that operations like multiplication, addition etc. have geometric implications in the complex plane. For instance, multiplying a point by i, causes it turn anti-clockwise by 90 degrees. This was the second big advance.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Reimann SphereRiemann, a student of Gauss, married the ideas of projective geometry and complex plane and “…all of a sudden lines became circles, circles become lines, and zero and infinity became the poles on a globe full of numbers.” Gauss figures out that all infinities are not the same - the infinity of real numbers (uncountable infinity) is much greater than the infinity of rational numbers (countable infinity).* Zero (and infinity) in Physics (I'll rush on this)From here on the rest of the book talks about occurrences of zero (or infinity) in physics - zero kelvin (minimum possible temperature), or black holes, the Casimir effect (forces applied by a vacuum), string theory, the big bang, and the fate of the universe (via heat death)."

Following this model, students could use the ""My____History"" (Gallagher 79) or the '""You Should Know"" (Gallagher 88) Biographical Paper' strategies. Students could write their own stories, detailing where they came from, how they have impacted others in their lives, and the impact they are currently having. Or, students could choose a person or perhaps a topic (such as zero) to practice writing a history of how that topic came into being, again how others have reacted to it or been impacted by it, and how its existence is affecting the world today.Pairing this text with the above strategies would not only allow students to learn new information about the technology they are immersed in, but would also allow them to reflect on and write about their own sense of identities."
131,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63312978-ben-jackson,2,"For full transparency, I read about 3/4 of this book and put it down. The book is a thoroughly researched and well written historical account of the history of zero, but more broadly the history of mathematics. We take zero for granted, but for most of human history we were unaware of its existence, and until only recently we denied its existence. Zero has many unusual properties and became the key to unlocking complicated mathematics like calculus and physics and indeed our understanding of the earth and the heavens. The first half was most interesting.So why did I give up? The book becomes intensely technical about halfway through, to a degree that only mathematicians can truly appreciate. It couldn’t hold my interest. I recommend this book for true math nerds. For casual math nerds, I instead recommend Jordan Ellenberg’s _How Not to be Wrong_, which Bill Gates describes as “a love letter to math.”"
132,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54161476-alexander-thomas,3,"I enjoyed the book and got through it fairly quickly. The first part of the book nicely brings about how the number zero moved from east to west and the impact of the idea on western philosophy and mathematics. Seife then explains how integration and differentiation solve tricky problems where zero is involved to make sense out of equations. The final third of the book is about singularities and the big bang - zero from a cosmological perspective. Good book, and I'd have give it 4 stars, but I docked one star because of a couple of things - Seife's breathless commentary: ""zero holds the secret to our existance"", ""the ultimate fate of the cosmos lies in zero"" and Seife's insistence to treat the vacuum and the void as regions of zero activity despite (as he also later writes) the abundance of virtual particles (meaning it's clearly non-zero). Seife also, in the first part of the book, stand on a pedestal to sniffily chastise the Aristotelian view of the universe without showing enough sympathy to the fact that they (the Aristotelians) were products of their time. Perhaps Seife should realise that he's not on a pedestal, but on the shoulders of giants."

I read a lot of that genre in high school, for whatever strange reason, so I am reasonably familiar with it. In the years since high school, I have moved on from being a pop scientist to a pop historian, and I think for that reason I preferred the historical half of this book, as opposed to the latter half, which is a whistle-stop tour of the most complex mathematical and physics advances of the twentieth-century. Seife pulled off this second half just fine, considering these topics are basically impossible to explain in any intuitive or comprehensible way to the armchair physicists like me."

The association between infinity and zero is something that I hadn't thought about prior to reading it. It also does a great job of explaining things like black holes and absolute zero temperature. The book seems, though, to switch about two thirds through, at first the book is a delightful romp in which zero is a character, a funny little imp that historically was either ignored or minimized. However once zero is introduced and history catches up with the 20th century, zero puts its big-boy pants on and gets down to business in modern physics. Some of the physics at the end of the book was a bit beyond me, but I liked the books premise that zero and its pal infinity are not just useful constructs but are necessary, and indeed absolutely essential, to our understand of the universe. The book makes you think. High praise indeed. Zero (the book) is not for everyone but if you enjoy thinking about the scientific/mathematical enterprise and how it has developed over time, I would recommend it."

144,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5986736-ashwini-nocaste,4,"Thanks to the mathematics of zero and infinity, Pascal concluded that one should assume that God exists – from Zero : The Biography of a Dangerous IdeaGod’s Debris – by Scott Adams is an interesting novella that tries to in a way put out a belief model where the universe and its constituents are explained as “God’s Debris” – the primordial sea of pre-big bang existence that got sprinkled into living existence as we perceive it today. No one knows or can easily surmise as to what exactly happened one second before the big bang took place. In the book “Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea” – author Charles Seife attempts to explain the suffusion of the idea of zero throughout our existence and hints at the possibility of zero being at the beginning as well as at the end of our existence.If one accepts the universe as a sprinkling of God’s Dust formed out of the primordial sea that existed pre-big bang (which in Charles Seife’s view is nothing but something as close to what Zero signifies), then it can be taken as granted that all forms in perceivable existence today are representations of constituents which when trussed together will be an exact replica of the pre-big bang primordial sea. But as Charles Seife indicates that zero must have existed before and at the beginning of big bang – it leads me to a hypothetical assumption that the sum total of the entire universe must be equal to what Zero signifies – an idea which takes into account the anti-matter argument posed by Stephen Hawkings in “A Brief History of Time” – where the positive matter resulted in the observable universe and the negative matter – i.e., anti-matter exists as non-existence, a concept not easily graspable by our faculties.Any number divided by Zero can result in infinity. As an example, suppose a packet of 50 toffies is to be distributed. If it is to be distributed to 25 people, then the number 50 is to be divided by 25 to result in 2 toffies in the hands of each individual. But if 0 toffies were to be distributed, then one can go on distributing 50 toffies to as many people as possible (of course in this case, no one will get anything in their hands). Thus a number divided by zero tends to infinity. But Zero is also a number – so can it be argued that 0/0 is equal to infinity? An absurd conclusion of course – because it seems that nothing divided by nothing results in everything : an absurd conclusion – but something which is very close to the nature of existence as we understand it today. We know that the universe is expanding and the discovery of that fact by Hubble led one to the conclusion that the universe was once closely packed into a primordial soup – but what could have caused the explosion and whether the universe will infinitely expand or will there be a limit? An external source of energy or force acting on the primordial soup? Well it would be naïve to argue that propulsion of the primordial soup into an expanding universe is owed to the agency of an external force – since that is a physical law steeped in our earthly surroundings – and which might not have existed in operation at all during pre-big bang. So does that imply, the initiative must have come from within? If the initiative had come from within, then why at that point of time only – and why it all had to come about in the first place? It could have continued as a dense primordial soup?Could Zero be God? An exact assimilation of the sum-total consciousness in the pre-big bang arrangement but which has got scattered round the universe and now exists as a harmless looking Zero? This concept is not new and thinkers of lore have attempted to discover God in the concept of Zero. In my opinion, offered merely as a thought and not as firm conviction, what Zero signified in the pre-big bang set-up lost its power and energy as it suffused out across the length and breadth of the universe-so much so that it now became worthy of only a concept that exists as a human thought – which leads one to the natural question – whether zero as a concept, not as a numerical entity, but as a thought representing the void – also graspable by animals?Another interesting thought that can there be is – What value to give to Zero? Should it signify a void – a nothingness? Has Zero been devised to signify a void only because our perceptions of existence imply “not nothingness”. What if the pre-big bang moment is not the Zeroth hour but just another point among several points as denoted by numbers on a numberline? As a personal belief, it is difficult for me to grasp that there was a big bang – but I do not shy away from believing in the possibility of an inter-dimensional change from a certain dimension to the other. As to whether the Universe is infinite or finite, the riddle lies in the resolution of the concept of Time; but Time as we have been thoroughly ingrained to accept is the Solar notion of time based on earth’s rotation/revolution around the Sun. Time as it really exists devoid of a reference point is a difficult concept for me to conjure."

Unfortunately, nobody had spotted the time bomb lurking in the code, a zero that engineers were supposed to remove while installing the software.- When the Yorktown’s computer system tried to divide by zero, 80,000 horsepower instantly became worthless.LEARNING TO COUNT- In the very beginning of mathematics, it seems that people could only distinguish between one and many.- Over time, primitive languages evolved to distinguish between one, two, and many, and eventually one, two, three, many, but didn’t have terms for higher numbers.TALLYING UP LARGER GROUPS OF NUMBERS- The early Greeks, for instance, used the word “fiving” to describe the process of tallying.- In English, eleven and twelve seem to be derived from “one over [ten]” and “two over [ten],” while thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and so on are contractions of “three and ten,” “four and ten,” and “five and ten.”GEOMETRY CREATED BECAUSE THE NILE FLOODED- The bad news was that the river destroyed many of the boundary markers, erasing all of the landmarks that told farmers which land was theirs to cultivate. (The Egyptians took property rights very seriously.- The ancient pharaohs assigned surveyors to assess the damage and reset the boundary markers, and thus geometry was born.- Egyptians were of a practical bent. They never progressed beyond measuring volumes and counting days and hours. Mathematics wasn’t used for anything impractical, except their system of astrology.FROM THE EGYPTIANS TO THE GREEKS- The Greeks were different; they embraced the abstract and the philosophical, and brought mathematics to its highest point in ancient times.- Instead of using pictures to represent numbers as the Egyptians did, the Greeks used letters.ZERO ENTERS THE EQUATION- Babylonian style of counting. And thanks to this system, zero finally appeared in the East, in the Fertile Crescent of present-day Iraq.ZERO STARTS OUT AS MERELY A PLACEHOLDER- Zero was born out of the need to give any given sequence of Babylonian digits a unique, permanent meaning.- Though zero was useful, it was only a placeholder. It was merely a symbol for a blank place in the abacus, a column where all the stones were at the bottom. It did little more than make sure digits fell in the right places; it didn’t really have a numerical value of its own.- Zero was a digit, not a number. It had no value.MANY WESTERNERS FOUND ZERO (AND INFINITY) TO BE SCARY- It is hard to imagine being afraid of a number. Yet zero was inexorably linked with the void—with nothing. There was a primal fear of void and chaos. There was also a fear of zero. Most ancient peoples believed that only emptiness and chaos were present before the universe came to be.- Multiplying by zero collapses the number line. But dividing by zero destroys the entire framework of mathematics.- The Greek universe, created by Pythagoras, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, survived long after the collapse of Greek civilization. In that universe there is no such thing as nothing. There is no zero. Because of this, the West could not accept zero for nearly two millennia.- This is the biggest failure in Greek mathematics, and it is the only thing that kept them from discovering calculus.- Aristotle just wished infinity away by stating that it is simply a construct of the human mind.INDIA- Hinduism was steeped in the symbolism of duality.- Indian mathematicians did more than simply accept zero. They transformed it, changing its role from mere placeholder to number. This reincarnation was what gave zero its power.- Our numbers evolved from the symbols that the Indians used; by rights they should be called Indian numerals rather than Arabic ones- Instead, they saw the interplay of numerals—numbers stripped of their geometric significance. This was the birth of what we now know as algebra.- Once numbers shed their geometric significance, mathematicians no longer had to worry about mathematical operations making geometric sense...You can’t remove a three-acre swath from a two-acre field, but nothing prevents you from subtracting three from two. Nowadays we recognize that 2 – 3=–1: negative one.ZERO BECOMES A NUMBER AND NO LONGER JUST A PLACE HOLDER- Just as 2 – 3 was now a number, so was 2 – 2. It was zero. Not just a mere placeholder zero that represents an empty space on the abacus, but zero the number.MUSLIMS LEARN FROM INDIA- Along the way to China, the Muslims conquered India. And there the Arabs learned about Indian numerals.- one of its first scholars was the mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi. Al-Khowarizmi wrote several important books, like Al-jabr wa’l muqabala, a treatise on how to solve elementary equations; the Al-jabr in the title (which means something like “completion”) gave us the term algebra.- algorithms, the tricks for multiplying and dividing Hindu numerals quickly...the word algorithm was a corruption of al-Khowarizmi’s name.MANY IN THE WEST STILL RELUCTANT TO ADOPT ZERO- In 1299, Florence banned Arabic numerals...Italian merchants continued to use them, and even used them to send encrypted messages—which is how the word cipher came to mean “secret code.”ZERO ENTERS INTO WESTERN ART- It was an Italian architect, Filippo Brunelleschi, who first demonstrated the power of an infinite zero: he created a realistic painting by using a vanishing point.- A point is a zero-dimensional object...This zero-dimensional object, the vanishing point, is an infinitesimal dot on the canvas that represents a spot infinitely far away from the viewer- It is no coincidence that zero and infinity are linked in the vanishing point. Just as multiplying by zero causes the number line to collapse into a point, the vanishing point has caused most of the universe to sit in a tiny dot. This is a singularity, a concept that became very important later in the history of science—ZERO AND COORDINATES- “I am in a sense something intermediate between God and nought.” —RENÉ DESCARTES, DISCOURSE ON METHOD- Descartes was a mathematician-philosopher; perhaps his most lasting legacy was a mathematical invention—what we now call Cartesian coordinates.- Descartes realized that he could not start his two reference lines, or axes, with the number 1.- Descartes quickly realized how powerful his coordinate system was. He used it to turn figures and shapes into equations and numbers; with Cartesian coordinates every geometric object—squares, triangles, wavy lines—could be represented by an equation, a mathematical relationship.- No longer were the Western art of geometry and the Eastern art of algebra separate domains.INFINITY- This is the definition of the infinite: it is something that can stay the same size even when you subtract from it.ZERO- Zero is behind all of the big puzzles in physics. The infinite density of the black hole is a division by zero. The big bang creation from the void is a division by zero. The infinite energy of the vacuum is a division by zero. Yet dividing by zero destroys the fabric of mathematics and the framework of logic—and threatens to undermine the very basis of science.- All that scientists know is the cosmos was spawned from nothing, and will return to the nothing from whence it came. The universe begins and ends with zero.PHYSICS- [Note: The second half of the book deals with how zero and infinity correspond to physics topics such as black holes, string theory, etc. Although interesting, I chose not to share too many excerpts.]*** *** *** *** ***HAHA- The Reformation was begun by Martin Luther while he was on the toilet (he suffered from chronic constipation): https://www.smh.com.au/world/toilet-w...- Estimated temperatures of heaven and hell (based on physics): http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/...FACTOIDS- 10,000—the myriad, the biggest grouping in the Greek system.- The Babylonians, like many different cultures, had invented machines that helped them count. The most famous was the abacus...The words calculate, calculus, and calcium all come from the Latin word for pebble: calculus.- In modern schools, children learn of Pythagoras for his famed theorem: the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. However, this was in fact ancient news. It was known more than 1,000 years before Pythagoras’s time.- stadium (the standard Greek unit of long distance)- (Our word noon comes from the word nones, the midday prayer service of medieval clergy.)- The Indian name for zero was sunya, meaning “empty,” which the Arabs turned into sifr. When some Western scholars described the new number to their colleagues, they turned sifr into a Latin-sounding word, yielding zephirus, which is the root of our word zero. Other Western mathematicians didn’t change the word so heavily and called zero cifra, which became cipher. Zero was so important to the new set of numbers that people started calling all numbers ciphers, which gave the French their term chiffre, digit.- The Germans called the counting board a Rechenbank, which is why we call moneylenders banks.- Not only did they use counting boards, they used tally sticks to record loans: a money value was written along the stick’s side, and it was split in two. The lender kept the biggest piece, the stock. After all, he was the stockholder.- Descartes thought that these numbers were even worse than negative numbers; he came up with a scornful name for the square roots of negatives: imaginary numbers. The name stuck, and eventually, the symbol for the square root of –1 became i.BONUS- The numbers cult of Pythagoras: https://youtu.be/9_DHBf_koGE- Zeno’s paradox - Achilles and the turtle: https://youtu.be/3vNlf2zGLaE- Archimedes principle: https://youtu.be/ijj58xD5fDI- Aristotle - History’s most influential thinker: https://youtu.be/qD5O3vXj9eU- Fibonacci’s rabbit problem: https://youtu.be/sjQlW6cH3Ko- Vacuums: https://youtu.be/EkDhlzA-lwI- Pascaline (world’s first calculator): https://youtu.be/5wB80HzF8sM- The Casimir Effect: https://youtu.be/nDxW9ZF5wGs- Pauli’s exclusion principle: https://youtu.be/GZku6bBaufs- What is a singularity?: https://youtu.be/24T58gXCUW8"

A step above textbook-level dryness but a step below pop-science narrative, this one stops being pleasurable to read after about 75 pages when it begins to retread similar ground (how zero was/wasn't explored as a concept in various ancient civilizations). Later the author shifts from cultural history and towards summaries of much drier mathematical concepts and their development, at which point we're really straining the use of ""biography"" in the title.

But for the time being, it appears that nothing will come of nothing.” (p. 189)“Zero dwells at the juxtaposition of quantum mechanics and relativity; zero lives where the two theories meet, and zero causes the two theories to clash. A black hole is a zero in the equations of general relativity; the energy of the vacuum is a zero in the mathematics of quantum theory. The big bang, the most puzzling event in the history of the universe, is a zero in both theories. The universe came from nothing – and both theories break down when they try to explain the origin of the cosmos.” (p. 192)"

Unfortunately, Zero is a little TOO pop-math - it hits on the same ""interesting"" math and physics tidbits that so many other pop-math and science books do. And while it relates all of its ideas to zero, it's not really about zero.The first half does talk about the historical context of the concept of zero, but it is mostly about philosophy - how the concepts of zero and infinity affected science and religion of the time. Just when I was hoping for some math, the book switches to a by-discipline survery of, again, math and phyiscs all-star fun factoids, including Fibonacci sequences, the golden ratio, set theory, numbers larger than infinity, wormholes, etc., etc. There were some ideas in there I had not read about before, like projective geometry, but for the most part, Hawking, Bryson, and popular math authors have covered this.So, for me, it was rehash. If you have not read much pop-math, this book is very interesting, although it definitely requires a late-high school understanding of algebra and physics to make sense. If you are familiar with the genre, you've seen most of it before."
151,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16896341-sotiris-makrygiannis,3,"First I start by changing my score criteria and start scoring lower, than higher.This is a good book on the history of Zero. We had 1000s of years without. Look around there is nothing zero, zero was invented for practical reasons. Greeks and many others hated it but mathematically they had a problem with long numbers. Zero is a dangerous idea, got converted to philosophy and find a way to enter also theology. The biography is rather complete with parts that are difficult mathematics but covers rather okish the part of philosophy and religion. Life is never zero so start searching what philosophies and policies are linked to maths and you will realize that everything is math, just avoid zero-sum games. Nihilism anyone? "

The author does at times try to squeeze some philosophical insights out of zero, which I found annoying, but for the most part it's pretty straightforward. "

This is a good book to read on a whim, any intentions for it more serious will result in disappointment. (In other words, it's like a really good one-hour History Channel program.)"
154,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"This book has a great title. It’s one word, loaded with the essence of the cosmos. That essence lies within gravity, the force that governs the large agglomerations of matter and energy.Gravity pulls energy and matter into itself, to a point, a singularity, seen in black holes and in the pre-Big Bang moment. The logic of gravitational force takes this collapse of everything into one point where, mathematically, the increased density continues into infinity. The sole break to this “bottomless” conclusion is through the mathematical addition of zero. Zero is nothing (i.e., nothing that can be further subdivided). (1)Zero works at the smallest of the small as well. This is the quantum world where particles and sub-particles break down into formless energy, which is a “singularity” of a different sort. (2) The “many” particles and sub-particles lose identity and morph into some yet-to-be-identified “oneness,”collapsing to a point, which is a “zero” point, beyond which there is or can be nothing more. (3)Then Seife unites gravity and the quantum world. Energy collapses further and further, to the point of a singularity, which is where matter itself collapses into oneness (a formless One). Singularities are mathematical realities that continue forever unless a zero point is added to stop the infinite regress. And zero means that the cosmos, at the macro and micro levels, is ultimately, nothing. (4)This is all mind-blowing stuff. Seife anchors all of this in the philosophical thinking of the East and West (5). The latter did not have the concept of zero for philosophical reasons and struggled scientifically with its absence. It was only after zero was imported from the East that Western science could incorporate its significance into cosmological discussions. I struggled to follow his various lines of thought in this regard. On the whole, though, the book is a philosophical inspiration. As Seife has it, zero-nothing unites philosophy and physics. Cosmic energy is a fixed amount (the conservation of energy, which is also an eternal notion). But that amount changes form and moves perpetually from high to low and from low to high, seeking its equilibrium – a point which is, and can only be, temporary, because energy changes forms and creates differences that in turn creates disequilibrium anew. It’s the Tao. It’s yang and yin. And it’s the three scenarios about the ultimate fate of the cosmos. (1) Zero also works at the opposite end of gravitational force as well. Zero is about a balance of energy. If the energy from the big bang expends itself, gravity pulls cosmic energy back into itself, the zero point (Big Crunch). If energy escapes the zero point, the cosmos expands and continues to the point of heat death, which is another zero point because there’s no energy differential (high to low energy). If cosmic expansion is stopped by gravity, stasis (equilibrium state) is zero as well.(2) Seife doesn’t use this word here but it seems to apply. (3) “A zero in quantum mechanics means that the entire universe – including the vacuum – is filled with an infinite amount of energy: the zero-point energy. This, in turn, leads to the most bizarre zero in the universe: the phantom force of nothing.” (4) Seife quotes Feynman who writes “The problem is, when we try to calculate all the way down to zero distance, the equation blows up in our face and gives us meaningless answers – things like infinity.” String theory is a way out of this dilemma because it sees, Seife writes, “every particle as a vibrating string rather than as a dot…In string theory, zero has been banished from the universe; there is no such thing as zero distance or zero time. This solves all the infinity problems of quantum mechanics.”(5) In the East, “The goal of the Hindu,” Seife writes, “is to free the Atman entirely from the cycle of rebirth, to stop wandering from death to death. The way to achieve the ultimate liberation through lifelessness is to cease paying heed to the illusion of reality. ‘The body, the house of the spirit, is under the power of pleasure and pain,’ explains a god. ‘And if a man is ruled by his body then this man can never be free.’ But once you are able to separate yourself from the whims of the flesh and embrace the silence and nothingness of your soul, you will be liberated. Your Atman will fly from the web of human desire and join the collective consciousness – the infinite soul that suffuses the universe at once everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It is infinity, and it is nothing. So India, as a society that actively explored the void and the infinite, accepted zero.” In the West, the Greeks “didn’t have the concept of a limit because they didn’t believe in zero.” An infinite series “seemed to get smaller and smaller without any particular end in sight. As a result, the Greeks couldn’t handle the infinite. They pondered the concept of the void but rejected zero as a number, and they toyed with the concept of the infinite but refused to allow infinity – numbers that are infinitely small and infinitely large – anywhere near the realm of numbers.” This resistance was tied up with a religious worldview. The infinite regressed into a bottomless void, without a beginning. That notion conflicted with God as the beginning point of creation and movement in the world. Zero allowed the void, nothing, to exist. That removed God and it was, therefore, atheistic. "

159,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21160019-sudeep,4,"I’m becoming more and more convinced of the power of teaching science and philosophy as a history - The progression of thought is for all to see; Human endeavour and collaboration more clearly visible. Contrast that with how science is usually thought in schools, where it seems like some genius just discovered/invented things in isolation, without any context or need. Students are not even sure why the scientist was working on that problem, and is colossally boring.Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea is presented in a similar vein. I loved the progression of chapters and how the history of science, mathematics and even philosophy was on show here. However, the concept of zero seemed to be forcefully injected and mixed with the major historical points, and that remains my only complaint of the book. If you can tolerate that (and I believe one can), it’s a very rewarding read.Here’s a brief history of Zero:* Initially mathematics was closely linked to practicality (counting sheep for example), and there was no need for the number zero in practical matters. Although the Egyptians and the Greeks progressed significantly in geometry, there was no use for the number zero in measuring dimensions of geometric objects. So, zero remained outside of mathematics.* The Greeks abhorred the concept of void and infinite. They were stumped with the paradox of Zeno. (The author even goes on to say not accepting zero was the “only thing that kept the Greeks from discovering calculus” - seems like a stretch for me).* Once the Roman empire fell, the dark ages started. The medieval scholars rather than looking at their peers for ideas, turned to the Greeks - Aristotle and Neoplatonists. Apart from other philosophical ideas (like the glorification of idealism), they inherited their fear for zero and infinity.Zero was still not on the numeric scale, and explains why we get a “jump” from 1 BC to 1 AD.* Zero goes East: After being rejected by the West for years, zero finally reached India (via Alexander’s invasion). The Indian mathematicians readily accepted the Babylonian numeral system (which had no special standalone symbol for zero, but zero was still used to distinguish 1 from 10 from 100 etc.)Aryabhatta is said to have positioned zero on the numeral system, from which our present day base-10 numeral system is derived.* Islamic invasion of India: Islam would take zero from India - and it was readily adopted in Italy, thanks to a one famous mathematician Fibonacci. Italian merchants were quick to seize upon the new numeral system (Arabic numbers), which allowed them to get rid of counting boards and make things simpler. Florence banned the Arabic numerals, but it was not so easy to dispense with; The Italian merchants continued using it, and the government had to relent in the face of commercial pressure.* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: Vanishing pointsThe Italian architect, Filippo, created a realistic painting using a vanishing point. A vanishing point is essentially a single dot, a zero, which contains the rest of the universe.* Introductions of zero in art and science: Cartesian coordinate systemRene Descartes introduces his Cartesian coordinate system, which is the first systematic link between Euclidean geometry and algebra. The points for a particular curve on such a system are the “zeros” for a particular equation: (x,y) for which f(x,y) = 0* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: VacuumVacuum has been a point of debate since Greeks. But Evangelista Torricelli is the first to study it empirically. He created the first laboratory vacuum - the torricellian vacuum, by filling a long glass tube filled to one end by mercury, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury.Pascal proves that it wasn’t nature’s abhorrence of vacuum that pushes the mercury up the tube, but rather atmospheric pressure. Vacuums don’t suck, atmosphere pushes. Pascal’s simple experiment demolished Aristotle’s assertion that nature abhors the vacuum. * Infidel Mathematics : The useful infinitesimalsInfinitesimals (extremely small numbers) starts making its way into mathematics. Kepler, in his attempt to calculate the volume of a crudely shaped wine barrel, chopped up the barrels - in his mind--into an infinite number of infinitely small pieces, and then added them back together to get the volume.Mathematicians use this infinitesimals to solve the problem of tangents - a line that just kisses a curve. It had important implications in studying motion - for example, you are swinging a ball tied to a thread above your head, if you cut off the string abruptly, the ball flies off into a tangent. Building on the idea of infinitesimals, Newton and Leibniz discover/invent calculus. The mathematicians are still grappling with the logical and philosophical problems of infinitesimals, but because of its accuracy and practical purpose, they accept it.It was finally with L’Hospital’s rule that trouble of 0/0, which plagued calculus could be resolved (though partially). The key was to make the infinitesimals carefully “tend towards zero”. Clever manipulations allowed one to resolve other odd expressions like ∞/∞, 00 and ∞0.It was finally with d’Alembert’s idea of limits that solved caculus’s problem with zeroes. He also resolved the Zeno’s paradox by boiling it down to a a sum of infinite number of ever-diminishing quantities. * Two sides of the same coin: IntroductionAlgebraic equations have roots - points where the value of the equation equals 0. Descartes refused to accept negative numbers as roots of an equation, calling them false roots. He also never extended his coordinate system beyond zero. He was even more disgusted by square roots of negative numbers, giving them a scornful name - imaginary numbers.Two developments here bridge the gap between zero and inifinity - projective geometry and the complex plane.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Projective geometryJean-Victor Poncelet was a mathematician in the Napoleon’s army, and was captured by Russia. In prison he found a new discipline: projective geometry. His work was the culmination of the work done by artists like Filippo and Da Vinci - learning to project 3d images on 2d planes, making use of, among other things, the vanishing point.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: The Complex PlaneGauss, an 18th century Mathematics prodigy was able to map out complex numbers on cartesian plane (which is called complex plane) - the vertical axis represents the imaginary numbers, while the horizontal axis represents real number. He also figured that operations like multiplication, addition etc. have geometric implications in the complex plane. For instance, multiplying a point by i, causes it turn anti-clockwise by 90 degrees. This was the second big advance.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Reimann SphereRiemann, a student of Gauss, married the ideas of projective geometry and complex plane and “…all of a sudden lines became circles, circles become lines, and zero and infinity became the poles on a globe full of numbers.” Gauss figures out that all infinities are not the same - the infinity of real numbers (uncountable infinity) is much greater than the infinity of rational numbers (countable infinity).* Zero (and infinity) in Physics (I'll rush on this)From here on the rest of the book talks about occurrences of zero (or infinity) in physics - zero kelvin (minimum possible temperature), or black holes, the Casimir effect (forces applied by a vacuum), string theory, the big bang, and the fate of the universe (via heat death)."

Following this model, students could use the ""My____History"" (Gallagher 79) or the '""You Should Know"" (Gallagher 88) Biographical Paper' strategies. Students could write their own stories, detailing where they came from, how they have impacted others in their lives, and the impact they are currently having. Or, students could choose a person or perhaps a topic (such as zero) to practice writing a history of how that topic came into being, again how others have reacted to it or been impacted by it, and how its existence is affecting the world today.Pairing this text with the above strategies would not only allow students to learn new information about the technology they are immersed in, but would also allow them to reflect on and write about their own sense of identities."

The book is a thoroughly researched and well written historical account of the history of zero, but more broadly the history of mathematics. We take zero for granted, but for most of human history we were unaware of its existence, and until only recently we denied its existence. Zero has many unusual properties and became the key to unlocking complicated mathematics like calculus and physics and indeed our understanding of the earth and the heavens. The first half was most interesting.So why did I give up? The book becomes intensely technical about halfway through, to a degree that only mathematicians can truly appreciate. It couldn’t hold my interest. I recommend this book for true math nerds. For casual math nerds, I instead recommend Jordan Ellenberg’s _How Not to be Wrong_, which Bill Gates describes as “a love letter to math.”"

The first part of the book nicely brings about how the number zero moved from east to west and the impact of the idea on western philosophy and mathematics. Seife then explains how integration and differentiation solve tricky problems where zero is involved to make sense out of equations. The final third of the book is about singularities and the big bang - zero from a cosmological perspective. Good book, and I'd have give it 4 stars, but I docked one star because of a couple of things - Seife's breathless commentary: ""zero holds the secret to our existance"", ""the ultimate fate of the cosmos lies in zero"" and Seife's insistence to treat the vacuum and the void as regions of zero activity despite (as he also later writes) the abundance of virtual particles (meaning it's clearly non-zero). Seife also, in the first part of the book, stand on a pedestal to sniffily chastise the Aristotelian view of the universe without showing enough sympathy to the fact that they (the Aristotelians) were products of their time. Perhaps Seife should realise that he's not on a pedestal, but on the shoulders of giants."

I read a lot of that genre in high school, for whatever strange reason, so I am reasonably familiar with it. In the years since high school, I have moved on from being a pop scientist to a pop historian, and I think for that reason I preferred the historical half of this book, as opposed to the latter half, which is a whistle-stop tour of the most complex mathematical and physics advances of the twentieth-century. Seife pulled off this second half just fine, considering these topics are basically impossible to explain in any intuitive or comprehensible way to the armchair physicists like me."
165,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96062163-alan-kolok,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The association between infinity and zero is something that I hadn't thought about prior to reading it. It also does a great job of explaining things like black holes and absolute zero temperature. The book seems, though, to switch about two thirds through, at first the book is a delightful romp in which zero is a character, a funny little imp that historically was either ignored or minimized. However once zero is introduced and history catches up with the 20th century, zero puts its big-boy pants on and gets down to business in modern physics. Some of the physics at the end of the book was a bit beyond me, but I liked the books premise that zero and its pal infinity are not just useful constructs but are necessary, and indeed absolutely essential, to our understand of the universe. The book makes you think. High praise indeed. Zero (the book) is not for everyone but if you enjoy thinking about the scientific/mathematical enterprise and how it has developed over time, I would recommend it."

174,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5986736-ashwini-nocaste,4,"Thanks to the mathematics of zero and infinity, Pascal concluded that one should assume that God exists – from Zero : The Biography of a Dangerous IdeaGod’s Debris – by Scott Adams is an interesting novella that tries to in a way put out a belief model where the universe and its constituents are explained as “God’s Debris” – the primordial sea of pre-big bang existence that got sprinkled into living existence as we perceive it today. No one knows or can easily surmise as to what exactly happened one second before the big bang took place. In the book “Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea” – author Charles Seife attempts to explain the suffusion of the idea of zero throughout our existence and hints at the possibility of zero being at the beginning as well as at the end of our existence.If one accepts the universe as a sprinkling of God’s Dust formed out of the primordial sea that existed pre-big bang (which in Charles Seife’s view is nothing but something as close to what Zero signifies), then it can be taken as granted that all forms in perceivable existence today are representations of constituents which when trussed together will be an exact replica of the pre-big bang primordial sea. But as Charles Seife indicates that zero must have existed before and at the beginning of big bang – it leads me to a hypothetical assumption that the sum total of the entire universe must be equal to what Zero signifies – an idea which takes into account the anti-matter argument posed by Stephen Hawkings in “A Brief History of Time” – where the positive matter resulted in the observable universe and the negative matter – i.e., anti-matter exists as non-existence, a concept not easily graspable by our faculties.Any number divided by Zero can result in infinity. As an example, suppose a packet of 50 toffies is to be distributed. If it is to be distributed to 25 people, then the number 50 is to be divided by 25 to result in 2 toffies in the hands of each individual. But if 0 toffies were to be distributed, then one can go on distributing 50 toffies to as many people as possible (of course in this case, no one will get anything in their hands). Thus a number divided by zero tends to infinity. But Zero is also a number – so can it be argued that 0/0 is equal to infinity? An absurd conclusion of course – because it seems that nothing divided by nothing results in everything : an absurd conclusion – but something which is very close to the nature of existence as we understand it today. We know that the universe is expanding and the discovery of that fact by Hubble led one to the conclusion that the universe was once closely packed into a primordial soup – but what could have caused the explosion and whether the universe will infinitely expand or will there be a limit? An external source of energy or force acting on the primordial soup? Well it would be naïve to argue that propulsion of the primordial soup into an expanding universe is owed to the agency of an external force – since that is a physical law steeped in our earthly surroundings – and which might not have existed in operation at all during pre-big bang. So does that imply, the initiative must have come from within? If the initiative had come from within, then why at that point of time only – and why it all had to come about in the first place? It could have continued as a dense primordial soup?Could Zero be God? An exact assimilation of the sum-total consciousness in the pre-big bang arrangement but which has got scattered round the universe and now exists as a harmless looking Zero? This concept is not new and thinkers of lore have attempted to discover God in the concept of Zero. In my opinion, offered merely as a thought and not as firm conviction, what Zero signified in the pre-big bang set-up lost its power and energy as it suffused out across the length and breadth of the universe-so much so that it now became worthy of only a concept that exists as a human thought – which leads one to the natural question – whether zero as a concept, not as a numerical entity, but as a thought representing the void – also graspable by animals?Another interesting thought that can there be is – What value to give to Zero? Should it signify a void – a nothingness? Has Zero been devised to signify a void only because our perceptions of existence imply “not nothingness”. What if the pre-big bang moment is not the Zeroth hour but just another point among several points as denoted by numbers on a numberline? As a personal belief, it is difficult for me to grasp that there was a big bang – but I do not shy away from believing in the possibility of an inter-dimensional change from a certain dimension to the other. As to whether the Universe is infinite or finite, the riddle lies in the resolution of the concept of Time; but Time as we have been thoroughly ingrained to accept is the Solar notion of time based on earth’s rotation/revolution around the Sun. Time as it really exists devoid of a reference point is a difficult concept for me to conjure."

They are equal and opposite, yin and yang. They are equally paradoxical and troubling. The biggest questions in science and religion are about nothingness and eternity, the void and the infinite, zero and infinity.ZERO: POWERFUL ENOUGH TO STOP A WARSHIP- Zero hit the USS Yorktown like a torpedo. On September 21, 1997, while cruising off the coast of Virginia, the billion-dollar missile cruiser shuddered to a halt.- The Yorktown’s computers had just received new software that was controlling the engines. Unfortunately, nobody had spotted the time bomb lurking in the code, a zero that engineers were supposed to remove while installing the software.- When the Yorktown’s computer system tried to divide by zero, 80,000 horsepower instantly became worthless.LEARNING TO COUNT- In the very beginning of mathematics, it seems that people could only distinguish between one and many.- Over time, primitive languages evolved to distinguish between one, two, and many, and eventually one, two, three, many, but didn’t have terms for higher numbers.TALLYING UP LARGER GROUPS OF NUMBERS- The early Greeks, for instance, used the word “fiving” to describe the process of tallying.- In English, eleven and twelve seem to be derived from “one over [ten]” and “two over [ten],” while thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and so on are contractions of “three and ten,” “four and ten,” and “five and ten.”GEOMETRY CREATED BECAUSE THE NILE FLOODED- The bad news was that the river destroyed many of the boundary markers, erasing all of the landmarks that told farmers which land was theirs to cultivate. (The Egyptians took property rights very seriously.- The ancient pharaohs assigned surveyors to assess the damage and reset the boundary markers, and thus geometry was born.- Egyptians were of a practical bent. They never progressed beyond measuring volumes and counting days and hours. Mathematics wasn’t used for anything impractical, except their system of astrology.FROM THE EGYPTIANS TO THE GREEKS- The Greeks were different; they embraced the abstract and the philosophical, and brought mathematics to its highest point in ancient times.- Instead of using pictures to represent numbers as the Egyptians did, the Greeks used letters.ZERO ENTERS THE EQUATION- Babylonian style of counting. And thanks to this system, zero finally appeared in the East, in the Fertile Crescent of present-day Iraq.ZERO STARTS OUT AS MERELY A PLACEHOLDER- Zero was born out of the need to give any given sequence of Babylonian digits a unique, permanent meaning.- Though zero was useful, it was only a placeholder. It was merely a symbol for a blank place in the abacus, a column where all the stones were at the bottom. It did little more than make sure digits fell in the right places; it didn’t really have a numerical value of its own.- Zero was a digit, not a number. It had no value.MANY WESTERNERS FOUND ZERO (AND INFINITY) TO BE SCARY- It is hard to imagine being afraid of a number. Yet zero was inexorably linked with the void—with nothing. There was a primal fear of void and chaos. There was also a fear of zero. Most ancient peoples believed that only emptiness and chaos were present before the universe came to be.- Multiplying by zero collapses the number line. But dividing by zero destroys the entire framework of mathematics.- The Greek universe, created by Pythagoras, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, survived long after the collapse of Greek civilization. In that universe there is no such thing as nothing. There is no zero. Because of this, the West could not accept zero for nearly two millennia.- This is the biggest failure in Greek mathematics, and it is the only thing that kept them from discovering calculus.- Aristotle just wished infinity away by stating that it is simply a construct of the human mind.INDIA- Hinduism was steeped in the symbolism of duality.- Indian mathematicians did more than simply accept zero. They transformed it, changing its role from mere placeholder to number. This reincarnation was what gave zero its power.- Our numbers evolved from the symbols that the Indians used; by rights they should be called Indian numerals rather than Arabic ones- Instead, they saw the interplay of numerals—numbers stripped of their geometric significance. This was the birth of what we now know as algebra.- Once numbers shed their geometric significance, mathematicians no longer had to worry about mathematical operations making geometric sense...You can’t remove a three-acre swath from a two-acre field, but nothing prevents you from subtracting three from two. Nowadays we recognize that 2 – 3=–1: negative one.ZERO BECOMES A NUMBER AND NO LONGER JUST A PLACE HOLDER- Just as 2 – 3 was now a number, so was 2 – 2. It was zero. Not just a mere placeholder zero that represents an empty space on the abacus, but zero the number.MUSLIMS LEARN FROM INDIA- Along the way to China, the Muslims conquered India. And there the Arabs learned about Indian numerals.- one of its first scholars was the mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi. Al-Khowarizmi wrote several important books, like Al-jabr wa’l muqabala, a treatise on how to solve elementary equations; the Al-jabr in the title (which means something like “completion”) gave us the term algebra.- algorithms, the tricks for multiplying and dividing Hindu numerals quickly...the word algorithm was a corruption of al-Khowarizmi’s name.MANY IN THE WEST STILL RELUCTANT TO ADOPT ZERO- In 1299, Florence banned Arabic numerals...Italian merchants continued to use them, and even used them to send encrypted messages—which is how the word cipher came to mean “secret code.”ZERO ENTERS INTO WESTERN ART- It was an Italian architect, Filippo Brunelleschi, who first demonstrated the power of an infinite zero: he created a realistic painting by using a vanishing point.- A point is a zero-dimensional object...This zero-dimensional object, the vanishing point, is an infinitesimal dot on the canvas that represents a spot infinitely far away from the viewer- It is no coincidence that zero and infinity are linked in the vanishing point. Just as multiplying by zero causes the number line to collapse into a point, the vanishing point has caused most of the universe to sit in a tiny dot. This is a singularity, a concept that became very important later in the history of science—ZERO AND COORDINATES- “I am in a sense something intermediate between God and nought.” —RENÉ DESCARTES, DISCOURSE ON METHOD- Descartes was a mathematician-philosopher; perhaps his most lasting legacy was a mathematical invention—what we now call Cartesian coordinates.- Descartes realized that he could not start his two reference lines, or axes, with the number 1.- Descartes quickly realized how powerful his coordinate system was. He used it to turn figures and shapes into equations and numbers; with Cartesian coordinates every geometric object—squares, triangles, wavy lines—could be represented by an equation, a mathematical relationship.- No longer were the Western art of geometry and the Eastern art of algebra separate domains.INFINITY- This is the definition of the infinite: it is something that can stay the same size even when you subtract from it.ZERO- Zero is behind all of the big puzzles in physics. The infinite density of the black hole is a division by zero. The big bang creation from the void is a division by zero. The infinite energy of the vacuum is a division by zero. Yet dividing by zero destroys the fabric of mathematics and the framework of logic—and threatens to undermine the very basis of science.- All that scientists know is the cosmos was spawned from nothing, and will return to the nothing from whence it came. The universe begins and ends with zero.PHYSICS- [Note: The second half of the book deals with how zero and infinity correspond to physics topics such as black holes, string theory, etc. Although interesting, I chose not to share too many excerpts.]*** *** *** *** ***HAHA- The Reformation was begun by Martin Luther while he was on the toilet (he suffered from chronic constipation): https://www.smh.com.au/world/toilet-w...- Estimated temperatures of heaven and hell (based on physics): http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/...FACTOIDS- 10,000—the myriad, the biggest grouping in the Greek system.- The Babylonians, like many different cultures, had invented machines that helped them count. The most famous was the abacus...The words calculate, calculus, and calcium all come from the Latin word for pebble: calculus.- In modern schools, children learn of Pythagoras for his famed theorem: the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. However, this was in fact ancient news. It was known more than 1,000 years before Pythagoras’s time.- stadium (the standard Greek unit of long distance)- (Our word noon comes from the word nones, the midday prayer service of medieval clergy.)- The Indian name for zero was sunya, meaning “empty,” which the Arabs turned into sifr. When some Western scholars described the new number to their colleagues, they turned sifr into a Latin-sounding word, yielding zephirus, which is the root of our word zero. Other Western mathematicians didn’t change the word so heavily and called zero cifra, which became cipher. Zero was so important to the new set of numbers that people started calling all numbers ciphers, which gave the French their term chiffre, digit.- The Germans called the counting board a Rechenbank, which is why we call moneylenders banks.- Not only did they use counting boards, they used tally sticks to record loans: a money value was written along the stick’s side, and it was split in two. The lender kept the biggest piece, the stock. After all, he was the stockholder.- Descartes thought that these numbers were even worse than negative numbers; he came up with a scornful name for the square roots of negatives: imaginary numbers.

Unfortunately, Zero is a little TOO pop-math - it hits on the same ""interesting"" math and physics tidbits that so many other pop-math and science books do. And while it relates all of its ideas to zero, it's not really about zero.The first half does talk about the historical context of the concept of zero, but it is mostly about philosophy - how the concepts of zero and infinity affected science and religion of the time. Just when I was hoping for some math, the book switches to a by-discipline survery of, again, math and phyiscs all-star fun factoids, including Fibonacci sequences, the golden ratio, set theory, numbers larger than infinity, wormholes, etc., etc. There were some ideas in there I had not read about before, like projective geometry, but for the most part, Hawking, Bryson, and popular math authors have covered this.So, for me, it was rehash. If you have not read much pop-math, this book is very interesting, although it definitely requires a late-high school understanding of algebra and physics to make sense.

We had 1000s of years without. Look around there is nothing zero, zero was invented for practical reasons. Greeks and many others hated it but mathematically they had a problem with long numbers. Zero is a dangerous idea, got converted to philosophy and find a way to enter also theology. The biography is rather complete with parts that are difficult mathematics but covers rather okish the part of philosophy and religion. Life is never zero so start searching what philosophies and policies are linked to maths and you will realize that everything is math, just avoid zero-sum games. Nihilism anyone? "

184,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"This book has a great title. It’s one word, loaded with the essence of the cosmos. That essence lies within gravity, the force that governs the large agglomerations of matter and energy.Gravity pulls energy and matter into itself, to a point, a singularity, seen in black holes and in the pre-Big Bang moment. The logic of gravitational force takes this collapse of everything into one point where, mathematically, the increased density continues into infinity. The sole break to this “bottomless” conclusion is through the mathematical addition of zero. Zero is nothing (i.e., nothing that can be further subdivided). (1)Zero works at the smallest of the small as well. This is the quantum world where particles and sub-particles break down into formless energy, which is a “singularity” of a different sort. (2) The “many” particles and sub-particles lose identity and morph into some yet-to-be-identified “oneness,”collapsing to a point, which is a “zero” point, beyond which there is or can be nothing more. (3)Then Seife unites gravity and the quantum world. Energy collapses further and further, to the point of a singularity, which is where matter itself collapses into oneness (a formless One). Singularities are mathematical realities that continue forever unless a zero point is added to stop the infinite regress. And zero means that the cosmos, at the macro and micro levels, is ultimately, nothing. (4)This is all mind-blowing stuff. Seife anchors all of this in the philosophical thinking of the East and West (5). The latter did not have the concept of zero for philosophical reasons and struggled scientifically with its absence. It was only after zero was imported from the East that Western science could incorporate its significance into cosmological discussions. I struggled to follow his various lines of thought in this regard. On the whole, though, the book is a philosophical inspiration. As Seife has it, zero-nothing unites philosophy and physics. Cosmic energy is a fixed amount (the conservation of energy, which is also an eternal notion). But that amount changes form and moves perpetually from high to low and from low to high, seeking its equilibrium – a point which is, and can only be, temporary, because energy changes forms and creates differences that in turn creates disequilibrium anew. It’s the Tao. It’s yang and yin. And it’s the three scenarios about the ultimate fate of the cosmos. (1) Zero also works at the opposite end of gravitational force as well. Zero is about a balance of energy. If the energy from the big bang expends itself, gravity pulls cosmic energy back into itself, the zero point (Big Crunch). If energy escapes the zero point, the cosmos expands and continues to the point of heat death, which is another zero point because there’s no energy differential (high to low energy). If cosmic expansion is stopped by gravity, stasis (equilibrium state) is zero as well.(2) Seife doesn’t use this word here but it seems to apply. (3) “A zero in quantum mechanics means that the entire universe – including the vacuum – is filled with an infinite amount of energy: the zero-point energy. This, in turn, leads to the most bizarre zero in the universe: the phantom force of nothing.” (4) Seife quotes Feynman who writes “The problem is, when we try to calculate all the way down to zero distance, the equation blows up in our face and gives us meaningless answers – things like infinity.” String theory is a way out of this dilemma because it sees, Seife writes, “every particle as a vibrating string rather than as a dot…In string theory, zero has been banished from the universe; there is no such thing as zero distance or zero time. This solves all the infinity problems of quantum mechanics.”(5) In the East, “The goal of the Hindu,” Seife writes, “is to free the Atman entirely from the cycle of rebirth, to stop wandering from death to death. The way to achieve the ultimate liberation through lifelessness is to cease paying heed to the illusion of reality. ‘The body, the house of the spirit, is under the power of pleasure and pain,’ explains a god. ‘And if a man is ruled by his body then this man can never be free.’ But once you are able to separate yourself from the whims of the flesh and embrace the silence and nothingness of your soul, you will be liberated. Your Atman will fly from the web of human desire and join the collective consciousness – the infinite soul that suffuses the universe at once everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It is infinity, and it is nothing. So India, as a society that actively explored the void and the infinite, accepted zero.” In the West, the Greeks “didn’t have the concept of a limit because they didn’t believe in zero.” An infinite series “seemed to get smaller and smaller without any particular end in sight. As a result, the Greeks couldn’t handle the infinite. They pondered the concept of the void but rejected zero as a number, and they toyed with the concept of the infinite but refused to allow infinity – numbers that are infinitely small and infinitely large – anywhere near the realm of numbers.” This resistance was tied up with a religious worldview. The infinite regressed into a bottomless void, without a beginning. That notion conflicted with God as the beginning point of creation and movement in the world. Zero allowed the void, nothing, to exist. That removed God and it was, therefore, atheistic. "

189,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21160019-sudeep,4,"I’m becoming more and more convinced of the power of teaching science and philosophy as a history - The progression of thought is for all to see; Human endeavour and collaboration more clearly visible. Contrast that with how science is usually thought in schools, where it seems like some genius just discovered/invented things in isolation, without any context or need. Students are not even sure why the scientist was working on that problem, and is colossally boring.Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea is presented in a similar vein. I loved the progression of chapters and how the history of science, mathematics and even philosophy was on show here. However, the concept of zero seemed to be forcefully injected and mixed with the major historical points, and that remains my only complaint of the book. If you can tolerate that (and I believe one can), it’s a very rewarding read.Here’s a brief history of Zero:* Initially mathematics was closely linked to practicality (counting sheep for example), and there was no need for the number zero in practical matters. Although the Egyptians and the Greeks progressed significantly in geometry, there was no use for the number zero in measuring dimensions of geometric objects. So, zero remained outside of mathematics.* The Greeks abhorred the concept of void and infinite. They were stumped with the paradox of Zeno. (The author even goes on to say not accepting zero was the “only thing that kept the Greeks from discovering calculus” - seems like a stretch for me).* Once the Roman empire fell, the dark ages started. The medieval scholars rather than looking at their peers for ideas, turned to the Greeks - Aristotle and Neoplatonists. Apart from other philosophical ideas (like the glorification of idealism), they inherited their fear for zero and infinity.Zero was still not on the numeric scale, and explains why we get a “jump” from 1 BC to 1 AD.* Zero goes East: After being rejected by the West for years, zero finally reached India (via Alexander’s invasion). The Indian mathematicians readily accepted the Babylonian numeral system (which had no special standalone symbol for zero, but zero was still used to distinguish 1 from 10 from 100 etc.)Aryabhatta is said to have positioned zero on the numeral system, from which our present day base-10 numeral system is derived.* Islamic invasion of India: Islam would take zero from India - and it was readily adopted in Italy, thanks to a one famous mathematician Fibonacci. Italian merchants were quick to seize upon the new numeral system (Arabic numbers), which allowed them to get rid of counting boards and make things simpler. Florence banned the Arabic numerals, but it was not so easy to dispense with; The Italian merchants continued using it, and the government had to relent in the face of commercial pressure.* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: Vanishing pointsThe Italian architect, Filippo, created a realistic painting using a vanishing point. A vanishing point is essentially a single dot, a zero, which contains the rest of the universe.* Introductions of zero in art and science: Cartesian coordinate systemRene Descartes introduces his Cartesian coordinate system, which is the first systematic link between Euclidean geometry and algebra. The points for a particular curve on such a system are the “zeros” for a particular equation: (x,y) for which f(x,y) = 0* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: VacuumVacuum has been a point of debate since Greeks. But Evangelista Torricelli is the first to study it empirically. He created the first laboratory vacuum - the torricellian vacuum, by filling a long glass tube filled to one end by mercury, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury.Pascal proves that it wasn’t nature’s abhorrence of vacuum that pushes the mercury up the tube, but rather atmospheric pressure. Vacuums don’t suck, atmosphere pushes. Pascal’s simple experiment demolished Aristotle’s assertion that nature abhors the vacuum. * Infidel Mathematics : The useful infinitesimalsInfinitesimals (extremely small numbers) starts making its way into mathematics. Kepler, in his attempt to calculate the volume of a crudely shaped wine barrel, chopped up the barrels - in his mind--into an infinite number of infinitely small pieces, and then added them back together to get the volume.Mathematicians use this infinitesimals to solve the problem of tangents - a line that just kisses a curve. It had important implications in studying motion - for example, you are swinging a ball tied to a thread above your head, if you cut off the string abruptly, the ball flies off into a tangent. Building on the idea of infinitesimals, Newton and Leibniz discover/invent calculus. The mathematicians are still grappling with the logical and philosophical problems of infinitesimals, but because of its accuracy and practical purpose, they accept it.It was finally with L’Hospital’s rule that trouble of 0/0, which plagued calculus could be resolved (though partially). The key was to make the infinitesimals carefully “tend towards zero”. Clever manipulations allowed one to resolve other odd expressions like ∞/∞, 00 and ∞0.It was finally with d’Alembert’s idea of limits that solved caculus’s problem with zeroes. He also resolved the Zeno’s paradox by boiling it down to a a sum of infinite number of ever-diminishing quantities. * Two sides of the same coin: IntroductionAlgebraic equations have roots - points where the value of the equation equals 0. Descartes refused to accept negative numbers as roots of an equation, calling them false roots. He also never extended his coordinate system beyond zero. He was even more disgusted by square roots of negative numbers, giving them a scornful name - imaginary numbers.Two developments here bridge the gap between zero and inifinity - projective geometry and the complex plane.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Projective geometryJean-Victor Poncelet was a mathematician in the Napoleon’s army, and was captured by Russia. In prison he found a new discipline: projective geometry. His work was the culmination of the work done by artists like Filippo and Da Vinci - learning to project 3d images on 2d planes, making use of, among other things, the vanishing point.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: The Complex PlaneGauss, an 18th century Mathematics prodigy was able to map out complex numbers on cartesian plane (which is called complex plane) - the vertical axis represents the imaginary numbers, while the horizontal axis represents real number. He also figured that operations like multiplication, addition etc. have geometric implications in the complex plane. For instance, multiplying a point by i, causes it turn anti-clockwise by 90 degrees. This was the second big advance.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Reimann SphereRiemann, a student of Gauss, married the ideas of projective geometry and complex plane and “…all of a sudden lines became circles, circles become lines, and zero and infinity became the poles on a globe full of numbers.” Gauss figures out that all infinities are not the same - the infinity of real numbers (uncountable infinity) is much greater than the infinity of rational numbers (countable infinity).* Zero (and infinity) in Physics (I'll rush on this)From here on the rest of the book talks about occurrences of zero (or infinity) in physics - zero kelvin (minimum possible temperature), or black holes, the Casimir effect (forces applied by a vacuum), string theory, the big bang, and the fate of the universe (via heat death)."

Following this model, students could use the ""My____History"" (Gallagher 79) or the '""You Should Know"" (Gallagher 88) Biographical Paper' strategies. Students could write their own stories, detailing where they came from, how they have impacted others in their lives, and the impact they are currently having. Or, students could choose a person or perhaps a topic (such as zero) to practice writing a history of how that topic came into being, again how others have reacted to it or been impacted by it, and how its existence is affecting the world today.Pairing this text with the above strategies would not only allow students to learn new information about the technology they are immersed in, but would also allow them to reflect on and write about their own sense of identities."
191,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63312978-ben-jackson,2,"For full transparency, I read about 3/4 of this book and put it down. The book is a thoroughly researched and well written historical account of the history of zero, but more broadly the history of mathematics. We take zero for granted, but for most of human history we were unaware of its existence, and until only recently we denied its existence. Zero has many unusual properties and became the key to unlocking complicated mathematics like calculus and physics and indeed our understanding of the earth and the heavens. The first half was most interesting.So why did I give up? The book becomes intensely technical about halfway through, to a degree that only mathematicians can truly appreciate. It couldn’t hold my interest. I recommend this book for true math nerds. For casual math nerds, I instead recommend Jordan Ellenberg’s _How Not to be Wrong_, which Bill Gates describes as “a love letter to math.”"
192,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54161476-alexander-thomas,3,"I enjoyed the book and got through it fairly quickly. The first part of the book nicely brings about how the number zero moved from east to west and the impact of the idea on western philosophy and mathematics. Seife then explains how integration and differentiation solve tricky problems where zero is involved to make sense out of equations. The final third of the book is about singularities and the big bang - zero from a cosmological perspective. Good book, and I'd have give it 4 stars, but I docked one star because of a couple of things - Seife's breathless commentary: ""zero holds the secret to our existance"", ""the ultimate fate of the cosmos lies in zero"" and Seife's insistence to treat the vacuum and the void as regions of zero activity despite (as he also later writes) the abundance of virtual particles (meaning it's clearly non-zero). Seife also, in the first part of the book, stand on a pedestal to sniffily chastise the Aristotelian view of the universe without showing enough sympathy to the fact that they (the Aristotelians) were products of their time. Perhaps Seife should realise that he's not on a pedestal, but on the shoulders of giants."

194,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10903318-mitch-rogers,3,"As far as the genre of pre-chewed, popular books on hard science goes, this one is alright. I read a lot of that genre in high school, for whatever strange reason, so I am reasonably familiar with it. In the years since high school, I have moved on from being a pop scientist to a pop historian, and I think for that reason I preferred the historical half of this book, as opposed to the latter half, which is a whistle-stop tour of the most complex mathematical and physics advances of the twentieth-century. Seife pulled off this second half just fine, considering these topics are basically impossible to explain in any intuitive or comprehensible way to the armchair physicists like me."
195,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96062163-alan-kolok,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The association between infinity and zero is something that I hadn't thought about prior to reading it. It also does a great job of explaining things like black holes and absolute zero temperature. The book seems, though, to switch about two thirds through, at first the book is a delightful romp in which zero is a character, a funny little imp that historically was either ignored or minimized. However once zero is introduced and history catches up with the 20th century, zero puts its big-boy pants on and gets down to business in modern physics. Some of the physics at the end of the book was a bit beyond me, but I liked the books premise that zero and its pal infinity are not just useful constructs but are necessary, and indeed absolutely essential, to our understand of the universe. The book makes you think. High praise indeed. Zero (the book) is not for everyone but if you enjoy thinking about the scientific/mathematical enterprise and how it has developed over time, I would recommend it."

204,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5986736-ashwini-nocaste,4,"Thanks to the mathematics of zero and infinity, Pascal concluded that one should assume that God exists – from Zero : The Biography of a Dangerous IdeaGod’s Debris – by Scott Adams is an interesting novella that tries to in a way put out a belief model where the universe and its constituents are explained as “God’s Debris” – the primordial sea of pre-big bang existence that got sprinkled into living existence as we perceive it today. No one knows or can easily surmise as to what exactly happened one second before the big bang took place. In the book “Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea” – author Charles Seife attempts to explain the suffusion of the idea of zero throughout our existence and hints at the possibility of zero being at the beginning as well as at the end of our existence.If one accepts the universe as a sprinkling of God’s Dust formed out of the primordial sea that existed pre-big bang (which in Charles Seife’s view is nothing but something as close to what Zero signifies), then it can be taken as granted that all forms in perceivable existence today are representations of constituents which when trussed together will be an exact replica of the pre-big bang primordial sea. But as Charles Seife indicates that zero must have existed before and at the beginning of big bang – it leads me to a hypothetical assumption that the sum total of the entire universe must be equal to what Zero signifies – an idea which takes into account the anti-matter argument posed by Stephen Hawkings in “A Brief History of Time” – where the positive matter resulted in the observable universe and the negative matter – i.e., anti-matter exists as non-existence, a concept not easily graspable by our faculties.Any number divided by Zero can result in infinity. As an example, suppose a packet of 50 toffies is to be distributed. If it is to be distributed to 25 people, then the number 50 is to be divided by 25 to result in 2 toffies in the hands of each individual. But if 0 toffies were to be distributed, then one can go on distributing 50 toffies to as many people as possible (of course in this case, no one will get anything in their hands). Thus a number divided by zero tends to infinity. But Zero is also a number – so can it be argued that 0/0 is equal to infinity? An absurd conclusion of course – because it seems that nothing divided by nothing results in everything : an absurd conclusion – but something which is very close to the nature of existence as we understand it today. We know that the universe is expanding and the discovery of that fact by Hubble led one to the conclusion that the universe was once closely packed into a primordial soup – but what could have caused the explosion and whether the universe will infinitely expand or will there be a limit? An external source of energy or force acting on the primordial soup? Well it would be naïve to argue that propulsion of the primordial soup into an expanding universe is owed to the agency of an external force – since that is a physical law steeped in our earthly surroundings – and which might not have existed in operation at all during pre-big bang. So does that imply, the initiative must have come from within? If the initiative had come from within, then why at that point of time only – and why it all had to come about in the first place? It could have continued as a dense primordial soup?Could Zero be God? An exact assimilation of the sum-total consciousness in the pre-big bang arrangement but which has got scattered round the universe and now exists as a harmless looking Zero? This concept is not new and thinkers of lore have attempted to discover God in the concept of Zero. In my opinion, offered merely as a thought and not as firm conviction, what Zero signified in the pre-big bang set-up lost its power and energy as it suffused out across the length and breadth of the universe-so much so that it now became worthy of only a concept that exists as a human thought – which leads one to the natural question – whether zero as a concept, not as a numerical entity, but as a thought representing the void – also graspable by animals?Another interesting thought that can there be is – What value to give to Zero? Should it signify a void – a nothingness? Has Zero been devised to signify a void only because our perceptions of existence imply “not nothingness”. What if the pre-big bang moment is not the Zeroth hour but just another point among several points as denoted by numbers on a numberline? As a personal belief, it is difficult for me to grasp that there was a big bang – but I do not shy away from believing in the possibility of an inter-dimensional change from a certain dimension to the other. As to whether the Universe is infinite or finite, the riddle lies in the resolution of the concept of Time; but Time as we have been thoroughly ingrained to accept is the Solar notion of time based on earth’s rotation/revolution around the Sun. Time as it really exists devoid of a reference point is a difficult concept for me to conjure."

They are equal and opposite, yin and yang. They are equally paradoxical and troubling. The biggest questions in science and religion are about nothingness and eternity, the void and the infinite, zero and infinity.ZERO: POWERFUL ENOUGH TO STOP A WARSHIP- Zero hit the USS Yorktown like a torpedo. On September 21, 1997, while cruising off the coast of Virginia, the billion-dollar missile cruiser shuddered to a halt.- The Yorktown’s computers had just received new software that was controlling the engines. Unfortunately, nobody had spotted the time bomb lurking in the code, a zero that engineers were supposed to remove while installing the software.- When the Yorktown’s computer system tried to divide by zero, 80,000 horsepower instantly became worthless.LEARNING TO COUNT- In the very beginning of mathematics, it seems that people could only distinguish between one and many.- Over time, primitive languages evolved to distinguish between one, two, and many, and eventually one, two, three, many, but didn’t have terms for higher numbers.TALLYING UP LARGER GROUPS OF NUMBERS- The early Greeks, for instance, used the word “fiving” to describe the process of tallying.- In English, eleven and twelve seem to be derived from “one over [ten]” and “two over [ten],” while thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and so on are contractions of “three and ten,” “four and ten,” and “five and ten.”GEOMETRY CREATED BECAUSE THE NILE FLOODED- The bad news was that the river destroyed many of the boundary markers, erasing all of the landmarks that told farmers which land was theirs to cultivate. (The Egyptians took property rights very seriously.- The ancient pharaohs assigned surveyors to assess the damage and reset the boundary markers, and thus geometry was born.- Egyptians were of a practical bent. They never progressed beyond measuring volumes and counting days and hours. Mathematics wasn’t used for anything impractical, except their system of astrology.FROM THE EGYPTIANS TO THE GREEKS- The Greeks were different; they embraced the abstract and the philosophical, and brought mathematics to its highest point in ancient times.- Instead of using pictures to represent numbers as the Egyptians did, the Greeks used letters.ZERO ENTERS THE EQUATION- Babylonian style of counting. And thanks to this system, zero finally appeared in the East, in the Fertile Crescent of present-day Iraq.ZERO STARTS OUT AS MERELY A PLACEHOLDER- Zero was born out of the need to give any given sequence of Babylonian digits a unique, permanent meaning.- Though zero was useful, it was only a placeholder. It was merely a symbol for a blank place in the abacus, a column where all the stones were at the bottom. It did little more than make sure digits fell in the right places; it didn’t really have a numerical value of its own.- Zero was a digit, not a number. It had no value.MANY WESTERNERS FOUND ZERO (AND INFINITY) TO BE SCARY- It is hard to imagine being afraid of a number. Yet zero was inexorably linked with the void—with nothing. There was a primal fear of void and chaos. There was also a fear of zero. Most ancient peoples believed that only emptiness and chaos were present before the universe came to be.- Multiplying by zero collapses the number line. But dividing by zero destroys the entire framework of mathematics.- The Greek universe, created by Pythagoras, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, survived long after the collapse of Greek civilization. In that universe there is no such thing as nothing. There is no zero. Because of this, the West could not accept zero for nearly two millennia.- This is the biggest failure in Greek mathematics, and it is the only thing that kept them from discovering calculus.- Aristotle just wished infinity away by stating that it is simply a construct of the human mind.INDIA- Hinduism was steeped in the symbolism of duality.- Indian mathematicians did more than simply accept zero. They transformed it, changing its role from mere placeholder to number. This reincarnation was what gave zero its power.- Our numbers evolved from the symbols that the Indians used; by rights they should be called Indian numerals rather than Arabic ones- Instead, they saw the interplay of numerals—numbers stripped of their geometric significance. This was the birth of what we now know as algebra.- Once numbers shed their geometric significance, mathematicians no longer had to worry about mathematical operations making geometric sense...You can’t remove a three-acre swath from a two-acre field, but nothing prevents you from subtracting three from two. Nowadays we recognize that 2 – 3=–1: negative one.ZERO BECOMES A NUMBER AND NO LONGER JUST A PLACE HOLDER- Just as 2 – 3 was now a number, so was 2 – 2. It was zero. Not just a mere placeholder zero that represents an empty space on the abacus, but zero the number.MUSLIMS LEARN FROM INDIA- Along the way to China, the Muslims conquered India. And there the Arabs learned about Indian numerals.- one of its first scholars was the mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi. Al-Khowarizmi wrote several important books, like Al-jabr wa’l muqabala, a treatise on how to solve elementary equations; the Al-jabr in the title (which means something like “completion”) gave us the term algebra.- algorithms, the tricks for multiplying and dividing Hindu numerals quickly...the word algorithm was a corruption of al-Khowarizmi’s name.MANY IN THE WEST STILL RELUCTANT TO ADOPT ZERO- In 1299, Florence banned Arabic numerals...Italian merchants continued to use them, and even used them to send encrypted messages—which is how the word cipher came to mean “secret code.”ZERO ENTERS INTO WESTERN ART- It was an Italian architect, Filippo Brunelleschi, who first demonstrated the power of an infinite zero: he created a realistic painting by using a vanishing point.- A point is a zero-dimensional object...This zero-dimensional object, the vanishing point, is an infinitesimal dot on the canvas that represents a spot infinitely far away from the viewer- It is no coincidence that zero and infinity are linked in the vanishing point. Just as multiplying by zero causes the number line to collapse into a point, the vanishing point has caused most of the universe to sit in a tiny dot. This is a singularity, a concept that became very important later in the history of science—ZERO AND COORDINATES- “I am in a sense something intermediate between God and nought.” —RENÉ DESCARTES, DISCOURSE ON METHOD- Descartes was a mathematician-philosopher; perhaps his most lasting legacy was a mathematical invention—what we now call Cartesian coordinates.- Descartes realized that he could not start his two reference lines, or axes, with the number 1.- Descartes quickly realized how powerful his coordinate system was. He used it to turn figures and shapes into equations and numbers; with Cartesian coordinates every geometric object—squares, triangles, wavy lines—could be represented by an equation, a mathematical relationship.- No longer were the Western art of geometry and the Eastern art of algebra separate domains.INFINITY- This is the definition of the infinite: it is something that can stay the same size even when you subtract from it.ZERO- Zero is behind all of the big puzzles in physics. The infinite density of the black hole is a division by zero. The big bang creation from the void is a division by zero. The infinite energy of the vacuum is a division by zero. Yet dividing by zero destroys the fabric of mathematics and the framework of logic—and threatens to undermine the very basis of science.- All that scientists know is the cosmos was spawned from nothing, and will return to the nothing from whence it came. The universe begins and ends with zero.PHYSICS- [Note: The second half of the book deals with how zero and infinity correspond to physics topics such as black holes, string theory, etc. Although interesting, I chose not to share too many excerpts.]*** *** *** *** ***HAHA- The Reformation was begun by Martin Luther while he was on the toilet (he suffered from chronic constipation): https://www.smh.com.au/world/toilet-w...- Estimated temperatures of heaven and hell (based on physics): http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/...FACTOIDS- 10,000—the myriad, the biggest grouping in the Greek system.- The Babylonians, like many different cultures, had invented machines that helped them count. The most famous was the abacus...The words calculate, calculus, and calcium all come from the Latin word for pebble: calculus.- In modern schools, children learn of Pythagoras for his famed theorem: the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. However, this was in fact ancient news. It was known more than 1,000 years before Pythagoras’s time.- stadium (the standard Greek unit of long distance)- (Our word noon comes from the word nones, the midday prayer service of medieval clergy.)- The Indian name for zero was sunya, meaning “empty,” which the Arabs turned into sifr. When some Western scholars described the new number to their colleagues, they turned sifr into a Latin-sounding word, yielding zephirus, which is the root of our word zero. Other Western mathematicians didn’t change the word so heavily and called zero cifra, which became cipher. Zero was so important to the new set of numbers that people started calling all numbers ciphers, which gave the French their term chiffre, digit.- The Germans called the counting board a Rechenbank, which is why we call moneylenders banks.- Not only did they use counting boards, they used tally sticks to record loans: a money value was written along the stick’s side, and it was split in two. The lender kept the biggest piece, the stock. After all, he was the stockholder.- Descartes thought that these numbers were even worse than negative numbers; he came up with a scornful name for the square roots of negatives: imaginary numbers.

Later the author shifts from cultural history and towards summaries of much drier mathematical concepts and their development, at which point we're really straining the use of ""biography"" in the title. But I will say this book's got the most concise and comprehensible explanation of string theory that I've ever come across, and that's certainly worth your time.(Read in 2017, the twenty-sixth book in my Alphabetical Reading Challenge)"

But for the time being, it appears that nothing will come of nothing.” (p. 189)“Zero dwells at the juxtaposition of quantum mechanics and relativity; zero lives where the two theories meet, and zero causes the two theories to clash. A black hole is a zero in the equations of general relativity; the energy of the vacuum is a zero in the mathematics of quantum theory. The big bang, the most puzzling event in the history of the universe, is a zero in both theories. The universe came from nothing – and both theories break down when they try to explain the origin of the cosmos.” (p. 192)"

210,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2327558-eric-rasmussen,3,"I was in the mood for some math (it had been so long since I read some pop-math literature), and Zero seemed like the perfect tome. Unfortunately, Zero is a little TOO pop-math - it hits on the same ""interesting"" math and physics tidbits that so many other pop-math and science books do. And while it relates all of its ideas to zero, it's not really about zero.The first half does talk about the historical context of the concept of zero, but it is mostly about philosophy - how the concepts of zero and infinity affected science and religion of the time. Just when I was hoping for some math, the book switches to a by-discipline survery of, again, math and phyiscs all-star fun factoids, including Fibonacci sequences, the golden ratio, set theory, numbers larger than infinity, wormholes, etc., etc. There were some ideas in there I had not read about before, like projective geometry, but for the most part, Hawking, Bryson, and popular math authors have covered this.So, for me, it was rehash. If you have not read much pop-math, this book is very interesting, although it definitely requires a late-high school understanding of algebra and physics to make sense. If you are familiar with the genre, you've seen most of it before."

We had 1000s of years without. Look around there is nothing zero, zero was invented for practical reasons. Greeks and many others hated it but mathematically they had a problem with long numbers. Zero is a dangerous idea, got converted to philosophy and find a way to enter also theology. The biography is rather complete with parts that are difficult mathematics but covers rather okish the part of philosophy and religion. Life is never zero so start searching what philosophies and policies are linked to maths and you will realize that everything is math, just avoid zero-sum games. Nihilism anyone? "

The latter is more of a travelogue/social history of zero (which has its charms), but I think I prefer this one better because it is a little more concrete. The author does at times try to squeeze some philosophical insights out of zero, which I found annoying, but for the most part it's pretty straightforward. "
213,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/357069-tj,3,"Mind-blowing mathematical literature. That is, if you don't mind having your brain fellated formulaically. Okay, stupid joke aside; this book meets minimum prose competency for making the story of zero, and mathematics, interesting and engaging. After finishing the book, I actually spent two hours giving myself basic algebra problems to see if I could still solve them. This is a good book to read on a whim, any intentions for it more serious will result in disappointment. (In other words, it's like a really good one-hour History Channel program.)"
214,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"This book has a great title. It’s one word, loaded with the essence of the cosmos. That essence lies within gravity, the force that governs the large agglomerations of matter and energy.Gravity pulls energy and matter into itself, to a point, a singularity, seen in black holes and in the pre-Big Bang moment. The logic of gravitational force takes this collapse of everything into one point where, mathematically, the increased density continues into infinity. The sole break to this “bottomless” conclusion is through the mathematical addition of zero. Zero is nothing (i.e., nothing that can be further subdivided). (1)Zero works at the smallest of the small as well. This is the quantum world where particles and sub-particles break down into formless energy, which is a “singularity” of a different sort. (2) The “many” particles and sub-particles lose identity and morph into some yet-to-be-identified “oneness,”collapsing to a point, which is a “zero” point, beyond which there is or can be nothing more. (3)Then Seife unites gravity and the quantum world. Energy collapses further and further, to the point of a singularity, which is where matter itself collapses into oneness (a formless One). Singularities are mathematical realities that continue forever unless a zero point is added to stop the infinite regress. And zero means that the cosmos, at the macro and micro levels, is ultimately, nothing. (4)This is all mind-blowing stuff. Seife anchors all of this in the philosophical thinking of the East and West (5). The latter did not have the concept of zero for philosophical reasons and struggled scientifically with its absence. It was only after zero was imported from the East that Western science could incorporate its significance into cosmological discussions. I struggled to follow his various lines of thought in this regard. On the whole, though, the book is a philosophical inspiration. As Seife has it, zero-nothing unites philosophy and physics. Cosmic energy is a fixed amount (the conservation of energy, which is also an eternal notion). But that amount changes form and moves perpetually from high to low and from low to high, seeking its equilibrium – a point which is, and can only be, temporary, because energy changes forms and creates differences that in turn creates disequilibrium anew. It’s the Tao. It’s yang and yin. And it’s the three scenarios about the ultimate fate of the cosmos. (1) Zero also works at the opposite end of gravitational force as well. Zero is about a balance of energy. If the energy from the big bang expends itself, gravity pulls cosmic energy back into itself, the zero point (Big Crunch). If energy escapes the zero point, the cosmos expands and continues to the point of heat death, which is another zero point because there’s no energy differential (high to low energy). If cosmic expansion is stopped by gravity, stasis (equilibrium state) is zero as well.(2) Seife doesn’t use this word here but it seems to apply. (3) “A zero in quantum mechanics means that the entire universe – including the vacuum – is filled with an infinite amount of energy: the zero-point energy. This, in turn, leads to the most bizarre zero in the universe: the phantom force of nothing.” (4) Seife quotes Feynman who writes “The problem is, when we try to calculate all the way down to zero distance, the equation blows up in our face and gives us meaningless answers – things like infinity.” String theory is a way out of this dilemma because it sees, Seife writes, “every particle as a vibrating string rather than as a dot…In string theory, zero has been banished from the universe; there is no such thing as zero distance or zero time. This solves all the infinity problems of quantum mechanics.”(5) In the East, “The goal of the Hindu,” Seife writes, “is to free the Atman entirely from the cycle of rebirth, to stop wandering from death to death. The way to achieve the ultimate liberation through lifelessness is to cease paying heed to the illusion of reality. ‘The body, the house of the spirit, is under the power of pleasure and pain,’ explains a god. ‘And if a man is ruled by his body then this man can never be free.’ But once you are able to separate yourself from the whims of the flesh and embrace the silence and nothingness of your soul, you will be liberated. Your Atman will fly from the web of human desire and join the collective consciousness – the infinite soul that suffuses the universe at once everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It is infinity, and it is nothing. So India, as a society that actively explored the void and the infinite, accepted zero.” In the West, the Greeks “didn’t have the concept of a limit because they didn’t believe in zero.” An infinite series “seemed to get smaller and smaller without any particular end in sight. As a result, the Greeks couldn’t handle the infinite. They pondered the concept of the void but rejected zero as a number, and they toyed with the concept of the infinite but refused to allow infinity – numbers that are infinitely small and infinitely large – anywhere near the realm of numbers.” This resistance was tied up with a religious worldview. The infinite regressed into a bottomless void, without a beginning. That notion conflicted with God as the beginning point of creation and movement in the world. Zero allowed the void, nothing, to exist. That removed God and it was, therefore, atheistic. "

219,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21160019-sudeep,4,"I’m becoming more and more convinced of the power of teaching science and philosophy as a history - The progression of thought is for all to see; Human endeavour and collaboration more clearly visible. Contrast that with how science is usually thought in schools, where it seems like some genius just discovered/invented things in isolation, without any context or need. Students are not even sure why the scientist was working on that problem, and is colossally boring.Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea is presented in a similar vein. I loved the progression of chapters and how the history of science, mathematics and even philosophy was on show here. However, the concept of zero seemed to be forcefully injected and mixed with the major historical points, and that remains my only complaint of the book. If you can tolerate that (and I believe one can), it’s a very rewarding read.Here’s a brief history of Zero:* Initially mathematics was closely linked to practicality (counting sheep for example), and there was no need for the number zero in practical matters. Although the Egyptians and the Greeks progressed significantly in geometry, there was no use for the number zero in measuring dimensions of geometric objects. So, zero remained outside of mathematics.* The Greeks abhorred the concept of void and infinite. They were stumped with the paradox of Zeno. (The author even goes on to say not accepting zero was the “only thing that kept the Greeks from discovering calculus” - seems like a stretch for me).* Once the Roman empire fell, the dark ages started. The medieval scholars rather than looking at their peers for ideas, turned to the Greeks - Aristotle and Neoplatonists. Apart from other philosophical ideas (like the glorification of idealism), they inherited their fear for zero and infinity.Zero was still not on the numeric scale, and explains why we get a “jump” from 1 BC to 1 AD.* Zero goes East: After being rejected by the West for years, zero finally reached India (via Alexander’s invasion). The Indian mathematicians readily accepted the Babylonian numeral system (which had no special standalone symbol for zero, but zero was still used to distinguish 1 from 10 from 100 etc.)Aryabhatta is said to have positioned zero on the numeral system, from which our present day base-10 numeral system is derived.* Islamic invasion of India: Islam would take zero from India - and it was readily adopted in Italy, thanks to a one famous mathematician Fibonacci. Italian merchants were quick to seize upon the new numeral system (Arabic numbers), which allowed them to get rid of counting boards and make things simpler. Florence banned the Arabic numerals, but it was not so easy to dispense with; The Italian merchants continued using it, and the government had to relent in the face of commercial pressure.* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: Vanishing pointsThe Italian architect, Filippo, created a realistic painting using a vanishing point. A vanishing point is essentially a single dot, a zero, which contains the rest of the universe.* Introductions of zero in art and science: Cartesian coordinate systemRene Descartes introduces his Cartesian coordinate system, which is the first systematic link between Euclidean geometry and algebra. The points for a particular curve on such a system are the “zeros” for a particular equation: (x,y) for which f(x,y) = 0* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: VacuumVacuum has been a point of debate since Greeks. But Evangelista Torricelli is the first to study it empirically. He created the first laboratory vacuum - the torricellian vacuum, by filling a long glass tube filled to one end by mercury, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury.Pascal proves that it wasn’t nature’s abhorrence of vacuum that pushes the mercury up the tube, but rather atmospheric pressure. Vacuums don’t suck, atmosphere pushes. Pascal’s simple experiment demolished Aristotle’s assertion that nature abhors the vacuum. * Infidel Mathematics : The useful infinitesimalsInfinitesimals (extremely small numbers) starts making its way into mathematics. Kepler, in his attempt to calculate the volume of a crudely shaped wine barrel, chopped up the barrels - in his mind--into an infinite number of infinitely small pieces, and then added them back together to get the volume.Mathematicians use this infinitesimals to solve the problem of tangents - a line that just kisses a curve. It had important implications in studying motion - for example, you are swinging a ball tied to a thread above your head, if you cut off the string abruptly, the ball flies off into a tangent. Building on the idea of infinitesimals, Newton and Leibniz discover/invent calculus. The mathematicians are still grappling with the logical and philosophical problems of infinitesimals, but because of its accuracy and practical purpose, they accept it.It was finally with L’Hospital’s rule that trouble of 0/0, which plagued calculus could be resolved (though partially). The key was to make the infinitesimals carefully “tend towards zero”. Clever manipulations allowed one to resolve other odd expressions like ∞/∞, 00 and ∞0.It was finally with d’Alembert’s idea of limits that solved caculus’s problem with zeroes. He also resolved the Zeno’s paradox by boiling it down to a a sum of infinite number of ever-diminishing quantities. * Two sides of the same coin: IntroductionAlgebraic equations have roots - points where the value of the equation equals 0. Descartes refused to accept negative numbers as roots of an equation, calling them false roots. He also never extended his coordinate system beyond zero. He was even more disgusted by square roots of negative numbers, giving them a scornful name - imaginary numbers.Two developments here bridge the gap between zero and inifinity - projective geometry and the complex plane.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Projective geometryJean-Victor Poncelet was a mathematician in the Napoleon’s army, and was captured by Russia. In prison he found a new discipline: projective geometry. His work was the culmination of the work done by artists like Filippo and Da Vinci - learning to project 3d images on 2d planes, making use of, among other things, the vanishing point.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: The Complex PlaneGauss, an 18th century Mathematics prodigy was able to map out complex numbers on cartesian plane (which is called complex plane) - the vertical axis represents the imaginary numbers, while the horizontal axis represents real number. He also figured that operations like multiplication, addition etc. have geometric implications in the complex plane. For instance, multiplying a point by i, causes it turn anti-clockwise by 90 degrees. This was the second big advance.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Reimann SphereRiemann, a student of Gauss, married the ideas of projective geometry and complex plane and “…all of a sudden lines became circles, circles become lines, and zero and infinity became the poles on a globe full of numbers.” Gauss figures out that all infinities are not the same - the infinity of real numbers (uncountable infinity) is much greater than the infinity of rational numbers (countable infinity).* Zero (and infinity) in Physics (I'll rush on this)From here on the rest of the book talks about occurrences of zero (or infinity) in physics - zero kelvin (minimum possible temperature), or black holes, the Casimir effect (forces applied by a vacuum), string theory, the big bang, and the fate of the universe (via heat death)."

Following this model, students could use the ""My____History"" (Gallagher 79) or the '""You Should Know"" (Gallagher 88) Biographical Paper' strategies. Students could write their own stories, detailing where they came from, how they have impacted others in their lives, and the impact they are currently having. Or, students could choose a person or perhaps a topic (such as zero) to practice writing a history of how that topic came into being, again how others have reacted to it or been impacted by it, and how its existence is affecting the world today.Pairing this text with the above strategies would not only allow students to learn new information about the technology they are immersed in, but would also allow them to reflect on and write about their own sense of identities."
221,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63312978-ben-jackson,2,"For full transparency, I read about 3/4 of this book and put it down. The book is a thoroughly researched and well written historical account of the history of zero, but more broadly the history of mathematics. We take zero for granted, but for most of human history we were unaware of its existence, and until only recently we denied its existence. Zero has many unusual properties and became the key to unlocking complicated mathematics like calculus and physics and indeed our understanding of the earth and the heavens. The first half was most interesting.So why did I give up? The book becomes intensely technical about halfway through, to a degree that only mathematicians can truly appreciate. It couldn’t hold my interest. I recommend this book for true math nerds. For casual math nerds, I instead recommend Jordan Ellenberg’s _How Not to be Wrong_, which Bill Gates describes as “a love letter to math.”"
222,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54161476-alexander-thomas,3,"I enjoyed the book and got through it fairly quickly. The first part of the book nicely brings about how the number zero moved from east to west and the impact of the idea on western philosophy and mathematics. Seife then explains how integration and differentiation solve tricky problems where zero is involved to make sense out of equations. The final third of the book is about singularities and the big bang - zero from a cosmological perspective. Good book, and I'd have give it 4 stars, but I docked one star because of a couple of things - Seife's breathless commentary: ""zero holds the secret to our existance"", ""the ultimate fate of the cosmos lies in zero"" and Seife's insistence to treat the vacuum and the void as regions of zero activity despite (as he also later writes) the abundance of virtual particles (meaning it's clearly non-zero). Seife also, in the first part of the book, stand on a pedestal to sniffily chastise the Aristotelian view of the universe without showing enough sympathy to the fact that they (the Aristotelians) were products of their time. Perhaps Seife should realise that he's not on a pedestal, but on the shoulders of giants."

I read a lot of that genre in high school, for whatever strange reason, so I am reasonably familiar with it. In the years since high school, I have moved on from being a pop scientist to a pop historian, and I think for that reason I preferred the historical half of this book, as opposed to the latter half, which is a whistle-stop tour of the most complex mathematical and physics advances of the twentieth-century. Seife pulled off this second half just fine, considering these topics are basically impossible to explain in any intuitive or comprehensible way to the armchair physicists like me."

The association between infinity and zero is something that I hadn't thought about prior to reading it. It also does a great job of explaining things like black holes and absolute zero temperature. The book seems, though, to switch about two thirds through, at first the book is a delightful romp in which zero is a character, a funny little imp that historically was either ignored or minimized. However once zero is introduced and history catches up with the 20th century, zero puts its big-boy pants on and gets down to business in modern physics. Some of the physics at the end of the book was a bit beyond me, but I liked the books premise that zero and its pal infinity are not just useful constructs but are necessary, and indeed absolutely essential, to our understand of the universe. The book makes you think. High praise indeed. Zero (the book) is not for everyone but if you enjoy thinking about the scientific/mathematical enterprise and how it has developed over time, I would recommend it."

234,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5986736-ashwini-nocaste,4,"Thanks to the mathematics of zero and infinity, Pascal concluded that one should assume that God exists – from Zero : The Biography of a Dangerous IdeaGod’s Debris – by Scott Adams is an interesting novella that tries to in a way put out a belief model where the universe and its constituents are explained as “God’s Debris” – the primordial sea of pre-big bang existence that got sprinkled into living existence as we perceive it today. No one knows or can easily surmise as to what exactly happened one second before the big bang took place. In the book “Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea” – author Charles Seife attempts to explain the suffusion of the idea of zero throughout our existence and hints at the possibility of zero being at the beginning as well as at the end of our existence.If one accepts the universe as a sprinkling of God’s Dust formed out of the primordial sea that existed pre-big bang (which in Charles Seife’s view is nothing but something as close to what Zero signifies), then it can be taken as granted that all forms in perceivable existence today are representations of constituents which when trussed together will be an exact replica of the pre-big bang primordial sea. But as Charles Seife indicates that zero must have existed before and at the beginning of big bang – it leads me to a hypothetical assumption that the sum total of the entire universe must be equal to what Zero signifies – an idea which takes into account the anti-matter argument posed by Stephen Hawkings in “A Brief History of Time” – where the positive matter resulted in the observable universe and the negative matter – i.e., anti-matter exists as non-existence, a concept not easily graspable by our faculties.Any number divided by Zero can result in infinity. As an example, suppose a packet of 50 toffies is to be distributed. If it is to be distributed to 25 people, then the number 50 is to be divided by 25 to result in 2 toffies in the hands of each individual. But if 0 toffies were to be distributed, then one can go on distributing 50 toffies to as many people as possible (of course in this case, no one will get anything in their hands). Thus a number divided by zero tends to infinity. But Zero is also a number – so can it be argued that 0/0 is equal to infinity? An absurd conclusion of course – because it seems that nothing divided by nothing results in everything : an absurd conclusion – but something which is very close to the nature of existence as we understand it today. We know that the universe is expanding and the discovery of that fact by Hubble led one to the conclusion that the universe was once closely packed into a primordial soup – but what could have caused the explosion and whether the universe will infinitely expand or will there be a limit? An external source of energy or force acting on the primordial soup? Well it would be naïve to argue that propulsion of the primordial soup into an expanding universe is owed to the agency of an external force – since that is a physical law steeped in our earthly surroundings – and which might not have existed in operation at all during pre-big bang. So does that imply, the initiative must have come from within? If the initiative had come from within, then why at that point of time only – and why it all had to come about in the first place? It could have continued as a dense primordial soup?Could Zero be God? An exact assimilation of the sum-total consciousness in the pre-big bang arrangement but which has got scattered round the universe and now exists as a harmless looking Zero? This concept is not new and thinkers of lore have attempted to discover God in the concept of Zero. In my opinion, offered merely as a thought and not as firm conviction, what Zero signified in the pre-big bang set-up lost its power and energy as it suffused out across the length and breadth of the universe-so much so that it now became worthy of only a concept that exists as a human thought – which leads one to the natural question – whether zero as a concept, not as a numerical entity, but as a thought representing the void – also graspable by animals?Another interesting thought that can there be is – What value to give to Zero? Should it signify a void – a nothingness? Has Zero been devised to signify a void only because our perceptions of existence imply “not nothingness”. What if the pre-big bang moment is not the Zeroth hour but just another point among several points as denoted by numbers on a numberline? As a personal belief, it is difficult for me to grasp that there was a big bang – but I do not shy away from believing in the possibility of an inter-dimensional change from a certain dimension to the other. As to whether the Universe is infinite or finite, the riddle lies in the resolution of the concept of Time; but Time as we have been thoroughly ingrained to accept is the Solar notion of time based on earth’s rotation/revolution around the Sun. Time as it really exists devoid of a reference point is a difficult concept for me to conjure."

They are equal and opposite, yin and yang. They are equally paradoxical and troubling. The biggest questions in science and religion are about nothingness and eternity, the void and the infinite, zero and infinity.ZERO: POWERFUL ENOUGH TO STOP A WARSHIP- Zero hit the USS Yorktown like a torpedo. On September 21, 1997, while cruising off the coast of Virginia, the billion-dollar missile cruiser shuddered to a halt.- The Yorktown’s computers had just received new software that was controlling the engines. Unfortunately, nobody had spotted the time bomb lurking in the code, a zero that engineers were supposed to remove while installing the software.- When the Yorktown’s computer system tried to divide by zero, 80,000 horsepower instantly became worthless.LEARNING TO COUNT- In the very beginning of mathematics, it seems that people could only distinguish between one and many.- Over time, primitive languages evolved to distinguish between one, two, and many, and eventually one, two, three, many, but didn’t have terms for higher numbers.TALLYING UP LARGER GROUPS OF NUMBERS- The early Greeks, for instance, used the word “fiving” to describe the process of tallying.- In English, eleven and twelve seem to be derived from “one over [ten]” and “two over [ten],” while thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and so on are contractions of “three and ten,” “four and ten,” and “five and ten.”GEOMETRY CREATED BECAUSE THE NILE FLOODED- The bad news was that the river destroyed many of the boundary markers, erasing all of the landmarks that told farmers which land was theirs to cultivate. (The Egyptians took property rights very seriously.- The ancient pharaohs assigned surveyors to assess the damage and reset the boundary markers, and thus geometry was born.- Egyptians were of a practical bent. They never progressed beyond measuring volumes and counting days and hours. Mathematics wasn’t used for anything impractical, except their system of astrology.FROM THE EGYPTIANS TO THE GREEKS- The Greeks were different; they embraced the abstract and the philosophical, and brought mathematics to its highest point in ancient times.- Instead of using pictures to represent numbers as the Egyptians did, the Greeks used letters.ZERO ENTERS THE EQUATION- Babylonian style of counting. And thanks to this system, zero finally appeared in the East, in the Fertile Crescent of present-day Iraq.ZERO STARTS OUT AS MERELY A PLACEHOLDER- Zero was born out of the need to give any given sequence of Babylonian digits a unique, permanent meaning.- Though zero was useful, it was only a placeholder. It was merely a symbol for a blank place in the abacus, a column where all the stones were at the bottom. It did little more than make sure digits fell in the right places; it didn’t really have a numerical value of its own.- Zero was a digit, not a number. It had no value.MANY WESTERNERS FOUND ZERO (AND INFINITY) TO BE SCARY- It is hard to imagine being afraid of a number. Yet zero was inexorably linked with the void—with nothing. There was a primal fear of void and chaos. There was also a fear of zero. Most ancient peoples believed that only emptiness and chaos were present before the universe came to be.- Multiplying by zero collapses the number line. But dividing by zero destroys the entire framework of mathematics.- The Greek universe, created by Pythagoras, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, survived long after the collapse of Greek civilization. In that universe there is no such thing as nothing. There is no zero. Because of this, the West could not accept zero for nearly two millennia.- This is the biggest failure in Greek mathematics, and it is the only thing that kept them from discovering calculus.- Aristotle just wished infinity away by stating that it is simply a construct of the human mind.INDIA- Hinduism was steeped in the symbolism of duality.- Indian mathematicians did more than simply accept zero. They transformed it, changing its role from mere placeholder to number. This reincarnation was what gave zero its power.- Our numbers evolved from the symbols that the Indians used; by rights they should be called Indian numerals rather than Arabic ones- Instead, they saw the interplay of numerals—numbers stripped of their geometric significance. This was the birth of what we now know as algebra.- Once numbers shed their geometric significance, mathematicians no longer had to worry about mathematical operations making geometric sense...You can’t remove a three-acre swath from a two-acre field, but nothing prevents you from subtracting three from two. Nowadays we recognize that 2 – 3=–1: negative one.ZERO BECOMES A NUMBER AND NO LONGER JUST A PLACE HOLDER- Just as 2 – 3 was now a number, so was 2 – 2. It was zero. Not just a mere placeholder zero that represents an empty space on the abacus, but zero the number.MUSLIMS LEARN FROM INDIA- Along the way to China, the Muslims conquered India. And there the Arabs learned about Indian numerals.- one of its first scholars was the mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi. Al-Khowarizmi wrote several important books, like Al-jabr wa’l muqabala, a treatise on how to solve elementary equations; the Al-jabr in the title (which means something like “completion”) gave us the term algebra.- algorithms, the tricks for multiplying and dividing Hindu numerals quickly...the word algorithm was a corruption of al-Khowarizmi’s name.MANY IN THE WEST STILL RELUCTANT TO ADOPT ZERO- In 1299, Florence banned Arabic numerals...Italian merchants continued to use them, and even used them to send encrypted messages—which is how the word cipher came to mean “secret code.”ZERO ENTERS INTO WESTERN ART- It was an Italian architect, Filippo Brunelleschi, who first demonstrated the power of an infinite zero: he created a realistic painting by using a vanishing point.- A point is a zero-dimensional object...This zero-dimensional object, the vanishing point, is an infinitesimal dot on the canvas that represents a spot infinitely far away from the viewer- It is no coincidence that zero and infinity are linked in the vanishing point. Just as multiplying by zero causes the number line to collapse into a point, the vanishing point has caused most of the universe to sit in a tiny dot. This is a singularity, a concept that became very important later in the history of science—ZERO AND COORDINATES- “I am in a sense something intermediate between God and nought.” —RENÉ DESCARTES, DISCOURSE ON METHOD- Descartes was a mathematician-philosopher; perhaps his most lasting legacy was a mathematical invention—what we now call Cartesian coordinates.- Descartes realized that he could not start his two reference lines, or axes, with the number 1.- Descartes quickly realized how powerful his coordinate system was. He used it to turn figures and shapes into equations and numbers; with Cartesian coordinates every geometric object—squares, triangles, wavy lines—could be represented by an equation, a mathematical relationship.- No longer were the Western art of geometry and the Eastern art of algebra separate domains.INFINITY- This is the definition of the infinite: it is something that can stay the same size even when you subtract from it.ZERO- Zero is behind all of the big puzzles in physics. The infinite density of the black hole is a division by zero. The big bang creation from the void is a division by zero. The infinite energy of the vacuum is a division by zero. Yet dividing by zero destroys the fabric of mathematics and the framework of logic—and threatens to undermine the very basis of science.- All that scientists know is the cosmos was spawned from nothing, and will return to the nothing from whence it came. The universe begins and ends with zero.PHYSICS- [Note: The second half of the book deals with how zero and infinity correspond to physics topics such as black holes, string theory, etc. Although interesting, I chose not to share too many excerpts.]*** *** *** *** ***HAHA- The Reformation was begun by Martin Luther while he was on the toilet (he suffered from chronic constipation): https://www.smh.com.au/world/toilet-w...- Estimated temperatures of heaven and hell (based on physics): http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/...FACTOIDS- 10,000—the myriad, the biggest grouping in the Greek system.- The Babylonians, like many different cultures, had invented machines that helped them count. The most famous was the abacus...The words calculate, calculus, and calcium all come from the Latin word for pebble: calculus.- In modern schools, children learn of Pythagoras for his famed theorem: the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. However, this was in fact ancient news. It was known more than 1,000 years before Pythagoras’s time.- stadium (the standard Greek unit of long distance)- (Our word noon comes from the word nones, the midday prayer service of medieval clergy.)- The Indian name for zero was sunya, meaning “empty,” which the Arabs turned into sifr. When some Western scholars described the new number to their colleagues, they turned sifr into a Latin-sounding word, yielding zephirus, which is the root of our word zero. Other Western mathematicians didn’t change the word so heavily and called zero cifra, which became cipher. Zero was so important to the new set of numbers that people started calling all numbers ciphers, which gave the French their term chiffre, digit.- The Germans called the counting board a Rechenbank, which is why we call moneylenders banks.- Not only did they use counting boards, they used tally sticks to record loans: a money value was written along the stick’s side, and it was split in two. The lender kept the biggest piece, the stock. After all, he was the stockholder.- Descartes thought that these numbers were even worse than negative numbers; he came up with a scornful name for the square roots of negatives: imaginary numbers. The name stuck, and eventually, the symbol for the square root of –1 became i.BONUS- The numbers cult of Pythagoras: https://youtu.be/9_DHBf_koGE- Zeno’s paradox - Achilles and the turtle: https://youtu.be/3vNlf2zGLaE- Archimedes principle: https://youtu.be/ijj58xD5fDI- Aristotle - History’s most influential thinker: https://youtu.be/qD5O3vXj9eU- Fibonacci’s rabbit problem: https://youtu.be/sjQlW6cH3Ko- Vacuums: https://youtu.be/EkDhlzA-lwI- Pascaline (world’s first calculator): https://youtu.be/5wB80HzF8sM- The Casimir Effect: https://youtu.be/nDxW9ZF5wGs- Pauli’s exclusion principle: https://youtu.be/GZku6bBaufs- What is a singularity?: https://youtu.be/24T58gXCUW8"

A black hole is a zero in the equations of general relativity; the energy of the vacuum is a zero in the mathematics of quantum theory.

Unfortunately, Zero is a little TOO pop-math - it hits on the same ""interesting"" math and physics tidbits that so many other pop-math and science books do. And while it relates all of its ideas to zero, it's not really about zero.The first half does talk about the historical context of the concept of zero, but it is mostly about philosophy - how the concepts of zero and infinity affected science and religion of the time. Just when I was hoping for some math, the book switches to a by-discipline survery of, again, math and phyiscs all-star fun factoids, including Fibonacci sequences, the golden ratio, set theory, numbers larger than infinity, wormholes, etc., etc. There were some ideas in there I had not read about before, like projective geometry, but for the most part, Hawking, Bryson, and popular math authors have covered this.So, for me, it was rehash. If you have not read much pop-math, this book is very interesting, although it definitely requires a late-high school understanding of algebra and physics to make sense. If you are familiar with the genre, you've seen most of it before."
241,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16896341-sotiris-makrygiannis,3,"First I start by changing my score criteria and start scoring lower, than higher.This is a good book on the history of Zero. We had 1000s of years without. Look around there is nothing zero, zero was invented for practical reasons. Greeks and many others hated it but mathematically they had a problem with long numbers. Zero is a dangerous idea, got converted to philosophy and find a way to enter also theology. The biography is rather complete with parts that are difficult mathematics but covers rather okish the part of philosophy and religion. Life is never zero so start searching what philosophies and policies are linked to maths and you will realize that everything is math, just avoid zero-sum games. Nihilism anyone? "

244,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"This book has a great title. It’s one word, loaded with the essence of the cosmos. That essence lies within gravity, the force that governs the large agglomerations of matter and energy.Gravity pulls energy and matter into itself, to a point, a singularity, seen in black holes and in the pre-Big Bang moment. The logic of gravitational force takes this collapse of everything into one point where, mathematically, the increased density continues into infinity. The sole break to this “bottomless” conclusion is through the mathematical addition of zero. Zero is nothing (i.e., nothing that can be further subdivided). (1)Zero works at the smallest of the small as well. This is the quantum world where particles and sub-particles break down into formless energy, which is a “singularity” of a different sort. (2) The “many” particles and sub-particles lose identity and morph into some yet-to-be-identified “oneness,”collapsing to a point, which is a “zero” point, beyond which there is or can be nothing more. (3)Then Seife unites gravity and the quantum world. Energy collapses further and further, to the point of a singularity, which is where matter itself collapses into oneness (a formless One). Singularities are mathematical realities that continue forever unless a zero point is added to stop the infinite regress. And zero means that the cosmos, at the macro and micro levels, is ultimately, nothing. (4)This is all mind-blowing stuff. Seife anchors all of this in the philosophical thinking of the East and West (5). The latter did not have the concept of zero for philosophical reasons and struggled scientifically with its absence. It was only after zero was imported from the East that Western science could incorporate its significance into cosmological discussions. I struggled to follow his various lines of thought in this regard. On the whole, though, the book is a philosophical inspiration. As Seife has it, zero-nothing unites philosophy and physics. Cosmic energy is a fixed amount (the conservation of energy, which is also an eternal notion). But that amount changes form and moves perpetually from high to low and from low to high, seeking its equilibrium – a point which is, and can only be, temporary, because energy changes forms and creates differences that in turn creates disequilibrium anew. It’s the Tao. It’s yang and yin. And it’s the three scenarios about the ultimate fate of the cosmos. (1) Zero also works at the opposite end of gravitational force as well. Zero is about a balance of energy. If the energy from the big bang expends itself, gravity pulls cosmic energy back into itself, the zero point (Big Crunch). If energy escapes the zero point, the cosmos expands and continues to the point of heat death, which is another zero point because there’s no energy differential (high to low energy). If cosmic expansion is stopped by gravity, stasis (equilibrium state) is zero as well.(2) Seife doesn’t use this word here but it seems to apply. (3) “A zero in quantum mechanics means that the entire universe – including the vacuum – is filled with an infinite amount of energy: the zero-point energy. This, in turn, leads to the most bizarre zero in the universe: the phantom force of nothing.” (4) Seife quotes Feynman who writes “The problem is, when we try to calculate all the way down to zero distance, the equation blows up in our face and gives us meaningless answers – things like infinity.” String theory is a way out of this dilemma because it sees, Seife writes, “every particle as a vibrating string rather than as a dot…In string theory, zero has been banished from the universe; there is no such thing as zero distance or zero time. This solves all the infinity problems of quantum mechanics.”(5) In the East, “The goal of the Hindu,” Seife writes, “is to free the Atman entirely from the cycle of rebirth, to stop wandering from death to death. The way to achieve the ultimate liberation through lifelessness is to cease paying heed to the illusion of reality. ‘The body, the house of the spirit, is under the power of pleasure and pain,’ explains a god. ‘And if a man is ruled by his body then this man can never be free.’ But once you are able to separate yourself from the whims of the flesh and embrace the silence and nothingness of your soul, you will be liberated. Your Atman will fly from the web of human desire and join the collective consciousness – the infinite soul that suffuses the universe at once everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It is infinity, and it is nothing. So India, as a society that actively explored the void and the infinite, accepted zero.” In the West, the Greeks “didn’t have the concept of a limit because they didn’t believe in zero.” An infinite series “seemed to get smaller and smaller without any particular end in sight. As a result, the Greeks couldn’t handle the infinite. They pondered the concept of the void but rejected zero as a number, and they toyed with the concept of the infinite but refused to allow infinity – numbers that are infinitely small and infinitely large – anywhere near the realm of numbers.” This resistance was tied up with a religious worldview. The infinite regressed into a bottomless void, without a beginning. That notion conflicted with God as the beginning point of creation and movement in the world. Zero allowed the void, nothing, to exist. That removed God and it was, therefore, atheistic. "

249,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21160019-sudeep,4,"I’m becoming more and more convinced of the power of teaching science and philosophy as a history - The progression of thought is for all to see; Human endeavour and collaboration more clearly visible. Contrast that with how science is usually thought in schools, where it seems like some genius just discovered/invented things in isolation, without any context or need. Students are not even sure why the scientist was working on that problem, and is colossally boring.Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea is presented in a similar vein. I loved the progression of chapters and how the history of science, mathematics and even philosophy was on show here. However, the concept of zero seemed to be forcefully injected and mixed with the major historical points, and that remains my only complaint of the book. If you can tolerate that (and I believe one can), it’s a very rewarding read.Here’s a brief history of Zero:* Initially mathematics was closely linked to practicality (counting sheep for example), and there was no need for the number zero in practical matters. Although the Egyptians and the Greeks progressed significantly in geometry, there was no use for the number zero in measuring dimensions of geometric objects. So, zero remained outside of mathematics.* The Greeks abhorred the concept of void and infinite. They were stumped with the paradox of Zeno. (The author even goes on to say not accepting zero was the “only thing that kept the Greeks from discovering calculus” - seems like a stretch for me).* Once the Roman empire fell, the dark ages started. The medieval scholars rather than looking at their peers for ideas, turned to the Greeks - Aristotle and Neoplatonists. Apart from other philosophical ideas (like the glorification of idealism), they inherited their fear for zero and infinity.Zero was still not on the numeric scale, and explains why we get a “jump” from 1 BC to 1 AD.* Zero goes East: After being rejected by the West for years, zero finally reached India (via Alexander’s invasion). The Indian mathematicians readily accepted the Babylonian numeral system (which had no special standalone symbol for zero, but zero was still used to distinguish 1 from 10 from 100 etc.)Aryabhatta is said to have positioned zero on the numeral system, from which our present day base-10 numeral system is derived.* Islamic invasion of India: Islam would take zero from India - and it was readily adopted in Italy, thanks to a one famous mathematician Fibonacci. Italian merchants were quick to seize upon the new numeral system (Arabic numbers), which allowed them to get rid of counting boards and make things simpler. Florence banned the Arabic numerals, but it was not so easy to dispense with; The Italian merchants continued using it, and the government had to relent in the face of commercial pressure.* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: Vanishing pointsThe Italian architect, Filippo, created a realistic painting using a vanishing point. A vanishing point is essentially a single dot, a zero, which contains the rest of the universe.* Introductions of zero in art and science: Cartesian coordinate systemRene Descartes introduces his Cartesian coordinate system, which is the first systematic link between Euclidean geometry and algebra. The points for a particular curve on such a system are the “zeros” for a particular equation: (x,y) for which f(x,y) = 0* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: VacuumVacuum has been a point of debate since Greeks. But Evangelista Torricelli is the first to study it empirically. He created the first laboratory vacuum - the torricellian vacuum, by filling a long glass tube filled to one end by mercury, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury.Pascal proves that it wasn’t nature’s abhorrence of vacuum that pushes the mercury up the tube, but rather atmospheric pressure. Vacuums don’t suck, atmosphere pushes. Pascal’s simple experiment demolished Aristotle’s assertion that nature abhors the vacuum. * Infidel Mathematics : The useful infinitesimalsInfinitesimals (extremely small numbers) starts making its way into mathematics. Kepler, in his attempt to calculate the volume of a crudely shaped wine barrel, chopped up the barrels - in his mind--into an infinite number of infinitely small pieces, and then added them back together to get the volume.Mathematicians use this infinitesimals to solve the problem of tangents - a line that just kisses a curve. It had important implications in studying motion - for example, you are swinging a ball tied to a thread above your head, if you cut off the string abruptly, the ball flies off into a tangent. Building on the idea of infinitesimals, Newton and Leibniz discover/invent calculus. The mathematicians are still grappling with the logical and philosophical problems of infinitesimals, but because of its accuracy and practical purpose, they accept it.It was finally with L’Hospital’s rule that trouble of 0/0, which plagued calculus could be resolved (though partially). The key was to make the infinitesimals carefully “tend towards zero”. Clever manipulations allowed one to resolve other odd expressions like ∞/∞, 00 and ∞0.It was finally with d’Alembert’s idea of limits that solved caculus’s problem with zeroes. He also resolved the Zeno’s paradox by boiling it down to a a sum of infinite number of ever-diminishing quantities. * Two sides of the same coin: IntroductionAlgebraic equations have roots - points where the value of the equation equals 0. Descartes refused to accept negative numbers as roots of an equation, calling them false roots. He also never extended his coordinate system beyond zero. He was even more disgusted by square roots of negative numbers, giving them a scornful name - imaginary numbers.Two developments here bridge the gap between zero and inifinity - projective geometry and the complex plane.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Projective geometryJean-Victor Poncelet was a mathematician in the Napoleon’s army, and was captured by Russia. In prison he found a new discipline: projective geometry. His work was the culmination of the work done by artists like Filippo and Da Vinci - learning to project 3d images on 2d planes, making use of, among other things, the vanishing point.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: The Complex PlaneGauss, an 18th century Mathematics prodigy was able to map out complex numbers on cartesian plane (which is called complex plane) - the vertical axis represents the imaginary numbers, while the horizontal axis represents real number. He also figured that operations like multiplication, addition etc. have geometric implications in the complex plane. For instance, multiplying a point by i, causes it turn anti-clockwise by 90 degrees. This was the second big advance.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Reimann SphereRiemann, a student of Gauss, married the ideas of projective geometry and complex plane and “…all of a sudden lines became circles, circles become lines, and zero and infinity became the poles on a globe full of numbers.” Gauss figures out that all infinities are not the same - the infinity of real numbers (uncountable infinity) is much greater than the infinity of rational numbers (countable infinity).* Zero (and infinity) in Physics (I'll rush on this)From here on the rest of the book talks about occurrences of zero (or infinity) in physics - zero kelvin (minimum possible temperature), or black holes, the Casimir effect (forces applied by a vacuum), string theory, the big bang, and the fate of the universe (via heat death)."

Following this model, students could use the ""My____History"" (Gallagher 79) or the '""You Should Know"" (Gallagher 88) Biographical Paper' strategies. Students could write their own stories, detailing where they came from, how they have impacted others in their lives, and the impact they are currently having. Or, students could choose a person or perhaps a topic (such as zero) to practice writing a history of how that topic came into being, again how others have reacted to it or been impacted by it, and how its existence is affecting the world today.Pairing this text with the above strategies would not only allow students to learn new information about the technology they are immersed in, but would also allow them to reflect on and write about their own sense of identities."
251,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63312978-ben-jackson,2,"For full transparency, I read about 3/4 of this book and put it down. The book is a thoroughly researched and well written historical account of the history of zero, but more broadly the history of mathematics. We take zero for granted, but for most of human history we were unaware of its existence, and until only recently we denied its existence. Zero has many unusual properties and became the key to unlocking complicated mathematics like calculus and physics and indeed our understanding of the earth and the heavens. The first half was most interesting.So why did I give up? The book becomes intensely technical about halfway through, to a degree that only mathematicians can truly appreciate. It couldn’t hold my interest. I recommend this book for true math nerds. For casual math nerds, I instead recommend Jordan Ellenberg’s _How Not to be Wrong_, which Bill Gates describes as “a love letter to math.”"

The first part of the book nicely brings about how the number zero moved from east to west and the impact of the idea on western philosophy and mathematics. Seife then explains how integration and differentiation solve tricky problems where zero is involved to make sense out of equations. The final third of the book is about singularities and the big bang - zero from a cosmological perspective. Good book, and I'd have give it 4 stars, but I docked one star because of a couple of things - Seife's breathless commentary: ""zero holds the secret to our existance"", ""the ultimate fate of the cosmos lies in zero"" and Seife's insistence to treat the vacuum and the void as regions of zero activity despite (as he also later writes) the abundance of virtual particles (meaning it's clearly non-zero). Seife also, in the first part of the book, stand on a pedestal to sniffily chastise the Aristotelian view of the universe without showing enough sympathy to the fact that they (the Aristotelians) were products of their time. Perhaps Seife should realise that he's not on a pedestal, but on the shoulders of giants."

I read a lot of that genre in high school, for whatever strange reason, so I am reasonably familiar with it. In the years since high school, I have moved on from being a pop scientist to a pop historian, and I think for that reason I preferred the historical half of this book, as opposed to the latter half, which is a whistle-stop tour of the most complex mathematical and physics advances of the twentieth-century. Seife pulled off this second half just fine, considering these topics are basically impossible to explain in any intuitive or comprehensible way to the armchair physicists like me."
255,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96062163-alan-kolok,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The association between infinity and zero is something that I hadn't thought about prior to reading it. It also does a great job of explaining things like black holes and absolute zero temperature. The book seems, though, to switch about two thirds through, at first the book is a delightful romp in which zero is a character, a funny little imp that historically was either ignored or minimized. However once zero is introduced and history catches up with the 20th century, zero puts its big-boy pants on and gets down to business in modern physics. Some of the physics at the end of the book was a bit beyond me, but I liked the books premise that zero and its pal infinity are not just useful constructs but are necessary, and indeed absolutely essential, to our understand of the universe. The book makes you think. High praise indeed. Zero (the book) is not for everyone but if you enjoy thinking about the scientific/mathematical enterprise and how it has developed over time, I would recommend it."

264,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5986736-ashwini-nocaste,4,"Thanks to the mathematics of zero and infinity, Pascal concluded that one should assume that God exists – from Zero : The Biography of a Dangerous IdeaGod’s Debris – by Scott Adams is an interesting novella that tries to in a way put out a belief model where the universe and its constituents are explained as “God’s Debris” – the primordial sea of pre-big bang existence that got sprinkled into living existence as we perceive it today. No one knows or can easily surmise as to what exactly happened one second before the big bang took place. In the book “Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea” – author Charles Seife attempts to explain the suffusion of the idea of zero throughout our existence and hints at the possibility of zero being at the beginning as well as at the end of our existence.If one accepts the universe as a sprinkling of God’s Dust formed out of the primordial sea that existed pre-big bang (which in Charles Seife’s view is nothing but something as close to what Zero signifies), then it can be taken as granted that all forms in perceivable existence today are representations of constituents which when trussed together will be an exact replica of the pre-big bang primordial sea. But as Charles Seife indicates that zero must have existed before and at the beginning of big bang – it leads me to a hypothetical assumption that the sum total of the entire universe must be equal to what Zero signifies – an idea which takes into account the anti-matter argument posed by Stephen Hawkings in “A Brief History of Time” – where the positive matter resulted in the observable universe and the negative matter – i.e., anti-matter exists as non-existence, a concept not easily graspable by our faculties.Any number divided by Zero can result in infinity. As an example, suppose a packet of 50 toffies is to be distributed. If it is to be distributed to 25 people, then the number 50 is to be divided by 25 to result in 2 toffies in the hands of each individual. But if 0 toffies were to be distributed, then one can go on distributing 50 toffies to as many people as possible (of course in this case, no one will get anything in their hands). Thus a number divided by zero tends to infinity. But Zero is also a number – so can it be argued that 0/0 is equal to infinity? An absurd conclusion of course – because it seems that nothing divided by nothing results in everything : an absurd conclusion – but something which is very close to the nature of existence as we understand it today. We know that the universe is expanding and the discovery of that fact by Hubble led one to the conclusion that the universe was once closely packed into a primordial soup – but what could have caused the explosion and whether the universe will infinitely expand or will there be a limit? An external source of energy or force acting on the primordial soup? Well it would be naïve to argue that propulsion of the primordial soup into an expanding universe is owed to the agency of an external force – since that is a physical law steeped in our earthly surroundings – and which might not have existed in operation at all during pre-big bang. So does that imply, the initiative must have come from within? If the initiative had come from within, then why at that point of time only – and why it all had to come about in the first place? It could have continued as a dense primordial soup?Could Zero be God? An exact assimilation of the sum-total consciousness in the pre-big bang arrangement but which has got scattered round the universe and now exists as a harmless looking Zero? This concept is not new and thinkers of lore have attempted to discover God in the concept of Zero. In my opinion, offered merely as a thought and not as firm conviction, what Zero signified in the pre-big bang set-up lost its power and energy as it suffused out across the length and breadth of the universe-so much so that it now became worthy of only a concept that exists as a human thought – which leads one to the natural question – whether zero as a concept, not as a numerical entity, but as a thought representing the void – also graspable by animals?Another interesting thought that can there be is – What value to give to Zero? Should it signify a void – a nothingness? Has Zero been devised to signify a void only because our perceptions of existence imply “not nothingness”. What if the pre-big bang moment is not the Zeroth hour but just another point among several points as denoted by numbers on a numberline? As a personal belief, it is difficult for me to grasp that there was a big bang – but I do not shy away from believing in the possibility of an inter-dimensional change from a certain dimension to the other. As to whether the Universe is infinite or finite, the riddle lies in the resolution of the concept of Time; but Time as we have been thoroughly ingrained to accept is the Solar notion of time based on earth’s rotation/revolution around the Sun. Time as it really exists devoid of a reference point is a difficult concept for me to conjure."

They are equal and opposite, yin and yang. They are equally paradoxical and troubling. The biggest questions in science and religion are about nothingness and eternity, the void and the infinite, zero and infinity.ZERO: POWERFUL ENOUGH TO STOP A WARSHIP- Zero hit the USS Yorktown like a torpedo. On September 21, 1997, while cruising off the coast of Virginia, the billion-dollar missile cruiser shuddered to a halt.- The Yorktown’s computers had just received new software that was controlling the engines. Unfortunately, nobody had spotted the time bomb lurking in the code, a zero that engineers were supposed to remove while installing the software.- When the Yorktown’s computer system tried to divide by zero, 80,000 horsepower instantly became worthless.LEARNING TO COUNT- In the very beginning of mathematics, it seems that people could only distinguish between one and many.- Over time, primitive languages evolved to distinguish between one, two, and many, and eventually one, two, three, many, but didn’t have terms for higher numbers.TALLYING UP LARGER GROUPS OF NUMBERS- The early Greeks, for instance, used the word “fiving” to describe the process of tallying.- In English, eleven and twelve seem to be derived from “one over [ten]” and “two over [ten],” while thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and so on are contractions of “three and ten,” “four and ten,” and “five and ten.”GEOMETRY CREATED BECAUSE THE NILE FLOODED- The bad news was that the river destroyed many of the boundary markers, erasing all of the landmarks that told farmers which land was theirs to cultivate. (The Egyptians took property rights very seriously.- The ancient pharaohs assigned surveyors to assess the damage and reset the boundary markers, and thus geometry was born.- Egyptians were of a practical bent. They never progressed beyond measuring volumes and counting days and hours. Mathematics wasn’t used for anything impractical, except their system of astrology.FROM THE EGYPTIANS TO THE GREEKS- The Greeks were different; they embraced the abstract and the philosophical, and brought mathematics to its highest point in ancient times.- Instead of using pictures to represent numbers as the Egyptians did, the Greeks used letters.ZERO ENTERS THE EQUATION- Babylonian style of counting. And thanks to this system, zero finally appeared in the East, in the Fertile Crescent of present-day Iraq.ZERO STARTS OUT AS MERELY A PLACEHOLDER- Zero was born out of the need to give any given sequence of Babylonian digits a unique, permanent meaning.- Though zero was useful, it was only a placeholder. It was merely a symbol for a blank place in the abacus, a column where all the stones were at the bottom. It did little more than make sure digits fell in the right places; it didn’t really have a numerical value of its own.- Zero was a digit, not a number. It had no value.MANY WESTERNERS FOUND ZERO (AND INFINITY) TO BE SCARY- It is hard to imagine being afraid of a number. Yet zero was inexorably linked with the void—with nothing. There was a primal fear of void and chaos. There was also a fear of zero. Most ancient peoples believed that only emptiness and chaos were present before the universe came to be.- Multiplying by zero collapses the number line. But dividing by zero destroys the entire framework of mathematics.- The Greek universe, created by Pythagoras, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, survived long after the collapse of Greek civilization. In that universe there is no such thing as nothing. There is no zero. Because of this, the West could not accept zero for nearly two millennia.- This is the biggest failure in Greek mathematics, and it is the only thing that kept them from discovering calculus.- Aristotle just wished infinity away by stating that it is simply a construct of the human mind.INDIA- Hinduism was steeped in the symbolism of duality.- Indian mathematicians did more than simply accept zero. They transformed it, changing its role from mere placeholder to number. This reincarnation was what gave zero its power.- Our numbers evolved from the symbols that the Indians used; by rights they should be called Indian numerals rather than Arabic ones- Instead, they saw the interplay of numerals—numbers stripped of their geometric significance. This was the birth of what we now know as algebra.- Once numbers shed their geometric significance, mathematicians no longer had to worry about mathematical operations making geometric sense...You can’t remove a three-acre swath from a two-acre field, but nothing prevents you from subtracting three from two. Nowadays we recognize that 2 – 3=–1: negative one.ZERO BECOMES A NUMBER AND NO LONGER JUST A PLACE HOLDER- Just as 2 – 3 was now a number, so was 2 – 2. It was zero. Not just a mere placeholder zero that represents an empty space on the abacus, but zero the number.MUSLIMS LEARN FROM INDIA- Along the way to China, the Muslims conquered India. And there the Arabs learned about Indian numerals.- one of its first scholars was the mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi. Al-Khowarizmi wrote several important books, like Al-jabr wa’l muqabala, a treatise on how to solve elementary equations; the Al-jabr in the title (which means something like “completion”) gave us the term algebra.- algorithms, the tricks for multiplying and dividing Hindu numerals quickly...the word algorithm was a corruption of al-Khowarizmi’s name.MANY IN THE WEST STILL RELUCTANT TO ADOPT ZERO- In 1299, Florence banned Arabic numerals...Italian merchants continued to use them, and even used them to send encrypted messages—which is how the word cipher came to mean “secret code.”ZERO ENTERS INTO WESTERN ART- It was an Italian architect, Filippo Brunelleschi, who first demonstrated the power of an infinite zero: he created a realistic painting by using a vanishing point.- A point is a zero-dimensional object...This zero-dimensional object, the vanishing point, is an infinitesimal dot on the canvas that represents a spot infinitely far away from the viewer- It is no coincidence that zero and infinity are linked in the vanishing point. Just as multiplying by zero causes the number line to collapse into a point, the vanishing point has caused most of the universe to sit in a tiny dot. This is a singularity, a concept that became very important later in the history of science—ZERO AND COORDINATES- “I am in a sense something intermediate between God and nought.” —RENÉ DESCARTES, DISCOURSE ON METHOD- Descartes was a mathematician-philosopher; perhaps his most lasting legacy was a mathematical invention—what we now call Cartesian coordinates.- Descartes realized that he could not start his two reference lines, or axes, with the number 1.- Descartes quickly realized how powerful his coordinate system was. He used it to turn figures and shapes into equations and numbers; with Cartesian coordinates every geometric object—squares, triangles, wavy lines—could be represented by an equation, a mathematical relationship.- No longer were the Western art of geometry and the Eastern art of algebra separate domains.INFINITY- This is the definition of the infinite: it is something that can stay the same size even when you subtract from it.ZERO- Zero is behind all of the big puzzles in physics. The infinite density of the black hole is a division by zero. The big bang creation from the void is a division by zero. The infinite energy of the vacuum is a division by zero. Yet dividing by zero destroys the fabric of mathematics and the framework of logic—and threatens to undermine the very basis of science.- All that scientists know is the cosmos was spawned from nothing, and will return to the nothing from whence it came. The universe begins and ends with zero.PHYSICS- [Note: The second half of the book deals with how zero and infinity correspond to physics topics such as black holes, string theory, etc. Although interesting, I chose not to share too many excerpts.]*** *** *** *** ***HAHA- The Reformation was begun by Martin Luther while he was on the toilet (he suffered from chronic constipation): https://www.smh.com.au/world/toilet-w...- Estimated temperatures of heaven and hell (based on physics): http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/...FACTOIDS- 10,000—the myriad, the biggest grouping in the Greek system.- The Babylonians, like many different cultures, had invented machines that helped them count. The most famous was the abacus...The words calculate, calculus, and calcium all come from the Latin word for pebble: calculus.- In modern schools, children learn of Pythagoras for his famed theorem: the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. However, this was in fact ancient news. It was known more than 1,000 years before Pythagoras’s time.- stadium (the standard Greek unit of long distance)- (Our word noon comes from the word nones, the midday prayer service of medieval clergy.)- The Indian name for zero was sunya, meaning “empty,” which the Arabs turned into sifr. When some Western scholars described the new number to their colleagues, they turned sifr into a Latin-sounding word, yielding zephirus, which is the root of our word zero. Other Western mathematicians didn’t change the word so heavily and called zero cifra, which became cipher. Zero was so important to the new set of numbers that people started calling all numbers ciphers, which gave the French their term chiffre, digit.- The Germans called the counting board a Rechenbank, which is why we call moneylenders banks.- Not only did they use counting boards, they used tally sticks to record loans: a money value was written along the stick’s side, and it was split in two. The lender kept the biggest piece, the stock. After all, he was the stockholder.- Descartes thought that these numbers were even worse than negative numbers; he came up with a scornful name for the square roots of negatives: imaginary numbers.

Unfortunately, Zero is a little TOO pop-math - it hits on the same ""interesting"" math and physics tidbits that so many other pop-math and science books do. And while it relates all of its ideas to zero, it's not really about zero.The first half does talk about the historical context of the concept of zero, but it is mostly about philosophy - how the concepts of zero and infinity affected science and religion of the time. Just when I was hoping for some math, the book switches to a by-discipline survery of, again, math and phyiscs all-star fun factoids, including Fibonacci sequences, the golden ratio, set theory, numbers larger than infinity, wormholes, etc., etc. There were some ideas in there I had not read about before, like projective geometry, but for the most part, Hawking, Bryson, and popular math authors have covered this.So, for me, it was rehash. If you have not read much pop-math, this book is very interesting, although it definitely requires a late-high school understanding of algebra and physics to make sense.

271,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16896341-sotiris-makrygiannis,3,"First I start by changing my score criteria and start scoring lower, than higher.This is a good book on the history of Zero. We had 1000s of years without. Look around there is nothing zero, zero was invented for practical reasons. Greeks and many others hated it but mathematically they had a problem with long numbers. Zero is a dangerous idea, got converted to philosophy and find a way to enter also theology. The biography is rather complete with parts that are difficult mathematics but covers rather okish the part of philosophy and religion. Life is never zero so start searching what philosophies and policies are linked to maths and you will realize that everything is math, just avoid zero-sum games. Nihilism anyone? "

274,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,4,"This book has a great title. It’s one word, loaded with the essence of the cosmos. That essence lies within gravity, the force that governs the large agglomerations of matter and energy.Gravity pulls energy and matter into itself, to a point, a singularity, seen in black holes and in the pre-Big Bang moment. The logic of gravitational force takes this collapse of everything into one point where, mathematically, the increased density continues into infinity. The sole break to this “bottomless” conclusion is through the mathematical addition of zero. Zero is nothing (i.e., nothing that can be further subdivided). (1)Zero works at the smallest of the small as well. This is the quantum world where particles and sub-particles break down into formless energy, which is a “singularity” of a different sort. (2) The “many” particles and sub-particles lose identity and morph into some yet-to-be-identified “oneness,”collapsing to a point, which is a “zero” point, beyond which there is or can be nothing more. (3)Then Seife unites gravity and the quantum world. Energy collapses further and further, to the point of a singularity, which is where matter itself collapses into oneness (a formless One). Singularities are mathematical realities that continue forever unless a zero point is added to stop the infinite regress. And zero means that the cosmos, at the macro and micro levels, is ultimately, nothing. (4)This is all mind-blowing stuff. Seife anchors all of this in the philosophical thinking of the East and West (5). The latter did not have the concept of zero for philosophical reasons and struggled scientifically with its absence. It was only after zero was imported from the East that Western science could incorporate its significance into cosmological discussions. I struggled to follow his various lines of thought in this regard. On the whole, though, the book is a philosophical inspiration. As Seife has it, zero-nothing unites philosophy and physics. Cosmic energy is a fixed amount (the conservation of energy, which is also an eternal notion). But that amount changes form and moves perpetually from high to low and from low to high, seeking its equilibrium – a point which is, and can only be, temporary, because energy changes forms and creates differences that in turn creates disequilibrium anew. It’s the Tao. It’s yang and yin. And it’s the three scenarios about the ultimate fate of the cosmos. (1) Zero also works at the opposite end of gravitational force as well. Zero is about a balance of energy. If the energy from the big bang expends itself, gravity pulls cosmic energy back into itself, the zero point (Big Crunch). If energy escapes the zero point, the cosmos expands and continues to the point of heat death, which is another zero point because there’s no energy differential (high to low energy). If cosmic expansion is stopped by gravity, stasis (equilibrium state) is zero as well.(2) Seife doesn’t use this word here but it seems to apply. (3) “A zero in quantum mechanics means that the entire universe – including the vacuum – is filled with an infinite amount of energy: the zero-point energy. This, in turn, leads to the most bizarre zero in the universe: the phantom force of nothing.” (4) Seife quotes Feynman who writes “The problem is, when we try to calculate all the way down to zero distance, the equation blows up in our face and gives us meaningless answers – things like infinity.” String theory is a way out of this dilemma because it sees, Seife writes, “every particle as a vibrating string rather than as a dot…In string theory, zero has been banished from the universe; there is no such thing as zero distance or zero time. This solves all the infinity problems of quantum mechanics.”(5) In the East, “The goal of the Hindu,” Seife writes, “is to free the Atman entirely from the cycle of rebirth, to stop wandering from death to death. The way to achieve the ultimate liberation through lifelessness is to cease paying heed to the illusion of reality. ‘The body, the house of the spirit, is under the power of pleasure and pain,’ explains a god. ‘And if a man is ruled by his body then this man can never be free.’ But once you are able to separate yourself from the whims of the flesh and embrace the silence and nothingness of your soul, you will be liberated. Your Atman will fly from the web of human desire and join the collective consciousness – the infinite soul that suffuses the universe at once everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It is infinity, and it is nothing. So India, as a society that actively explored the void and the infinite, accepted zero.” In the West, the Greeks “didn’t have the concept of a limit because they didn’t believe in zero.” An infinite series “seemed to get smaller and smaller without any particular end in sight. As a result, the Greeks couldn’t handle the infinite. They pondered the concept of the void but rejected zero as a number, and they toyed with the concept of the infinite but refused to allow infinity – numbers that are infinitely small and infinitely large – anywhere near the realm of numbers.” This resistance was tied up with a religious worldview. The infinite regressed into a bottomless void, without a beginning. That notion conflicted with God as the beginning point of creation and movement in the world. Zero allowed the void, nothing, to exist. That removed God and it was, therefore, atheistic. "

279,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21160019-sudeep,4,"I’m becoming more and more convinced of the power of teaching science and philosophy as a history - The progression of thought is for all to see; Human endeavour and collaboration more clearly visible. Contrast that with how science is usually thought in schools, where it seems like some genius just discovered/invented things in isolation, without any context or need. Students are not even sure why the scientist was working on that problem, and is colossally boring.Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea is presented in a similar vein. I loved the progression of chapters and how the history of science, mathematics and even philosophy was on show here. However, the concept of zero seemed to be forcefully injected and mixed with the major historical points, and that remains my only complaint of the book. If you can tolerate that (and I believe one can), it’s a very rewarding read.Here’s a brief history of Zero:* Initially mathematics was closely linked to practicality (counting sheep for example), and there was no need for the number zero in practical matters. Although the Egyptians and the Greeks progressed significantly in geometry, there was no use for the number zero in measuring dimensions of geometric objects. So, zero remained outside of mathematics.* The Greeks abhorred the concept of void and infinite. They were stumped with the paradox of Zeno. (The author even goes on to say not accepting zero was the “only thing that kept the Greeks from discovering calculus” - seems like a stretch for me).* Once the Roman empire fell, the dark ages started. The medieval scholars rather than looking at their peers for ideas, turned to the Greeks - Aristotle and Neoplatonists. Apart from other philosophical ideas (like the glorification of idealism), they inherited their fear for zero and infinity.Zero was still not on the numeric scale, and explains why we get a “jump” from 1 BC to 1 AD.* Zero goes East: After being rejected by the West for years, zero finally reached India (via Alexander’s invasion). The Indian mathematicians readily accepted the Babylonian numeral system (which had no special standalone symbol for zero, but zero was still used to distinguish 1 from 10 from 100 etc.)Aryabhatta is said to have positioned zero on the numeral system, from which our present day base-10 numeral system is derived.* Islamic invasion of India: Islam would take zero from India - and it was readily adopted in Italy, thanks to a one famous mathematician Fibonacci. Italian merchants were quick to seize upon the new numeral system (Arabic numbers), which allowed them to get rid of counting boards and make things simpler. Florence banned the Arabic numerals, but it was not so easy to dispense with; The Italian merchants continued using it, and the government had to relent in the face of commercial pressure.* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: Vanishing pointsThe Italian architect, Filippo, created a realistic painting using a vanishing point. A vanishing point is essentially a single dot, a zero, which contains the rest of the universe.* Introductions of zero in art and science: Cartesian coordinate systemRene Descartes introduces his Cartesian coordinate system, which is the first systematic link between Euclidean geometry and algebra. The points for a particular curve on such a system are the “zeros” for a particular equation: (x,y) for which f(x,y) = 0* Introductions (metaphorical?) of zero in art and science: VacuumVacuum has been a point of debate since Greeks. But Evangelista Torricelli is the first to study it empirically. He created the first laboratory vacuum - the torricellian vacuum, by filling a long glass tube filled to one end by mercury, and then inverting it in a bowl to contain the mercury.Pascal proves that it wasn’t nature’s abhorrence of vacuum that pushes the mercury up the tube, but rather atmospheric pressure. Vacuums don’t suck, atmosphere pushes. Pascal’s simple experiment demolished Aristotle’s assertion that nature abhors the vacuum. * Infidel Mathematics : The useful infinitesimalsInfinitesimals (extremely small numbers) starts making its way into mathematics. Kepler, in his attempt to calculate the volume of a crudely shaped wine barrel, chopped up the barrels - in his mind--into an infinite number of infinitely small pieces, and then added them back together to get the volume.Mathematicians use this infinitesimals to solve the problem of tangents - a line that just kisses a curve. It had important implications in studying motion - for example, you are swinging a ball tied to a thread above your head, if you cut off the string abruptly, the ball flies off into a tangent. Building on the idea of infinitesimals, Newton and Leibniz discover/invent calculus. The mathematicians are still grappling with the logical and philosophical problems of infinitesimals, but because of its accuracy and practical purpose, they accept it.It was finally with L’Hospital’s rule that trouble of 0/0, which plagued calculus could be resolved (though partially). The key was to make the infinitesimals carefully “tend towards zero”. Clever manipulations allowed one to resolve other odd expressions like ∞/∞, 00 and ∞0.It was finally with d’Alembert’s idea of limits that solved caculus’s problem with zeroes. He also resolved the Zeno’s paradox by boiling it down to a a sum of infinite number of ever-diminishing quantities. * Two sides of the same coin: IntroductionAlgebraic equations have roots - points where the value of the equation equals 0. Descartes refused to accept negative numbers as roots of an equation, calling them false roots. He also never extended his coordinate system beyond zero. He was even more disgusted by square roots of negative numbers, giving them a scornful name - imaginary numbers.Two developments here bridge the gap between zero and inifinity - projective geometry and the complex plane.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Projective geometryJean-Victor Poncelet was a mathematician in the Napoleon’s army, and was captured by Russia. In prison he found a new discipline: projective geometry. His work was the culmination of the work done by artists like Filippo and Da Vinci - learning to project 3d images on 2d planes, making use of, among other things, the vanishing point.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: The Complex PlaneGauss, an 18th century Mathematics prodigy was able to map out complex numbers on cartesian plane (which is called complex plane) - the vertical axis represents the imaginary numbers, while the horizontal axis represents real number. He also figured that operations like multiplication, addition etc. have geometric implications in the complex plane. For instance, multiplying a point by i, causes it turn anti-clockwise by 90 degrees. This was the second big advance.* Two sides of the same coin - Zero and infinity: Reimann SphereRiemann, a student of Gauss, married the ideas of projective geometry and complex plane and “…all of a sudden lines became circles, circles become lines, and zero and infinity became the poles on a globe full of numbers.” Gauss figures out that all infinities are not the same - the infinity of real numbers (uncountable infinity) is much greater than the infinity of rational numbers (countable infinity).* Zero (and infinity) in Physics (I'll rush on this)From here on the rest of the book talks about occurrences of zero (or infinity) in physics - zero kelvin (minimum possible temperature), or black holes, the Casimir effect (forces applied by a vacuum), string theory, the big bang, and the fate of the universe (via heat death)."

Following this model, students could use the ""My____History"" (Gallagher 79) or the '""You Should Know"" (Gallagher 88) Biographical Paper' strategies. Students could write their own stories, detailing where they came from, how they have impacted others in their lives, and the impact they are currently having. Or, students could choose a person or perhaps a topic (such as zero) to practice writing a history of how that topic came into being, again how others have reacted to it or been impacted by it, and how its existence is affecting the world today.Pairing this text with the above strategies would not only allow students to learn new information about the technology they are immersed in, but would also allow them to reflect on and write about their own sense of identities."
281,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63312978-ben-jackson,2,"For full transparency, I read about 3/4 of this book and put it down. The book is a thoroughly researched and well written historical account of the history of zero, but more broadly the history of mathematics. We take zero for granted, but for most of human history we were unaware of its existence, and until only recently we denied its existence. Zero has many unusual properties and became the key to unlocking complicated mathematics like calculus and physics and indeed our understanding of the earth and the heavens. The first half was most interesting.So why did I give up? The book becomes intensely technical about halfway through, to a degree that only mathematicians can truly appreciate. It couldn’t hold my interest. I recommend this book for true math nerds. For casual math nerds, I instead recommend Jordan Ellenberg’s _How Not to be Wrong_, which Bill Gates describes as “a love letter to math.”"
282,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54161476-alexander-thomas,3,"I enjoyed the book and got through it fairly quickly. The first part of the book nicely brings about how the number zero moved from east to west and the impact of the idea on western philosophy and mathematics. Seife then explains how integration and differentiation solve tricky problems where zero is involved to make sense out of equations. The final third of the book is about singularities and the big bang - zero from a cosmological perspective. Good book, and I'd have give it 4 stars, but I docked one star because of a couple of things - Seife's breathless commentary: ""zero holds the secret to our existance"", ""the ultimate fate of the cosmos lies in zero"" and Seife's insistence to treat the vacuum and the void as regions of zero activity despite (as he also later writes) the abundance of virtual particles (meaning it's clearly non-zero). Seife also, in the first part of the book, stand on a pedestal to sniffily chastise the Aristotelian view of the universe without showing enough sympathy to the fact that they (the Aristotelians) were products of their time. Perhaps Seife should realise that he's not on a pedestal, but on the shoulders of giants."

I read a lot of that genre in high school, for whatever strange reason, so I am reasonably familiar with it. In the years since high school, I have moved on from being a pop scientist to a pop historian, and I think for that reason I preferred the historical half of this book, as opposed to the latter half, which is a whistle-stop tour of the most complex mathematical and physics advances of the twentieth-century. Seife pulled off this second half just fine, considering these topics are basically impossible to explain in any intuitive or comprehensible way to the armchair physicists like me."

The association between infinity and zero is something that I hadn't thought about prior to reading it. It also does a great job of explaining things like black holes and absolute zero temperature. The book seems, though, to switch about two thirds through, at first the book is a delightful romp in which zero is a character, a funny little imp that historically was either ignored or minimized. However once zero is introduced and history catches up with the 20th century, zero puts its big-boy pants on and gets down to business in modern physics. Some of the physics at the end of the book was a bit beyond me, but I liked the books premise that zero and its pal infinity are not just useful constructs but are necessary, and indeed absolutely essential, to our understand of the universe. The book makes you think. High praise indeed. Zero (the book) is not for everyone but if you enjoy thinking about the scientific/mathematical enterprise and how it has developed over time, I would recommend it."

294,0140296476,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5986736-ashwini-nocaste,4,"Thanks to the mathematics of zero and infinity, Pascal concluded that one should assume that God exists – from Zero : The Biography of a Dangerous IdeaGod’s Debris – by Scott Adams is an interesting novella that tries to in a way put out a belief model where the universe and its constituents are explained as “God’s Debris” – the primordial sea of pre-big bang existence that got sprinkled into living existence as we perceive it today. No one knows or can easily surmise as to what exactly happened one second before the big bang took place. In the book “Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea” – author Charles Seife attempts to explain the suffusion of the idea of zero throughout our existence and hints at the possibility of zero being at the beginning as well as at the end of our existence.If one accepts the universe as a sprinkling of God’s Dust formed out of the primordial sea that existed pre-big bang (which in Charles Seife’s view is nothing but something as close to what Zero signifies), then it can be taken as granted that all forms in perceivable existence today are representations of constituents which when trussed together will be an exact replica of the pre-big bang primordial sea. But as Charles Seife indicates that zero must have existed before and at the beginning of big bang – it leads me to a hypothetical assumption that the sum total of the entire universe must be equal to what Zero signifies – an idea which takes into account the anti-matter argument posed by Stephen Hawkings in “A Brief History of Time” – where the positive matter resulted in the observable universe and the negative matter – i.e., anti-matter exists as non-existence, a concept not easily graspable by our faculties.Any number divided by Zero can result in infinity. As an example, suppose a packet of 50 toffies is to be distributed. If it is to be distributed to 25 people, then the number 50 is to be divided by 25 to result in 2 toffies in the hands of each individual. But if 0 toffies were to be distributed, then one can go on distributing 50 toffies to as many people as possible (of course in this case, no one will get anything in their hands). Thus a number divided by zero tends to infinity. But Zero is also a number – so can it be argued that 0/0 is equal to infinity? An absurd conclusion of course – because it seems that nothing divided by nothing results in everything : an absurd conclusion – but something which is very close to the nature of existence as we understand it today. We know that the universe is expanding and the discovery of that fact by Hubble led one to the conclusion that the universe was once closely packed into a primordial soup – but what could have caused the explosion and whether the universe will infinitely expand or will there be a limit? An external source of energy or force acting on the primordial soup? Well it would be naïve to argue that propulsion of the primordial soup into an expanding universe is owed to the agency of an external force – since that is a physical law steeped in our earthly surroundings – and which might not have existed in operation at all during pre-big bang. So does that imply, the initiative must have come from within? If the initiative had come from within, then why at that point of time only – and why it all had to come about in the first place? It could have continued as a dense primordial soup?Could Zero be God? An exact assimilation of the sum-total consciousness in the pre-big bang arrangement but which has got scattered round the universe and now exists as a harmless looking Zero? This concept is not new and thinkers of lore have attempted to discover God in the concept of Zero. In my opinion, offered merely as a thought and not as firm conviction, what Zero signified in the pre-big bang set-up lost its power and energy as it suffused out across the length and breadth of the universe-so much so that it now became worthy of only a concept that exists as a human thought – which leads one to the natural question – whether zero as a concept, not as a numerical entity, but as a thought representing the void – also graspable by animals?Another interesting thought that can there be is – What value to give to Zero? Should it signify a void – a nothingness? Has Zero been devised to signify a void only because our perceptions of existence imply “not nothingness”. What if the pre-big bang moment is not the Zeroth hour but just another point among several points as denoted by numbers on a numberline? As a personal belief, it is difficult for me to grasp that there was a big bang – but I do not shy away from believing in the possibility of an inter-dimensional change from a certain dimension to the other. As to whether the Universe is infinite or finite, the riddle lies in the resolution of the concept of Time; but Time as we have been thoroughly ingrained to accept is the Solar notion of time based on earth’s rotation/revolution around the Sun. Time as it really exists devoid of a reference point is a difficult concept for me to conjure."

They are equal and opposite, yin and yang. They are equally paradoxical and troubling. The biggest questions in science and religion are about nothingness and eternity, the void and the infinite, zero and infinity.ZERO: POWERFUL ENOUGH TO STOP A WARSHIP- Zero hit the USS Yorktown like a torpedo. On September 21, 1997, while cruising off the coast of Virginia, the billion-dollar missile cruiser shuddered to a halt.- The Yorktown’s computers had just received new software that was controlling the engines. Unfortunately, nobody had spotted the time bomb lurking in the code, a zero that engineers were supposed to remove while installing the software.- When the Yorktown’s computer system tried to divide by zero, 80,000 horsepower instantly became worthless.LEARNING TO COUNT- In the very beginning of mathematics, it seems that people could only distinguish between one and many.- Over time, primitive languages evolved to distinguish between one, two, and many, and eventually one, two, three, many, but didn’t have terms for higher numbers.TALLYING UP LARGER GROUPS OF NUMBERS- The early Greeks, for instance, used the word “fiving” to describe the process of tallying.- In English, eleven and twelve seem to be derived from “one over [ten]” and “two over [ten],” while thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, and so on are contractions of “three and ten,” “four and ten,” and “five and ten.”GEOMETRY CREATED BECAUSE THE NILE FLOODED- The bad news was that the river destroyed many of the boundary markers, erasing all of the landmarks that told farmers which land was theirs to cultivate. (The Egyptians took property rights very seriously.- The ancient pharaohs assigned surveyors to assess the damage and reset the boundary markers, and thus geometry was born.- Egyptians were of a practical bent. They never progressed beyond measuring volumes and counting days and hours. Mathematics wasn’t used for anything impractical, except their system of astrology.FROM THE EGYPTIANS TO THE GREEKS- The Greeks were different; they embraced the abstract and the philosophical, and brought mathematics to its highest point in ancient times.- Instead of using pictures to represent numbers as the Egyptians did, the Greeks used letters.ZERO ENTERS THE EQUATION- Babylonian style of counting. And thanks to this system, zero finally appeared in the East, in the Fertile Crescent of present-day Iraq.ZERO STARTS OUT AS MERELY A PLACEHOLDER- Zero was born out of the need to give any given sequence of Babylonian digits a unique, permanent meaning.- Though zero was useful, it was only a placeholder. It was merely a symbol for a blank place in the abacus, a column where all the stones were at the bottom. It did little more than make sure digits fell in the right places; it didn’t really have a numerical value of its own.- Zero was a digit, not a number. It had no value.MANY WESTERNERS FOUND ZERO (AND INFINITY) TO BE SCARY- It is hard to imagine being afraid of a number. Yet zero was inexorably linked with the void—with nothing. There was a primal fear of void and chaos. There was also a fear of zero. Most ancient peoples believed that only emptiness and chaos were present before the universe came to be.- Multiplying by zero collapses the number line. But dividing by zero destroys the entire framework of mathematics.- The Greek universe, created by Pythagoras, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, survived long after the collapse of Greek civilization. In that universe there is no such thing as nothing. There is no zero. Because of this, the West could not accept zero for nearly two millennia.- This is the biggest failure in Greek mathematics, and it is the only thing that kept them from discovering calculus.- Aristotle just wished infinity away by stating that it is simply a construct of the human mind.INDIA- Hinduism was steeped in the symbolism of duality.- Indian mathematicians did more than simply accept zero. They transformed it, changing its role from mere placeholder to number. This reincarnation was what gave zero its power.- Our numbers evolved from the symbols that the Indians used; by rights they should be called Indian numerals rather than Arabic ones- Instead, they saw the interplay of numerals—numbers stripped of their geometric significance. This was the birth of what we now know as algebra.- Once numbers shed their geometric significance, mathematicians no longer had to worry about mathematical operations making geometric sense...You can’t remove a three-acre swath from a two-acre field, but nothing prevents you from subtracting three from two. Nowadays we recognize that 2 – 3=–1: negative one.ZERO BECOMES A NUMBER AND NO LONGER JUST A PLACE HOLDER- Just as 2 – 3 was now a number, so was 2 – 2. It was zero. Not just a mere placeholder zero that represents an empty space on the abacus, but zero the number.MUSLIMS LEARN FROM INDIA- Along the way to China, the Muslims conquered India. And there the Arabs learned about Indian numerals.- one of its first scholars was the mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khowarizmi. Al-Khowarizmi wrote several important books, like Al-jabr wa’l muqabala, a treatise on how to solve elementary equations; the Al-jabr in the title (which means something like “completion”) gave us the term algebra.- algorithms, the tricks for multiplying and dividing Hindu numerals quickly...the word algorithm was a corruption of al-Khowarizmi’s name.MANY IN THE WEST STILL RELUCTANT TO ADOPT ZERO- In 1299, Florence banned Arabic numerals...Italian merchants continued to use them, and even used them to send encrypted messages—which is how the word cipher came to mean “secret code.”ZERO ENTERS INTO WESTERN ART- It was an Italian architect, Filippo Brunelleschi, who first demonstrated the power of an infinite zero: he created a realistic painting by using a vanishing point.- A point is a zero-dimensional object...This zero-dimensional object, the vanishing point, is an infinitesimal dot on the canvas that represents a spot infinitely far away from the viewer- It is no coincidence that zero and infinity are linked in the vanishing point. Just as multiplying by zero causes the number line to collapse into a point, the vanishing point has caused most of the universe to sit in a tiny dot. This is a singularity, a concept that became very important later in the history of science—ZERO AND COORDINATES- “I am in a sense something intermediate between God and nought.” —RENÉ DESCARTES, DISCOURSE ON METHOD- Descartes was a mathematician-philosopher; perhaps his most lasting legacy was a mathematical invention—what we now call Cartesian coordinates.- Descartes realized that he could not start his two reference lines, or axes, with the number 1.- Descartes quickly realized how powerful his coordinate system was. He used it to turn figures and shapes into equations and numbers; with Cartesian coordinates every geometric object—squares, triangles, wavy lines—could be represented by an equation, a mathematical relationship.- No longer were the Western art of geometry and the Eastern art of algebra separate domains.INFINITY- This is the definition of the infinite: it is something that can stay the same size even when you subtract from it.ZERO- Zero is behind all of the big puzzles in physics. The infinite density of the black hole is a division by zero. The big bang creation from the void is a division by zero. The infinite energy of the vacuum is a division by zero. Yet dividing by zero destroys the fabric of mathematics and the framework of logic—and threatens to undermine the very basis of science.- All that scientists know is the cosmos was spawned from nothing, and will return to the nothing from whence it came. The universe begins and ends with zero.PHYSICS- [Note: The second half of the book deals with how zero and infinity correspond to physics topics such as black holes, string theory, etc. Although interesting, I chose not to share too many excerpts.]*** *** *** *** ***HAHA- The Reformation was begun by Martin Luther while he was on the toilet (he suffered from chronic constipation): https://www.smh.com.au/world/toilet-w...- Estimated temperatures of heaven and hell (based on physics): http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/...FACTOIDS- 10,000—the myriad, the biggest grouping in the Greek system.- The Babylonians, like many different cultures, had invented machines that helped them count. The most famous was the abacus...The words calculate, calculus, and calcium all come from the Latin word for pebble: calculus.- In modern schools, children learn of Pythagoras for his famed theorem: the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. However, this was in fact ancient news. It was known more than 1,000 years before Pythagoras’s time.- stadium (the standard Greek unit of long distance)- (Our word noon comes from the word nones, the midday prayer service of medieval clergy.)- The Indian name for zero was sunya, meaning “empty,” which the Arabs turned into sifr. When some Western scholars described the new number to their colleagues, they turned sifr into a Latin-sounding word, yielding zephirus, which is the root of our word zero. Other Western mathematicians didn’t change the word so heavily and called zero cifra, which became cipher. Zero was so important to the new set of numbers that people started calling all numbers ciphers, which gave the French their term chiffre, digit.- The Germans called the counting board a Rechenbank, which is why we call moneylenders banks.- Not only did they use counting boards, they used tally sticks to record loans: a money value was written along the stick’s side, and it was split in two. The lender kept the biggest piece, the stock. After all, he was the stockholder.- Descartes thought that these numbers were even worse than negative numbers; he came up with a scornful name for the square roots of negatives: imaginary numbers.

It's kind of fun, but mostly educational.2.5 stars out of 5. A step above textbook-level dryness but a step below pop-science narrative, this one stops being pleasurable to read after about 75 pages when it begins to retread similar ground (how zero was/wasn't explored as a concept in various ancient civilizations). Later the author shifts from cultural history and towards summaries of much drier mathematical concepts and their development, at which point we're really straining the use of ""biography"" in the title. But I will say this book's got the most concise and comprehensible explanation of string theory that I've ever come across, and that's certainly worth your time.(Read in 2017, the twenty-sixth book in my Alphabetical Reading Challenge)"

But for the time being, it appears that nothing will come of nothing.” (p. 189)“Zero dwells at the juxtaposition of quantum mechanics and relativity; zero lives where the two theories meet, and zero causes the two theories to clash. A black hole is a zero in the equations of general relativity; the energy of the vacuum is a zero in the mathematics of quantum theory. The big bang, the most puzzling event in the history of the universe, is a zero in both theories. The universe came from nothing – and both theories break down when they try to explain the origin of the cosmos.” (p. 192)"
