It's really fantastic, and I want to recommend it to EVERYONE, but in my heart I know the tone would bore some of my friends... I suggest thinking of the author/narrator as a cool guy you'd be friends with telling you all this information, instead of a nerdy/haughty *scientist* ...He's not a scientist, he's a writer & former editor, & this isn't a textbook, but it could be--he's done his research & includes all his references. Just slightly out-of-date (published in 1999) since genetics is such a fast-progressing area of knowledge but overall not ""dated"" or off-base.As for the content, WOW! Changed the way I think about evolution & heredity (duh), human biology, history, & psychology, disease, medicine, food, sexuality, instinct, intelligence, personality, behavior, EVERYTHING. Eye-opening in a way that encourages wonder rather than only prescribing answers.If you can't stomach the whole book, browse the Table of Contents &/or the Index & pick out a chapter or two--they're fairly self-contained so you can get away with skipping around, and I guarantee you will learn something cool."
1,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"I wish I had read this book 19 years ago, when it was first published. Now, it is out of date. In fact, the Bibliography and Notes section mentions that the book was already out of date, as new knowledge is growing at a very fast rate. Nevertheless, the book is fascinating, even if modern genetic technologies are not even mentioned--as they were not yet invented at the time of publication!We often read that 98% of our genetic letters are in common with chimpanzees, and 97% with gorillas. But, I was amazed to read that humans share exactly the same number and types of bones with chimpanzees, the same chemicals in our brains. We have the same types of immune, digestive, vascular, lymph, and nervous systems. So, it must be the remaining 2% of our gene structures that differentiate humans from chimpanzees.All sorts of nature-vs.-nurture issues are addressed in this book. The book contains a remarkable table of IQ correlations. For identical twins reared together, the correlation is 86%. For twins reared apart, 76%. For biological siblings, 47%. For adopted children living together, the correlation is 0%. These statistics say a lot about the relative importance of nature vs. nurture. And, remarkably, as one ages from childhood to adolescence to adulthood, the importance of heritability of IQ increases!Evolution by natural selection is about the ""competition between genes, using individual and occasionally societies as their temporary vehicles.... The body's survival is secondary to the goal of getting another generation started."" Genes act as if they have selfish goals, an idea first proposed and made popular by Richard Dawkins in his famous book, The Selfish Gene.I learned from this book that men and women are most attracted to body odors of people of the opposite sex who are most different from them genetically, in terms of MHC genes that govern resistance to parasite intruders, by the immune system. Also, I learned how genes can be expressed due to the release of cortisol and other hormones during periods of stress. For example, people living near the Three Mile Island nuclear plant at the time of the accident had more cancers than expected. But, these cancers were not due to radiation exposure, as there was none, but due to heightened cortisol levels, which which reduced the effectiveness of the immune system.Genes need to be switched on in order to work. External events and free-willed behavior can switch on genes. Genes are not omnipotent; they are at the mercy of our behavior. Another remarkable fact is that the status of a person's job is a better predictor of the likelihood of a heart attack, than obesity or high blood pressure. Someone in a low-grade job is four times more likely to have a heart attack than a high-grade job. The reason is that low-grade jobs lead to the lack of control over one's fate, leading to an increase in stress hormones, followed by a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. This may explain why unemployment and welfare dependency help to make people ill. It is not understood why we and all animals have evolved in such a way that stress suppresses our immune systems.The most important lesson from the book is repeated over and over again, ""Genes are not there to cause diseases."" Gene mutations can lead to disease, and sometimes there is a balancing effect between resistance to one disease at the expense of being susceptible to another disease.This is an excellent book, very readable, and quite engaging. The author gets into some technical detail at times, without getting too bogged down in jargon. I recommend this book for anyone interested in genetics. My only reservation about it, is the fact that it is already quite out of date due to the rate of increasing knowledge about genetics."
2,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Ridley takes on a number of controversial topics. These include the genome’s influence on intelligence, sexual orientation, personality and free will; genetically modified foods, eugenics and testing for incurable diseases. He explains how genes function, their structure, and how they shape our bodies and minds. The book was written in 1999 so some of it may be dated. Below are my notes.Genes are turned on and off throughout our life often dependent on environmental factors. Some genes code for proteins but many are simply switches dictating when another gene will be active. A good example of this is asthma driven by a variety of genes in different combinations all dependent on environmental stimulus. Huntington’s disease is an example of a genetic defect that doesn’t show up until late in life.Every cell contains a complete set of genes. This is evident in the growth of a fertilized egg. It grows into a blob and then differentiates. There is no central control. Each cell independently knows where it should go, what it should become. Specialized developmental genes turn on and off at each step often repeating the processes of our evolutionary ancestors. That we are self-assembled from a single cell is perhaps the most remarkable feat in genetics.In some sense the cells of the body act like a colony of ants or bees. Each has a specialized role and each may sacrifice itself for the good of the others, but not always. In cancer, cells have gone awry and there are tumor suppressor genes to take care of them. One is the well-known P.53 gene. However it too can become mutated and ineffective and virulent cancer results.Genes can be imprinted from their source, either paternal or maternal. Paternal and maternal genes may have distinct roles. Some areas of brain development come from the father’s genes, other areas from the mother’s. It is not an equal or random mix. Also just as physical sex is determined by genes so are many of the attitudes consistent with that sex. Girls like dolls and boys like trucks, not just because of their upbringing, but because it is in their genesTwo ways genes affect personality and behavior are through the production of dopamine and serotonin and their receptors. An extreme shortage of dopamine causes Parkinson’s, an extreme over abundance, schizophrenia. Dopamine is important to feeling pleasure. Many addictive drugs increase dopamine levels. People with fewer dopamine receptors take more risks. They need more stimulation to feel pleasure and thus have more adventurous personalities. Serotonin is a similar brain chemical that when very low can lead to impulsiveness and when very high lead to OCD. Increasing serotonin levels leads to a pleasure response. One way to increase serotonin is to increase insulin levels thus eating a bag of chocolate chip cookies can do the trick.Perhaps the most controversial area of genetics is its relationship to intelligence. The issue is especially problematic since no one can really define intelligence. IQ is a notoriously deficient indicator. But the discussion persists particularly with respect to race so here is the author’s take. Whatever IQ measures, it is 50% heritable. The rest is due to the environment including time spent in the womb, time at home, time at school and with peers. Blacks do score lower on IQ tests than whites, but to conclude that this is due to genes is fallacious. There is no evidence showing the difference is due to heritability and in fact blacks raised among whites perform just as well as whites on IQ tests.Taking on another controversy, Ridley cites studies indicating sexual orientation is 50% due to genes. A male child is much more likely to be gay if the mother’s brother is. Another factor in males according to Ridley is birth order. The more elder brothers the more probable a child is gay. This is likely due to antigens produced by three genes on the Y chromosome. Only males have the Y chromosome. These three genes are similar to one that codes a protein essential to masculinize the brain. The mother may build up an immune response to the antigens increasing with each successive male child. Genes responsible for genital development are not affected. How much of our behavior is hard wired? What is learned and subject to free choice and what is due to instinct? Language provides a good example of how both factors are at play. We learn language, hundreds of different ones, but their grammar is remarkably similar. People, particularly in childhood, have an instinct for grammar, an inherent ability to arrange words in a meaningful way. This ability diminishes after childhood making learning second languages harder. Who is in charge: the genes, the body or the mind? In fact it is chaos as each impacts the other. Genes predispose our behavior, but environmental factors activate genes. Take stress which causes the hormone cortisol to be produced. The mind becomes anxious, say because of an impending exam, and this causes the body to release the hormone cortisol. Cortisol switches on many genes in cells with receptors to it. Some of these genes dim down the immune system leaving us more vulnerable to infection. The feeling of stress can depend on our outlook, but the release of cortisol is an involuntary response by the body. Constant release of cortisol can lead to heart disease. Those who lack control over their life by being at the bottom of the economic pecking order suffer more from heart disease than those at the top.Do we have free will? The author believes genes predispose us to behaviors but we are still free to make choices. If a gene gives us an unhealthy craving for sweets we can still choose to overcome it, perhaps with the help of another gene that makes us want to look good or enjoy good health. Ridley attacks those who replace genetic determinism with social determinism. He points to the belief that children grow up to be child abusers because they were abused. Ridley says none of the studies supporting this have controlled for genetic influences, that the child of an abuser would have the same genetic disposition to be an abuser. He cites studies comparing the disparate outcomes of biological and adopted children of abusers to make his case.Genetically modified food has become very controversial despite many benefits. Partly this is for agricultural practices that some modifications encourage such as increased pesticide use. On the other hand increased productivity and nutrition can save many lives particularly in developing countries. Modified animals such as chimeric mice facilitate the testing of human genes to find out how they work. This can lead to new disease treatments which may be quite traditional such as altered diet. Would you want to be tested for an incurable disease? Huntington’s patients face this choice and soon Alzheimer’s patients may as well. Genetic screening is also a controversial issue because of the potential inappropriate use of information by insurance companies and employers.Eugenics gained steam in the early twentieth century. The US and many European countries sterilized the “feeble minded.” The idea was endorsed by prominent politicians and members of the scientific community. Sweden sterilized 60,000. Germany sterilized 400,000 of its psychiatric patients. It subsequently murdered 70,000 of them to provide beds for wounded soldiers in WWII. The German scenario did serve to wake up the rest of the world to eugenics’ end game. People were seen as cattle. There is no more appalling example of the misuse of science.If these topics catch your interest, it would be well worth your time to read the book. Ridley keeps the technical stuff to a minimum and has an engaging style. He also stakes out his own point of view on some controversial issues which encourages you to think through how you feel."
3,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5611008-kay,4,"A really great introduction to genetics. One of my friends, who studied chemistry in college, recommended the book to me. The book is divided into 23 chapters, representing the 23 different sets of chromosomes in the human body. The concept fascinated me, and I thought that if the author had enough of a sense of humor to write a book this way, why not give it a try?I'm not going to pretend that I understood 100% of the book, but the parts I did understand, I appreciated. While the writer does provide an introduction on how genes and DNA work, for most people who don't have a background in genetics, the amount of material will be overwhelming. My best advice is to skim to get the general idea and continue on. The principles will be repeated as you progress along the book, and this time they'll stick because they are illustrated using real life occurrences (for example, I now have a clearer understanding of how stress biologically affects our bodies). The concepts are intricate, but Matt Ridley does a great job breaking things down into digestible portions. Despite the title, each chapter does not go into a detailed account of the function of each set of chromosomes. Good thing, too, since each chromosome serves a variety of different functions. Instead, each chapter is divided up into themes. For example, the chapter Fate, which I found the most fascinating, sought to prove that a good portion of our lives is written in our genetic code. Ridley uses Huntington’s Disease to prove this point: he explains how Huntington’s is caused, why it happens in some people and not in others, and describes in detail how a repeating sequence of CAGs can determine at what age you start to show symptoms. What I appreciated the most, though, was that Ridley also pushes further to describe the ramifications of the disease—should doctors tell a patient that they have the disease and that they will develop symptoms at a certain age? Should patients inquire about whether or not they have the incurable, unavoidable disease? The book, while informative and intellectually stimulating, encourages us to ask very difficult questions that result from such issues. Rather than the detached scientist studying life through a microscope, Ridley actively engages with life, challenging and observing and questioning. Instead of the coldly yet carefully studied discourse on genetics it could have been, the book joins human life and genetics together in a compassionate way. Definitely recommended, and not just for the science-y people. "
4,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,2,"I gave Ridley's The Red Queen five stars when I read it half a decade ago, and The Rational Optimist one (and a longish review) when I read it in 2011. Genome, his most famous book, isn't quite as awful as the latter, but Ridley's godawful politics shine through often enough to irritate.His insistence on lauding free entreprise (even where it only exists in his imagination) and condescendingly cautioning against ``big government'' at every turn isn't even the most obnoxious part this time; if anything, that just neatly serves as a cautionary tale of the deleterious effects of American politics on an impressionable Tory.His stereotypically regressive views on sex and gender (which include not only a complete denial that trans people exist, but also views on gender roles and things boys inherently like versus things girls inherently like so comically extreme and poorly defended I would have believed them to be satire in any other context) are considerably more grating, and make me question whether the score I gave Red Queen—which is, after all, entirely about those things—wasn't a result of an excess of faith in humanity and red wine.The hypocritical chapter on eugenics, which decries the practice despite being sandwiched between two chapters implicitly defending it, is likely to annoy even people who don't particularly care about gender issues, and any remaining patience I had for Ridley he lost when he quoted Gould on IQ.There isn't enough of interest in the rest of the book to begin to salvage it, or to recommend it over any book on roughly the same subject. Skip it."
5,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3020662-douglas,5,"Even though this was written and published over 15 years ago, I found it relevant and revealing. Ridley is one of the better science writers, and this is assuredly his master work. Each chapter highlights a specific gene found on each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes. He repeatedly states that the book is not about disease, but it ultimately becomes a major theme and topic. The final chapters that discuss genetic determinism, eugenics, and nature vs nurture are treated with upmost care, empathy, and altogether brilliant writing. Ridley expresses his views by not expressing his views. How rare is that for a science writer? If he has a bias, it’s hard to tell here. Highly recommended and thoroughly engaging read. "
6,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,3,"It is interesting to me how, despite our best efforts, our preconceptions can totally shape our experiences. I was impressed when two biology majors in my school independently recommended this to book to me. Must be good, I thought. So, in the interest of honesty, I must disclose that my inflated expectations were probably the biggest contributor to my lackluster reaction. I had high hopes, and Ridley only partially delivered. In popular science, an easy way to divide books is by the occupation of the writer: scientist or journalist? Dawkins represents, to me, the high point of the scientist end; he does not pepper his books with interesting anecdotes and trivia, but concentrates on real theories and real dilemmas in science. He succeeds in making the reader feel like an insider rather than an outsider. On the other end of the spectrum is Bill Bryson’s wonderful Short History of Nearly Everything, which is overflowing with anecdotes and trivia; read that book, and you’ll be spewing interesting stories and facts to your friends for months. Where Dawkins is focused on the theoretical, Bryson concentrates on the human side of things. Bryson doesn’t pretend to be any kind of expert; rather, his journalistic background has honed his appreciation for the fascinating backstory, the compelling character, the revealing tidbit. He brings the scientists to life, and focuses on their personalities and circumstances. The reader is not left feeling like an insider to the world of science, but a very appreciative outsider. Ridley walks an uncomfortable medium in this book, and the result is decidedly mediocre. He has clearly spent a great deal of time familiarizing himself with the subject, and it shows; nevertheless, he is no expert. Ridley’s appreciation for the subject matter is not for its theoretical beauty, but for its social significance. He is exclusively interested, apparently, in humans (an unscientific prejudice!). This book combines research findings about the human genome with little biographies of scientists and narratives of their research. By the end, the reader feels neither like an insider nor an appreciative outsider. Rather, the reader feels like she has just read several science sections of the New York Times back to back. I’m really finding it difficult to say anything concrete about Ridley; it’s far easier to say what he is not. His writing is neither incompetent nor exceptional; the reader is never struck by a malformed sentence, nor do any sentences stick in the mind after the book is put down. His understanding of the material is neither superficial nor deep; the reader is given some discussions of the logic of the theories, but as quick sketches rather than detailed diagrams. His feeling for a good anecdote is neither substandard nor superb; he presents many interesting stories, but none so shocking, hilarious, or dramatic as could be found in, say, Bryson. In sum, this is an eminently mediocre book. To reiterate my above warning, I think my underwhelmed impression is due as much to my overblown expectations as to the quality of the book. By no means is this a bad book, and I’m sure it could be read by many with great interest; yet I expected a detailed exploration of the field of genetics, and instead got a series of stories about particular discoveries, which didn’t end up adding into a thorough picture of the field. Ridley perhaps stands in a much-needed middle ground between ‘deep’ scientists and ‘superficial’ journalists; but it is a middle-ground that I found fairly uninteresting."
7,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29931726-joel,5,"I recently read two other books on the human genome: Siddhartha Mukherjee's The Gene: An Intimate History and Sam Kean's The Violinist's Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code. I expected there to be a bit of overlap between them, but I actually found them each to be very different. Mukherjee and Kean focus a lot on the history, while Ridley stays more on the science and less about the history. Kean is a great storyteller, while Mukherjee tries hard to make a grand philosophical message, which falls flat, in my opinion, compared to Ridley.As for the science, much of it seemed outdated, this book being almost two decades old, and the field of human genetics so quickly changing. Most of the sources are academic papers or articles, and the popular books and textbooks referenced are mostly outdated. However, based what I learned in Muckerjee's book, most of the science in Ridley still seems valid.I'll admit that the real reason I picked this one up was to read Ridley's political views, and in that, he does not fail. The thrust of Ridley's political philosophy is in complex systems control is not centralized but distributed - a view I fully subscribe to. And this is not only true for biology, but for economics and government too. Ridley makes this very clear and convincing in several places in the book. I'd really like to read his other book - The Evolution of Everything: How New Ideas Emerge, where he expands on this greatly.Ridley delves into other contentious political topics as well, such as media hysteria over Mad Cow Disease, eugenics, genetic screening, sex, evolutionary psychology, and luddism. Ridley has a unique, but extremely compelling views on all these topics, and that's where this book really shines. One of the points Ridley quite clearly makes in a couple of places is that your genes belong to you alone, and you alone have the right to decide who you want to share it with. However, you really have to wait for the last few chapters of the book for his to really get started.Overall, this book is a great addition to the popular literature on genetics. Despite being almost two decades old, the science is still fresh, and the political angle is something you won't get from any other author is such compelling a manner."
8,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Ridley tells a little about each gene in order & focuses on one specific part of each to discuss their workings & significance. He doesn't limit himself to our physical make up, but discusses the historical, sociological, & political. It's a fascinating tour & he leaves as many questions as he answers.Huntington's Disease is well known & mapped. Most of us have less than 36 repeated glutamines in a specific spot on chromosome 4. If you have more, you're more likely to get it & they can even pin down when. It's an awful death & they can test for it. Would you? Should a doctor or anyone else tell you? Ridley discusses that at some length. He comes back to this again with chromosome 21 when dealing with Down Syndrome which is also easily tested for, but he opens the can of eugenic worms. He does a great job reporting the arguments, in which he points out a lot of flaws, & the facts leaving the reader to make up their own mind. Very well done.He also puts a lot of the fears of genetic tinkering to rest by showing just how the data is being used. Often knowing the genetic code, what works (It usually always does.) & what is broken or different allows medicine to alleviate or even fix the problem with more conventional means. He also briefly explains the various methods used for genetically modifying various organisms. This book is 20 years old, so there's been a lot of progress, but it is still relevant since he's dealing with a lot of basics & shows how our expanding knowledge is making life better. I can't remember the exact quote, ""Scientists live for ignorance; finding the answers. Knowledge is boring."" or something like that & adds that every discovery only creates more questions. It was great because he summed up our technological leaps of the past few centuries so well. Very well narrated & highly recommended in any format. "
9,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863801-ade-bailey,4,"Sometimes I have to stop after even a paragraph. It's a strong feeling of becoming enraptured by the information, connections and insights afforded by this extremely lucid and stimulating layperson's introduction to the human genome. An extremely compressed three page preface provides a glossary and explanation of key terms, and can be returned to as needed. Each chapter then takes one chromosome and selects from each a particular gene to describe with a much broader emphasis upon what this actually means for human individuality, culture and society.As always when reading popular science books, as well as becoming enthusiastic and wishing to retrain as an astrophysicist or quantum mechanic for instance, I am very interested in the 'rhetoric' of discourses, what emerges between the lines - often very powerful assumptions and values relating to conceptualising 'human nature'. In the case of biology, neuroscience etc. it strikes me as not at all right that one of the assumptions seems to be treating the hard, material attributes of human animalism on the same logical level as the wider discourses of humanity: thus for instance the nature-nurture division (itself making the same logically precarious distinction) leads at worst to quanitfying the relative influence of each 'side'. The are always ideological and political implication, too, not only within the production of science popularisation but within scientific enterprises generally.Ridley does not entirely address the identity question. There's an interesting parallel I think between science writing like this which acknowledges ""environmental factors' but leaves them as extremely vague, amorphous and subject to filling with whatever a particular thinker or conceptual paradigm requires, and those who consider such questions as occur around socioeconomics, ideology, material poverty etc. who tend to leave the questions about the enormously important weight of human meat, including brain meat, as a passing aside. Both have their essential role, and a synthesis is required. However, Ridley does an excellent job in contrasting Chapter/Chromosome 4, Fate wherein a particular tiny, tiny genetic abnormality is indeed an unstoppable marker which predicts certain terminal illnesses )or, the high risk of) with Chromosome5, in Environment which details the research for asthma related genes: here, he whizzes through the many implicated genes correlating with different demographies and how environment is a very significant, possibly crucial, factor in triggering genetic propensities (among different groups: men, for instance seem more affected by petrol fumes than women who have a weakness for diesel).I like his conclusion of the chapter on environment (in which he does, by the way, mention the wide open field for interpreters of data to channel explanations through favourite hobby horses, interests or ideology):The more we delve into the genome the less fatalistic it will seem. Grey indeterminancy, variable causality and vague predisposition are hallmarks of the system.....(S)implicity piled upon simplicity creates complexity. The genome is as complicated and indeterminate as ordinary life, because it is ordinary life. This should come as a relief. Simple determinism, whether of the genetic or environmental kind, is a depressing prospect for those with a fondness for free will.Well, being a numbskull, I hadn't realised that gene theory has almost died in relation to the context of this book. I shall keep it as an historical text! Still, its great strength remains which is the approach to emphasising the amorphousness of data and theory, the tentative nature of concluding anything, and so thus an antidote to the dread ideologies of the numbskulls all around who use language like lego blocks and words like things to be quantified, measured and sold and bought. Yah!"
10,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25108-andy,2,"An interesting idea for a popular book about genetics - 23 chapters, one for each pair of chromosomes - that is realized into a not particularly good book. I appreciate that it's trying to be generalist, but it's generalist to the point of failing to convey ideas. Ridley moves from topic to topic like a student who has been told that he must include a long list of them in his paper. And I'm afraid the writing is just not good enough for any of the briefly discussed ideas to stick in your brain, unless this book is literally your first exposure to the field of genetics at all (like, you didn't even learn about it at a high school level). Part of the problem is the numerous minor details that are brought up and then discarded as we move on to the next subject. So for example in chapter 9, ""Disease,"" we have a discussion of blood types. Good at first, but then we're told that the blood type gene is 1,062 letters of a section of 18,000, that it creates an enzyme called galactosyl transferase, and that type As have a sequence CGCG where Bs have a sequence called GAAC. In chapter 12, ""Self-Assembly,"" the writing leaps around from a 1970s study on geometry of genes in fruit flies, to cross-species homologies in some of these genes, to a dizzying laundry list of genes within the space of a few pages: ""Otx (1 and 2)"", ""Emx (1 and 2)"", ""decapentaplegic"", ""short gastrulation"", ""BMP4"", ""chordin"", ""Hox"" and its alleles, ""hedgehog"" and its alleles. This level of detail may add some texture, but as a generalist I think you only want as much detail as makes the topic fun to learn about, and then to focus on getting the big ideas across. As it was, I think I would have been better off reading anything in the book's bibliography than this book itself. "
11,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24237425-james-hartley,5,"This is a really great book - my only qualm is that it might be outdated now, as gene technology and science is moving so quickly forwards. Basically, if you want to know why you are here, what you are and what you´re made of, this book has some pretty convincing answers. Fate, destiny, love, life, death, character, intelligence and illness are all covered and it´s worth pressing on through the quite tough prose to get a better, illuminating, scary but finally comforting picture of the vehicle you´re in for this trip through life. Here´s the thing: even though you´ve got your hands on the wheel, you´re not the driver."
12,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3149607-voodoochilli,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I would say it is so far the best book I have read this year and a great introduction to genetics. Quite a lot of the stuff in this book has been covered in other books I have read, most notably by Richard Dawkins, however the writing was fresh and I learned a hell of a lot of stuff throughout this book. For example, did you know that the placenta is actually a parasite, the result of male antagonistic genes battling the female's X chromosomes by redirecting more resources to the baby? And in response the female releases insulin in an attempt to counter this intrusion and moderate the resources? I didn't! What about the fact that male sperm has an agenda and that chemicals within enter the female's brain, lowering her sex drive and adjusting the timings of her menstrual cycle in an attempt to stop her mating with others? At the same time, the female's genes have attacked the poor Y chromosome to such an extent that it has all but shut down, being a tiny little stub of a gene. Fascinating!Many issues are explored in this book, from reproduction, disease to Eugenics and the politics of science and academia. There is also quite a bit of history, and not just the usual mention of Darwin on the Galapagos islands with his finches. There were many occasions in this book when I stopped to read a paragraph out to my wife who was also fascinated.My only minor criticism of this book would be that the final chapter seems slightly rushed. Additionally, I don't like it when authors start name dropping a lot of people (particularly the self declared intellectuals we call philosophers). I find name dropping is often used as a diversion from fact, and I feel the last chapter lacked some of the magic of the 22 chapters before it. I feel the author did this in an attempt to cover too many topics and round the book with a nice conclusion, one that wasn't needed. You see, each chapter tells the story of a chromosome! The book is accessible but does get progressively more difficult and there is quite a bit of genetic code mentioned, but most people will not have a problem understanding it since the book does educate so well.Written at the turn of the century, the book is 10 years old and with the exception of the first human genome being transcribed, to a lay person like me it doesn't seem dated at all. I have since ordered more books on the subject and I am once again interested in evolutionary biology! I am now reading The prehistory of the mind : a search for the origins of art, religion, and science By Steven Mithen.The book just missed 5 stars for me as I feel the final chapter didn't quite gel with the rest, however this book is on par with any book by Richard Dawkins, Bill Bryson, Marcus Chown, Richard Feynman or any other well known popular science writer you can name. If you are interested in science, biology or evolution just a little bit then read this, you won't be disappointed."
13,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Genome is somewhat out of date by now, published back in 1999. Bearing that in mind, it was a pretty good read; sometimes, the themes Ridley chose for a particular chapter weren’t all that closely tied to the chromosome he chose, and issues like that, but that’s the problem with our chromosomes. The information isn’t distributed neatly across our chromosomes: in fact, those of us with a Y chromosome have one that does almost nothing overall, despite the fact that it affects carriers’ phenotypes so markedly.It’s mostly informative and tries hard to avoid reinforcing certain misconceptions — like the idea that a gene codes for a disease, or that things are as simple as a single gene coding for a single trait. A lot of the anecdotes are familiar to me from previous reading, but it’s still interesting to see them presented in this way. It’s pretty modern-human-centric: I mean, if you’re going to look at our autobiography of a species, then I think at least a little time needs to be given to the past of our species. People so often want to know how closely we’re related to Neanderthals.I think Ridley’s tone is a little dry, though; given that and the fact that the book is a little out of date now, I probably wouldn’t recommend it to anyone looking for a quick and up to date whip around of what we know of genetics. If you have a more general, patient interest, though, why not?Originally posted here."
14,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2480529-nicole,3,"This was an interesting and understandable survey of human genetic heritage. There were a few boring pieces that recounted things I'd been taught repeatedly in biology classes - I can see the utility of this as not all readers would have taken those classes, I just didn't enjoy reading about those things again as much as I enjoyed the more specific examples. The last few chapters contained some biased language (calling people who tore up GM crops ""eco-terrorists"" rather than simply ""vandals,"" for example, is using a contested definition of terrorism) and drew some political conclusions that, whether I agreed with them or not (and there were some of each) neither fit well with the reasonably objective structure established by the preceding chapters nor were especially well defended.Despite these problems, though, this made me want to find out more about advances in genetic research since it was published. The biggest problem I had with this book, and the reason I'd hesitate to recommend it, is that it's more than a decade out of date. It was worth reading to find out some interesting historical facts, but if I was choosing one book to read about genetics I'd pick something published more recently."

16,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"Keeping in mind that this book was written 20 years ago -which of course if a short life-span for literature, but a very long one for science - this is very well written, ingeniously presented and fun to engage with. I would definitely still recommend it, even if some of the scientific discussions inside are a little bit dated, because it offers a sound review of how we came to know what we do about genes and what exactly they are. "
17,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,4,"[30 September 2019]I really enjoyed this book, and appreciated it, because it explained basic genetics better than anything else I've ever read. Of course I haven't read Siddhartha Mukherjee's book, but I still suspect this book is better for the genetic novice. Of course, it's 20 years old, but most of what it covers is probably still true. Some readers might object to how much he injects his personal opinions into the text, but I liked it. And I felt it was usually clear that it was his personal opinion. Another thing a little odd was the number of off topic digressions, often coupled with personal observations. But I mostly liked those too. The last chapter got a bit into the weeds, discussing the apparent controversy over ""free will"". He disagrees with the common positions that there is no free will because your actions are either dictated entirely by your genome or your actions are entirely random. Ridley does not accept that dichotomy, saying that neither of those control absolutely and free will resides in the interaction between those two extremes. That makes a lot of sense to me.I do wish there was a way to get an updated and annotated edition. One specific item he mentions is a study that found heart disease is not a function of diet or exercise as much as it is of stress, and particularly the stress related to your status or lack there of. I'd never heard of that. The medical community certainly is still concentrating on diet and exercise. So I wonder if that study is still considered valid. The book is short and easy to read. The writing style is relaxed and doesn't get too bogged down in scientific detail for the lay reader. I wholeheartedly recommend it."

20,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7943826-moumeeta,5,"The Genome is yet another non-fiction science book that I have read with the utmost fascination. Not that there are that many in the list, but this is a genre that I am absolutely delighting in. It would have been great to have this enthusiasm to know, in school perhaps, when I was rote-learning about DNA and had no idea what the implications of genes were. This book ought to have livened things up in my mind. The best thing about the book is the lucid structure. It is brilliantly organised, to make non-science people like me understand its content. There are 23 chapters, one for each chromosome. And each chapter discusses a gene from the said chromosome. Sample this, from the first chapter, titled “Life” - “In the beginning was the word. The word proselytised the sea with its message, copying itself unceasingly and forever. The word discovered how to rearrange chemicals so as to capture little eddies in the stream of entropy and make them live. The word transformed the land surface of the planet from a dusty hell to a verdant paradise. The word eventually blossomed and became sufficiently ingenious to build a porridgy contraption called a human brain that could discover and be aware of the word itself.”Some points I came to note: Knowledge is incremental. Understanding of one fact often leads to increased understanding about many other seemingly unrelated topics. For example, Alan Turing’s demonstration that numbers can compute numbers led indirectly (very, very indirectly) to the knowledge that life too, is written in code. The past is always a useful guide to understanding the present. Whether this is the “recent” past or the “distant” one. The missing link maybe the most famous aspect of human genetics. But it was shocking for me to know that genes from fruit flies can be spliced and replaced by human genetic fragments and there is NO difference in the outcome. We share genes with the fruit fly! That is how distant a past we can analyse and put to good use to understand our own selves. Consider the impressive imagery evoked by this line that says “After all it is less than 300,000 human generations since the common ancestor of both species lived in central Africa. If you held hands with your mother, and she held hands with hers, and she with hers, the line would stretch only from New York to Washington before you were holding hands with the ‘missing link’ - the common ancestor with chimpanzees.”“The impact of genes on our lives is a gradual, partial, blended sort of thing”. The whole is not a sum of the parts. True. But the parts are critical. If we refuse to acknowledge this we can end up wasting time and resources on the kind of scale that cancer researchers did when they focused their attention on cancer as a whole. The real breakthrough in cancer has in fact, come from the much maligned reductionist approach in science. The breaking up of genes to understand the constituent parts and functions revealed the oncogene - the Why of cancer. Treatment for cancer too is most likely to benefit from further understanding of how genes causing cancer can be approached. ""Meanwhile, in one of those ironies which modern biology supplies in abundance, if you have a faulty tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 18, forget gene therapy. A much simpler preventive treatment may be at hand. New research suggests that for those with genes that increase their susceptibility to bowel cancer, a diet rich in aspirin and unripe bananas offers the promise of protection against the cancer. The diagnosis is genetic, but the cure is not. Genetic diagnosis followed by conventional cure is probably the genome's greatest boon to medicine."" The implication of a fact needs to be checked against reality. Coming to conclusions from a certain knowledge is dangerous. For example “the heritability of childhood IQ is about forty-five percent, whereas in late adolescence, it rises to seventy-five per cent. As you grow up, you gradually express your own innate intelligence and leave behind the influences stamped on you by others.” This fact is likely to induce knee jerk conclusions about Nature ruling over Nurture. In reality, “you select the environments that suit your innate tendencies, rather than adjusting your innate tendencies to the environments you find yourself in.” Also, “the heritability of IQ might not be caused by direct ‘genes for intelligence’ at all, but by indirect genes for resistance to toxins or infections - genes in other words, that work by interacting with the environment.” A little knowledge is a dangerous thing indeed. And smug conclusions, truly stupid.“Sexual relations are driven not by what is good, in evolutionary terms, for what is good for men or for women, but by what is good for their chromosomes. The ability to seduce a woman was good for the y chromosomes in the past; the ability to resist seduction by a man was good for x chromosomes in the past”. This chapter, on chromosomes x and y had me quite astonished. I had never heard of this notion of Interlocus Contest Evolution. By the end of the book, it was one among so many other, equally astonishing facts. Instead of coming to conclusions on any of these, it makes one wonder at what else there is to grasp, to know,and what among them may be put to good use. “The man who first set in train the ideas that led to sexual antagonism, Bill Hamilton, understood how profoundly it shook our notions of what genes are…” He wrote:“My own conscious and seemingly indivisible self was turning out far from what I had imagined and I need not be so ashamed of my self-pity! I was an ambassador ordered abroad by some fragile coalition, a bearer of conflicting orders from the uneasy masters of a divided empire…..As I write these words, even so as to be able to write them, I am pretending to a unity that, deep inside myself, I now know does not exist. I am fundamentally mixed, male with female, parent with offspring, warring segments of chromosomes that interlocked in strife millions of years before the River Severn ever saw the Celts and Saxons of Housman’s poem( A Shropshire Lad).”The writer makes an appeal to inform oneself about the benefits that have accrued from science and to stop the fear mongering that is based on wilful ignorance and refusal to read up. In Cosmos, Carl Sagan gives the example of the destruction of the library at Alexandria and the ensuing thousand plus years of ignorance and cruelty as an indication of how dangerous turns can take place in the history of humanity. From the astounding knowledge base developed by the Greeks, mankind went backwards to devoting lives to their respective invisible friends. The two major desert cults spawned violence and ignorance for centuries till the Renaissance. Here in India, one guy draped a thread around his torso, declared himself and his progeny “highborn” and rendered millions to servitude to an invention called caste. Knowledge, post the Zero, was stillborn. No lessons are learnt yet. One can only hope."
21,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91299031-david-crow,5,"Matt Ridley is able to break down extremely difficult concepts into terms the average reader can understand. This book was fascinating as it took every human genome and added real life in clear, lucid examples. This is a remarkable work and it will make anyone who reads it smarter, and it is highly entertaining, not an easy feat."
22,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931082-arminius,5,"A genome is an organism’s complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. Each genome contains all of the information needed to build and maintain an organism. In 1953 Francis Crick and James Watson decoded the structure of DNA and with this discovery Crick exclaimed “We’ve discovered the secret of life.” What they discovered was that the main purpose of genes is to store the recipe for making proteins. The proteins are what determine the color of our hair, fight infection, and carry oxygen as well as almost everything the body does. Crick and Watson decoded DNA by labeling its parts as A,C, G and T.Chromosomes where, however, discovered much earlier, in 1878 by Walther Flemming, and they are thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of animal and plant cells. Each chromosome is made of protein and a single molecule of (DNA).Over the latter half of the 20th century individual chromosomes have been linked to specific character traits. The author proceeds to explain each link and provide a history as well as the specific sequences of molecules that provide variable traits. For example, Intelligence is found on Chromosome 6, Instinct is on Chromosome 7, Disease comes from Chromosome 9. I want to explore Chromosome 11 which determines Personality. Dopamine interacts with the D4DR gene on Chromosome 11. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter. It is a chemical messenger that helps in the transmission of signals in the brain and other vital areas. A shortage of dopamine will cause an indecisive and frozen personality. Furthermore, studies have found that people with a long D4DR gene have low responses to dopamine and tend to take a more adventurous approach to life to achieve the same “buzz’ which short D4DR genes obtain from simple life experiences. There is another chemical found in the brain which acts on personality which is serotonin. Serotonin is the chemical that makes you feel good. Curiously, melatonin is made from serotonin. Melatonin is the chemical that induces sleep. That is why people tend to get sleepy in winter evenings early. The darkness triggers serotonin to be turned into melatonin. The way to reverse this is to introduce insulin, which retards melatonin, by eating a carbohydrate snack. An interesting fact was pointed out. The fact indicates that impulsive, anti-social and depressed people have generally lower levels of cholesterol than the populace in general. It appears that cholesterol promotes serotonin build up. Chromosome 15 is responsible for your sex determination. Males have an XY chromosome pair while Females have an XX pair. The father’s sex chromosomes determine the sex of a child. If the father passes his Y chromosome then the baby will be a boy. If he passes his X chromosome then the baby will be a girl. What scientists discovered was that the spare X chromosome of the man contains a switch that when turned on enhances development and produces a normal baby. Failure of the switch to activate may explain dyslexia, autism and language problems. This explains why these diseases are more common in boys than girls.If you need proof that boys and girls are different from the very beginning it lies in this chapter and it lists an unusual and cruel Canadian experiment to help prove this point.It is also apparently clear that science is on track to cure most cancers. It has discovered that a gene called oncogenes encourage cells to grow. Cancer is nothing more than uncontrolled cell multiplication. Oncogenes are vital to life however because they heal wounds. If they become jammed Oncogenes will cause cells to reproduce unmolested and thus cause cancer. The body though protects us from an overactive Oncogene with Tumour suppressors. These tomour suppressors are working all the time. However, if they are damaged cancer will thrive. TP53 is the most powerful tumour suppressor. It dismantles unneeded cells from the inside out eliminating them in the process. The body also has another protection mechanism know as Apoptosis. Apoptosis are cells which detect infectious diseases and proceed to kill the infected cells. The book’s final chapters are an interesting combination of science and ethics dealing with eugenics and Free will. "

That’s one of the questions raised in Matt Ridley’s Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters. Using a gene from each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that make up our DNA as a launching point, Ridley discusses what we’ve learned about the history of the human race. Some concepts about heredity are confirmed, while others are discarded.Through the Human Genome Project, scientists have mapped out the complete set of human genes. With that map, we can discover more about the causes of disease, develop therapies, and improve the quality of life. We’re also learning about how our genes impact our behavior, resurrecting the “nature vs. nurture” argument on human behavior.Ridley is able to write about these technical discoveries and theories in layman’s terms. He emphasizes that gaining knowledge through gene research is important and necessary, even if how we use that knowledge is subject to debate. And as a believer in free will, Ridley writes, “Heritability does not mean immutability.” You, not your genes, control your life."

All at the same time."
30,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19862763-amr-khaled,5,"I'll fail to review this book if I thought about it as a single book. Genome feels like many books written in a specific order; many excellent book that is. Genome speaks of Health, Disease, Sex, Power, Philosophy, Politics, Geology, Literature, Language, History, Evolution, Science, People, & everything linking them together. That last statement might seem as overselling the book, & if it was me, I wouldn't buy that statement if I saw it in a review. However, it came as a surprise for me as well.To begin with, Matt Ridley has one of the best pens I've ever seen. His writing method is superb & only surpassed by his scientific knowledge. Being written in 1999, it's certainly a bit outdated, but still provide some fundamentals in history, theories, & science to make up for the time gap between now & then.It astonished me that a book put a daunting task such as addressing 23 Chromosomes in different topics in our single species, & succeeded in doing so.Some areas felt boring for me, but I'm sure that stemmed from my own lack of interest in said areas, like for example language, philosophical depths, & some sides of history. These were however made up for me by the kind Ridley when he wrote the wonderful chapters on Genetic Diseases, History of Eugenia, Prions, Sex Chromosomes Struggle, Geology, Evolution. And these are just the tip of the iceberg for this book.If there's one thing you'd certainly regret after reading Genome, it'll be that you hadn't read it sooner."
31,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4824483-charlotte-osborn-bensaada,4,"Rideley's trope is to connect circa 2000 what we are beginning to know about the human geonomes if you will through each of the 23 human chromosomes. Some it works very well, I think I have a much better understanding of the implications of all types issues related to genetics. I also realized afterward that we as a society don't even have the beginnings of a social discussion taking place even as the science races forward. The challenge with a book like Ridley's is that it based on what we knew even just 10 years ago and I can imagine, that there is so much that even now needs to be updated. For instance he has this fascinating chapter on how 2 variations of certain cholesterol distributor or receptors (this is the other thing, you think you understand what he is saying, but it is pretty complex stuff so you can't really summarize the argument)may increase the likelihood of brain diseases in boxers. In all the coverage I have seen of the concussion crisis nothing of the sort has been noted. Is that because those studies were invalidated, is it just too new, should we be thinking about that for dangerous sports? This is not a book that will answer, but instead will push you to wonder what about. "

This is more than a book about the human genome, its also an analysis of the social, political and scientific implications of understanding the human genetic map. Each area he analyses from health and healing to death and immortalit, from instinct and intelligence to personality and behavior is illustrated with examples of experiments used to prove the point and is analysed with a laymans eye so even those of us without a scientific background can absorb and understand the complexity, possibilities and even the threats this ""new"" science presents us with. Thankfully for me, he also steers away from the spiritual/religious debate and concentrates on evidentiary argument.I enjoyed this book so much I came straight back and bought his follow up ""Nature via Nurture"", also an excellent read.Highly recommended."

Under the cover of biology, the book is really about humans on a philosophical level - the interesting balance between social determinism and biological determinism, the philosophical debate on if human have free will, and also who defined ""self"" - the genes, the brain, the mind, the body, or us? It triggers a waterfall of questions related to religion (belief systems) and buddhist ideologies - what is us? What is consciousness, awareness? Yet at the same time the book did give me hope, that even though we are determined/told to operate by these full body of genes, these genes are the army that support our day to day functions. Not a single gene can exert absolute influence on any feature of us, personality trait of us, meaning we have room to grow, to improve, to fulfill what we believe on this earth.

It has all sorts of mischievous genes on it, he explained.Imagine that the genome is a book. There are twenty-three chapters, called CHROMOSOMES. Each chapter contains several thousand stories, called GENES. Each story is made up of paragraphs, called EXONS, which are interrupted by advertisements called INTRONS. Each paragraph is made up of words, called COD ON s. Each word is written in letters called BASES.The genome is a very clever book, because in the right conditions it can both photocopy itself and read itself. The photocopying is known as REPLICATION, and the reading as TRANSLATION. In fact, the usual state of DNA is the famous DOUBLE HELIX of the original strand and its complementary pair intertwined.RNA, too, can carry a linear code and it uses the same letters as DNA except that it uses U, for uracil, in place of T. This RNA copy, called the MESSENGER RNA, is then edited by the excision of all introns and the splicing together of all exons (see above).Almost everything in the body, from hair to hormones, is either made of proteins or made by them. Every protein is a translated gene.Proteins are also responsible for switching genes on and off, by physically attaching themselves to PROMOTER and ENHANCER sequences near the start of a gene’s text.about one hundred mutations per generation, which may not seem much given that there are more than a million codons in the human genome, but in the wrong place even a single one can be fatal.Not all human genes are found on the twenty-three principal chromosomes; a few live inside little blobs called mitochondriaIn the beginning was the word.

The answer will not come from physics.3 In New York in 1943, a sixty-six-year-old Canadian scientist, Oswald Avery, is putting the finishing touches to an experiment that will decisively identify DNA as the chemical manifestation of heredity.Claude Shannon is ruminating about an idea he had first had at Princeton a few years earlier. Shannon’s idea is that information and entropy are opposite faces of the same coin and that both have an intimate link with energy. The less entropy a system has, the more information it contains.Samuel Buder, a protein is just a gene’s way of making another gene; and a gene is just a protein’s way of making another protein.there is growing evidence that RNA came before proteins. RNA is a chemical substance that links the two worlds of DNA and protein.the most primitive and basic functions require the presence of RNA. It is an RNA-dependent enzyme l8 GENOME that takes the message, made of RNA, from the gene.The discovery of these remarkable properties of RNA in the early 1980s, made by Thomas Cech and Sidney Altaian, transformed our understanding of the origin of life.These ribo-organisms had a big problem. RNA is an unstable substance, which falls apart within hours. Had these organisms ventured anywhere hot, or tried to grow too large, they would have faced what geneticists call an error catastrophe — a rapid decay of the message in their genes.If this was so, Carl Woese points out, the organism was not yet an enduring entity. It was a temporary team of genes.As Patrick Forterre has long argued, it now looks as if bacteria came later, highly specialised and simplified descendants of the Lucas, long after the invention of the DNA-protein world.bacteria are much more ‘highly evolved’ than we are.supported by the existence of molecular ‘fossils’ — little bits of RN A that hang about inside the nucleus of your ceils doing unnecessary things such as splicing themselves out of genes: guide RNA, vault RN A, small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA, self-splicing introns.We put a premium instead on being complicated, in having as many genes as possible, rather than a streamlined machine for using them.CGA means arginine and GCG means alanine — in bats, in beetles, in beech trees, in bacteria.This means — and religious people might find this a useful argument — that there was only one creation, one single event when life was born.

42,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073465-carlos-martinez,3,"A very well-written, chatty, enjoyable and wide-ranging introduction to genomics. Ridley does a reasonably good job of keeping his political philosophy - nutty right-wing libertarianism - to himself until the last couple of chapters, at which it emerges in the most unfortunate (and unscientific) fashion with the soft-pedalling of eugenics. Eugenics, we are told, is not bad science but bad _politics_; we could breed a population of really smart, slim, law-abiding people if we as individuals wanted to, but the real problem is the government telling us what to do. Absurd. If nothing else, it's well established that phenomena like 'intelligence' are extremely complex and that their genetic component corresponds to a large variety of genes that you couldn't possibly breed for.Partly the problem is that the book was published in 1999, which is a long time ago in a fast-changing world; but I think a particular political bias is the bigger issue here.If you were planning to read 5-10 books on genomics, this should probably be one of them. If however you wanted a single book to give you a flavour of the topic, I'd go for either The Gene: An Intimate History or A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Stories in Our Genes - both are more up-to-date and less Tory."
43,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832262-misterfweem,4,"So, what are you?A complicated biological machine beset by innate programming and external conditions bent both on keeping you alive and eventually killing you?Or are you the creation of a supreme being, both soul and body, possessed of a free will?And though Matt Ridley, in his 2000 book “Genome: The Autobiography of A Species in 23 Chapters,” leans to the left in this equation, he still writes an incredibly balanced and above all scientific book about the human genome, what we know about it, how we think it works and how we misunderstand the science that’s delving into figuring out how that double helix of DNA can turn two germ cells into a complicated biological masterpiece.Ridley, in the footnotes to his book, acknowledges that it was, at its printing, already out of date. Ten years further along, of course, it is certainly even more out of date. But what’s not out of date in this wonderful book is the critical approach Ridley takes to this science. And it’s not critical in any political way, but critical in a scientific way. He reminds the reader constantly that what is known about the human genome is small compared to what is not known, that cause does not necessarily mean effect, that a firm belief in genetic determinism is just as foolish on the left as is a firm belief in free will is on the right. More importantly, he reminds us all that what we have, as far as genetics goes, is some knowledge bolstered by a lot of unsupported belief.Here’s an example: We instinctively assume that bodily biochemistry is cause whereas behavior is effect, an assumption we have taken to a ridiculous extent in considering the impact of genes upon our lives. If genes are involved in behavior then it is they that are the cause and they that are deemed immutable. This is a mistake made not just by genetic determinists, but by their vociferous opponents, the people who say behavior is “not in the genes”; the people who deplore the fatalism and predestination implied, they say, by behavior genetics. They give too much ground to their opponents by allowing this assumption to stand, for they tacitly admit that if genes are involved at all, then they area t the top of the hierarchy. They forget that genes need to be switched on, and external events – or free-willed behavior – can switch on genes. Far from us lying at the mercy of our omnipotent genes, it is often our genes that lie at the mercy of us. If you go bungee jumping or take a stressful job, or repeatedly imagine a terrible fear, you will raise your cortisol levels, and the cortisol will dash about the body busy switching on genes. (It is an indisputable fact that you can rigger activity in the “happiness centers” of the brain with a deliberate smile, as surely as you can trigger a smile with happy thoughts. It really does make you feel better to smile. The physical can be at the beck and call of the behavioral.)Ridley, I believe, successfully finds and holds that middle ground. Our genes certainly influence who we are and what we become. But our behavior can, in turn, influence our genes. We are machines, beautiful, free-willed machines, capable to some extent of reprogramming ourselves.Here’s a thought I had on the bus this morning: Our genes are like the model tank kit we can buy at the hobby store. We follow the instructions religiously and build that magnificent tank. Everything works. The wheels turn. The gun turrets rotate. The tracks allow the tank to maneuver through any kind of terrain. And then we take that tank not into the battlefield, but gently down a city street, to the park, to the grocery store, trundling along. It is still there in its essence of tankness; everything that makes it a tank is still there. And yet our use of it for domestic purposes does not mean that its innate tankness takes over; we drive it to the grocery store and load it with groceries, we do not drive it to the grocery store to level the building with our tank shells.So brain and genome, tank and the purpose we put with it, work together. As Ridley writes: The human brain is a far more impressive machine than the genome. If you like quantitative measure, it has trillions of synapses instead of billions of bases and it weighs kilograms in stead of micrograms. If you prefer geometry, it is an analogue, three-dimensional machine, rather than a digital, one-dimensional one. If you like thermodynamics, it generates large quantities of heat as it works, like a steam engine. For biochemists, it requires many thousands of different proteins, neurotransmitters, and other chemicals, not just the four nucleotides of DNA. For the impatient, it literally changes while you watch, as synapses are altered to create learned memories, whereas the genome changes more slowly than a glacier. For the lover of free will, the pruning of the neural networks in our grains, by the ruthless gardener called experience, is vital to the proper functioning of the organ, whereas genomes play out their messages in a predetermined way with comparatively little flexibility. Yet . . . the dichotomy is a false one. The brain is created by genes. It is only as good as its innate design. The very fact that it is a machine designed to be modified by experience is written in the genes. The mystery of how is one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. But that the human brain is the finest monument to the capacities of genes there is no doubt. It is the mark of a great leader that he knows when to delegate. The genome knew when to delegate.I think what I enjoyed most about reading this book is that I learned a few things. Genetics is a pretty fascinating field of science, and I think if we all learned about it a bit more, we could have more intelligent discussions on the subject that what we see in political and media circles. Politics tends to get too black and white in this subject, and the media, for the most part, either boils things down too simply or merely presents both sides of the argument without really bothering to explain anything to the layman about what's being discussed. Ridley does a wonderful job explaining to the layman, but keeping it intelligent enough that the curious layman is able to keep exploring and asking questions. "
44,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63196979-matej-misik,4,"Although I found “The Gene” a slightly better read, I can still highly recommend this book. Especially the last two chapters cover the topics of eugenics & free will in a captivating & thought provoking fashion. On eugenics: “these things should be kept away from people who think they know best... I am trying to see genetic decisions put in the hands of users, which governments aren’t”And a great quote on science: “Science is like a hungry furnace that must be fed by logs from the forests of ignorance that surround us. In the process, the clearing we call knowledge expands, but the more it expands, the larger its perimeter and the more ignorance comes into view. [...] A true scientist is bored by knowledge, it is the assault on ignorance that motivates him - the mysteries that previous discoveries have revealed. The forest is more interesting than the clearing.”"

The inevitable genetic engineering and rewriting the genome to enhance humans are mind-blowing and horrifying ideas. Analogous to 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells, the book has 23 chapters. In each chapter, Ridely picks an appealing gene from the corresponding chromosome and discusses it. Sometimes he tells the story of how the gene was discovered. Sometimes he explains the role the gene plays in our life, or its necessity, or how it evolved through natural selection, or how and why it causes a disease. However, my favorite parts of the book were the side stories about the people who were somehow related to the discovery of the genes or affected by a disease caused by the genes. "
46,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105387858-stetson,4,"Matt Ridley's Genome engagingly narrates the major stories of genetic science and the insight it provides on the human condition one chromosome at a time. This clever device obviously requires some finagling from Ridley to work, but it is fun way to organize a book about the genome and allows Ridley to connect disparate topics and themes throughout the course of the book, giving in it at least the semblance of unity and a central thesis. Regardless of the organizational conceit, Ridley maintains a breezy and engaging prose style that gives lay readers digestible and enjoyable information about the science of genetics and genomics.It is notable as well as remarkable that this book was originally published the book in 1999. I read the 2011 updated version, but I don't think much about the structure or even content of the book changed radically, which is both to the benefit and detriment of Ridley's Genome. It's beneficial in that it allows Ridley to focus in on well elucidated genetic observations that come in neat anecdotal packages and really provide interesting insight about human biology and behavior, but it's detrimental in that Ridley is unable to address the massive advancements that have occurred in the genome sciences after the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and the very real prospect of germline genomic engineering in humans because of technologies like CRISPR/Cas9. It is undoubtedly true that these development would significantly shift Ridley analyses and discussions.One of the most interesting aspects of Genome is Ridley's tendency to want to leverage the science of genetics to make a nature versus nurture argument and generally extemporize about the effect of genetics on complex behaviors and social organization (ostensibly controversial but deeply interesting content). For the most part, Ridley's commentary on these subjects is fairly measured and largely fits within the orthodoxy of modern science; however, there are times where his analysis is glib or superficial. For instance, Ridley's commentary on the arguments made my Charles Murray in The Bell Curve is largely an unfledged regurgitation of the many motivated critiques from Murray-detractors who often misrepresent and malign Murray's work because of its political valence. Moreover, Ridley's reflexive and complete embrace of evolutionary linguistic theories (i.e. universal grammar) argued for by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker appears naive to elucidated limitations of such theories and their fraught relationship with neo-Darwinism. Ultimately, these shortcoming are small and should not dissuade readers eager for popular science content from picking up Genome."

The layout of the book is extremely unique, as the 23 chapters represent the 23 different types of chromosomes found within the human body. Ironically, these chapters do not necessarily set out to describe the complexity and function of each chromosome, but seeks to tell the story of the Human Genome Project, various topics related to genetics (such as its application to medicine and the Nature vs. Nuture debate), and how fascinating the human genome really is. Not only is this book informative of the rich scientific history and the inner workings of DNA and genes, it excites the reader to learn and hope for more to come from the scientific community. This book highlights the importance of science and the era of understanding the genome, as the world transitions into the emerging subfield of understanding proteins. The only downfall of this book is the detailed writing can be somewhat confusing. Nonetheless, Ridley does an excellent job at trying to alleviate the complexity of the subject by giving a great background and avoiding words that are extremely genre specific. Therefore, this book could be read by anyone, as the reader does not need a previous background in genetics or biology. As a result, this book is perfect for those looking to learn more about genes, epigenetics, DNA, and/or the future of medicine. "

He comes across very clearly as a polymath man of letters, who engages intelligently with a range of ideas. Plus, he has a deliciously plain evil streak that makes him so much more interesting than the others in this genre. The Rational Optimist was a rare find for me, exciting me with intuitively objectionable yet logically consistent counter-arguments to intuitively black&white morality topics like climate change, precisely the sort of topics that need more of the sort of challenging intellectualism that drives a rational view of the topic deeper instead of doubling down emotionally and calling out the particularly stupid dissent in order to call dissent itself stupid. Genetics is a similarly intuitively black&white morality that I imagined evil freemason rationalist Ridley would have challenging views on. This didn’t turn out in the same way as the first book, mostly because this time I was firmly on the side that didn’t quite know black from white in the ethics of genetics, even tending more towards the black than white, for which Ridley’s evil would be a powerful and compelling ally. For someone who complains non-stop about the irritating politicization in popular science books, I think maybe I was disappointed this wasn’t political enough, maybe I mean it wasn’t controversial enough in its choice of subject matter or courageous enough in its edginess of stance on it. This book revealed just how shockingly low my recollection of the online course on Behavioral Genetics has been. NotesWhat an amazing period of science the 1940s/50s are. Norbert Wiener/Neumann are seeing similarities between programmable machine and organism - cybernetics. Turing makes a Universal Machine. Schrodinger postulates the code-script for organisms. Avery finds DNA. Rosalind Franklin’s experiments. Crick and Watson. Claude Shannon on information. RNA came before DNA or proteins. Life began as RNA. RNA transcribes DNA to RNA and then translates to proteins. Somewhere it became advantageous to be coded into DNA that can then be replicated, using RNA as the intermediary. An opposing theory to the idea that we all started as bacteria/archaea type branches off from the tree of life, is that we are more like initial life than bacteria, which branched off and started shaving off unnecessary DNA to become highly specialized for extreme environments. Occams razor suggests more likely bacteria shed the basic common genes than we gained new ones. We’re more like chimps than chimps are like gorillas. Compared to great apes, we have 1 less chromosome (23 vs 24), seems like our Chromosome 2 is a fused version of 2 chromosomes. Does that explain our soul?Maybe we didn’t climb down and head into the savanna, but it came to us. Sahara desert is born. Rift valley is born, creating a dry eastern highland where we’re separated from the chimp population. Aquatic hypothesis where Gibraltar cataract creates many marooned islands where we’re forced to wade for shellfish etc. Explains why we’re so comfortable in the water.There’s actually a tension created by Mendel’s neat mathematical quanta of genotypes, for Darwin’s gradual natural selection. Recessive genes shouldn’t be coming back according to Darwin. It took decades until Robert Fischer solved this problem, partly by recognizing the chromosome received separately from 2 parentsCrick was effortlessly brilliant and meandering 35yr old while Watson was precocious 19yr old. Crick had the elegant idea called the greatest wrong idea of the century, 3-letter word from 4 alphabets ATGC can account for exactly 20 amino acids (not 64), if you remove all combinations that might be misread if you start from the wrong place. Later this was shown to be wrong because phenylalanine was coded by just UUU, which Crick had ruled out by his rules. Nature it seems was more forgiving of errors by building redundancies. By identifying gene sequences and the change in a single letter that leads to a disease, now had a concrete example to Mendel’s abstract theory. Happened on a small part of Chromosome 3.Slippery slope of base pair mistakes, when there are more mistakes, it is easier to make further more mistakes (count 6 things accurately vs count 36 things). Less than 36 CAG (Glutamine), normal, more = Huntington’s, exponentially decreasing life expectancy with number of additional CAGsChromosome 4 has Huntington’s. What are the ethics around diagnosing an incurable illness? Also, 50% chance of getting it is a mathematical construct, you either have 100% or 0%. Similarly, half your children will get it is meaningless, each one has a 50% chance of getting it.Y-chromosomes are only in males, so they’re incentivized to selfishly put male interests over female. Genes that induce women to stop feeding and start ovulating for instance.X-chromosomes spend 3 times more time in females than in males, so they’re optimized for women, yet they’re in men so can act against their own body. Is this an explanation for homosexuality? Male with male elder brothers chance of being gay jumps by 33%, yet no such connection for lesbians. AB protects against Cholera. But O protects against Malaria. O protects against Syphilis also. Does this explain why Americas are primarily O, since syphilis came from there and cholera came from old world?Cholesterol is responsible for turning on important steroids, progesterone, cortisol, testosterone etc. A missing hormone on a gene in Chromosome 10 fails to turn on additional steroidal hormones, so you get feminine males for example. Cortisol turns off immune response, lymphocytes, get sick when stressed. Why has he ignored the most obvious explanation that energy-expensive long-term infection-fighting immunity is not as important as immediate danger of lion that needs shunting energy to muscles? Instead goes to sexual selection, testosterone higher for impressing females, saying hey look I can afford to get by with suppressed immunity. Insulin triggers absorption of tryptophan, needed to make serotonin, needed to make melatonin. So in dark wintry months, melatonin triggered drops serotonin, which drops tryptophan, needs insulin, so craving for carb-rich foods.Low cholesterol diet reduced heart disease by 14% but increased violent deaths by 78% because serotonin is reduced. High serotonin is OCD but low is depression, impulsive behavior.Blue eyes, pale skin, selected for cold-tolerance in nordics, also produces shy/anxious behavior. In interviews we select for confident people with interpersonal skills, yet selecting against blue eyes is considered inappropriate?Ashkenazi Jews all get assigned a number at birth, so when wanting to get married they check with a registry(Dor Yeshorim) which matches their numbers to validate no genetic diseases. Cystic fibrosis has been wipd out in the community (descended from just 350 ppl 800yrs ago). Similarly, Tay-Sachs has been eliminated. Genomic imprinting: epigenetic process that expresses genes based on parent of origin. Placental mammals: father wants the embryo to parasitize mother, mother wants to conserve resources. Embryo created from 2 mother cells does not develop placenta. Some rats A have litter with different fathers, father wants his embryo to monopolize. Arms race, so mother resists as much as possible. Take A-fathers and put them in B-mothers (single father, not evolved to resist) and kid is obese. Support for parental-conflict hypothesis is lack of imprinted genes in eggs/marsupials where embryo isn’t fighting to share mother resourcesDeadly prion disease (Creutzfeld-Jakob disease), scrapie in sheep. Jumped. Mad Cow disease’s panicky govt response. Banned beef, meat. After a while, though risk was 1 death in 4 years, still banned, instead of letting consumers make their risk-choices. Consumers who were allowed riskier choices like driving and vending machines. On all other chromosomes, a third chromosome is a death sentence, embryo never develops. But on chromosome 21, the smallest chromosome, it can develop. Down syndrome.USA culled 40k people. Sweden, Germany quickly followed suit. UK held out until Churchill shows up championing it in 1910. Full support of scientific community, and socialists who love social engineering. One hold-out in parliament, a libertarian who said state cannot have such coercive power. The fact that it was better for the community that ‘inferior humans’ not procreate was irrelevant when the unit of analysis should be the individual. Why don’t stepchildren of abusive parents become abusive? Isn’t it just as deterministic defeatism on the part of gene-critics who say everything is environmentally determined? Wouldn’t you rather be determined by something within you than something without?Difference between determinism and fatalism. Can there be free will without determinism against which to be free?"

Genome feels like many books written in a specific order; many excellent book that is. Genome speaks of Health, Disease, Sex, Power, Philosophy, Politics, Geology, Literature, Language, History, Evolution, Science, People, & everything linking them together. That last statement might seem as overselling the book, & if it was me, I wouldn't buy that statement if I saw it in a review. However, it came as a surprise for me as well.To begin with, Matt Ridley has one of the best pens I've ever seen. His writing method is superb & only surpassed by his scientific knowledge. Being written in 1999, it's certainly a bit outdated, but still provide some fundamentals in history, theories, & science to make up for the time gap between now & then.It astonished me that a book put a daunting task such as addressing 23 Chromosomes in different topics in our single species, & succeeded in doing so.Some areas felt boring for me, but I'm sure that stemmed from my own lack of interest in said areas, like for example language, philosophical depths, & some sides of history. These were however made up for me by the kind Ridley when he wrote the wonderful chapters on Genetic Diseases, History of Eugenia, Prions, Sex Chromosomes Struggle, Geology, Evolution. And these are just the tip of the iceberg for this book.If there's one thing you'd certainly regret after reading Genome, it'll be that you hadn't read it sooner."
61,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4824483-charlotte-osborn-bensaada,4,"Rideley's trope is to connect circa 2000 what we are beginning to know about the human geonomes if you will through each of the 23 human chromosomes. Some it works very well, I think I have a much better understanding of the implications of all types issues related to genetics. I also realized afterward that we as a society don't even have the beginnings of a social discussion taking place even as the science races forward. The challenge with a book like Ridley's is that it based on what we knew even just 10 years ago and I can imagine, that there is so much that even now needs to be updated. For instance he has this fascinating chapter on how 2 variations of certain cholesterol distributor or receptors (this is the other thing, you think you understand what he is saying, but it is pretty complex stuff so you can't really summarize the argument)may increase the likelihood of brain diseases in boxers. In all the coverage I have seen of the concussion crisis nothing of the sort has been noted. Is that because those studies were invalidated, is it just too new, should we be thinking about that for dangerous sports? This is not a book that will answer, but instead will push you to wonder what about. "

This is more than a book about the human genome, its also an analysis of the social, political and scientific implications of understanding the human genetic map. Each area he analyses from health and healing to death and immortalit, from instinct and intelligence to personality and behavior is illustrated with examples of experiments used to prove the point and is analysed with a laymans eye so even those of us without a scientific background can absorb and understand the complexity, possibilities and even the threats this ""new"" science presents us with.

Under the cover of biology, the book is really about humans on a philosophical level - the interesting balance between social determinism and biological determinism, the philosophical debate on if human have free will, and also who defined ""self"" - the genes, the brain, the mind, the body, or us? It triggers a waterfall of questions related to religion (belief systems) and buddhist ideologies - what is us? What is consciousness, awareness? Yet at the same time the book did give me hope, that even though we are determined/told to operate by these full body of genes, these genes are the army that support our day to day functions. Not a single gene can exert absolute influence on any feature of us, personality trait of us, meaning we have room to grow, to improve, to fulfill what we believe on this earth.

The slower tilt cycle takes 41,000 years for the North Pole to rock back and forth between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees of arc.We have fewer chromosomes than a chicken, much less DNA than a lungfish, and fewer genes than a rice plant (24,000 compared to 40,000).Yet there is much more to genetics than medicine.So it falls to commentators like me to try to translate the arcane stories of genes into something more like entertainment than education.David Haig, an evolutionary biologist, I was slightly startled to hear him say that chromosome 19 was his favourite chromosome. It has all sorts of mischievous genes on it, he explained.Imagine that the genome is a book. There are twenty-three chapters, called CHROMOSOMES. Each chapter contains several thousand stories, called GENES. Each story is made up of paragraphs, called EXONS, which are interrupted by advertisements called INTRONS. Each paragraph is made up of words, called COD ON s. Each word is written in letters called BASES.The genome is a very clever book, because in the right conditions it can both photocopy itself and read itself. The photocopying is known as REPLICATION, and the reading as TRANSLATION. In fact, the usual state of DNA is the famous DOUBLE HELIX of the original strand and its complementary pair intertwined.RNA, too, can carry a linear code and it uses the same letters as DNA except that it uses U, for uracil, in place of T. This RNA copy, called the MESSENGER RNA, is then edited by the excision of all introns and the splicing together of all exons (see above).Almost everything in the body, from hair to hormones, is either made of proteins or made by them. Every protein is a translated gene.Proteins are also responsible for switching genes on and off, by physically attaching themselves to PROMOTER and ENHANCER sequences near the start of a gene’s text.about one hundred mutations per generation, which may not seem much given that there are more than a million codons in the human genome, but in the wrong place even a single one can be fatal.Not all human genes are found on the twenty-three principal chromosomes; a few live inside little blobs called mitochondriaIn the beginning was the word. The word proselytised the sea with its message, copying itself unceasingly and forever. The word discovered how to rearrange chemicals so as to capture little eddies in the stream of entropy and make them live.conjecture that one and the same kind of living filaments is and has been the cause of all organic life?’ asked the polymathic poet and physician Erasmus Darwin in 1794.1life is a slippery thing to define, but it consists of two very different skills: the ability to replicate, and the ability to create order.The secret of life has nothing to do with quantum states. The answer will not come from physics.3 In New York in 1943, a sixty-six-year-old Canadian scientist, Oswald Avery, is putting the finishing touches to an experiment that will decisively identify DNA as the chemical manifestation of heredity.Claude Shannon is ruminating about an idea he had first had at Princeton a few years earlier. Shannon’s idea is that information and entropy are opposite faces of the same coin and that both have an intimate link with energy. The less entropy a system has, the more information it contains.Samuel Buder, a protein is just a gene’s way of making another gene; and a gene is just a protein’s way of making another protein.there is growing evidence that RNA came before proteins. RNA is a chemical substance that links the two worlds of DNA and protein.the most primitive and basic functions require the presence of RNA. It is an RNA-dependent enzyme l8 GENOME that takes the message, made of RNA, from the gene.The discovery of these remarkable properties of RNA in the early 1980s, made by Thomas Cech and Sidney Altaian, transformed our understanding of the origin of life.These ribo-organisms had a big problem. RNA is an unstable substance, which falls apart within hours. Had these organisms ventured anywhere hot, or tried to grow too large, they would have faced what geneticists call an error catastrophe — a rapid decay of the message in their genes.If this was so, Carl Woese points out, the organism was not yet an enduring entity. It was a temporary team of genes.As Patrick Forterre has long argued, it now looks as if bacteria came later, highly specialised and simplified descendants of the Lucas, long after the invention of the DNA-protein world.bacteria are much more ‘highly evolved’ than we are.supported by the existence of molecular ‘fossils’ — little bits of RN A that hang about inside the nucleus of your ceils doing unnecessary things such as splicing themselves out of genes: guide RNA, vault RN A, small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA, self-splicing introns.We put a premium instead on being complicated, in having as many genes as possible, rather than a streamlined machine for using them.CGA means arginine and GCG means alanine — in bats, in beetles, in beech trees, in bacteria.This means — and religious people might find this a useful argument — that there was only one creation, one single event when life was born. Of course, that life might have been born on a different planet and seeded here by spacecraft, or there might even have been thousands of kinds of life at first, but only Luca survived in the ruthless free-for-all of the primeval soup.the fact that large, single-celled creatures were probably the ancestors of bacteria, not vice versa.Man with all his noble qualities still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.

72,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073465-carlos-martinez,3,"A very well-written, chatty, enjoyable and wide-ranging introduction to genomics. Ridley does a reasonably good job of keeping his political philosophy - nutty right-wing libertarianism - to himself until the last couple of chapters, at which it emerges in the most unfortunate (and unscientific) fashion with the soft-pedalling of eugenics. Eugenics, we are told, is not bad science but bad _politics_; we could breed a population of really smart, slim, law-abiding people if we as individuals wanted to, but the real problem is the government telling us what to do. Absurd. If nothing else, it's well established that phenomena like 'intelligence' are extremely complex and that their genetic component corresponds to a large variety of genes that you couldn't possibly breed for.Partly the problem is that the book was published in 1999, which is a long time ago in a fast-changing world; but I think a particular political bias is the bigger issue here.If you were planning to read 5-10 books on genomics, this should probably be one of them. If however you wanted a single book to give you a flavour of the topic, I'd go for either The Gene: An Intimate History or A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Stories in Our Genes - both are more up-to-date and less Tory."
73,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832262-misterfweem,4,"So, what are you?A complicated biological machine beset by innate programming and external conditions bent both on keeping you alive and eventually killing you?Or are you the creation of a supreme being, both soul and body, possessed of a free will?And though Matt Ridley, in his 2000 book “Genome: The Autobiography of A Species in 23 Chapters,” leans to the left in this equation, he still writes an incredibly balanced and above all scientific book about the human genome, what we know about it, how we think it works and how we misunderstand the science that’s delving into figuring out how that double helix of DNA can turn two germ cells into a complicated biological masterpiece.Ridley, in the footnotes to his book, acknowledges that it was, at its printing, already out of date. Ten years further along, of course, it is certainly even more out of date. But what’s not out of date in this wonderful book is the critical approach Ridley takes to this science. And it’s not critical in any political way, but critical in a scientific way. He reminds the reader constantly that what is known about the human genome is small compared to what is not known, that cause does not necessarily mean effect, that a firm belief in genetic determinism is just as foolish on the left as is a firm belief in free will is on the right. More importantly, he reminds us all that what we have, as far as genetics goes, is some knowledge bolstered by a lot of unsupported belief.Here’s an example: We instinctively assume that bodily biochemistry is cause whereas behavior is effect, an assumption we have taken to a ridiculous extent in considering the impact of genes upon our lives. If genes are involved in behavior then it is they that are the cause and they that are deemed immutable. This is a mistake made not just by genetic determinists, but by their vociferous opponents, the people who say behavior is “not in the genes”; the people who deplore the fatalism and predestination implied, they say, by behavior genetics. They give too much ground to their opponents by allowing this assumption to stand, for they tacitly admit that if genes are involved at all, then they area t the top of the hierarchy. They forget that genes need to be switched on, and external events – or free-willed behavior – can switch on genes. Far from us lying at the mercy of our omnipotent genes, it is often our genes that lie at the mercy of us. If you go bungee jumping or take a stressful job, or repeatedly imagine a terrible fear, you will raise your cortisol levels, and the cortisol will dash about the body busy switching on genes. (It is an indisputable fact that you can rigger activity in the “happiness centers” of the brain with a deliberate smile, as surely as you can trigger a smile with happy thoughts. It really does make you feel better to smile. The physical can be at the beck and call of the behavioral.)Ridley, I believe, successfully finds and holds that middle ground. Our genes certainly influence who we are and what we become. But our behavior can, in turn, influence our genes. We are machines, beautiful, free-willed machines, capable to some extent of reprogramming ourselves.Here’s a thought I had on the bus this morning: Our genes are like the model tank kit we can buy at the hobby store. We follow the instructions religiously and build that magnificent tank. Everything works. The wheels turn. The gun turrets rotate. The tracks allow the tank to maneuver through any kind of terrain. And then we take that tank not into the battlefield, but gently down a city street, to the park, to the grocery store, trundling along. It is still there in its essence of tankness; everything that makes it a tank is still there. And yet our use of it for domestic purposes does not mean that its innate tankness takes over; we drive it to the grocery store and load it with groceries, we do not drive it to the grocery store to level the building with our tank shells.So brain and genome, tank and the purpose we put with it, work together. As Ridley writes: The human brain is a far more impressive machine than the genome. If you like quantitative measure, it has trillions of synapses instead of billions of bases and it weighs kilograms in stead of micrograms. If you prefer geometry, it is an analogue, three-dimensional machine, rather than a digital, one-dimensional one. If you like thermodynamics, it generates large quantities of heat as it works, like a steam engine. For biochemists, it requires many thousands of different proteins, neurotransmitters, and other chemicals, not just the four nucleotides of DNA. For the impatient, it literally changes while you watch, as synapses are altered to create learned memories, whereas the genome changes more slowly than a glacier. For the lover of free will, the pruning of the neural networks in our grains, by the ruthless gardener called experience, is vital to the proper functioning of the organ, whereas genomes play out their messages in a predetermined way with comparatively little flexibility. Yet . . . the dichotomy is a false one. The brain is created by genes. It is only as good as its innate design. The very fact that it is a machine designed to be modified by experience is written in the genes. The mystery of how is one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. But that the human brain is the finest monument to the capacities of genes there is no doubt. It is the mark of a great leader that he knows when to delegate. The genome knew when to delegate.I think what I enjoyed most about reading this book is that I learned a few things. Genetics is a pretty fascinating field of science, and I think if we all learned about it a bit more, we could have more intelligent discussions on the subject that what we see in political and media circles. Politics tends to get too black and white in this subject, and the media, for the most part, either boils things down too simply or merely presents both sides of the argument without really bothering to explain anything to the layman about what's being discussed. Ridley does a wonderful job explaining to the layman, but keeping it intelligent enough that the curious layman is able to keep exploring and asking questions. "
74,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63196979-matej-misik,4,"Although I found “The Gene” a slightly better read, I can still highly recommend this book. Especially the last two chapters cover the topics of eugenics & free will in a captivating & thought provoking fashion. On eugenics: “these things should be kept away from people who think they know best... I am trying to see genetic decisions put in the hands of users, which governments aren’t”And a great quote on science: “Science is like a hungry furnace that must be fed by logs from the forests of ignorance that surround us. In the process, the clearing we call knowledge expands, but the more it expands, the larger its perimeter and the more ignorance comes into view. [...] A true scientist is bored by knowledge, it is the assault on ignorance that motivates him - the mysteries that previous discoveries have revealed. The forest is more interesting than the clearing.”"
75,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272480-sina-jahandari,2,"I find the notions of genetics and inheritance both fascinating and sad. The inevitable genetic engineering and rewriting the genome to enhance humans are mind-blowing and horrifying ideas. Analogous to 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells, the book has 23 chapters. In each chapter, Ridely picks an appealing gene from the corresponding chromosome and discusses it. Sometimes he tells the story of how the gene was discovered. Sometimes he explains the role the gene plays in our life, or its necessity, or how it evolved through natural selection, or how and why it causes a disease. However, my favorite parts of the book were the side stories about the people who were somehow related to the discovery of the genes or affected by a disease caused by the genes. "
76,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105387858-stetson,4,"Matt Ridley's Genome engagingly narrates the major stories of genetic science and the insight it provides on the human condition one chromosome at a time. This clever device obviously requires some finagling from Ridley to work, but it is fun way to organize a book about the genome and allows Ridley to connect disparate topics and themes throughout the course of the book, giving in it at least the semblance of unity and a central thesis. Regardless of the organizational conceit, Ridley maintains a breezy and engaging prose style that gives lay readers digestible and enjoyable information about the science of genetics and genomics.It is notable as well as remarkable that this book was originally published the book in 1999. I read the 2011 updated version, but I don't think much about the structure or even content of the book changed radically, which is both to the benefit and detriment of Ridley's Genome. It's beneficial in that it allows Ridley to focus in on well elucidated genetic observations that come in neat anecdotal packages and really provide interesting insight about human biology and behavior, but it's detrimental in that Ridley is unable to address the massive advancements that have occurred in the genome sciences after the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and the very real prospect of germline genomic engineering in humans because of technologies like CRISPR/Cas9. It is undoubtedly true that these development would significantly shift Ridley analyses and discussions.One of the most interesting aspects of Genome is Ridley's tendency to want to leverage the science of genetics to make a nature versus nurture argument and generally extemporize about the effect of genetics on complex behaviors and social organization (ostensibly controversial but deeply interesting content). For the most part, Ridley's commentary on these subjects is fairly measured and largely fits within the orthodoxy of modern science; however, there are times where his analysis is glib or superficial. For instance, Ridley's commentary on the arguments made my Charles Murray in The Bell Curve is largely an unfledged regurgitation of the many motivated critiques from Murray-detractors who often misrepresent and malign Murray's work because of its political valence. Moreover, Ridley's reflexive and complete embrace of evolutionary linguistic theories (i.e. universal grammar) argued for by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker appears naive to elucidated limitations of such theories and their fraught relationship with neo-Darwinism. Ultimately, these shortcoming are small and should not dissuade readers eager for popular science content from picking up Genome."
77,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10961320-shane-phillips,4,"Each chapter was about a different chromosome and some concept extracted by a gene on that chromosome. There wasn't an overall story, but I found each chapter had fascinating facts about the impact of those genes. The history of the discoverers of these fascinating gene's was eye opening. Eor example, the doctor who exposed his skin to radiation so they could test if a protein responded to genetic damage as research for cancer treatments and the team that went to a remote island to get blood test from all 300 people on an island to help isolate a gene. While its 15 yrs old and probably dated, the history aspect is worth it. "
78,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67178937-melanie,5,"Matt Ridley’s book is very impressive and a must read for science majors, especially those majoring and/or taking genetics. The layout of the book is extremely unique, as the 23 chapters represent the 23 different types of chromosomes found within the human body. Ironically, these chapters do not necessarily set out to describe the complexity and function of each chromosome, but seeks to tell the story of the Human Genome Project, various topics related to genetics (such as its application to medicine and the Nature vs. Nuture debate), and how fascinating the human genome really is. Not only is this book informative of the rich scientific history and the inner workings of DNA and genes, it excites the reader to learn and hope for more to come from the scientific community. This book highlights the importance of science and the era of understanding the genome, as the world transitions into the emerging subfield of understanding proteins. The only downfall of this book is the detailed writing can be somewhat confusing. Nonetheless, Ridley does an excellent job at trying to alleviate the complexity of the subject by giving a great background and avoiding words that are extremely genre specific. Therefore, this book could be read by anyone, as the reader does not need a previous background in genetics or biology. As a result, this book is perfect for those looking to learn more about genes, epigenetics, DNA, and/or the future of medicine. "
79,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63171318-sarah-hussain,5,"Matt Ridley is an author that doesn't disappoint. This book is easy to read, well researched and presented, and full of unexpected concepts and information that challenge preconceptions. This book is an informal read, as he uses the central idea of 23 chromosomes as a vehicle without being hidebound over where the content goes. It is very entertaining as well as informative. Anyone with an interest in the field will find the text delightful devoid of unnecessary jargon. "

He comes across very clearly as a polymath man of letters, who engages intelligently with a range of ideas. Plus, he has a deliciously plain evil streak that makes him so much more interesting than the others in this genre. The Rational Optimist was a rare find for me, exciting me with intuitively objectionable yet logically consistent counter-arguments to intuitively black&white morality topics like climate change, precisely the sort of topics that need more of the sort of challenging intellectualism that drives a rational view of the topic deeper instead of doubling down emotionally and calling out the particularly stupid dissent in order to call dissent itself stupid. Genetics is a similarly intuitively black&white morality that I imagined evil freemason rationalist Ridley would have challenging views on. This didn’t turn out in the same way as the first book, mostly because this time I was firmly on the side that didn’t quite know black from white in the ethics of genetics, even tending more towards the black than white, for which Ridley’s evil would be a powerful and compelling ally. For someone who complains non-stop about the irritating politicization in popular science books, I think maybe I was disappointed this wasn’t political enough, maybe I mean it wasn’t controversial enough in its choice of subject matter or courageous enough in its edginess of stance on it. This book revealed just how shockingly low my recollection of the online course on Behavioral Genetics has been. NotesWhat an amazing period of science the 1940s/50s are. Norbert Wiener/Neumann are seeing similarities between programmable machine and organism - cybernetics. Turing makes a Universal Machine. Schrodinger postulates the code-script for organisms. Avery finds DNA. Rosalind Franklin’s experiments. Crick and Watson. Claude Shannon on information. RNA came before DNA or proteins. Life began as RNA. RNA transcribes DNA to RNA and then translates to proteins. Somewhere it became advantageous to be coded into DNA that can then be replicated, using RNA as the intermediary. An opposing theory to the idea that we all started as bacteria/archaea type branches off from the tree of life, is that we are more like initial life than bacteria, which branched off and started shaving off unnecessary DNA to become highly specialized for extreme environments. Occams razor suggests more likely bacteria shed the basic common genes than we gained new ones. We’re more like chimps than chimps are like gorillas. Compared to great apes, we have 1 less chromosome (23 vs 24), seems like our Chromosome 2 is a fused version of 2 chromosomes. Does that explain our soul?Maybe we didn’t climb down and head into the savanna, but it came to us. Sahara desert is born. Rift valley is born, creating a dry eastern highland where we’re separated from the chimp population. Aquatic hypothesis where Gibraltar cataract creates many marooned islands where we’re forced to wade for shellfish etc. Explains why we’re so comfortable in the water.There’s actually a tension created by Mendel’s neat mathematical quanta of genotypes, for Darwin’s gradual natural selection. Recessive genes shouldn’t be coming back according to Darwin. It took decades until Robert Fischer solved this problem, partly by recognizing the chromosome received separately from 2 parentsCrick was effortlessly brilliant and meandering 35yr old while Watson was precocious 19yr old. Crick had the elegant idea called the greatest wrong idea of the century, 3-letter word from 4 alphabets ATGC can account for exactly 20 amino acids (not 64), if you remove all combinations that might be misread if you start from the wrong place. Later this was shown to be wrong because phenylalanine was coded by just UUU, which Crick had ruled out by his rules. Nature it seems was more forgiving of errors by building redundancies. By identifying gene sequences and the change in a single letter that leads to a disease, now had a concrete example to Mendel’s abstract theory. Happened on a small part of Chromosome 3.Slippery slope of base pair mistakes, when there are more mistakes, it is easier to make further more mistakes (count 6 things accurately vs count 36 things). Less than 36 CAG (Glutamine), normal, more = Huntington’s, exponentially decreasing life expectancy with number of additional CAGsChromosome 4 has Huntington’s. What are the ethics around diagnosing an incurable illness? Also, 50% chance of getting it is a mathematical construct, you either have 100% or 0%. Similarly, half your children will get it is meaningless, each one has a 50% chance of getting it.Y-chromosomes are only in males, so they’re incentivized to selfishly put male interests over female. Genes that induce women to stop feeding and start ovulating for instance.X-chromosomes spend 3 times more time in females than in males, so they’re optimized for women, yet they’re in men so can act against their own body. Is this an explanation for homosexuality? Male with male elder brothers chance of being gay jumps by 33%, yet no such connection for lesbians. AB protects against Cholera. But O protects against Malaria. O protects against Syphilis also. Does this explain why Americas are primarily O, since syphilis came from there and cholera came from old world?Cholesterol is responsible for turning on important steroids, progesterone, cortisol, testosterone etc. A missing hormone on a gene in Chromosome 10 fails to turn on additional steroidal hormones, so you get feminine males for example. Cortisol turns off immune response, lymphocytes, get sick when stressed. Why has he ignored the most obvious explanation that energy-expensive long-term infection-fighting immunity is not as important as immediate danger of lion that needs shunting energy to muscles? Instead goes to sexual selection, testosterone higher for impressing females, saying hey look I can afford to get by with suppressed immunity. Insulin triggers absorption of tryptophan, needed to make serotonin, needed to make melatonin. So in dark wintry months, melatonin triggered drops serotonin, which drops tryptophan, needs insulin, so craving for carb-rich foods.Low cholesterol diet reduced heart disease by 14% but increased violent deaths by 78% because serotonin is reduced. High serotonin is OCD but low is depression, impulsive behavior.Blue eyes, pale skin, selected for cold-tolerance in nordics, also produces shy/anxious behavior. In interviews we select for confident people with interpersonal skills, yet selecting against blue eyes is considered inappropriate?Ashkenazi Jews all get assigned a number at birth, so when wanting to get married they check with a registry(Dor Yeshorim) which matches their numbers to validate no genetic diseases. Cystic fibrosis has been wipd out in the community (descended from just 350 ppl 800yrs ago). Similarly, Tay-Sachs has been eliminated. Genomic imprinting: epigenetic process that expresses genes based on parent of origin. Placental mammals: father wants the embryo to parasitize mother, mother wants to conserve resources. Embryo created from 2 mother cells does not develop placenta. Some rats A have litter with different fathers, father wants his embryo to monopolize. Arms race, so mother resists as much as possible. Take A-fathers and put them in B-mothers (single father, not evolved to resist) and kid is obese. Support for parental-conflict hypothesis is lack of imprinted genes in eggs/marsupials where embryo isn’t fighting to share mother resourcesDeadly prion disease (Creutzfeld-Jakob disease), scrapie in sheep. Jumped. Mad Cow disease’s panicky govt response. Banned beef, meat. After a while, though risk was 1 death in 4 years, still banned, instead of letting consumers make their risk-choices. Consumers who were allowed riskier choices like driving and vending machines. On all other chromosomes, a third chromosome is a death sentence, embryo never develops. But on chromosome 21, the smallest chromosome, it can develop. Down syndrome.USA culled 40k people. Sweden, Germany quickly followed suit. UK held out until Churchill shows up championing it in 1910. Full support of scientific community, and socialists who love social engineering. One hold-out in parliament, a libertarian who said state cannot have such coercive power. The fact that it was better for the community that ‘inferior humans’ not procreate was irrelevant when the unit of analysis should be the individual. Why don’t stepchildren of abusive parents become abusive? Isn’t it just as deterministic defeatism on the part of gene-critics who say everything is environmentally determined? Wouldn’t you rather be determined by something within you than something without?Difference between determinism and fatalism. Can there be free will without determinism against which to be free?"
90,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19862763-amr-khaled,5,"I'll fail to review this book if I thought about it as a single book. Genome feels like many books written in a specific order; many excellent book that is. Genome speaks of Health, Disease, Sex, Power, Philosophy, Politics, Geology, Literature, Language, History, Evolution, Science, People, & everything linking them together. That last statement might seem as overselling the book, & if it was me, I wouldn't buy that statement if I saw it in a review. However, it came as a surprise for me as well.To begin with, Matt Ridley has one of the best pens I've ever seen. His writing method is superb & only surpassed by his scientific knowledge. Being written in 1999, it's certainly a bit outdated, but still provide some fundamentals in history, theories, & science to make up for the time gap between now & then.It astonished me that a book put a daunting task such as addressing 23 Chromosomes in different topics in our single species, & succeeded in doing so.Some areas felt boring for me, but I'm sure that stemmed from my own lack of interest in said areas, like for example language, philosophical depths, & some sides of history. These were however made up for me by the kind Ridley when he wrote the wonderful chapters on Genetic Diseases, History of Eugenia, Prions, Sex Chromosomes Struggle, Geology, Evolution. And these are just the tip of the iceberg for this book.If there's one thing you'd certainly regret after reading Genome, it'll be that you hadn't read it sooner."
91,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4824483-charlotte-osborn-bensaada,4,"Rideley's trope is to connect circa 2000 what we are beginning to know about the human geonomes if you will through each of the 23 human chromosomes. Some it works very well, I think I have a much better understanding of the implications of all types issues related to genetics. I also realized afterward that we as a society don't even have the beginnings of a social discussion taking place even as the science races forward. The challenge with a book like Ridley's is that it based on what we knew even just 10 years ago and I can imagine, that there is so much that even now needs to be updated. For instance he has this fascinating chapter on how 2 variations of certain cholesterol distributor or receptors (this is the other thing, you think you understand what he is saying, but it is pretty complex stuff so you can't really summarize the argument)may increase the likelihood of brain diseases in boxers. In all the coverage I have seen of the concussion crisis nothing of the sort has been noted. Is that because those studies were invalidated, is it just too new, should we be thinking about that for dangerous sports? This is not a book that will answer, but instead will push you to wonder what about. "

This is more than a book about the human genome, its also an analysis of the social, political and scientific implications of understanding the human genetic map. Each area he analyses from health and healing to death and immortalit, from instinct and intelligence to personality and behavior is illustrated with examples of experiments used to prove the point and is analysed with a laymans eye so even those of us without a scientific background can absorb and understand the complexity, possibilities and even the threats this ""new"" science presents us with.

Under the cover of biology, the book is really about humans on a philosophical level - the interesting balance between social determinism and biological determinism, the philosophical debate on if human have free will, and also who defined ""self"" - the genes, the brain, the mind, the body, or us? It triggers a waterfall of questions related to religion (belief systems) and buddhist ideologies - what is us? What is consciousness, awareness? Yet at the same time the book did give me hope, that even though we are determined/told to operate by these full body of genes, these genes are the army that support our day to day functions. Not a single gene can exert absolute influence on any feature of us, personality trait of us, meaning we have room to grow, to improve, to fulfill what we believe on this earth.

Each chapter contains several thousand stories, called GENES. Each story is made up of paragraphs, called EXONS, which are interrupted by advertisements called INTRONS. Each paragraph is made up of words, called COD ON s. Each word is written in letters called BASES.The genome is a very clever book, because in the right conditions it can both photocopy itself and read itself. The photocopying is known as REPLICATION, and the reading as TRANSLATION. In fact, the usual state of DNA is the famous DOUBLE HELIX of the original strand and its complementary pair intertwined.RNA, too, can carry a linear code and it uses the same letters as DNA except that it uses U, for uracil, in place of T. This RNA copy, called the MESSENGER RNA, is then edited by the excision of all introns and the splicing together of all exons (see above).Almost everything in the body, from hair to hormones, is either made of proteins or made by them. Every protein is a translated gene.Proteins are also responsible for switching genes on and off, by physically attaching themselves to PROMOTER and ENHANCER sequences near the start of a gene’s text.about one hundred mutations per generation, which may not seem much given that there are more than a million codons in the human genome, but in the wrong place even a single one can be fatal.Not all human genes are found on the twenty-three principal chromosomes; a few live inside little blobs called mitochondriaIn the beginning was the word.

RNA is an unstable substance, which falls apart within hours. Had these organisms ventured anywhere hot, or tried to grow too large, they would have faced what geneticists call an error catastrophe — a rapid decay of the message in their genes.If this was so, Carl Woese points out, the organism was not yet an enduring entity.

102,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073465-carlos-martinez,3,"A very well-written, chatty, enjoyable and wide-ranging introduction to genomics. Ridley does a reasonably good job of keeping his political philosophy - nutty right-wing libertarianism - to himself until the last couple of chapters, at which it emerges in the most unfortunate (and unscientific) fashion with the soft-pedalling of eugenics. Eugenics, we are told, is not bad science but bad _politics_; we could breed a population of really smart, slim, law-abiding people if we as individuals wanted to, but the real problem is the government telling us what to do. Absurd. If nothing else, it's well established that phenomena like 'intelligence' are extremely complex and that their genetic component corresponds to a large variety of genes that you couldn't possibly breed for.Partly the problem is that the book was published in 1999, which is a long time ago in a fast-changing world; but I think a particular political bias is the bigger issue here.If you were planning to read 5-10 books on genomics, this should probably be one of them. If however you wanted a single book to give you a flavour of the topic, I'd go for either The Gene: An Intimate History or A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Stories in Our Genes - both are more up-to-date and less Tory."
103,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832262-misterfweem,4,"So, what are you?A complicated biological machine beset by innate programming and external conditions bent both on keeping you alive and eventually killing you?Or are you the creation of a supreme being, both soul and body, possessed of a free will?And though Matt Ridley, in his 2000 book “Genome: The Autobiography of A Species in 23 Chapters,” leans to the left in this equation, he still writes an incredibly balanced and above all scientific book about the human genome, what we know about it, how we think it works and how we misunderstand the science that’s delving into figuring out how that double helix of DNA can turn two germ cells into a complicated biological masterpiece.Ridley, in the footnotes to his book, acknowledges that it was, at its printing, already out of date. Ten years further along, of course, it is certainly even more out of date. But what’s not out of date in this wonderful book is the critical approach Ridley takes to this science. And it’s not critical in any political way, but critical in a scientific way. He reminds the reader constantly that what is known about the human genome is small compared to what is not known, that cause does not necessarily mean effect, that a firm belief in genetic determinism is just as foolish on the left as is a firm belief in free will is on the right. More importantly, he reminds us all that what we have, as far as genetics goes, is some knowledge bolstered by a lot of unsupported belief.Here’s an example: We instinctively assume that bodily biochemistry is cause whereas behavior is effect, an assumption we have taken to a ridiculous extent in considering the impact of genes upon our lives. If genes are involved in behavior then it is they that are the cause and they that are deemed immutable. This is a mistake made not just by genetic determinists, but by their vociferous opponents, the people who say behavior is “not in the genes”; the people who deplore the fatalism and predestination implied, they say, by behavior genetics. They give too much ground to their opponents by allowing this assumption to stand, for they tacitly admit that if genes are involved at all, then they area t the top of the hierarchy. They forget that genes need to be switched on, and external events – or free-willed behavior – can switch on genes. Far from us lying at the mercy of our omnipotent genes, it is often our genes that lie at the mercy of us. If you go bungee jumping or take a stressful job, or repeatedly imagine a terrible fear, you will raise your cortisol levels, and the cortisol will dash about the body busy switching on genes. (It is an indisputable fact that you can rigger activity in the “happiness centers” of the brain with a deliberate smile, as surely as you can trigger a smile with happy thoughts. It really does make you feel better to smile. The physical can be at the beck and call of the behavioral.)Ridley, I believe, successfully finds and holds that middle ground. Our genes certainly influence who we are and what we become. But our behavior can, in turn, influence our genes. We are machines, beautiful, free-willed machines, capable to some extent of reprogramming ourselves.Here’s a thought I had on the bus this morning: Our genes are like the model tank kit we can buy at the hobby store. We follow the instructions religiously and build that magnificent tank. Everything works. The wheels turn. The gun turrets rotate. The tracks allow the tank to maneuver through any kind of terrain. And then we take that tank not into the battlefield, but gently down a city street, to the park, to the grocery store, trundling along. It is still there in its essence of tankness; everything that makes it a tank is still there. And yet our use of it for domestic purposes does not mean that its innate tankness takes over; we drive it to the grocery store and load it with groceries, we do not drive it to the grocery store to level the building with our tank shells.So brain and genome, tank and the purpose we put with it, work together. As Ridley writes: The human brain is a far more impressive machine than the genome. If you like quantitative measure, it has trillions of synapses instead of billions of bases and it weighs kilograms in stead of micrograms. If you prefer geometry, it is an analogue, three-dimensional machine, rather than a digital, one-dimensional one. If you like thermodynamics, it generates large quantities of heat as it works, like a steam engine. For biochemists, it requires many thousands of different proteins, neurotransmitters, and other chemicals, not just the four nucleotides of DNA. For the impatient, it literally changes while you watch, as synapses are altered to create learned memories, whereas the genome changes more slowly than a glacier. For the lover of free will, the pruning of the neural networks in our grains, by the ruthless gardener called experience, is vital to the proper functioning of the organ, whereas genomes play out their messages in a predetermined way with comparatively little flexibility. Yet . . . the dichotomy is a false one. The brain is created by genes. It is only as good as its innate design. The very fact that it is a machine designed to be modified by experience is written in the genes. The mystery of how is one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. But that the human brain is the finest monument to the capacities of genes there is no doubt. It is the mark of a great leader that he knows when to delegate. The genome knew when to delegate.I think what I enjoyed most about reading this book is that I learned a few things. Genetics is a pretty fascinating field of science, and I think if we all learned about it a bit more, we could have more intelligent discussions on the subject that what we see in political and media circles. Politics tends to get too black and white in this subject, and the media, for the most part, either boils things down too simply or merely presents both sides of the argument without really bothering to explain anything to the layman about what's being discussed. Ridley does a wonderful job explaining to the layman, but keeping it intelligent enough that the curious layman is able to keep exploring and asking questions. "

I am trying to see genetic decisions put in the hands of users, which governments aren’t”And a great quote on science: “Science is like a hungry furnace that must be fed by logs from the forests of ignorance that surround us. In the process, the clearing we call knowledge expands, but the more it expands, the larger its perimeter and the more ignorance comes into view.

In each chapter, Ridely picks an appealing gene from the corresponding chromosome and discusses it. Sometimes he tells the story of how the gene was discovered. Sometimes he explains the role the gene plays in our life, or its necessity, or how it evolved through natural selection, or how and why it causes a disease. However, my favorite parts of the book were the side stories about the people who were somehow related to the discovery of the genes or affected by a disease caused by the genes. "
106,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105387858-stetson,4,"Matt Ridley's Genome engagingly narrates the major stories of genetic science and the insight it provides on the human condition one chromosome at a time. This clever device obviously requires some finagling from Ridley to work, but it is fun way to organize a book about the genome and allows Ridley to connect disparate topics and themes throughout the course of the book, giving in it at least the semblance of unity and a central thesis. Regardless of the organizational conceit, Ridley maintains a breezy and engaging prose style that gives lay readers digestible and enjoyable information about the science of genetics and genomics.It is notable as well as remarkable that this book was originally published the book in 1999. I read the 2011 updated version, but I don't think much about the structure or even content of the book changed radically, which is both to the benefit and detriment of Ridley's Genome. It's beneficial in that it allows Ridley to focus in on well elucidated genetic observations that come in neat anecdotal packages and really provide interesting insight about human biology and behavior, but it's detrimental in that Ridley is unable to address the massive advancements that have occurred in the genome sciences after the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and the very real prospect of germline genomic engineering in humans because of technologies like CRISPR/Cas9. It is undoubtedly true that these development would significantly shift Ridley analyses and discussions.One of the most interesting aspects of Genome is Ridley's tendency to want to leverage the science of genetics to make a nature versus nurture argument and generally extemporize about the effect of genetics on complex behaviors and social organization (ostensibly controversial but deeply interesting content). For the most part, Ridley's commentary on these subjects is fairly measured and largely fits within the orthodoxy of modern science; however, there are times where his analysis is glib or superficial. For instance, Ridley's commentary on the arguments made my Charles Murray in The Bell Curve is largely an unfledged regurgitation of the many motivated critiques from Murray-detractors who often misrepresent and malign Murray's work because of its political valence. Moreover, Ridley's reflexive and complete embrace of evolutionary linguistic theories (i.e. universal grammar) argued for by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker appears naive to elucidated limitations of such theories and their fraught relationship with neo-Darwinism. Ultimately, these shortcoming are small and should not dissuade readers eager for popular science content from picking up Genome."
107,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10961320-shane-phillips,4,"Each chapter was about a different chromosome and some concept extracted by a gene on that chromosome. There wasn't an overall story, but I found each chapter had fascinating facts about the impact of those genes. The history of the discoverers of these fascinating gene's was eye opening. Eor example, the doctor who exposed his skin to radiation so they could test if a protein responded to genetic damage as research for cancer treatments and the team that went to a remote island to get blood test from all 300 people on an island to help isolate a gene. While its 15 yrs old and probably dated, the history aspect is worth it. "
108,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67178937-melanie,5,"Matt Ridley’s book is very impressive and a must read for science majors, especially those majoring and/or taking genetics. The layout of the book is extremely unique, as the 23 chapters represent the 23 different types of chromosomes found within the human body. Ironically, these chapters do not necessarily set out to describe the complexity and function of each chromosome, but seeks to tell the story of the Human Genome Project, various topics related to genetics (such as its application to medicine and the Nature vs. Nuture debate), and how fascinating the human genome really is. Not only is this book informative of the rich scientific history and the inner workings of DNA and genes, it excites the reader to learn and hope for more to come from the scientific community. This book highlights the importance of science and the era of understanding the genome, as the world transitions into the emerging subfield of understanding proteins. The only downfall of this book is the detailed writing can be somewhat confusing. Nonetheless, Ridley does an excellent job at trying to alleviate the complexity of the subject by giving a great background and avoiding words that are extremely genre specific. Therefore, this book could be read by anyone, as the reader does not need a previous background in genetics or biology. As a result, this book is perfect for those looking to learn more about genes, epigenetics, DNA, and/or the future of medicine. "
109,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63171318-sarah-hussain,5,"Matt Ridley is an author that doesn't disappoint. This book is easy to read, well researched and presented, and full of unexpected concepts and information that challenge preconceptions. This book is an informal read, as he uses the central idea of 23 chromosomes as a vehicle without being hidebound over where the content goes. It is very entertaining as well as informative. Anyone with an interest in the field will find the text delightful devoid of unnecessary jargon. "

He comes across very clearly as a polymath man of letters, who engages intelligently with a range of ideas. Plus, he has a deliciously plain evil streak that makes him so much more interesting than the others in this genre. The Rational Optimist was a rare find for me, exciting me with intuitively objectionable yet logically consistent counter-arguments to intuitively black&white morality topics like climate change, precisely the sort of topics that need more of the sort of challenging intellectualism that drives a rational view of the topic deeper instead of doubling down emotionally and calling out the particularly stupid dissent in order to call dissent itself stupid. Genetics is a similarly intuitively black&white morality that I imagined evil freemason rationalist Ridley would have challenging views on. This didn’t turn out in the same way as the first book, mostly because this time I was firmly on the side that didn’t quite know black from white in the ethics of genetics, even tending more towards the black than white, for which Ridley’s evil would be a powerful and compelling ally. For someone who complains non-stop about the irritating politicization in popular science books, I think maybe I was disappointed this wasn’t political enough, maybe I mean it wasn’t controversial enough in its choice of subject matter or courageous enough in its edginess of stance on it. This book revealed just how shockingly low my recollection of the online course on Behavioral Genetics has been. NotesWhat an amazing period of science the 1940s/50s are. Norbert Wiener/Neumann are seeing similarities between programmable machine and organism - cybernetics. Turing makes a Universal Machine. Schrodinger postulates the code-script for organisms. Avery finds DNA. Rosalind Franklin’s experiments. Crick and Watson. Claude Shannon on information. RNA came before DNA or proteins. Life began as RNA. RNA transcribes DNA to RNA and then translates to proteins. Somewhere it became advantageous to be coded into DNA that can then be replicated, using RNA as the intermediary. An opposing theory to the idea that we all started as bacteria/archaea type branches off from the tree of life, is that we are more like initial life than bacteria, which branched off and started shaving off unnecessary DNA to become highly specialized for extreme environments. Occams razor suggests more likely bacteria shed the basic common genes than we gained new ones. We’re more like chimps than chimps are like gorillas. Compared to great apes, we have 1 less chromosome (23 vs 24), seems like our Chromosome 2 is a fused version of 2 chromosomes. Does that explain our soul?Maybe we didn’t climb down and head into the savanna, but it came to us. Sahara desert is born. Rift valley is born, creating a dry eastern highland where we’re separated from the chimp population. Aquatic hypothesis where Gibraltar cataract creates many marooned islands where we’re forced to wade for shellfish etc. Explains why we’re so comfortable in the water.There’s actually a tension created by Mendel’s neat mathematical quanta of genotypes, for Darwin’s gradual natural selection. Recessive genes shouldn’t be coming back according to Darwin. It took decades until Robert Fischer solved this problem, partly by recognizing the chromosome received separately from 2 parentsCrick was effortlessly brilliant and meandering 35yr old while Watson was precocious 19yr old. Crick had the elegant idea called the greatest wrong idea of the century, 3-letter word from 4 alphabets ATGC can account for exactly 20 amino acids (not 64), if you remove all combinations that might be misread if you start from the wrong place. Later this was shown to be wrong because phenylalanine was coded by just UUU, which Crick had ruled out by his rules. Nature it seems was more forgiving of errors by building redundancies. By identifying gene sequences and the change in a single letter that leads to a disease, now had a concrete example to Mendel’s abstract theory. Happened on a small part of Chromosome 3.Slippery slope of base pair mistakes, when there are more mistakes, it is easier to make further more mistakes (count 6 things accurately vs count 36 things). Less than 36 CAG (Glutamine), normal, more = Huntington’s, exponentially decreasing life expectancy with number of additional CAGsChromosome 4 has Huntington’s. What are the ethics around diagnosing an incurable illness? Also, 50% chance of getting it is a mathematical construct, you either have 100% or 0%. Similarly, half your children will get it is meaningless, each one has a 50% chance of getting it.Y-chromosomes are only in males, so they’re incentivized to selfishly put male interests over female. Genes that induce women to stop feeding and start ovulating for instance.X-chromosomes spend 3 times more time in females than in males, so they’re optimized for women, yet they’re in men so can act against their own body. Is this an explanation for homosexuality? Male with male elder brothers chance of being gay jumps by 33%, yet no such connection for lesbians. AB protects against Cholera. But O protects against Malaria. O protects against Syphilis also. Does this explain why Americas are primarily O, since syphilis came from there and cholera came from old world?Cholesterol is responsible for turning on important steroids, progesterone, cortisol, testosterone etc. A missing hormone on a gene in Chromosome 10 fails to turn on additional steroidal hormones, so you get feminine males for example. Cortisol turns off immune response, lymphocytes, get sick when stressed. Why has he ignored the most obvious explanation that energy-expensive long-term infection-fighting immunity is not as important as immediate danger of lion that needs shunting energy to muscles? Instead goes to sexual selection, testosterone higher for impressing females, saying hey look I can afford to get by with suppressed immunity. Insulin triggers absorption of tryptophan, needed to make serotonin, needed to make melatonin. So in dark wintry months, melatonin triggered drops serotonin, which drops tryptophan, needs insulin, so craving for carb-rich foods.Low cholesterol diet reduced heart disease by 14% but increased violent deaths by 78% because serotonin is reduced. High serotonin is OCD but low is depression, impulsive behavior.Blue eyes, pale skin, selected for cold-tolerance in nordics, also produces shy/anxious behavior. In interviews we select for confident people with interpersonal skills, yet selecting against blue eyes is considered inappropriate?Ashkenazi Jews all get assigned a number at birth, so when wanting to get married they check with a registry(Dor Yeshorim) which matches their numbers to validate no genetic diseases. Cystic fibrosis has been wipd out in the community (descended from just 350 ppl 800yrs ago). Similarly, Tay-Sachs has been eliminated. Genomic imprinting: epigenetic process that expresses genes based on parent of origin. Placental mammals: father wants the embryo to parasitize mother, mother wants to conserve resources. Embryo created from 2 mother cells does not develop placenta. Some rats A have litter with different fathers, father wants his embryo to monopolize. Arms race, so mother resists as much as possible. Take A-fathers and put them in B-mothers (single father, not evolved to resist) and kid is obese. Support for parental-conflict hypothesis is lack of imprinted genes in eggs/marsupials where embryo isn’t fighting to share mother resourcesDeadly prion disease (Creutzfeld-Jakob disease), scrapie in sheep. Jumped. Mad Cow disease’s panicky govt response. Banned beef, meat. After a while, though risk was 1 death in 4 years, still banned, instead of letting consumers make their risk-choices. Consumers who were allowed riskier choices like driving and vending machines. On all other chromosomes, a third chromosome is a death sentence, embryo never develops. But on chromosome 21, the smallest chromosome, it can develop. Down syndrome.USA culled 40k people. Sweden, Germany quickly followed suit. UK held out until Churchill shows up championing it in 1910. Full support of scientific community, and socialists who love social engineering. One hold-out in parliament, a libertarian who said state cannot have such coercive power. The fact that it was better for the community that ‘inferior humans’ not procreate was irrelevant when the unit of analysis should be the individual. Why don’t stepchildren of abusive parents become abusive? Isn’t it just as deterministic defeatism on the part of gene-critics who say everything is environmentally determined? Wouldn’t you rather be determined by something within you than something without?Difference between determinism and fatalism. Can there be free will without determinism against which to be free?"

Genome feels like many books written in a specific order; many excellent book that is. Genome speaks of Health, Disease, Sex, Power, Philosophy, Politics, Geology, Literature, Language, History, Evolution, Science, People, & everything linking them together. That last statement might seem as overselling the book, & if it was me, I wouldn't buy that statement if I saw it in a review. However, it came as a surprise for me as well.To begin with, Matt Ridley has one of the best pens I've ever seen. His writing method is superb & only surpassed by his scientific knowledge. Being written in 1999, it's certainly a bit outdated, but still provide some fundamentals in history, theories, & science to make up for the time gap between now & then.It astonished me that a book put a daunting task such as addressing 23 Chromosomes in different topics in our single species, & succeeded in doing so.Some areas felt boring for me, but I'm sure that stemmed from my own lack of interest in said areas, like for example language, philosophical depths, & some sides of history. These were however made up for me by the kind Ridley when he wrote the wonderful chapters on Genetic Diseases, History of Eugenia, Prions, Sex Chromosomes Struggle, Geology, Evolution. And these are just the tip of the iceberg for this book.If there's one thing you'd certainly regret after reading Genome, it'll be that you hadn't read it sooner."
121,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4824483-charlotte-osborn-bensaada,4,"Rideley's trope is to connect circa 2000 what we are beginning to know about the human geonomes if you will through each of the 23 human chromosomes. Some it works very well, I think I have a much better understanding of the implications of all types issues related to genetics. I also realized afterward that we as a society don't even have the beginnings of a social discussion taking place even as the science races forward. The challenge with a book like Ridley's is that it based on what we knew even just 10 years ago and I can imagine, that there is so much that even now needs to be updated. For instance he has this fascinating chapter on how 2 variations of certain cholesterol distributor or receptors (this is the other thing, you think you understand what he is saying, but it is pretty complex stuff so you can't really summarize the argument)may increase the likelihood of brain diseases in boxers. In all the coverage I have seen of the concussion crisis nothing of the sort has been noted. Is that because those studies were invalidated, is it just too new, should we be thinking about that for dangerous sports? This is not a book that will answer, but instead will push you to wonder what about. "

This is more than a book about the human genome, its also an analysis of the social, political and scientific implications of understanding the human genetic map. Each area he analyses from health and healing to death and immortalit, from instinct and intelligence to personality and behavior is illustrated with examples of experiments used to prove the point and is analysed with a laymans eye so even those of us without a scientific background can absorb and understand the complexity, possibilities and even the threats this ""new"" science presents us with. Thankfully for me, he also steers away from the spiritual/religious debate and concentrates on evidentiary argument.I enjoyed this book so much I came straight back and bought his follow up ""Nature via Nurture"", also an excellent read.Highly recommended."

Under the cover of biology, the book is really about humans on a philosophical level - the interesting balance between social determinism and biological determinism, the philosophical debate on if human have free will, and also who defined ""self"" - the genes, the brain, the mind, the body, or us? It triggers a waterfall of questions related to religion (belief systems) and buddhist ideologies - what is us? What is consciousness, awareness? Yet at the same time the book did give me hope, that even though we are determined/told to operate by these full body of genes, these genes are the army that support our day to day functions. Not a single gene can exert absolute influence on any feature of us, personality trait of us, meaning we have room to grow, to improve, to fulfill what we believe on this earth.

It has all sorts of mischievous genes on it, he explained.Imagine that the genome is a book. There are twenty-three chapters, called CHROMOSOMES. Each chapter contains several thousand stories, called GENES. Each story is made up of paragraphs, called EXONS, which are interrupted by advertisements called INTRONS. Each paragraph is made up of words, called COD ON s. Each word is written in letters called BASES.The genome is a very clever book, because in the right conditions it can both photocopy itself and read itself. The photocopying is known as REPLICATION, and the reading as TRANSLATION. In fact, the usual state of DNA is the famous DOUBLE HELIX of the original strand and its complementary pair intertwined.RNA, too, can carry a linear code and it uses the same letters as DNA except that it uses U, for uracil, in place of T. This RNA copy, called the MESSENGER RNA, is then edited by the excision of all introns and the splicing together of all exons (see above).Almost everything in the body, from hair to hormones, is either made of proteins or made by them. Every protein is a translated gene.Proteins are also responsible for switching genes on and off, by physically attaching themselves to PROMOTER and ENHANCER sequences near the start of a gene’s text.about one hundred mutations per generation, which may not seem much given that there are more than a million codons in the human genome, but in the wrong place even a single one can be fatal.Not all human genes are found on the twenty-three principal chromosomes; a few live inside little blobs called mitochondriaIn the beginning was the word. The word proselytised the sea with its message, copying itself unceasingly and forever. The word discovered how to rearrange chemicals so as to capture little eddies in the stream of entropy and make them live.conjecture that one and the same kind of living filaments is and has been the cause of all organic life?’ asked the polymathic poet and physician Erasmus Darwin in 1794.1life is a slippery thing to define, but it consists of two very different skills: the ability to replicate, and the ability to create order.The secret of life has nothing to do with quantum states.

Shannon’s idea is that information and entropy are opposite faces of the same coin and that both have an intimate link with energy. The less entropy a system has, the more information it contains.Samuel Buder, a protein is just a gene’s way of making another gene; and a gene is just a protein’s way of making another protein.there is growing evidence that RNA came before proteins. RNA is a chemical substance that links the two worlds of DNA and protein.the most primitive and basic functions require the presence of RNA. It is an RNA-dependent enzyme l8 GENOME that takes the message, made of RNA, from the gene.The discovery of these remarkable properties of RNA in the early 1980s, made by Thomas Cech and Sidney Altaian, transformed our understanding of the origin of life.These ribo-organisms had a big problem. RNA is an unstable substance, which falls apart within hours. Had these organisms ventured anywhere hot, or tried to grow too large, they would have faced what geneticists call an error catastrophe — a rapid decay of the message in their genes.If this was so, Carl Woese points out, the organism was not yet an enduring entity. It was a temporary team of genes.As Patrick Forterre has long argued, it now looks as if bacteria came later, highly specialised and simplified descendants of the Lucas, long after the invention of the DNA-protein world.bacteria are much more ‘highly evolved’ than we are.supported by the existence of molecular ‘fossils’ — little bits of RN A that hang about inside the nucleus of your ceils doing unnecessary things such as splicing themselves out of genes: guide RNA, vault RN A, small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA, self-splicing introns.We put a premium instead on being complicated, in having as many genes as possible, rather than a streamlined machine for using them.CGA means arginine and GCG means alanine — in bats, in beetles, in beech trees, in bacteria.This means — and religious people might find this a useful argument — that there was only one creation, one single event when life was born. Of course, that life might have been born on a different planet and seeded here by spacecraft, or there might even have been thousands of kinds of life at first, but only Luca survived in the ruthless free-for-all of the primeval soup.the fact that large, single-celled creatures were probably the ancestors of bacteria, not vice versa.Man with all his noble qualities still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.

132,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073465-carlos-martinez,3,"A very well-written, chatty, enjoyable and wide-ranging introduction to genomics. Ridley does a reasonably good job of keeping his political philosophy - nutty right-wing libertarianism - to himself until the last couple of chapters, at which it emerges in the most unfortunate (and unscientific) fashion with the soft-pedalling of eugenics. Eugenics, we are told, is not bad science but bad _politics_; we could breed a population of really smart, slim, law-abiding people if we as individuals wanted to, but the real problem is the government telling us what to do. Absurd. If nothing else, it's well established that phenomena like 'intelligence' are extremely complex and that their genetic component corresponds to a large variety of genes that you couldn't possibly breed for.Partly the problem is that the book was published in 1999, which is a long time ago in a fast-changing world; but I think a particular political bias is the bigger issue here.If you were planning to read 5-10 books on genomics, this should probably be one of them. If however you wanted a single book to give you a flavour of the topic, I'd go for either The Gene: An Intimate History or A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Stories in Our Genes - both are more up-to-date and less Tory."
133,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832262-misterfweem,4,"So, what are you?A complicated biological machine beset by innate programming and external conditions bent both on keeping you alive and eventually killing you?Or are you the creation of a supreme being, both soul and body, possessed of a free will?And though Matt Ridley, in his 2000 book “Genome: The Autobiography of A Species in 23 Chapters,” leans to the left in this equation, he still writes an incredibly balanced and above all scientific book about the human genome, what we know about it, how we think it works and how we misunderstand the science that’s delving into figuring out how that double helix of DNA can turn two germ cells into a complicated biological masterpiece.Ridley, in the footnotes to his book, acknowledges that it was, at its printing, already out of date. Ten years further along, of course, it is certainly even more out of date. But what’s not out of date in this wonderful book is the critical approach Ridley takes to this science. And it’s not critical in any political way, but critical in a scientific way. He reminds the reader constantly that what is known about the human genome is small compared to what is not known, that cause does not necessarily mean effect, that a firm belief in genetic determinism is just as foolish on the left as is a firm belief in free will is on the right. More importantly, he reminds us all that what we have, as far as genetics goes, is some knowledge bolstered by a lot of unsupported belief.Here’s an example: We instinctively assume that bodily biochemistry is cause whereas behavior is effect, an assumption we have taken to a ridiculous extent in considering the impact of genes upon our lives. If genes are involved in behavior then it is they that are the cause and they that are deemed immutable. This is a mistake made not just by genetic determinists, but by their vociferous opponents, the people who say behavior is “not in the genes”; the people who deplore the fatalism and predestination implied, they say, by behavior genetics. They give too much ground to their opponents by allowing this assumption to stand, for they tacitly admit that if genes are involved at all, then they area t the top of the hierarchy. They forget that genes need to be switched on, and external events – or free-willed behavior – can switch on genes. Far from us lying at the mercy of our omnipotent genes, it is often our genes that lie at the mercy of us. If you go bungee jumping or take a stressful job, or repeatedly imagine a terrible fear, you will raise your cortisol levels, and the cortisol will dash about the body busy switching on genes. (It is an indisputable fact that you can rigger activity in the “happiness centers” of the brain with a deliberate smile, as surely as you can trigger a smile with happy thoughts. It really does make you feel better to smile. The physical can be at the beck and call of the behavioral.)Ridley, I believe, successfully finds and holds that middle ground. Our genes certainly influence who we are and what we become. But our behavior can, in turn, influence our genes. We are machines, beautiful, free-willed machines, capable to some extent of reprogramming ourselves.Here’s a thought I had on the bus this morning: Our genes are like the model tank kit we can buy at the hobby store. We follow the instructions religiously and build that magnificent tank. Everything works. The wheels turn. The gun turrets rotate. The tracks allow the tank to maneuver through any kind of terrain. And then we take that tank not into the battlefield, but gently down a city street, to the park, to the grocery store, trundling along. It is still there in its essence of tankness; everything that makes it a tank is still there. And yet our use of it for domestic purposes does not mean that its innate tankness takes over; we drive it to the grocery store and load it with groceries, we do not drive it to the grocery store to level the building with our tank shells.So brain and genome, tank and the purpose we put with it, work together. As Ridley writes: The human brain is a far more impressive machine than the genome. If you like quantitative measure, it has trillions of synapses instead of billions of bases and it weighs kilograms in stead of micrograms. If you prefer geometry, it is an analogue, three-dimensional machine, rather than a digital, one-dimensional one. If you like thermodynamics, it generates large quantities of heat as it works, like a steam engine. For biochemists, it requires many thousands of different proteins, neurotransmitters, and other chemicals, not just the four nucleotides of DNA. For the impatient, it literally changes while you watch, as synapses are altered to create learned memories, whereas the genome changes more slowly than a glacier. For the lover of free will, the pruning of the neural networks in our grains, by the ruthless gardener called experience, is vital to the proper functioning of the organ, whereas genomes play out their messages in a predetermined way with comparatively little flexibility. Yet . . . the dichotomy is a false one. The brain is created by genes. It is only as good as its innate design. The very fact that it is a machine designed to be modified by experience is written in the genes. The mystery of how is one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. But that the human brain is the finest monument to the capacities of genes there is no doubt. It is the mark of a great leader that he knows when to delegate. The genome knew when to delegate.I think what I enjoyed most about reading this book is that I learned a few things. Genetics is a pretty fascinating field of science, and I think if we all learned about it a bit more, we could have more intelligent discussions on the subject that what we see in political and media circles. Politics tends to get too black and white in this subject, and the media, for the most part, either boils things down too simply or merely presents both sides of the argument without really bothering to explain anything to the layman about what's being discussed. Ridley does a wonderful job explaining to the layman, but keeping it intelligent enough that the curious layman is able to keep exploring and asking questions. "
134,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63196979-matej-misik,4,"Although I found “The Gene” a slightly better read, I can still highly recommend this book. Especially the last two chapters cover the topics of eugenics & free will in a captivating & thought provoking fashion. On eugenics: “these things should be kept away from people who think they know best... I am trying to see genetic decisions put in the hands of users, which governments aren’t”And a great quote on science: “Science is like a hungry furnace that must be fed by logs from the forests of ignorance that surround us. In the process, the clearing we call knowledge expands, but the more it expands, the larger its perimeter and the more ignorance comes into view. [...] A true scientist is bored by knowledge, it is the assault on ignorance that motivates him - the mysteries that previous discoveries have revealed. The forest is more interesting than the clearing.”"

The inevitable genetic engineering and rewriting the genome to enhance humans are mind-blowing and horrifying ideas. Analogous to 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells, the book has 23 chapters. In each chapter, Ridely picks an appealing gene from the corresponding chromosome and discusses it. Sometimes he tells the story of how the gene was discovered. Sometimes he explains the role the gene plays in our life, or its necessity, or how it evolved through natural selection, or how and why it causes a disease. However, my favorite parts of the book were the side stories about the people who were somehow related to the discovery of the genes or affected by a disease caused by the genes. "
136,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105387858-stetson,4,"Matt Ridley's Genome engagingly narrates the major stories of genetic science and the insight it provides on the human condition one chromosome at a time. This clever device obviously requires some finagling from Ridley to work, but it is fun way to organize a book about the genome and allows Ridley to connect disparate topics and themes throughout the course of the book, giving in it at least the semblance of unity and a central thesis. Regardless of the organizational conceit, Ridley maintains a breezy and engaging prose style that gives lay readers digestible and enjoyable information about the science of genetics and genomics.It is notable as well as remarkable that this book was originally published the book in 1999. I read the 2011 updated version, but I don't think much about the structure or even content of the book changed radically, which is both to the benefit and detriment of Ridley's Genome. It's beneficial in that it allows Ridley to focus in on well elucidated genetic observations that come in neat anecdotal packages and really provide interesting insight about human biology and behavior, but it's detrimental in that Ridley is unable to address the massive advancements that have occurred in the genome sciences after the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and the very real prospect of germline genomic engineering in humans because of technologies like CRISPR/Cas9. It is undoubtedly true that these development would significantly shift Ridley analyses and discussions.One of the most interesting aspects of Genome is Ridley's tendency to want to leverage the science of genetics to make a nature versus nurture argument and generally extemporize about the effect of genetics on complex behaviors and social organization (ostensibly controversial but deeply interesting content). For the most part, Ridley's commentary on these subjects is fairly measured and largely fits within the orthodoxy of modern science; however, there are times where his analysis is glib or superficial. For instance, Ridley's commentary on the arguments made my Charles Murray in The Bell Curve is largely an unfledged regurgitation of the many motivated critiques from Murray-detractors who often misrepresent and malign Murray's work because of its political valence. Moreover, Ridley's reflexive and complete embrace of evolutionary linguistic theories (i.e. universal grammar) argued for by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker appears naive to elucidated limitations of such theories and their fraught relationship with neo-Darwinism. Ultimately, these shortcoming are small and should not dissuade readers eager for popular science content from picking up Genome."

Eor example, the doctor who exposed his skin to radiation so they could test if a protein responded to genetic damage as research for cancer treatments and the team that went to a remote island to get blood test from all 300 people on an island to help isolate a gene.

The layout of the book is extremely unique, as the 23 chapters represent the 23 different types of chromosomes found within the human body. Ironically, these chapters do not necessarily set out to describe the complexity and function of each chromosome, but seeks to tell the story of the Human Genome Project, various topics related to genetics (such as its application to medicine and the Nature vs. Nuture debate), and how fascinating the human genome really is. Not only is this book informative of the rich scientific history and the inner workings of DNA and genes, it excites the reader to learn and hope for more to come from the scientific community. This book highlights the importance of science and the era of understanding the genome, as the world transitions into the emerging subfield of understanding proteins. The only downfall of this book is the detailed writing can be somewhat confusing. Nonetheless, Ridley does an excellent job at trying to alleviate the complexity of the subject by giving a great background and avoiding words that are extremely genre specific. Therefore, this book could be read by anyone, as the reader does not need a previous background in genetics or biology. As a result, this book is perfect for those looking to learn more about genes, epigenetics, DNA, and/or the future of medicine. "

He comes across very clearly as a polymath man of letters, who engages intelligently with a range of ideas. Plus, he has a deliciously plain evil streak that makes him so much more interesting than the others in this genre. The Rational Optimist was a rare find for me, exciting me with intuitively objectionable yet logically consistent counter-arguments to intuitively black&white morality topics like climate change, precisely the sort of topics that need more of the sort of challenging intellectualism that drives a rational view of the topic deeper instead of doubling down emotionally and calling out the particularly stupid dissent in order to call dissent itself stupid. Genetics is a similarly intuitively black&white morality that I imagined evil freemason rationalist Ridley would have challenging views on. This didn’t turn out in the same way as the first book, mostly because this time I was firmly on the side that didn’t quite know black from white in the ethics of genetics, even tending more towards the black than white, for which Ridley’s evil would be a powerful and compelling ally. For someone who complains non-stop about the irritating politicization in popular science books, I think maybe I was disappointed this wasn’t political enough, maybe I mean it wasn’t controversial enough in its choice of subject matter or courageous enough in its edginess of stance on it. This book revealed just how shockingly low my recollection of the online course on Behavioral Genetics has been. NotesWhat an amazing period of science the 1940s/50s are.

RNA transcribes DNA to RNA and then translates to proteins. Somewhere it became advantageous to be coded into DNA that can then be replicated, using RNA as the intermediary. An opposing theory to the idea that we all started as bacteria/archaea type branches off from the tree of life, is that we are more like initial life than bacteria, which branched off and started shaving off unnecessary DNA to become highly specialized for extreme environments. Occams razor suggests more likely bacteria shed the basic common genes than we gained new ones. We’re more like chimps than chimps are like gorillas. Compared to great apes, we have 1 less chromosome (23 vs 24), seems like our Chromosome 2 is a fused version of 2 chromosomes. Does that explain our soul?Maybe we didn’t climb down and head into the savanna, but it came to us. Sahara desert is born. Rift valley is born, creating a dry eastern highland where we’re separated from the chimp population. Aquatic hypothesis where Gibraltar cataract creates many marooned islands where we’re forced to wade for shellfish etc. Explains why we’re so comfortable in the water.There’s actually a tension created by Mendel’s neat mathematical quanta of genotypes, for Darwin’s gradual natural selection. Recessive genes shouldn’t be coming back according to Darwin. It took decades until Robert Fischer solved this problem, partly by recognizing the chromosome received separately from 2 parentsCrick was effortlessly brilliant and meandering 35yr old while Watson was precocious 19yr old. Crick had the elegant idea called the greatest wrong idea of the century, 3-letter word from 4 alphabets ATGC can account for exactly 20 amino acids (not 64), if you remove all combinations that might be misread if you start from the wrong place. Later this was shown to be wrong because phenylalanine was coded by just UUU, which Crick had ruled out by his rules. Nature it seems was more forgiving of errors by building redundancies. By identifying gene sequences and the change in a single letter that leads to a disease, now had a concrete example to Mendel’s abstract theory. Happened on a small part of Chromosome 3.Slippery slope of base pair mistakes, when there are more mistakes, it is easier to make further more mistakes (count 6 things accurately vs count 36 things). Less than 36 CAG (Glutamine), normal, more = Huntington’s, exponentially decreasing life expectancy with number of additional CAGsChromosome 4 has Huntington’s. What are the ethics around diagnosing an incurable illness? Also, 50% chance of getting it is a mathematical construct, you either have 100% or 0%. Similarly, half your children will get it is meaningless, each one has a 50% chance of getting it.Y-chromosomes are only in males, so they’re incentivized to selfishly put male interests over female. Genes that induce women to stop feeding and start ovulating for instance.X-chromosomes spend 3 times more time in females than in males, so they’re optimized for women, yet they’re in men so can act against their own body. Is this an explanation for homosexuality? Male with male elder brothers chance of being gay jumps by 33%, yet no such connection for lesbians. AB protects against Cholera. But O protects against Malaria. O protects against Syphilis also. Does this explain why Americas are primarily O, since syphilis came from there and cholera came from old world?Cholesterol is responsible for turning on important steroids, progesterone, cortisol, testosterone etc. A missing hormone on a gene in Chromosome 10 fails to turn on additional steroidal hormones, so you get feminine males for example. Cortisol turns off immune response, lymphocytes, get sick when stressed. Why has he ignored the most obvious explanation that energy-expensive long-term infection-fighting immunity is not as important as immediate danger of lion that needs shunting energy to muscles? Instead goes to sexual selection, testosterone higher for impressing females, saying hey look I can afford to get by with suppressed immunity. Insulin triggers absorption of tryptophan, needed to make serotonin, needed to make melatonin. So in dark wintry months, melatonin triggered drops serotonin, which drops tryptophan, needs insulin, so craving for carb-rich foods.Low cholesterol diet reduced heart disease by 14% but increased violent deaths by 78% because serotonin is reduced. High serotonin is OCD but low is depression, impulsive behavior.Blue eyes, pale skin, selected for cold-tolerance in nordics, also produces shy/anxious behavior. In interviews we select for confident people with interpersonal skills, yet selecting against blue eyes is considered inappropriate?Ashkenazi Jews all get assigned a number at birth, so when wanting to get married they check with a registry(Dor Yeshorim) which matches their numbers to validate no genetic diseases. Cystic fibrosis has been wipd out in the community (descended from just 350 ppl 800yrs ago). Similarly, Tay-Sachs has been eliminated. Genomic imprinting: epigenetic process that expresses genes based on parent of origin. Placental mammals: father wants the embryo to parasitize mother, mother wants to conserve resources. Embryo created from 2 mother cells does not develop placenta. Some rats A have litter with different fathers, father wants his embryo to monopolize. Arms race, so mother resists as much as possible. Take A-fathers and put them in B-mothers (single father, not evolved to resist) and kid is obese. Support for parental-conflict hypothesis is lack of imprinted genes in eggs/marsupials where embryo isn’t fighting to share mother resourcesDeadly prion disease (Creutzfeld-Jakob disease), scrapie in sheep. Jumped. Mad Cow disease’s panicky govt response. Banned beef, meat. After a while, though risk was 1 death in 4 years, still banned, instead of letting consumers make their risk-choices. Consumers who were allowed riskier choices like driving and vending machines. On all other chromosomes, a third chromosome is a death sentence, embryo never develops. But on chromosome 21, the smallest chromosome, it can develop. Down syndrome.USA culled 40k people. Sweden, Germany quickly followed suit. UK held out until Churchill shows up championing it in 1910. Full support of scientific community, and socialists who love social engineering. One hold-out in parliament, a libertarian who said state cannot have such coercive power. The fact that it was better for the community that ‘inferior humans’ not procreate was irrelevant when the unit of analysis should be the individual. Why don’t stepchildren of abusive parents become abusive? Isn’t it just as deterministic defeatism on the part of gene-critics who say everything is environmentally determined? Wouldn’t you rather be determined by something within you than something without?Difference between determinism and fatalism. Can there be free will without determinism against which to be free?"

Genome feels like many books written in a specific order; many excellent book that is. Genome speaks of Health, Disease, Sex, Power, Philosophy, Politics, Geology, Literature, Language, History, Evolution, Science, People, & everything linking them together. That last statement might seem as overselling the book, & if it was me, I wouldn't buy that statement if I saw it in a review. However, it came as a surprise for me as well.To begin with, Matt Ridley has one of the best pens I've ever seen. His writing method is superb & only surpassed by his scientific knowledge. Being written in 1999, it's certainly a bit outdated, but still provide some fundamentals in history, theories, & science to make up for the time gap between now & then.It astonished me that a book put a daunting task such as addressing 23 Chromosomes in different topics in our single species, & succeeded in doing so.Some areas felt boring for me, but I'm sure that stemmed from my own lack of interest in said areas, like for example language, philosophical depths, & some sides of history. These were however made up for me by the kind Ridley when he wrote the wonderful chapters on Genetic Diseases, History of Eugenia, Prions, Sex Chromosomes Struggle, Geology, Evolution. And these are just the tip of the iceberg for this book.If there's one thing you'd certainly regret after reading Genome, it'll be that you hadn't read it sooner."
151,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4824483-charlotte-osborn-bensaada,4,"Rideley's trope is to connect circa 2000 what we are beginning to know about the human geonomes if you will through each of the 23 human chromosomes. Some it works very well, I think I have a much better understanding of the implications of all types issues related to genetics. I also realized afterward that we as a society don't even have the beginnings of a social discussion taking place even as the science races forward. The challenge with a book like Ridley's is that it based on what we knew even just 10 years ago and I can imagine, that there is so much that even now needs to be updated. For instance he has this fascinating chapter on how 2 variations of certain cholesterol distributor or receptors (this is the other thing, you think you understand what he is saying, but it is pretty complex stuff so you can't really summarize the argument)may increase the likelihood of brain diseases in boxers. In all the coverage I have seen of the concussion crisis nothing of the sort has been noted. Is that because those studies were invalidated, is it just too new, should we be thinking about that for dangerous sports? This is not a book that will answer, but instead will push you to wonder what about. "

This is more than a book about the human genome, its also an analysis of the social, political and scientific implications of understanding the human genetic map. Each area he analyses from health and healing to death and immortalit, from instinct and intelligence to personality and behavior is illustrated with examples of experiments used to prove the point and is analysed with a laymans eye so even those of us without a scientific background can absorb and understand the complexity, possibilities and even the threats this ""new"" science presents us with.

It triggers a waterfall of questions related to religion (belief systems) and buddhist ideologies - what is us? What is consciousness, awareness? Yet at the same time the book did give me hope, that even though we are determined/told to operate by these full body of genes, these genes are the army that support our day to day functions. Not a single gene can exert absolute influence on any feature of us, personality trait of us, meaning we have room to grow, to improve, to fulfill what we believe on this earth.

The slower tilt cycle takes 41,000 years for the North Pole to rock back and forth between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees of arc.We have fewer chromosomes than a chicken, much less DNA than a lungfish, and fewer genes than a rice plant (24,000 compared to 40,000).Yet there is much more to genetics than medicine.So it falls to commentators like me to try to translate the arcane stories of genes into something more like entertainment than education.David Haig, an evolutionary biologist, I was slightly startled to hear him say that chromosome 19 was his favourite chromosome. It has all sorts of mischievous genes on it, he explained.Imagine that the genome is a book. There are twenty-three chapters, called CHROMOSOMES. Each chapter contains several thousand stories, called GENES. Each story is made up of paragraphs, called EXONS, which are interrupted by advertisements called INTRONS. Each paragraph is made up of words, called COD ON s. Each word is written in letters called BASES.The genome is a very clever book, because in the right conditions it can both photocopy itself and read itself. The photocopying is known as REPLICATION, and the reading as TRANSLATION. In fact, the usual state of DNA is the famous DOUBLE HELIX of the original strand and its complementary pair intertwined.RNA, too, can carry a linear code and it uses the same letters as DNA except that it uses U, for uracil, in place of T. This RNA copy, called the MESSENGER RNA, is then edited by the excision of all introns and the splicing together of all exons (see above).Almost everything in the body, from hair to hormones, is either made of proteins or made by them. Every protein is a translated gene.Proteins are also responsible for switching genes on and off, by physically attaching themselves to PROMOTER and ENHANCER sequences near the start of a gene’s text.about one hundred mutations per generation, which may not seem much given that there are more than a million codons in the human genome, but in the wrong place even a single one can be fatal.Not all human genes are found on the twenty-three principal chromosomes; a few live inside little blobs called mitochondriaIn the beginning was the word. The word proselytised the sea with its message, copying itself unceasingly and forever. The word discovered how to rearrange chemicals so as to capture little eddies in the stream of entropy and make them live.conjecture that one and the same kind of living filaments is and has been the cause of all organic life?’ asked the polymathic poet and physician Erasmus Darwin in 1794.1life is a slippery thing to define, but it consists of two very different skills: the ability to replicate, and the ability to create order.The secret of life has nothing to do with quantum states. The answer will not come from physics.3 In New York in 1943, a sixty-six-year-old Canadian scientist, Oswald Avery, is putting the finishing touches to an experiment that will decisively identify DNA as the chemical manifestation of heredity.Claude Shannon is ruminating about an idea he had first had at Princeton a few years earlier. Shannon’s idea is that information and entropy are opposite faces of the same coin and that both have an intimate link with energy. The less entropy a system has, the more information it contains.Samuel Buder, a protein is just a gene’s way of making another gene; and a gene is just a protein’s way of making another protein.there is growing evidence that RNA came before proteins. RNA is a chemical substance that links the two worlds of DNA and protein.the most primitive and basic functions require the presence of RNA. It is an RNA-dependent enzyme l8 GENOME that takes the message, made of RNA, from the gene.The discovery of these remarkable properties of RNA in the early 1980s, made by Thomas Cech and Sidney Altaian, transformed our understanding of the origin of life.These ribo-organisms had a big problem. RNA is an unstable substance, which falls apart within hours. Had these organisms ventured anywhere hot, or tried to grow too large, they would have faced what geneticists call an error catastrophe — a rapid decay of the message in their genes.If this was so, Carl Woese points out, the organism was not yet an enduring entity. It was a temporary team of genes.As Patrick Forterre has long argued, it now looks as if bacteria came later, highly specialised and simplified descendants of the Lucas, long after the invention of the DNA-protein world.bacteria are much more ‘highly evolved’ than we are.supported by the existence of molecular ‘fossils’ — little bits of RN A that hang about inside the nucleus of your ceils doing unnecessary things such as splicing themselves out of genes: guide RNA, vault RN A, small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA, self-splicing introns.We put a premium instead on being complicated, in having as many genes as possible, rather than a streamlined machine for using them.CGA means arginine and GCG means alanine — in bats, in beetles, in beech trees, in bacteria.This means — and religious people might find this a useful argument — that there was only one creation, one single event when life was born. Of course, that life might have been born on a different planet and seeded here by spacecraft, or there might even have been thousands of kinds of life at first, but only Luca survived in the ruthless free-for-all of the primeval soup.the fact that large, single-celled creatures were probably the ancestors of bacteria, not vice versa.Man with all his noble qualities still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.

162,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073465-carlos-martinez,3,"A very well-written, chatty, enjoyable and wide-ranging introduction to genomics. Ridley does a reasonably good job of keeping his political philosophy - nutty right-wing libertarianism - to himself until the last couple of chapters, at which it emerges in the most unfortunate (and unscientific) fashion with the soft-pedalling of eugenics. Eugenics, we are told, is not bad science but bad _politics_; we could breed a population of really smart, slim, law-abiding people if we as individuals wanted to, but the real problem is the government telling us what to do. Absurd. If nothing else, it's well established that phenomena like 'intelligence' are extremely complex and that their genetic component corresponds to a large variety of genes that you couldn't possibly breed for.Partly the problem is that the book was published in 1999, which is a long time ago in a fast-changing world; but I think a particular political bias is the bigger issue here.If you were planning to read 5-10 books on genomics, this should probably be one of them. If however you wanted a single book to give you a flavour of the topic, I'd go for either The Gene: An Intimate History or A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Stories in Our Genes - both are more up-to-date and less Tory."
163,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832262-misterfweem,4,"So, what are you?A complicated biological machine beset by innate programming and external conditions bent both on keeping you alive and eventually killing you?Or are you the creation of a supreme being, both soul and body, possessed of a free will?And though Matt Ridley, in his 2000 book “Genome: The Autobiography of A Species in 23 Chapters,” leans to the left in this equation, he still writes an incredibly balanced and above all scientific book about the human genome, what we know about it, how we think it works and how we misunderstand the science that’s delving into figuring out how that double helix of DNA can turn two germ cells into a complicated biological masterpiece.Ridley, in the footnotes to his book, acknowledges that it was, at its printing, already out of date. Ten years further along, of course, it is certainly even more out of date. But what’s not out of date in this wonderful book is the critical approach Ridley takes to this science. And it’s not critical in any political way, but critical in a scientific way. He reminds the reader constantly that what is known about the human genome is small compared to what is not known, that cause does not necessarily mean effect, that a firm belief in genetic determinism is just as foolish on the left as is a firm belief in free will is on the right. More importantly, he reminds us all that what we have, as far as genetics goes, is some knowledge bolstered by a lot of unsupported belief.Here’s an example: We instinctively assume that bodily biochemistry is cause whereas behavior is effect, an assumption we have taken to a ridiculous extent in considering the impact of genes upon our lives. If genes are involved in behavior then it is they that are the cause and they that are deemed immutable. This is a mistake made not just by genetic determinists, but by their vociferous opponents, the people who say behavior is “not in the genes”; the people who deplore the fatalism and predestination implied, they say, by behavior genetics. They give too much ground to their opponents by allowing this assumption to stand, for they tacitly admit that if genes are involved at all, then they area t the top of the hierarchy. They forget that genes need to be switched on, and external events – or free-willed behavior – can switch on genes. Far from us lying at the mercy of our omnipotent genes, it is often our genes that lie at the mercy of us. If you go bungee jumping or take a stressful job, or repeatedly imagine a terrible fear, you will raise your cortisol levels, and the cortisol will dash about the body busy switching on genes. (It is an indisputable fact that you can rigger activity in the “happiness centers” of the brain with a deliberate smile, as surely as you can trigger a smile with happy thoughts. It really does make you feel better to smile. The physical can be at the beck and call of the behavioral.)Ridley, I believe, successfully finds and holds that middle ground. Our genes certainly influence who we are and what we become. But our behavior can, in turn, influence our genes. We are machines, beautiful, free-willed machines, capable to some extent of reprogramming ourselves.Here’s a thought I had on the bus this morning: Our genes are like the model tank kit we can buy at the hobby store. We follow the instructions religiously and build that magnificent tank. Everything works. The wheels turn. The gun turrets rotate. The tracks allow the tank to maneuver through any kind of terrain. And then we take that tank not into the battlefield, but gently down a city street, to the park, to the grocery store, trundling along. It is still there in its essence of tankness; everything that makes it a tank is still there. And yet our use of it for domestic purposes does not mean that its innate tankness takes over; we drive it to the grocery store and load it with groceries, we do not drive it to the grocery store to level the building with our tank shells.So brain and genome, tank and the purpose we put with it, work together. As Ridley writes: The human brain is a far more impressive machine than the genome. If you like quantitative measure, it has trillions of synapses instead of billions of bases and it weighs kilograms in stead of micrograms. If you prefer geometry, it is an analogue, three-dimensional machine, rather than a digital, one-dimensional one. If you like thermodynamics, it generates large quantities of heat as it works, like a steam engine. For biochemists, it requires many thousands of different proteins, neurotransmitters, and other chemicals, not just the four nucleotides of DNA. For the impatient, it literally changes while you watch, as synapses are altered to create learned memories, whereas the genome changes more slowly than a glacier. For the lover of free will, the pruning of the neural networks in our grains, by the ruthless gardener called experience, is vital to the proper functioning of the organ, whereas genomes play out their messages in a predetermined way with comparatively little flexibility. Yet . . . the dichotomy is a false one. The brain is created by genes. It is only as good as its innate design. The very fact that it is a machine designed to be modified by experience is written in the genes. The mystery of how is one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. But that the human brain is the finest monument to the capacities of genes there is no doubt. It is the mark of a great leader that he knows when to delegate. The genome knew when to delegate.I think what I enjoyed most about reading this book is that I learned a few things. Genetics is a pretty fascinating field of science, and I think if we all learned about it a bit more, we could have more intelligent discussions on the subject that what we see in political and media circles. Politics tends to get too black and white in this subject, and the media, for the most part, either boils things down too simply or merely presents both sides of the argument without really bothering to explain anything to the layman about what's being discussed. Ridley does a wonderful job explaining to the layman, but keeping it intelligent enough that the curious layman is able to keep exploring and asking questions. "
164,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63196979-matej-misik,4,"Although I found “The Gene” a slightly better read, I can still highly recommend this book. Especially the last two chapters cover the topics of eugenics & free will in a captivating & thought provoking fashion. On eugenics: “these things should be kept away from people who think they know best... I am trying to see genetic decisions put in the hands of users, which governments aren’t”And a great quote on science: “Science is like a hungry furnace that must be fed by logs from the forests of ignorance that surround us. In the process, the clearing we call knowledge expands, but the more it expands, the larger its perimeter and the more ignorance comes into view. [...] A true scientist is bored by knowledge, it is the assault on ignorance that motivates him - the mysteries that previous discoveries have revealed. The forest is more interesting than the clearing.”"
165,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272480-sina-jahandari,2,"I find the notions of genetics and inheritance both fascinating and sad. The inevitable genetic engineering and rewriting the genome to enhance humans are mind-blowing and horrifying ideas. Analogous to 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells, the book has 23 chapters. In each chapter, Ridely picks an appealing gene from the corresponding chromosome and discusses it. Sometimes he tells the story of how the gene was discovered. Sometimes he explains the role the gene plays in our life, or its necessity, or how it evolved through natural selection, or how and why it causes a disease. However, my favorite parts of the book were the side stories about the people who were somehow related to the discovery of the genes or affected by a disease caused by the genes. "
166,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105387858-stetson,4,"Matt Ridley's Genome engagingly narrates the major stories of genetic science and the insight it provides on the human condition one chromosome at a time. This clever device obviously requires some finagling from Ridley to work, but it is fun way to organize a book about the genome and allows Ridley to connect disparate topics and themes throughout the course of the book, giving in it at least the semblance of unity and a central thesis. Regardless of the organizational conceit, Ridley maintains a breezy and engaging prose style that gives lay readers digestible and enjoyable information about the science of genetics and genomics.It is notable as well as remarkable that this book was originally published the book in 1999. I read the 2011 updated version, but I don't think much about the structure or even content of the book changed radically, which is both to the benefit and detriment of Ridley's Genome. It's beneficial in that it allows Ridley to focus in on well elucidated genetic observations that come in neat anecdotal packages and really provide interesting insight about human biology and behavior, but it's detrimental in that Ridley is unable to address the massive advancements that have occurred in the genome sciences after the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and the very real prospect of germline genomic engineering in humans because of technologies like CRISPR/Cas9. It is undoubtedly true that these development would significantly shift Ridley analyses and discussions.One of the most interesting aspects of Genome is Ridley's tendency to want to leverage the science of genetics to make a nature versus nurture argument and generally extemporize about the effect of genetics on complex behaviors and social organization (ostensibly controversial but deeply interesting content). For the most part, Ridley's commentary on these subjects is fairly measured and largely fits within the orthodoxy of modern science; however, there are times where his analysis is glib or superficial. For instance, Ridley's commentary on the arguments made my Charles Murray in The Bell Curve is largely an unfledged regurgitation of the many motivated critiques from Murray-detractors who often misrepresent and malign Murray's work because of its political valence. Moreover, Ridley's reflexive and complete embrace of evolutionary linguistic theories (i.e. universal grammar) argued for by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker appears naive to elucidated limitations of such theories and their fraught relationship with neo-Darwinism. Ultimately, these shortcoming are small and should not dissuade readers eager for popular science content from picking up Genome."
167,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10961320-shane-phillips,4,"Each chapter was about a different chromosome and some concept extracted by a gene on that chromosome. There wasn't an overall story, but I found each chapter had fascinating facts about the impact of those genes. The history of the discoverers of these fascinating gene's was eye opening. Eor example, the doctor who exposed his skin to radiation so they could test if a protein responded to genetic damage as research for cancer treatments and the team that went to a remote island to get blood test from all 300 people on an island to help isolate a gene. While its 15 yrs old and probably dated, the history aspect is worth it. "
168,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67178937-melanie,5,"Matt Ridley’s book is very impressive and a must read for science majors, especially those majoring and/or taking genetics. The layout of the book is extremely unique, as the 23 chapters represent the 23 different types of chromosomes found within the human body. Ironically, these chapters do not necessarily set out to describe the complexity and function of each chromosome, but seeks to tell the story of the Human Genome Project, various topics related to genetics (such as its application to medicine and the Nature vs. Nuture debate), and how fascinating the human genome really is. Not only is this book informative of the rich scientific history and the inner workings of DNA and genes, it excites the reader to learn and hope for more to come from the scientific community. This book highlights the importance of science and the era of understanding the genome, as the world transitions into the emerging subfield of understanding proteins. The only downfall of this book is the detailed writing can be somewhat confusing. Nonetheless, Ridley does an excellent job at trying to alleviate the complexity of the subject by giving a great background and avoiding words that are extremely genre specific. Therefore, this book could be read by anyone, as the reader does not need a previous background in genetics or biology. As a result, this book is perfect for those looking to learn more about genes, epigenetics, DNA, and/or the future of medicine. "
169,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63171318-sarah-hussain,5,"Matt Ridley is an author that doesn't disappoint. This book is easy to read, well researched and presented, and full of unexpected concepts and information that challenge preconceptions. This book is an informal read, as he uses the central idea of 23 chromosomes as a vehicle without being hidebound over where the content goes. It is very entertaining as well as informative. Anyone with an interest in the field will find the text delightful devoid of unnecessary jargon. "

He comes across very clearly as a polymath man of letters, who engages intelligently with a range of ideas. Plus, he has a deliciously plain evil streak that makes him so much more interesting than the others in this genre. The Rational Optimist was a rare find for me, exciting me with intuitively objectionable yet logically consistent counter-arguments to intuitively black&white morality topics like climate change, precisely the sort of topics that need more of the sort of challenging intellectualism that drives a rational view of the topic deeper instead of doubling down emotionally and calling out the particularly stupid dissent in order to call dissent itself stupid. Genetics is a similarly intuitively black&white morality that I imagined evil freemason rationalist Ridley would have challenging views on. This didn’t turn out in the same way as the first book, mostly because this time I was firmly on the side that didn’t quite know black from white in the ethics of genetics, even tending more towards the black than white, for which Ridley’s evil would be a powerful and compelling ally. For someone who complains non-stop about the irritating politicization in popular science books, I think maybe I was disappointed this wasn’t political enough, maybe I mean it wasn’t controversial enough in its choice of subject matter or courageous enough in its edginess of stance on it. This book revealed just how shockingly low my recollection of the online course on Behavioral Genetics has been. NotesWhat an amazing period of science the 1940s/50s are. Norbert Wiener/Neumann are seeing similarities between programmable machine and organism - cybernetics. Turing makes a Universal Machine. Schrodinger postulates the code-script for organisms. Avery finds DNA. Rosalind Franklin’s experiments. Crick and Watson. Claude Shannon on information. RNA came before DNA or proteins. Life began as RNA. RNA transcribes DNA to RNA and then translates to proteins. Somewhere it became advantageous to be coded into DNA that can then be replicated, using RNA as the intermediary. An opposing theory to the idea that we all started as bacteria/archaea type branches off from the tree of life, is that we are more like initial life than bacteria, which branched off and started shaving off unnecessary DNA to become highly specialized for extreme environments. Occams razor suggests more likely bacteria shed the basic common genes than we gained new ones. We’re more like chimps than chimps are like gorillas. Compared to great apes, we have 1 less chromosome (23 vs 24), seems like our Chromosome 2 is a fused version of 2 chromosomes. Does that explain our soul?Maybe we didn’t climb down and head into the savanna, but it came to us. Sahara desert is born. Rift valley is born, creating a dry eastern highland where we’re separated from the chimp population. Aquatic hypothesis where Gibraltar cataract creates many marooned islands where we’re forced to wade for shellfish etc. Explains why we’re so comfortable in the water.There’s actually a tension created by Mendel’s neat mathematical quanta of genotypes, for Darwin’s gradual natural selection. Recessive genes shouldn’t be coming back according to Darwin. It took decades until Robert Fischer solved this problem, partly by recognizing the chromosome received separately from 2 parentsCrick was effortlessly brilliant and meandering 35yr old while Watson was precocious 19yr old. Crick had the elegant idea called the greatest wrong idea of the century, 3-letter word from 4 alphabets ATGC can account for exactly 20 amino acids (not 64), if you remove all combinations that might be misread if you start from the wrong place. Later this was shown to be wrong because phenylalanine was coded by just UUU, which Crick had ruled out by his rules. Nature it seems was more forgiving of errors by building redundancies. By identifying gene sequences and the change in a single letter that leads to a disease, now had a concrete example to Mendel’s abstract theory. Happened on a small part of Chromosome 3.Slippery slope of base pair mistakes, when there are more mistakes, it is easier to make further more mistakes (count 6 things accurately vs count 36 things). Less than 36 CAG (Glutamine), normal, more = Huntington’s, exponentially decreasing life expectancy with number of additional CAGsChromosome 4 has Huntington’s. What are the ethics around diagnosing an incurable illness? Also, 50% chance of getting it is a mathematical construct, you either have 100% or 0%. Similarly, half your children will get it is meaningless, each one has a 50% chance of getting it.Y-chromosomes are only in males, so they’re incentivized to selfishly put male interests over female. Genes that induce women to stop feeding and start ovulating for instance.X-chromosomes spend 3 times more time in females than in males, so they’re optimized for women, yet they’re in men so can act against their own body. Is this an explanation for homosexuality? Male with male elder brothers chance of being gay jumps by 33%, yet no such connection for lesbians. AB protects against Cholera. But O protects against Malaria. O protects against Syphilis also. Does this explain why Americas are primarily O, since syphilis came from there and cholera came from old world?Cholesterol is responsible for turning on important steroids, progesterone, cortisol, testosterone etc. A missing hormone on a gene in Chromosome 10 fails to turn on additional steroidal hormones, so you get feminine males for example. Cortisol turns off immune response, lymphocytes, get sick when stressed. Why has he ignored the most obvious explanation that energy-expensive long-term infection-fighting immunity is not as important as immediate danger of lion that needs shunting energy to muscles? Instead goes to sexual selection, testosterone higher for impressing females, saying hey look I can afford to get by with suppressed immunity. Insulin triggers absorption of tryptophan, needed to make serotonin, needed to make melatonin. So in dark wintry months, melatonin triggered drops serotonin, which drops tryptophan, needs insulin, so craving for carb-rich foods.Low cholesterol diet reduced heart disease by 14% but increased violent deaths by 78% because serotonin is reduced. High serotonin is OCD but low is depression, impulsive behavior.Blue eyes, pale skin, selected for cold-tolerance in nordics, also produces shy/anxious behavior. In interviews we select for confident people with interpersonal skills, yet selecting against blue eyes is considered inappropriate?Ashkenazi Jews all get assigned a number at birth, so when wanting to get married they check with a registry(Dor Yeshorim) which matches their numbers to validate no genetic diseases. Cystic fibrosis has been wipd out in the community (descended from just 350 ppl 800yrs ago). Similarly, Tay-Sachs has been eliminated. Genomic imprinting: epigenetic process that expresses genes based on parent of origin. Placental mammals: father wants the embryo to parasitize mother, mother wants to conserve resources. Embryo created from 2 mother cells does not develop placenta. Some rats A have litter with different fathers, father wants his embryo to monopolize. Arms race, so mother resists as much as possible. Take A-fathers and put them in B-mothers (single father, not evolved to resist) and kid is obese. Support for parental-conflict hypothesis is lack of imprinted genes in eggs/marsupials where embryo isn’t fighting to share mother resourcesDeadly prion disease (Creutzfeld-Jakob disease), scrapie in sheep. Jumped. Mad Cow disease’s panicky govt response. Banned beef, meat. After a while, though risk was 1 death in 4 years, still banned, instead of letting consumers make their risk-choices. Consumers who were allowed riskier choices like driving and vending machines. On all other chromosomes, a third chromosome is a death sentence, embryo never develops. But on chromosome 21, the smallest chromosome, it can develop. Down syndrome.USA culled 40k people. Sweden, Germany quickly followed suit. UK held out until Churchill shows up championing it in 1910. Full support of scientific community, and socialists who love social engineering. One hold-out in parliament, a libertarian who said state cannot have such coercive power. The fact that it was better for the community that ‘inferior humans’ not procreate was irrelevant when the unit of analysis should be the individual. Why don’t stepchildren of abusive parents become abusive? Isn’t it just as deterministic defeatism on the part of gene-critics who say everything is environmentally determined? Wouldn’t you rather be determined by something within you than something without?Difference between determinism and fatalism. Can there be free will without determinism against which to be free?"
180,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19862763-amr-khaled,5,"I'll fail to review this book if I thought about it as a single book. Genome feels like many books written in a specific order; many excellent book that is. Genome speaks of Health, Disease, Sex, Power, Philosophy, Politics, Geology, Literature, Language, History, Evolution, Science, People, & everything linking them together. That last statement might seem as overselling the book, & if it was me, I wouldn't buy that statement if I saw it in a review. However, it came as a surprise for me as well.To begin with, Matt Ridley has one of the best pens I've ever seen. His writing method is superb & only surpassed by his scientific knowledge. Being written in 1999, it's certainly a bit outdated, but still provide some fundamentals in history, theories, & science to make up for the time gap between now & then.It astonished me that a book put a daunting task such as addressing 23 Chromosomes in different topics in our single species, & succeeded in doing so.Some areas felt boring for me, but I'm sure that stemmed from my own lack of interest in said areas, like for example language, philosophical depths, & some sides of history. These were however made up for me by the kind Ridley when he wrote the wonderful chapters on Genetic Diseases, History of Eugenia, Prions, Sex Chromosomes Struggle, Geology, Evolution. And these are just the tip of the iceberg for this book.If there's one thing you'd certainly regret after reading Genome, it'll be that you hadn't read it sooner."
181,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4824483-charlotte-osborn-bensaada,4,"Rideley's trope is to connect circa 2000 what we are beginning to know about the human geonomes if you will through each of the 23 human chromosomes. Some it works very well, I think I have a much better understanding of the implications of all types issues related to genetics. I also realized afterward that we as a society don't even have the beginnings of a social discussion taking place even as the science races forward. The challenge with a book like Ridley's is that it based on what we knew even just 10 years ago and I can imagine, that there is so much that even now needs to be updated. For instance he has this fascinating chapter on how 2 variations of certain cholesterol distributor or receptors (this is the other thing, you think you understand what he is saying, but it is pretty complex stuff so you can't really summarize the argument)may increase the likelihood of brain diseases in boxers. In all the coverage I have seen of the concussion crisis nothing of the sort has been noted. Is that because those studies were invalidated, is it just too new, should we be thinking about that for dangerous sports? This is not a book that will answer, but instead will push you to wonder what about. "

This is more than a book about the human genome, its also an analysis of the social, political and scientific implications of understanding the human genetic map. Each area he analyses from health and healing to death and immortalit, from instinct and intelligence to personality and behavior is illustrated with examples of experiments used to prove the point and is analysed with a laymans eye so even those of us without a scientific background can absorb and understand the complexity, possibilities and even the threats this ""new"" science presents us with. Thankfully for me, he also steers away from the spiritual/religious debate and concentrates on evidentiary argument.I enjoyed this book so much I came straight back and bought his follow up ""Nature via Nurture"", also an excellent read.Highly recommended."

Under the cover of biology, the book is really about humans on a philosophical level - the interesting balance between social determinism and biological determinism, the philosophical debate on if human have free will, and also who defined ""self"" - the genes, the brain, the mind, the body, or us? It triggers a waterfall of questions related to religion (belief systems) and buddhist ideologies - what is us? What is consciousness, awareness? Yet at the same time the book did give me hope, that even though we are determined/told to operate by these full body of genes, these genes are the army that support our day to day functions. Not a single gene can exert absolute influence on any feature of us, personality trait of us, meaning we have room to grow, to improve, to fulfill what we believe on this earth.

It has all sorts of mischievous genes on it, he explained.Imagine that the genome is a book. There are twenty-three chapters, called CHROMOSOMES. Each chapter contains several thousand stories, called GENES. Each story is made up of paragraphs, called EXONS, which are interrupted by advertisements called INTRONS. Each paragraph is made up of words, called COD ON s. Each word is written in letters called BASES.The genome is a very clever book, because in the right conditions it can both photocopy itself and read itself. The photocopying is known as REPLICATION, and the reading as TRANSLATION. In fact, the usual state of DNA is the famous DOUBLE HELIX of the original strand and its complementary pair intertwined.RNA, too, can carry a linear code and it uses the same letters as DNA except that it uses U, for uracil, in place of T. This RNA copy, called the MESSENGER RNA, is then edited by the excision of all introns and the splicing together of all exons (see above).Almost everything in the body, from hair to hormones, is either made of proteins or made by them. Every protein is a translated gene.Proteins are also responsible for switching genes on and off, by physically attaching themselves to PROMOTER and ENHANCER sequences near the start of a gene’s text.about one hundred mutations per generation, which may not seem much given that there are more than a million codons in the human genome, but in the wrong place even a single one can be fatal.Not all human genes are found on the twenty-three principal chromosomes; a few live inside little blobs called mitochondriaIn the beginning was the word.

RNA is an unstable substance, which falls apart within hours. Had these organisms ventured anywhere hot, or tried to grow too large, they would have faced what geneticists call an error catastrophe — a rapid decay of the message in their genes.If this was so, Carl Woese points out, the organism was not yet an enduring entity.

192,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073465-carlos-martinez,3,"A very well-written, chatty, enjoyable and wide-ranging introduction to genomics. Ridley does a reasonably good job of keeping his political philosophy - nutty right-wing libertarianism - to himself until the last couple of chapters, at which it emerges in the most unfortunate (and unscientific) fashion with the soft-pedalling of eugenics. Eugenics, we are told, is not bad science but bad _politics_; we could breed a population of really smart, slim, law-abiding people if we as individuals wanted to, but the real problem is the government telling us what to do. Absurd. If nothing else, it's well established that phenomena like 'intelligence' are extremely complex and that their genetic component corresponds to a large variety of genes that you couldn't possibly breed for.Partly the problem is that the book was published in 1999, which is a long time ago in a fast-changing world; but I think a particular political bias is the bigger issue here.If you were planning to read 5-10 books on genomics, this should probably be one of them. If however you wanted a single book to give you a flavour of the topic, I'd go for either The Gene: An Intimate History or A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Stories in Our Genes - both are more up-to-date and less Tory."
193,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832262-misterfweem,4,"So, what are you?A complicated biological machine beset by innate programming and external conditions bent both on keeping you alive and eventually killing you?Or are you the creation of a supreme being, both soul and body, possessed of a free will?And though Matt Ridley, in his 2000 book “Genome: The Autobiography of A Species in 23 Chapters,” leans to the left in this equation, he still writes an incredibly balanced and above all scientific book about the human genome, what we know about it, how we think it works and how we misunderstand the science that’s delving into figuring out how that double helix of DNA can turn two germ cells into a complicated biological masterpiece.Ridley, in the footnotes to his book, acknowledges that it was, at its printing, already out of date. Ten years further along, of course, it is certainly even more out of date. But what’s not out of date in this wonderful book is the critical approach Ridley takes to this science. And it’s not critical in any political way, but critical in a scientific way. He reminds the reader constantly that what is known about the human genome is small compared to what is not known, that cause does not necessarily mean effect, that a firm belief in genetic determinism is just as foolish on the left as is a firm belief in free will is on the right. More importantly, he reminds us all that what we have, as far as genetics goes, is some knowledge bolstered by a lot of unsupported belief.Here’s an example: We instinctively assume that bodily biochemistry is cause whereas behavior is effect, an assumption we have taken to a ridiculous extent in considering the impact of genes upon our lives. If genes are involved in behavior then it is they that are the cause and they that are deemed immutable. This is a mistake made not just by genetic determinists, but by their vociferous opponents, the people who say behavior is “not in the genes”; the people who deplore the fatalism and predestination implied, they say, by behavior genetics. They give too much ground to their opponents by allowing this assumption to stand, for they tacitly admit that if genes are involved at all, then they area t the top of the hierarchy. They forget that genes need to be switched on, and external events – or free-willed behavior – can switch on genes. Far from us lying at the mercy of our omnipotent genes, it is often our genes that lie at the mercy of us. If you go bungee jumping or take a stressful job, or repeatedly imagine a terrible fear, you will raise your cortisol levels, and the cortisol will dash about the body busy switching on genes. (It is an indisputable fact that you can rigger activity in the “happiness centers” of the brain with a deliberate smile, as surely as you can trigger a smile with happy thoughts. It really does make you feel better to smile. The physical can be at the beck and call of the behavioral.)Ridley, I believe, successfully finds and holds that middle ground. Our genes certainly influence who we are and what we become. But our behavior can, in turn, influence our genes. We are machines, beautiful, free-willed machines, capable to some extent of reprogramming ourselves.Here’s a thought I had on the bus this morning: Our genes are like the model tank kit we can buy at the hobby store. We follow the instructions religiously and build that magnificent tank. Everything works. The wheels turn. The gun turrets rotate. The tracks allow the tank to maneuver through any kind of terrain. And then we take that tank not into the battlefield, but gently down a city street, to the park, to the grocery store, trundling along. It is still there in its essence of tankness; everything that makes it a tank is still there. And yet our use of it for domestic purposes does not mean that its innate tankness takes over; we drive it to the grocery store and load it with groceries, we do not drive it to the grocery store to level the building with our tank shells.So brain and genome, tank and the purpose we put with it, work together. As Ridley writes: The human brain is a far more impressive machine than the genome. If you like quantitative measure, it has trillions of synapses instead of billions of bases and it weighs kilograms in stead of micrograms. If you prefer geometry, it is an analogue, three-dimensional machine, rather than a digital, one-dimensional one. If you like thermodynamics, it generates large quantities of heat as it works, like a steam engine. For biochemists, it requires many thousands of different proteins, neurotransmitters, and other chemicals, not just the four nucleotides of DNA. For the impatient, it literally changes while you watch, as synapses are altered to create learned memories, whereas the genome changes more slowly than a glacier. For the lover of free will, the pruning of the neural networks in our grains, by the ruthless gardener called experience, is vital to the proper functioning of the organ, whereas genomes play out their messages in a predetermined way with comparatively little flexibility. Yet . . . the dichotomy is a false one. The brain is created by genes. It is only as good as its innate design. The very fact that it is a machine designed to be modified by experience is written in the genes. The mystery of how is one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. But that the human brain is the finest monument to the capacities of genes there is no doubt. It is the mark of a great leader that he knows when to delegate. The genome knew when to delegate.I think what I enjoyed most about reading this book is that I learned a few things. Genetics is a pretty fascinating field of science, and I think if we all learned about it a bit more, we could have more intelligent discussions on the subject that what we see in political and media circles. Politics tends to get too black and white in this subject, and the media, for the most part, either boils things down too simply or merely presents both sides of the argument without really bothering to explain anything to the layman about what's being discussed. Ridley does a wonderful job explaining to the layman, but keeping it intelligent enough that the curious layman is able to keep exploring and asking questions. "

Especially the last two chapters cover the topics of eugenics & free will in a captivating & thought provoking fashion. On eugenics: “these things should be kept away from people who think they know best... I am trying to see genetic decisions put in the hands of users, which governments aren’t”And a great quote on science: “Science is like a hungry furnace that must be fed by logs from the forests of ignorance that surround us. In the process, the clearing we call knowledge expands, but the more it expands, the larger its perimeter and the more ignorance comes into view. [...] A true scientist is bored by knowledge, it is the assault on ignorance that motivates him - the mysteries that previous discoveries have revealed. The forest is more interesting than the clearing.”"

The inevitable genetic engineering and rewriting the genome to enhance humans are mind-blowing and horrifying ideas. Analogous to 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells, the book has 23 chapters.

Sometimes he explains the role the gene plays in our life, or its necessity, or how it evolved through natural selection, or how and why it causes a disease. However, my favorite parts of the book were the side stories about the people who were somehow related to the discovery of the genes or affected by a disease caused by the genes. "
196,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105387858-stetson,4,"Matt Ridley's Genome engagingly narrates the major stories of genetic science and the insight it provides on the human condition one chromosome at a time. This clever device obviously requires some finagling from Ridley to work, but it is fun way to organize a book about the genome and allows Ridley to connect disparate topics and themes throughout the course of the book, giving in it at least the semblance of unity and a central thesis. Regardless of the organizational conceit, Ridley maintains a breezy and engaging prose style that gives lay readers digestible and enjoyable information about the science of genetics and genomics.It is notable as well as remarkable that this book was originally published the book in 1999. I read the 2011 updated version, but I don't think much about the structure or even content of the book changed radically, which is both to the benefit and detriment of Ridley's Genome. It's beneficial in that it allows Ridley to focus in on well elucidated genetic observations that come in neat anecdotal packages and really provide interesting insight about human biology and behavior, but it's detrimental in that Ridley is unable to address the massive advancements that have occurred in the genome sciences after the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and the very real prospect of germline genomic engineering in humans because of technologies like CRISPR/Cas9. It is undoubtedly true that these development would significantly shift Ridley analyses and discussions.One of the most interesting aspects of Genome is Ridley's tendency to want to leverage the science of genetics to make a nature versus nurture argument and generally extemporize about the effect of genetics on complex behaviors and social organization (ostensibly controversial but deeply interesting content). For the most part, Ridley's commentary on these subjects is fairly measured and largely fits within the orthodoxy of modern science; however, there are times where his analysis is glib or superficial. For instance, Ridley's commentary on the arguments made my Charles Murray in The Bell Curve is largely an unfledged regurgitation of the many motivated critiques from Murray-detractors who often misrepresent and malign Murray's work because of its political valence. Moreover, Ridley's reflexive and complete embrace of evolutionary linguistic theories (i.e. universal grammar) argued for by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker appears naive to elucidated limitations of such theories and their fraught relationship with neo-Darwinism. Ultimately, these shortcoming are small and should not dissuade readers eager for popular science content from picking up Genome."

There wasn't an overall story, but I found each chapter had fascinating facts about the impact of those genes. The history of the discoverers of these fascinating gene's was eye opening. Eor example, the doctor who exposed his skin to radiation so they could test if a protein responded to genetic damage as research for cancer treatments and the team that went to a remote island to get blood test from all 300 people on an island to help isolate a gene. While its 15 yrs old and probably dated, the history aspect is worth it. "
198,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67178937-melanie,5,"Matt Ridley’s book is very impressive and a must read for science majors, especially those majoring and/or taking genetics. The layout of the book is extremely unique, as the 23 chapters represent the 23 different types of chromosomes found within the human body. Ironically, these chapters do not necessarily set out to describe the complexity and function of each chromosome, but seeks to tell the story of the Human Genome Project, various topics related to genetics (such as its application to medicine and the Nature vs. Nuture debate), and how fascinating the human genome really is. Not only is this book informative of the rich scientific history and the inner workings of DNA and genes, it excites the reader to learn and hope for more to come from the scientific community. This book highlights the importance of science and the era of understanding the genome, as the world transitions into the emerging subfield of understanding proteins. The only downfall of this book is the detailed writing can be somewhat confusing. Nonetheless, Ridley does an excellent job at trying to alleviate the complexity of the subject by giving a great background and avoiding words that are extremely genre specific. Therefore, this book could be read by anyone, as the reader does not need a previous background in genetics or biology. As a result, this book is perfect for those looking to learn more about genes, epigenetics, DNA, and/or the future of medicine. "
199,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63171318-sarah-hussain,5,"Matt Ridley is an author that doesn't disappoint. This book is easy to read, well researched and presented, and full of unexpected concepts and information that challenge preconceptions. This book is an informal read, as he uses the central idea of 23 chromosomes as a vehicle without being hidebound over where the content goes. It is very entertaining as well as informative. Anyone with an interest in the field will find the text delightful devoid of unnecessary jargon. "

He comes across very clearly as a polymath man of letters, who engages intelligently with a range of ideas. Plus, he has a deliciously plain evil streak that makes him so much more interesting than the others in this genre. The Rational Optimist was a rare find for me, exciting me with intuitively objectionable yet logically consistent counter-arguments to intuitively black&white morality topics like climate change, precisely the sort of topics that need more of the sort of challenging intellectualism that drives a rational view of the topic deeper instead of doubling down emotionally and calling out the particularly stupid dissent in order to call dissent itself stupid. Genetics is a similarly intuitively black&white morality that I imagined evil freemason rationalist Ridley would have challenging views on. This didn’t turn out in the same way as the first book, mostly because this time I was firmly on the side that didn’t quite know black from white in the ethics of genetics, even tending more towards the black than white, for which Ridley’s evil would be a powerful and compelling ally. For someone who complains non-stop about the irritating politicization in popular science books, I think maybe I was disappointed this wasn’t political enough, maybe I mean it wasn’t controversial enough in its choice of subject matter or courageous enough in its edginess of stance on it. This book revealed just how shockingly low my recollection of the online course on Behavioral Genetics has been. NotesWhat an amazing period of science the 1940s/50s are. Norbert Wiener/Neumann are seeing similarities between programmable machine and organism - cybernetics. Turing makes a Universal Machine. Schrodinger postulates the code-script for organisms. Avery finds DNA. Rosalind Franklin’s experiments. Crick and Watson. Claude Shannon on information. RNA came before DNA or proteins. Life began as RNA. RNA transcribes DNA to RNA and then translates to proteins. Somewhere it became advantageous to be coded into DNA that can then be replicated, using RNA as the intermediary. An opposing theory to the idea that we all started as bacteria/archaea type branches off from the tree of life, is that we are more like initial life than bacteria, which branched off and started shaving off unnecessary DNA to become highly specialized for extreme environments. Occams razor suggests more likely bacteria shed the basic common genes than we gained new ones. We’re more like chimps than chimps are like gorillas. Compared to great apes, we have 1 less chromosome (23 vs 24), seems like our Chromosome 2 is a fused version of 2 chromosomes. Does that explain our soul?Maybe we didn’t climb down and head into the savanna, but it came to us. Sahara desert is born. Rift valley is born, creating a dry eastern highland where we’re separated from the chimp population. Aquatic hypothesis where Gibraltar cataract creates many marooned islands where we’re forced to wade for shellfish etc. Explains why we’re so comfortable in the water.There’s actually a tension created by Mendel’s neat mathematical quanta of genotypes, for Darwin’s gradual natural selection. Recessive genes shouldn’t be coming back according to Darwin. It took decades until Robert Fischer solved this problem, partly by recognizing the chromosome received separately from 2 parentsCrick was effortlessly brilliant and meandering 35yr old while Watson was precocious 19yr old. Crick had the elegant idea called the greatest wrong idea of the century, 3-letter word from 4 alphabets ATGC can account for exactly 20 amino acids (not 64), if you remove all combinations that might be misread if you start from the wrong place. Later this was shown to be wrong because phenylalanine was coded by just UUU, which Crick had ruled out by his rules. Nature it seems was more forgiving of errors by building redundancies. By identifying gene sequences and the change in a single letter that leads to a disease, now had a concrete example to Mendel’s abstract theory. Happened on a small part of Chromosome 3.Slippery slope of base pair mistakes, when there are more mistakes, it is easier to make further more mistakes (count 6 things accurately vs count 36 things). Less than 36 CAG (Glutamine), normal, more = Huntington’s, exponentially decreasing life expectancy with number of additional CAGsChromosome 4 has Huntington’s. What are the ethics around diagnosing an incurable illness? Also, 50% chance of getting it is a mathematical construct, you either have 100% or 0%. Similarly, half your children will get it is meaningless, each one has a 50% chance of getting it.Y-chromosomes are only in males, so they’re incentivized to selfishly put male interests over female. Genes that induce women to stop feeding and start ovulating for instance.X-chromosomes spend 3 times more time in females than in males, so they’re optimized for women, yet they’re in men so can act against their own body. Is this an explanation for homosexuality? Male with male elder brothers chance of being gay jumps by 33%, yet no such connection for lesbians. AB protects against Cholera. But O protects against Malaria. O protects against Syphilis also. Does this explain why Americas are primarily O, since syphilis came from there and cholera came from old world?Cholesterol is responsible for turning on important steroids, progesterone, cortisol, testosterone etc. A missing hormone on a gene in Chromosome 10 fails to turn on additional steroidal hormones, so you get feminine males for example. Cortisol turns off immune response, lymphocytes, get sick when stressed. Why has he ignored the most obvious explanation that energy-expensive long-term infection-fighting immunity is not as important as immediate danger of lion that needs shunting energy to muscles? Instead goes to sexual selection, testosterone higher for impressing females, saying hey look I can afford to get by with suppressed immunity. Insulin triggers absorption of tryptophan, needed to make serotonin, needed to make melatonin. So in dark wintry months, melatonin triggered drops serotonin, which drops tryptophan, needs insulin, so craving for carb-rich foods.Low cholesterol diet reduced heart disease by 14% but increased violent deaths by 78% because serotonin is reduced. High serotonin is OCD but low is depression, impulsive behavior.Blue eyes, pale skin, selected for cold-tolerance in nordics, also produces shy/anxious behavior. In interviews we select for confident people with interpersonal skills, yet selecting against blue eyes is considered inappropriate?Ashkenazi Jews all get assigned a number at birth, so when wanting to get married they check with a registry(Dor Yeshorim) which matches their numbers to validate no genetic diseases. Cystic fibrosis has been wipd out in the community (descended from just 350 ppl 800yrs ago). Similarly, Tay-Sachs has been eliminated. Genomic imprinting: epigenetic process that expresses genes based on parent of origin. Placental mammals: father wants the embryo to parasitize mother, mother wants to conserve resources. Embryo created from 2 mother cells does not develop placenta. Some rats A have litter with different fathers, father wants his embryo to monopolize. Arms race, so mother resists as much as possible. Take A-fathers and put them in B-mothers (single father, not evolved to resist) and kid is obese. Support for parental-conflict hypothesis is lack of imprinted genes in eggs/marsupials where embryo isn’t fighting to share mother resourcesDeadly prion disease (Creutzfeld-Jakob disease), scrapie in sheep. Jumped. Mad Cow disease’s panicky govt response. Banned beef, meat. After a while, though risk was 1 death in 4 years, still banned, instead of letting consumers make their risk-choices. Consumers who were allowed riskier choices like driving and vending machines. On all other chromosomes, a third chromosome is a death sentence, embryo never develops. But on chromosome 21, the smallest chromosome, it can develop. Down syndrome.USA culled 40k people. Sweden, Germany quickly followed suit. UK held out until Churchill shows up championing it in 1910. Full support of scientific community, and socialists who love social engineering. One hold-out in parliament, a libertarian who said state cannot have such coercive power. The fact that it was better for the community that ‘inferior humans’ not procreate was irrelevant when the unit of analysis should be the individual. Why don’t stepchildren of abusive parents become abusive? Isn’t it just as deterministic defeatism on the part of gene-critics who say everything is environmentally determined? Wouldn’t you rather be determined by something within you than something without?Difference between determinism and fatalism. Can there be free will without determinism against which to be free?"

Genome feels like many books written in a specific order; many excellent book that is. Genome speaks of Health, Disease, Sex, Power, Philosophy, Politics, Geology, Literature, Language, History, Evolution, Science, People, & everything linking them together. That last statement might seem as overselling the book, & if it was me, I wouldn't buy that statement if I saw it in a review. However, it came as a surprise for me as well.To begin with, Matt Ridley has one of the best pens I've ever seen. His writing method is superb & only surpassed by his scientific knowledge. Being written in 1999, it's certainly a bit outdated, but still provide some fundamentals in history, theories, & science to make up for the time gap between now & then.It astonished me that a book put a daunting task such as addressing 23 Chromosomes in different topics in our single species, & succeeded in doing so.Some areas felt boring for me, but I'm sure that stemmed from my own lack of interest in said areas, like for example language, philosophical depths, & some sides of history. These were however made up for me by the kind Ridley when he wrote the wonderful chapters on Genetic Diseases, History of Eugenia, Prions, Sex Chromosomes Struggle, Geology, Evolution. And these are just the tip of the iceberg for this book.If there's one thing you'd certainly regret after reading Genome, it'll be that you hadn't read it sooner."
211,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4824483-charlotte-osborn-bensaada,4,"Rideley's trope is to connect circa 2000 what we are beginning to know about the human geonomes if you will through each of the 23 human chromosomes. Some it works very well, I think I have a much better understanding of the implications of all types issues related to genetics. I also realized afterward that we as a society don't even have the beginnings of a social discussion taking place even as the science races forward. The challenge with a book like Ridley's is that it based on what we knew even just 10 years ago and I can imagine, that there is so much that even now needs to be updated. For instance he has this fascinating chapter on how 2 variations of certain cholesterol distributor or receptors (this is the other thing, you think you understand what he is saying, but it is pretty complex stuff so you can't really summarize the argument)may increase the likelihood of brain diseases in boxers. In all the coverage I have seen of the concussion crisis nothing of the sort has been noted. Is that because those studies were invalidated, is it just too new, should we be thinking about that for dangerous sports? This is not a book that will answer, but instead will push you to wonder what about. "

This is more than a book about the human genome, its also an analysis of the social, political and scientific implications of understanding the human genetic map. Each area he analyses from health and healing to death and immortalit, from instinct and intelligence to personality and behavior is illustrated with examples of experiments used to prove the point and is analysed with a laymans eye so even those of us without a scientific background can absorb and understand the complexity, possibilities and even the threats this ""new"" science presents us with. Thankfully for me, he also steers away from the spiritual/religious debate and concentrates on evidentiary argument.I enjoyed this book so much I came straight back and bought his follow up ""Nature via Nurture"", also an excellent read.Highly recommended."

Under the cover of biology, the book is really about humans on a philosophical level - the interesting balance between social determinism and biological determinism, the philosophical debate on if human have free will, and also who defined ""self"" - the genes, the brain, the mind, the body, or us? It triggers a waterfall of questions related to religion (belief systems) and buddhist ideologies - what is us? What is consciousness, awareness? Yet at the same time the book did give me hope, that even though we are determined/told to operate by these full body of genes, these genes are the army that support our day to day functions. Not a single gene can exert absolute influence on any feature of us, personality trait of us, meaning we have room to grow, to improve, to fulfill what we believe on this earth.

It has all sorts of mischievous genes on it, he explained.Imagine that the genome is a book. There are twenty-three chapters, called CHROMOSOMES. Each chapter contains several thousand stories, called GENES. Each story is made up of paragraphs, called EXONS, which are interrupted by advertisements called INTRONS. Each paragraph is made up of words, called COD ON s. Each word is written in letters called BASES.The genome is a very clever book, because in the right conditions it can both photocopy itself and read itself. The photocopying is known as REPLICATION, and the reading as TRANSLATION. In fact, the usual state of DNA is the famous DOUBLE HELIX of the original strand and its complementary pair intertwined.RNA, too, can carry a linear code and it uses the same letters as DNA except that it uses U, for uracil, in place of T. This RNA copy, called the MESSENGER RNA, is then edited by the excision of all introns and the splicing together of all exons (see above).Almost everything in the body, from hair to hormones, is either made of proteins or made by them. Every protein is a translated gene.Proteins are also responsible for switching genes on and off, by physically attaching themselves to PROMOTER and ENHANCER sequences near the start of a gene’s text.about one hundred mutations per generation, which may not seem much given that there are more than a million codons in the human genome, but in the wrong place even a single one can be fatal.Not all human genes are found on the twenty-three principal chromosomes; a few live inside little blobs called mitochondriaIn the beginning was the word. The word proselytised the sea with its message, copying itself unceasingly and forever. The word discovered how to rearrange chemicals so as to capture little eddies in the stream of entropy and make them live.conjecture that one and the same kind of living filaments is and has been the cause of all organic life?’ asked the polymathic poet and physician Erasmus Darwin in 1794.1life is a slippery thing to define, but it consists of two very different skills: the ability to replicate, and the ability to create order.The secret of life has nothing to do with quantum states.

Shannon’s idea is that information and entropy are opposite faces of the same coin and that both have an intimate link with energy. The less entropy a system has, the more information it contains.Samuel Buder, a protein is just a gene’s way of making another gene; and a gene is just a protein’s way of making another protein.there is growing evidence that RNA came before proteins. RNA is a chemical substance that links the two worlds of DNA and protein.the most primitive and basic functions require the presence of RNA. It is an RNA-dependent enzyme l8 GENOME that takes the message, made of RNA, from the gene.The discovery of these remarkable properties of RNA in the early 1980s, made by Thomas Cech and Sidney Altaian, transformed our understanding of the origin of life.These ribo-organisms had a big problem. RNA is an unstable substance, which falls apart within hours. Had these organisms ventured anywhere hot, or tried to grow too large, they would have faced what geneticists call an error catastrophe — a rapid decay of the message in their genes.If this was so, Carl Woese points out, the organism was not yet an enduring entity. It was a temporary team of genes.As Patrick Forterre has long argued, it now looks as if bacteria came later, highly specialised and simplified descendants of the Lucas, long after the invention of the DNA-protein world.bacteria are much more ‘highly evolved’ than we are.supported by the existence of molecular ‘fossils’ — little bits of RN A that hang about inside the nucleus of your ceils doing unnecessary things such as splicing themselves out of genes: guide RNA, vault RN A, small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA, self-splicing introns.We put a premium instead on being complicated, in having as many genes as possible, rather than a streamlined machine for using them.CGA means arginine and GCG means alanine — in bats, in beetles, in beech trees, in bacteria.This means — and religious people might find this a useful argument — that there was only one creation, one single event when life was born. Of course, that life might have been born on a different planet and seeded here by spacecraft, or there might even have been thousands of kinds of life at first, but only Luca survived in the ruthless free-for-all of the primeval soup.the fact that large, single-celled creatures were probably the ancestors of bacteria, not vice versa.Man with all his noble qualities still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.

222,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073465-carlos-martinez,3,"A very well-written, chatty, enjoyable and wide-ranging introduction to genomics. Ridley does a reasonably good job of keeping his political philosophy - nutty right-wing libertarianism - to himself until the last couple of chapters, at which it emerges in the most unfortunate (and unscientific) fashion with the soft-pedalling of eugenics. Eugenics, we are told, is not bad science but bad _politics_; we could breed a population of really smart, slim, law-abiding people if we as individuals wanted to, but the real problem is the government telling us what to do. Absurd. If nothing else, it's well established that phenomena like 'intelligence' are extremely complex and that their genetic component corresponds to a large variety of genes that you couldn't possibly breed for.Partly the problem is that the book was published in 1999, which is a long time ago in a fast-changing world; but I think a particular political bias is the bigger issue here.If you were planning to read 5-10 books on genomics, this should probably be one of them. If however you wanted a single book to give you a flavour of the topic, I'd go for either The Gene: An Intimate History or A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Stories in Our Genes - both are more up-to-date and less Tory."
223,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832262-misterfweem,4,"So, what are you?A complicated biological machine beset by innate programming and external conditions bent both on keeping you alive and eventually killing you?Or are you the creation of a supreme being, both soul and body, possessed of a free will?And though Matt Ridley, in his 2000 book “Genome: The Autobiography of A Species in 23 Chapters,” leans to the left in this equation, he still writes an incredibly balanced and above all scientific book about the human genome, what we know about it, how we think it works and how we misunderstand the science that’s delving into figuring out how that double helix of DNA can turn two germ cells into a complicated biological masterpiece.Ridley, in the footnotes to his book, acknowledges that it was, at its printing, already out of date. Ten years further along, of course, it is certainly even more out of date. But what’s not out of date in this wonderful book is the critical approach Ridley takes to this science. And it’s not critical in any political way, but critical in a scientific way. He reminds the reader constantly that what is known about the human genome is small compared to what is not known, that cause does not necessarily mean effect, that a firm belief in genetic determinism is just as foolish on the left as is a firm belief in free will is on the right. More importantly, he reminds us all that what we have, as far as genetics goes, is some knowledge bolstered by a lot of unsupported belief.Here’s an example: We instinctively assume that bodily biochemistry is cause whereas behavior is effect, an assumption we have taken to a ridiculous extent in considering the impact of genes upon our lives. If genes are involved in behavior then it is they that are the cause and they that are deemed immutable. This is a mistake made not just by genetic determinists, but by their vociferous opponents, the people who say behavior is “not in the genes”; the people who deplore the fatalism and predestination implied, they say, by behavior genetics. They give too much ground to their opponents by allowing this assumption to stand, for they tacitly admit that if genes are involved at all, then they area t the top of the hierarchy. They forget that genes need to be switched on, and external events – or free-willed behavior – can switch on genes. Far from us lying at the mercy of our omnipotent genes, it is often our genes that lie at the mercy of us. If you go bungee jumping or take a stressful job, or repeatedly imagine a terrible fear, you will raise your cortisol levels, and the cortisol will dash about the body busy switching on genes. (It is an indisputable fact that you can rigger activity in the “happiness centers” of the brain with a deliberate smile, as surely as you can trigger a smile with happy thoughts. It really does make you feel better to smile. The physical can be at the beck and call of the behavioral.)Ridley, I believe, successfully finds and holds that middle ground. Our genes certainly influence who we are and what we become. But our behavior can, in turn, influence our genes. We are machines, beautiful, free-willed machines, capable to some extent of reprogramming ourselves.Here’s a thought I had on the bus this morning: Our genes are like the model tank kit we can buy at the hobby store. We follow the instructions religiously and build that magnificent tank. Everything works. The wheels turn. The gun turrets rotate. The tracks allow the tank to maneuver through any kind of terrain. And then we take that tank not into the battlefield, but gently down a city street, to the park, to the grocery store, trundling along. It is still there in its essence of tankness; everything that makes it a tank is still there. And yet our use of it for domestic purposes does not mean that its innate tankness takes over; we drive it to the grocery store and load it with groceries, we do not drive it to the grocery store to level the building with our tank shells.So brain and genome, tank and the purpose we put with it, work together. As Ridley writes: The human brain is a far more impressive machine than the genome. If you like quantitative measure, it has trillions of synapses instead of billions of bases and it weighs kilograms in stead of micrograms. If you prefer geometry, it is an analogue, three-dimensional machine, rather than a digital, one-dimensional one. If you like thermodynamics, it generates large quantities of heat as it works, like a steam engine. For biochemists, it requires many thousands of different proteins, neurotransmitters, and other chemicals, not just the four nucleotides of DNA. For the impatient, it literally changes while you watch, as synapses are altered to create learned memories, whereas the genome changes more slowly than a glacier. For the lover of free will, the pruning of the neural networks in our grains, by the ruthless gardener called experience, is vital to the proper functioning of the organ, whereas genomes play out their messages in a predetermined way with comparatively little flexibility. Yet . . . the dichotomy is a false one. The brain is created by genes. It is only as good as its innate design. The very fact that it is a machine designed to be modified by experience is written in the genes. The mystery of how is one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. But that the human brain is the finest monument to the capacities of genes there is no doubt. It is the mark of a great leader that he knows when to delegate. The genome knew when to delegate.I think what I enjoyed most about reading this book is that I learned a few things. Genetics is a pretty fascinating field of science, and I think if we all learned about it a bit more, we could have more intelligent discussions on the subject that what we see in political and media circles. Politics tends to get too black and white in this subject, and the media, for the most part, either boils things down too simply or merely presents both sides of the argument without really bothering to explain anything to the layman about what's being discussed. Ridley does a wonderful job explaining to the layman, but keeping it intelligent enough that the curious layman is able to keep exploring and asking questions. "
224,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63196979-matej-misik,4,"Although I found “The Gene” a slightly better read, I can still highly recommend this book. Especially the last two chapters cover the topics of eugenics & free will in a captivating & thought provoking fashion. On eugenics: “these things should be kept away from people who think they know best... I am trying to see genetic decisions put in the hands of users, which governments aren’t”And a great quote on science: “Science is like a hungry furnace that must be fed by logs from the forests of ignorance that surround us. In the process, the clearing we call knowledge expands, but the more it expands, the larger its perimeter and the more ignorance comes into view. [...] A true scientist is bored by knowledge, it is the assault on ignorance that motivates him - the mysteries that previous discoveries have revealed. The forest is more interesting than the clearing.”"

The inevitable genetic engineering and rewriting the genome to enhance humans are mind-blowing and horrifying ideas. Analogous to 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells, the book has 23 chapters. In each chapter, Ridely picks an appealing gene from the corresponding chromosome and discusses it. Sometimes he tells the story of how the gene was discovered. Sometimes he explains the role the gene plays in our life, or its necessity, or how it evolved through natural selection, or how and why it causes a disease. However, my favorite parts of the book were the side stories about the people who were somehow related to the discovery of the genes or affected by a disease caused by the genes. "
226,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105387858-stetson,4,"Matt Ridley's Genome engagingly narrates the major stories of genetic science and the insight it provides on the human condition one chromosome at a time. This clever device obviously requires some finagling from Ridley to work, but it is fun way to organize a book about the genome and allows Ridley to connect disparate topics and themes throughout the course of the book, giving in it at least the semblance of unity and a central thesis. Regardless of the organizational conceit, Ridley maintains a breezy and engaging prose style that gives lay readers digestible and enjoyable information about the science of genetics and genomics.It is notable as well as remarkable that this book was originally published the book in 1999. I read the 2011 updated version, but I don't think much about the structure or even content of the book changed radically, which is both to the benefit and detriment of Ridley's Genome. It's beneficial in that it allows Ridley to focus in on well elucidated genetic observations that come in neat anecdotal packages and really provide interesting insight about human biology and behavior, but it's detrimental in that Ridley is unable to address the massive advancements that have occurred in the genome sciences after the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and the very real prospect of germline genomic engineering in humans because of technologies like CRISPR/Cas9. It is undoubtedly true that these development would significantly shift Ridley analyses and discussions.One of the most interesting aspects of Genome is Ridley's tendency to want to leverage the science of genetics to make a nature versus nurture argument and generally extemporize about the effect of genetics on complex behaviors and social organization (ostensibly controversial but deeply interesting content). For the most part, Ridley's commentary on these subjects is fairly measured and largely fits within the orthodoxy of modern science; however, there are times where his analysis is glib or superficial. For instance, Ridley's commentary on the arguments made my Charles Murray in The Bell Curve is largely an unfledged regurgitation of the many motivated critiques from Murray-detractors who often misrepresent and malign Murray's work because of its political valence. Moreover, Ridley's reflexive and complete embrace of evolutionary linguistic theories (i.e. universal grammar) argued for by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker appears naive to elucidated limitations of such theories and their fraught relationship with neo-Darwinism. Ultimately, these shortcoming are small and should not dissuade readers eager for popular science content from picking up Genome."

Eor example, the doctor who exposed his skin to radiation so they could test if a protein responded to genetic damage as research for cancer treatments and the team that went to a remote island to get blood test from all 300 people on an island to help isolate a gene.

The layout of the book is extremely unique, as the 23 chapters represent the 23 different types of chromosomes found within the human body. Ironically, these chapters do not necessarily set out to describe the complexity and function of each chromosome, but seeks to tell the story of the Human Genome Project, various topics related to genetics (such as its application to medicine and the Nature vs. Nuture debate), and how fascinating the human genome really is. Not only is this book informative of the rich scientific history and the inner workings of DNA and genes, it excites the reader to learn and hope for more to come from the scientific community. This book highlights the importance of science and the era of understanding the genome, as the world transitions into the emerging subfield of understanding proteins. The only downfall of this book is the detailed writing can be somewhat confusing. Nonetheless, Ridley does an excellent job at trying to alleviate the complexity of the subject by giving a great background and avoiding words that are extremely genre specific. Therefore, this book could be read by anyone, as the reader does not need a previous background in genetics or biology. As a result, this book is perfect for those looking to learn more about genes, epigenetics, DNA, and/or the future of medicine. "

He comes across very clearly as a polymath man of letters, who engages intelligently with a range of ideas. Plus, he has a deliciously plain evil streak that makes him so much more interesting than the others in this genre. The Rational Optimist was a rare find for me, exciting me with intuitively objectionable yet logically consistent counter-arguments to intuitively black&white morality topics like climate change, precisely the sort of topics that need more of the sort of challenging intellectualism that drives a rational view of the topic deeper instead of doubling down emotionally and calling out the particularly stupid dissent in order to call dissent itself stupid. Genetics is a similarly intuitively black&white morality that I imagined evil freemason rationalist Ridley would have challenging views on. This didn’t turn out in the same way as the first book, mostly because this time I was firmly on the side that didn’t quite know black from white in the ethics of genetics, even tending more towards the black than white, for which Ridley’s evil would be a powerful and compelling ally. For someone who complains non-stop about the irritating politicization in popular science books, I think maybe I was disappointed this wasn’t political enough, maybe I mean it wasn’t controversial enough in its choice of subject matter or courageous enough in its edginess of stance on it. This book revealed just how shockingly low my recollection of the online course on Behavioral Genetics has been. NotesWhat an amazing period of science the 1940s/50s are. Norbert Wiener/Neumann are seeing similarities between programmable machine and organism - cybernetics. Turing makes a Universal Machine. Schrodinger postulates the code-script for organisms. Avery finds DNA. Rosalind Franklin’s experiments. Crick and Watson. Claude Shannon on information. RNA came before DNA or proteins. Life began as RNA. RNA transcribes DNA to RNA and then translates to proteins. Somewhere it became advantageous to be coded into DNA that can then be replicated, using RNA as the intermediary. An opposing theory to the idea that we all started as bacteria/archaea type branches off from the tree of life, is that we are more like initial life than bacteria, which branched off and started shaving off unnecessary DNA to become highly specialized for extreme environments. Occams razor suggests more likely bacteria shed the basic common genes than we gained new ones. We’re more like chimps than chimps are like gorillas. Compared to great apes, we have 1 less chromosome (23 vs 24), seems like our Chromosome 2 is a fused version of 2 chromosomes. Does that explain our soul?Maybe we didn’t climb down and head into the savanna, but it came to us. Sahara desert is born. Rift valley is born, creating a dry eastern highland where we’re separated from the chimp population. Aquatic hypothesis where Gibraltar cataract creates many marooned islands where we’re forced to wade for shellfish etc. Explains why we’re so comfortable in the water.There’s actually a tension created by Mendel’s neat mathematical quanta of genotypes, for Darwin’s gradual natural selection. Recessive genes shouldn’t be coming back according to Darwin. It took decades until Robert Fischer solved this problem, partly by recognizing the chromosome received separately from 2 parentsCrick was effortlessly brilliant and meandering 35yr old while Watson was precocious 19yr old. Crick had the elegant idea called the greatest wrong idea of the century, 3-letter word from 4 alphabets ATGC can account for exactly 20 amino acids (not 64), if you remove all combinations that might be misread if you start from the wrong place. Later this was shown to be wrong because phenylalanine was coded by just UUU, which Crick had ruled out by his rules. Nature it seems was more forgiving of errors by building redundancies. By identifying gene sequences and the change in a single letter that leads to a disease, now had a concrete example to Mendel’s abstract theory. Happened on a small part of Chromosome 3.Slippery slope of base pair mistakes, when there are more mistakes, it is easier to make further more mistakes (count 6 things accurately vs count 36 things). Less than 36 CAG (Glutamine), normal, more = Huntington’s, exponentially decreasing life expectancy with number of additional CAGsChromosome 4 has Huntington’s. What are the ethics around diagnosing an incurable illness? Also, 50% chance of getting it is a mathematical construct, you either have 100% or 0%. Similarly, half your children will get it is meaningless, each one has a 50% chance of getting it.Y-chromosomes are only in males, so they’re incentivized to selfishly put male interests over female. Genes that induce women to stop feeding and start ovulating for instance.X-chromosomes spend 3 times more time in females than in males, so they’re optimized for women, yet they’re in men so can act against their own body. Is this an explanation for homosexuality? Male with male elder brothers chance of being gay jumps by 33%, yet no such connection for lesbians. AB protects against Cholera.

Genomic imprinting: epigenetic process that expresses genes based on parent of origin. Placental mammals: father wants the embryo to parasitize mother, mother wants to conserve resources. Embryo created from 2 mother cells does not develop placenta. Some rats A have litter with different fathers, father wants his embryo to monopolize. Arms race, so mother resists as much as possible. Take A-fathers and put them in B-mothers (single father, not evolved to resist) and kid is obese.

Genome feels like many books written in a specific order; many excellent book that is. Genome speaks of Health, Disease, Sex, Power, Philosophy, Politics, Geology, Literature, Language, History, Evolution, Science, People, & everything linking them together. That last statement might seem as overselling the book, & if it was me, I wouldn't buy that statement if I saw it in a review. However, it came as a surprise for me as well.To begin with, Matt Ridley has one of the best pens I've ever seen. His writing method is superb & only surpassed by his scientific knowledge. Being written in 1999, it's certainly a bit outdated, but still provide some fundamentals in history, theories, & science to make up for the time gap between now & then.It astonished me that a book put a daunting task such as addressing 23 Chromosomes in different topics in our single species, & succeeded in doing so.Some areas felt boring for me, but I'm sure that stemmed from my own lack of interest in said areas, like for example language, philosophical depths, & some sides of history. These were however made up for me by the kind Ridley when he wrote the wonderful chapters on Genetic Diseases, History of Eugenia, Prions, Sex Chromosomes Struggle, Geology, Evolution. And these are just the tip of the iceberg for this book.If there's one thing you'd certainly regret after reading Genome, it'll be that you hadn't read it sooner."
241,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4824483-charlotte-osborn-bensaada,4,"Rideley's trope is to connect circa 2000 what we are beginning to know about the human geonomes if you will through each of the 23 human chromosomes. Some it works very well, I think I have a much better understanding of the implications of all types issues related to genetics. I also realized afterward that we as a society don't even have the beginnings of a social discussion taking place even as the science races forward. The challenge with a book like Ridley's is that it based on what we knew even just 10 years ago and I can imagine, that there is so much that even now needs to be updated. For instance he has this fascinating chapter on how 2 variations of certain cholesterol distributor or receptors (this is the other thing, you think you understand what he is saying, but it is pretty complex stuff so you can't really summarize the argument)may increase the likelihood of brain diseases in boxers. In all the coverage I have seen of the concussion crisis nothing of the sort has been noted. Is that because those studies were invalidated, is it just too new, should we be thinking about that for dangerous sports? This is not a book that will answer, but instead will push you to wonder what about. "

This is more than a book about the human genome, its also an analysis of the social, political and scientific implications of understanding the human genetic map. Each area he analyses from health and healing to death and immortalit, from instinct and intelligence to personality and behavior is illustrated with examples of experiments used to prove the point and is analysed with a laymans eye so even those of us without a scientific background can absorb and understand the complexity, possibilities and even the threats this ""new"" science presents us with.

It triggers a waterfall of questions related to religion (belief systems) and buddhist ideologies - what is us? What is consciousness, awareness? Yet at the same time the book did give me hope, that even though we are determined/told to operate by these full body of genes, these genes are the army that support our day to day functions. Not a single gene can exert absolute influence on any feature of us, personality trait of us, meaning we have room to grow, to improve, to fulfill what we believe on this earth.

The slower tilt cycle takes 41,000 years for the North Pole to rock back and forth between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees of arc.We have fewer chromosomes than a chicken, much less DNA than a lungfish, and fewer genes than a rice plant (24,000 compared to 40,000).Yet there is much more to genetics than medicine.So it falls to commentators like me to try to translate the arcane stories of genes into something more like entertainment than education.David Haig, an evolutionary biologist, I was slightly startled to hear him say that chromosome 19 was his favourite chromosome. It has all sorts of mischievous genes on it, he explained.Imagine that the genome is a book. There are twenty-three chapters, called CHROMOSOMES. Each chapter contains several thousand stories, called GENES. Each story is made up of paragraphs, called EXONS, which are interrupted by advertisements called INTRONS. Each paragraph is made up of words, called COD ON s. Each word is written in letters called BASES.The genome is a very clever book, because in the right conditions it can both photocopy itself and read itself. The photocopying is known as REPLICATION, and the reading as TRANSLATION. In fact, the usual state of DNA is the famous DOUBLE HELIX of the original strand and its complementary pair intertwined.RNA, too, can carry a linear code and it uses the same letters as DNA except that it uses U, for uracil, in place of T. This RNA copy, called the MESSENGER RNA, is then edited by the excision of all introns and the splicing together of all exons (see above).Almost everything in the body, from hair to hormones, is either made of proteins or made by them. Every protein is a translated gene.Proteins are also responsible for switching genes on and off, by physically attaching themselves to PROMOTER and ENHANCER sequences near the start of a gene’s text.about one hundred mutations per generation, which may not seem much given that there are more than a million codons in the human genome, but in the wrong place even a single one can be fatal.Not all human genes are found on the twenty-three principal chromosomes; a few live inside little blobs called mitochondriaIn the beginning was the word. The word proselytised the sea with its message, copying itself unceasingly and forever. The word discovered how to rearrange chemicals so as to capture little eddies in the stream of entropy and make them live.conjecture that one and the same kind of living filaments is and has been the cause of all organic life?’ asked the polymathic poet and physician Erasmus Darwin in 1794.1life is a slippery thing to define, but it consists of two very different skills: the ability to replicate, and the ability to create order.The secret of life has nothing to do with quantum states.

Shannon’s idea is that information and entropy are opposite faces of the same coin and that both have an intimate link with energy. The less entropy a system has, the more information it contains.Samuel Buder, a protein is just a gene’s way of making another gene; and a gene is just a protein’s way of making another protein.there is growing evidence that RNA came before proteins. RNA is a chemical substance that links the two worlds of DNA and protein.the most primitive and basic functions require the presence of RNA. It is an RNA-dependent enzyme l8 GENOME that takes the message, made of RNA, from the gene.The discovery of these remarkable properties of RNA in the early 1980s, made by Thomas Cech and Sidney Altaian, transformed our understanding of the origin of life.These ribo-organisms had a big problem. RNA is an unstable substance, which falls apart within hours. Had these organisms ventured anywhere hot, or tried to grow too large, they would have faced what geneticists call an error catastrophe — a rapid decay of the message in their genes.If this was so, Carl Woese points out, the organism was not yet an enduring entity. It was a temporary team of genes.As Patrick Forterre has long argued, it now looks as if bacteria came later, highly specialised and simplified descendants of the Lucas, long after the invention of the DNA-protein world.bacteria are much more ‘highly evolved’ than we are.supported by the existence of molecular ‘fossils’ — little bits of RN A that hang about inside the nucleus of your ceils doing unnecessary things such as splicing themselves out of genes: guide RNA, vault RN A, small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA, self-splicing introns.We put a premium instead on being complicated, in having as many genes as possible, rather than a streamlined machine for using them.CGA means arginine and GCG means alanine — in bats, in beetles, in beech trees, in bacteria.This means — and religious people might find this a useful argument — that there was only one creation, one single event when life was born. Of course, that life might have been born on a different planet and seeded here by spacecraft, or there might even have been thousands of kinds of life at first, but only Luca survived in the ruthless free-for-all of the primeval soup.the fact that large, single-celled creatures were probably the ancestors of bacteria, not vice versa.Man with all his noble qualities still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.

If nothing else, it's well established that phenomena like 'intelligence' are extremely complex and that their genetic component corresponds to a large variety of genes that you couldn't possibly breed for.Partly the problem is that the book was published in 1999, which is a long time ago in a fast-changing world; but I think a particular political bias is the bigger issue here.If you were planning to read 5-10 books on genomics, this should probably be one of them. If however you wanted a single book to give you a flavour of the topic, I'd go for either The Gene: An Intimate History or A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Stories in Our Genes - both are more up-to-date and less Tory."
253,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832262-misterfweem,4,"So, what are you?A complicated biological machine beset by innate programming and external conditions bent both on keeping you alive and eventually killing you?Or are you the creation of a supreme being, both soul and body, possessed of a free will?And though Matt Ridley, in his 2000 book “Genome: The Autobiography of A Species in 23 Chapters,” leans to the left in this equation, he still writes an incredibly balanced and above all scientific book about the human genome, what we know about it, how we think it works and how we misunderstand the science that’s delving into figuring out how that double helix of DNA can turn two germ cells into a complicated biological masterpiece.Ridley, in the footnotes to his book, acknowledges that it was, at its printing, already out of date. Ten years further along, of course, it is certainly even more out of date. But what’s not out of date in this wonderful book is the critical approach Ridley takes to this science. And it’s not critical in any political way, but critical in a scientific way. He reminds the reader constantly that what is known about the human genome is small compared to what is not known, that cause does not necessarily mean effect, that a firm belief in genetic determinism is just as foolish on the left as is a firm belief in free will is on the right. More importantly, he reminds us all that what we have, as far as genetics goes, is some knowledge bolstered by a lot of unsupported belief.Here’s an example: We instinctively assume that bodily biochemistry is cause whereas behavior is effect, an assumption we have taken to a ridiculous extent in considering the impact of genes upon our lives. If genes are involved in behavior then it is they that are the cause and they that are deemed immutable. This is a mistake made not just by genetic determinists, but by their vociferous opponents, the people who say behavior is “not in the genes”; the people who deplore the fatalism and predestination implied, they say, by behavior genetics. They give too much ground to their opponents by allowing this assumption to stand, for they tacitly admit that if genes are involved at all, then they area t the top of the hierarchy. They forget that genes need to be switched on, and external events – or free-willed behavior – can switch on genes. Far from us lying at the mercy of our omnipotent genes, it is often our genes that lie at the mercy of us. If you go bungee jumping or take a stressful job, or repeatedly imagine a terrible fear, you will raise your cortisol levels, and the cortisol will dash about the body busy switching on genes. (It is an indisputable fact that you can rigger activity in the “happiness centers” of the brain with a deliberate smile, as surely as you can trigger a smile with happy thoughts. It really does make you feel better to smile. The physical can be at the beck and call of the behavioral.)Ridley, I believe, successfully finds and holds that middle ground. Our genes certainly influence who we are and what we become. But our behavior can, in turn, influence our genes. We are machines, beautiful, free-willed machines, capable to some extent of reprogramming ourselves.Here’s a thought I had on the bus this morning: Our genes are like the model tank kit we can buy at the hobby store. We follow the instructions religiously and build that magnificent tank. Everything works. The wheels turn. The gun turrets rotate. The tracks allow the tank to maneuver through any kind of terrain. And then we take that tank not into the battlefield, but gently down a city street, to the park, to the grocery store, trundling along. It is still there in its essence of tankness; everything that makes it a tank is still there. And yet our use of it for domestic purposes does not mean that its innate tankness takes over; we drive it to the grocery store and load it with groceries, we do not drive it to the grocery store to level the building with our tank shells.So brain and genome, tank and the purpose we put with it, work together. As Ridley writes: The human brain is a far more impressive machine than the genome. If you like quantitative measure, it has trillions of synapses instead of billions of bases and it weighs kilograms in stead of micrograms. If you prefer geometry, it is an analogue, three-dimensional machine, rather than a digital, one-dimensional one. If you like thermodynamics, it generates large quantities of heat as it works, like a steam engine. For biochemists, it requires many thousands of different proteins, neurotransmitters, and other chemicals, not just the four nucleotides of DNA. For the impatient, it literally changes while you watch, as synapses are altered to create learned memories, whereas the genome changes more slowly than a glacier. For the lover of free will, the pruning of the neural networks in our grains, by the ruthless gardener called experience, is vital to the proper functioning of the organ, whereas genomes play out their messages in a predetermined way with comparatively little flexibility. Yet . . . the dichotomy is a false one. The brain is created by genes. It is only as good as its innate design. The very fact that it is a machine designed to be modified by experience is written in the genes. The mystery of how is one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. But that the human brain is the finest monument to the capacities of genes there is no doubt. It is the mark of a great leader that he knows when to delegate. The genome knew when to delegate.I think what I enjoyed most about reading this book is that I learned a few things. Genetics is a pretty fascinating field of science, and I think if we all learned about it a bit more, we could have more intelligent discussions on the subject that what we see in political and media circles. Politics tends to get too black and white in this subject, and the media, for the most part, either boils things down too simply or merely presents both sides of the argument without really bothering to explain anything to the layman about what's being discussed. Ridley does a wonderful job explaining to the layman, but keeping it intelligent enough that the curious layman is able to keep exploring and asking questions. "
254,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63196979-matej-misik,4,"Although I found “The Gene” a slightly better read, I can still highly recommend this book. Especially the last two chapters cover the topics of eugenics & free will in a captivating & thought provoking fashion. On eugenics: “these things should be kept away from people who think they know best... I am trying to see genetic decisions put in the hands of users, which governments aren’t”And a great quote on science: “Science is like a hungry furnace that must be fed by logs from the forests of ignorance that surround us. In the process, the clearing we call knowledge expands, but the more it expands, the larger its perimeter and the more ignorance comes into view. [...] A true scientist is bored by knowledge, it is the assault on ignorance that motivates him - the mysteries that previous discoveries have revealed. The forest is more interesting than the clearing.”"
255,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272480-sina-jahandari,2,"I find the notions of genetics and inheritance both fascinating and sad. The inevitable genetic engineering and rewriting the genome to enhance humans are mind-blowing and horrifying ideas. Analogous to 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells, the book has 23 chapters. In each chapter, Ridely picks an appealing gene from the corresponding chromosome and discusses it. Sometimes he tells the story of how the gene was discovered. Sometimes he explains the role the gene plays in our life, or its necessity, or how it evolved through natural selection, or how and why it causes a disease. However, my favorite parts of the book were the side stories about the people who were somehow related to the discovery of the genes or affected by a disease caused by the genes. "
256,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105387858-stetson,4,"Matt Ridley's Genome engagingly narrates the major stories of genetic science and the insight it provides on the human condition one chromosome at a time. This clever device obviously requires some finagling from Ridley to work, but it is fun way to organize a book about the genome and allows Ridley to connect disparate topics and themes throughout the course of the book, giving in it at least the semblance of unity and a central thesis. Regardless of the organizational conceit, Ridley maintains a breezy and engaging prose style that gives lay readers digestible and enjoyable information about the science of genetics and genomics.It is notable as well as remarkable that this book was originally published the book in 1999. I read the 2011 updated version, but I don't think much about the structure or even content of the book changed radically, which is both to the benefit and detriment of Ridley's Genome. It's beneficial in that it allows Ridley to focus in on well elucidated genetic observations that come in neat anecdotal packages and really provide interesting insight about human biology and behavior, but it's detrimental in that Ridley is unable to address the massive advancements that have occurred in the genome sciences after the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and the very real prospect of germline genomic engineering in humans because of technologies like CRISPR/Cas9. It is undoubtedly true that these development would significantly shift Ridley analyses and discussions.One of the most interesting aspects of Genome is Ridley's tendency to want to leverage the science of genetics to make a nature versus nurture argument and generally extemporize about the effect of genetics on complex behaviors and social organization (ostensibly controversial but deeply interesting content). For the most part, Ridley's commentary on these subjects is fairly measured and largely fits within the orthodoxy of modern science; however, there are times where his analysis is glib or superficial. For instance, Ridley's commentary on the arguments made my Charles Murray in The Bell Curve is largely an unfledged regurgitation of the many motivated critiques from Murray-detractors who often misrepresent and malign Murray's work because of its political valence. Moreover, Ridley's reflexive and complete embrace of evolutionary linguistic theories (i.e. universal grammar) argued for by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker appears naive to elucidated limitations of such theories and their fraught relationship with neo-Darwinism. Ultimately, these shortcoming are small and should not dissuade readers eager for popular science content from picking up Genome."
257,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10961320-shane-phillips,4,"Each chapter was about a different chromosome and some concept extracted by a gene on that chromosome. There wasn't an overall story, but I found each chapter had fascinating facts about the impact of those genes. The history of the discoverers of these fascinating gene's was eye opening. Eor example, the doctor who exposed his skin to radiation so they could test if a protein responded to genetic damage as research for cancer treatments and the team that went to a remote island to get blood test from all 300 people on an island to help isolate a gene. While its 15 yrs old and probably dated, the history aspect is worth it. "
258,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67178937-melanie,5,"Matt Ridley’s book is very impressive and a must read for science majors, especially those majoring and/or taking genetics. The layout of the book is extremely unique, as the 23 chapters represent the 23 different types of chromosomes found within the human body. Ironically, these chapters do not necessarily set out to describe the complexity and function of each chromosome, but seeks to tell the story of the Human Genome Project, various topics related to genetics (such as its application to medicine and the Nature vs. Nuture debate), and how fascinating the human genome really is. Not only is this book informative of the rich scientific history and the inner workings of DNA and genes, it excites the reader to learn and hope for more to come from the scientific community. This book highlights the importance of science and the era of understanding the genome, as the world transitions into the emerging subfield of understanding proteins. The only downfall of this book is the detailed writing can be somewhat confusing. Nonetheless, Ridley does an excellent job at trying to alleviate the complexity of the subject by giving a great background and avoiding words that are extremely genre specific. Therefore, this book could be read by anyone, as the reader does not need a previous background in genetics or biology. As a result, this book is perfect for those looking to learn more about genes, epigenetics, DNA, and/or the future of medicine. "
259,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63171318-sarah-hussain,5,"Matt Ridley is an author that doesn't disappoint. This book is easy to read, well researched and presented, and full of unexpected concepts and information that challenge preconceptions. This book is an informal read, as he uses the central idea of 23 chromosomes as a vehicle without being hidebound over where the content goes. It is very entertaining as well as informative. Anyone with an interest in the field will find the text delightful devoid of unnecessary jargon. "

269,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71646156-nv,5,"Among the science journalists repackaging complicated ideas into digestible bits of oversimplified tweetables with nuance-penurious overarching narratives, I think I hate Matt Ridley the least. He comes across very clearly as a polymath man of letters, who engages intelligently with a range of ideas. Plus, he has a deliciously plain evil streak that makes him so much more interesting than the others in this genre. The Rational Optimist was a rare find for me, exciting me with intuitively objectionable yet logically consistent counter-arguments to intuitively black&white morality topics like climate change, precisely the sort of topics that need more of the sort of challenging intellectualism that drives a rational view of the topic deeper instead of doubling down emotionally and calling out the particularly stupid dissent in order to call dissent itself stupid. Genetics is a similarly intuitively black&white morality that I imagined evil freemason rationalist Ridley would have challenging views on. This didn’t turn out in the same way as the first book, mostly because this time I was firmly on the side that didn’t quite know black from white in the ethics of genetics, even tending more towards the black than white, for which Ridley’s evil would be a powerful and compelling ally. For someone who complains non-stop about the irritating politicization in popular science books, I think maybe I was disappointed this wasn’t political enough, maybe I mean it wasn’t controversial enough in its choice of subject matter or courageous enough in its edginess of stance on it. This book revealed just how shockingly low my recollection of the online course on Behavioral Genetics has been. NotesWhat an amazing period of science the 1940s/50s are. Norbert Wiener/Neumann are seeing similarities between programmable machine and organism - cybernetics. Turing makes a Universal Machine. Schrodinger postulates the code-script for organisms. Avery finds DNA. Rosalind Franklin’s experiments. Crick and Watson. Claude Shannon on information. RNA came before DNA or proteins. Life began as RNA. RNA transcribes DNA to RNA and then translates to proteins. Somewhere it became advantageous to be coded into DNA that can then be replicated, using RNA as the intermediary. An opposing theory to the idea that we all started as bacteria/archaea type branches off from the tree of life, is that we are more like initial life than bacteria, which branched off and started shaving off unnecessary DNA to become highly specialized for extreme environments. Occams razor suggests more likely bacteria shed the basic common genes than we gained new ones. We’re more like chimps than chimps are like gorillas. Compared to great apes, we have 1 less chromosome (23 vs 24), seems like our Chromosome 2 is a fused version of 2 chromosomes. Does that explain our soul?Maybe we didn’t climb down and head into the savanna, but it came to us. Sahara desert is born. Rift valley is born, creating a dry eastern highland where we’re separated from the chimp population. Aquatic hypothesis where Gibraltar cataract creates many marooned islands where we’re forced to wade for shellfish etc. Explains why we’re so comfortable in the water.There’s actually a tension created by Mendel’s neat mathematical quanta of genotypes, for Darwin’s gradual natural selection. Recessive genes shouldn’t be coming back according to Darwin. It took decades until Robert Fischer solved this problem, partly by recognizing the chromosome received separately from 2 parentsCrick was effortlessly brilliant and meandering 35yr old while Watson was precocious 19yr old. Crick had the elegant idea called the greatest wrong idea of the century, 3-letter word from 4 alphabets ATGC can account for exactly 20 amino acids (not 64), if you remove all combinations that might be misread if you start from the wrong place. Later this was shown to be wrong because phenylalanine was coded by just UUU, which Crick had ruled out by his rules. Nature it seems was more forgiving of errors by building redundancies. By identifying gene sequences and the change in a single letter that leads to a disease, now had a concrete example to Mendel’s abstract theory. Happened on a small part of Chromosome 3.Slippery slope of base pair mistakes, when there are more mistakes, it is easier to make further more mistakes (count 6 things accurately vs count 36 things). Less than 36 CAG (Glutamine), normal, more = Huntington’s, exponentially decreasing life expectancy with number of additional CAGsChromosome 4 has Huntington’s. What are the ethics around diagnosing an incurable illness? Also, 50% chance of getting it is a mathematical construct, you either have 100% or 0%. Similarly, half your children will get it is meaningless, each one has a 50% chance of getting it.Y-chromosomes are only in males, so they’re incentivized to selfishly put male interests over female. Genes that induce women to stop feeding and start ovulating for instance.X-chromosomes spend 3 times more time in females than in males, so they’re optimized for women, yet they’re in men so can act against their own body. Is this an explanation for homosexuality? Male with male elder brothers chance of being gay jumps by 33%, yet no such connection for lesbians. AB protects against Cholera. But O protects against Malaria. O protects against Syphilis also. Does this explain why Americas are primarily O, since syphilis came from there and cholera came from old world?Cholesterol is responsible for turning on important steroids, progesterone, cortisol, testosterone etc. A missing hormone on a gene in Chromosome 10 fails to turn on additional steroidal hormones, so you get feminine males for example. Cortisol turns off immune response, lymphocytes, get sick when stressed. Why has he ignored the most obvious explanation that energy-expensive long-term infection-fighting immunity is not as important as immediate danger of lion that needs shunting energy to muscles? Instead goes to sexual selection, testosterone higher for impressing females, saying hey look I can afford to get by with suppressed immunity. Insulin triggers absorption of tryptophan, needed to make serotonin, needed to make melatonin. So in dark wintry months, melatonin triggered drops serotonin, which drops tryptophan, needs insulin, so craving for carb-rich foods.Low cholesterol diet reduced heart disease by 14% but increased violent deaths by 78% because serotonin is reduced. High serotonin is OCD but low is depression, impulsive behavior.Blue eyes, pale skin, selected for cold-tolerance in nordics, also produces shy/anxious behavior. In interviews we select for confident people with interpersonal skills, yet selecting against blue eyes is considered inappropriate?Ashkenazi Jews all get assigned a number at birth, so when wanting to get married they check with a registry(Dor Yeshorim) which matches their numbers to validate no genetic diseases. Cystic fibrosis has been wipd out in the community (descended from just 350 ppl 800yrs ago). Similarly, Tay-Sachs has been eliminated. Genomic imprinting: epigenetic process that expresses genes based on parent of origin. Placental mammals: father wants the embryo to parasitize mother, mother wants to conserve resources. Embryo created from 2 mother cells does not develop placenta. Some rats A have litter with different fathers, father wants his embryo to monopolize. Arms race, so mother resists as much as possible. Take A-fathers and put them in B-mothers (single father, not evolved to resist) and kid is obese. Support for parental-conflict hypothesis is lack of imprinted genes in eggs/marsupials where embryo isn’t fighting to share mother resourcesDeadly prion disease (Creutzfeld-Jakob disease), scrapie in sheep. Jumped. Mad Cow disease’s panicky govt response. Banned beef, meat. After a while, though risk was 1 death in 4 years, still banned, instead of letting consumers make their risk-choices. Consumers who were allowed riskier choices like driving and vending machines. On all other chromosomes, a third chromosome is a death sentence, embryo never develops. But on chromosome 21, the smallest chromosome, it can develop. Down syndrome.USA culled 40k people. Sweden, Germany quickly followed suit. UK held out until Churchill shows up championing it in 1910. Full support of scientific community, and socialists who love social engineering. One hold-out in parliament, a libertarian who said state cannot have such coercive power. The fact that it was better for the community that ‘inferior humans’ not procreate was irrelevant when the unit of analysis should be the individual. Why don’t stepchildren of abusive parents become abusive? Isn’t it just as deterministic defeatism on the part of gene-critics who say everything is environmentally determined? Wouldn’t you rather be determined by something within you than something without?Difference between determinism and fatalism. Can there be free will without determinism against which to be free?"

Genome feels like many books written in a specific order; many excellent book that is. Genome speaks of Health, Disease, Sex, Power, Philosophy, Politics, Geology, Literature, Language, History, Evolution, Science, People, & everything linking them together. That last statement might seem as overselling the book, & if it was me, I wouldn't buy that statement if I saw it in a review. However, it came as a surprise for me as well.To begin with, Matt Ridley has one of the best pens I've ever seen. His writing method is superb & only surpassed by his scientific knowledge. Being written in 1999, it's certainly a bit outdated, but still provide some fundamentals in history, theories, & science to make up for the time gap between now & then.It astonished me that a book put a daunting task such as addressing 23 Chromosomes in different topics in our single species, & succeeded in doing so.Some areas felt boring for me, but I'm sure that stemmed from my own lack of interest in said areas, like for example language, philosophical depths, & some sides of history. These were however made up for me by the kind Ridley when he wrote the wonderful chapters on Genetic Diseases, History of Eugenia, Prions, Sex Chromosomes Struggle, Geology, Evolution. And these are just the tip of the iceberg for this book.If there's one thing you'd certainly regret after reading Genome, it'll be that you hadn't read it sooner."
271,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4824483-charlotte-osborn-bensaada,4,"Rideley's trope is to connect circa 2000 what we are beginning to know about the human geonomes if you will through each of the 23 human chromosomes. Some it works very well, I think I have a much better understanding of the implications of all types issues related to genetics. I also realized afterward that we as a society don't even have the beginnings of a social discussion taking place even as the science races forward. The challenge with a book like Ridley's is that it based on what we knew even just 10 years ago and I can imagine, that there is so much that even now needs to be updated. For instance he has this fascinating chapter on how 2 variations of certain cholesterol distributor or receptors (this is the other thing, you think you understand what he is saying, but it is pretty complex stuff so you can't really summarize the argument)may increase the likelihood of brain diseases in boxers. In all the coverage I have seen of the concussion crisis nothing of the sort has been noted. Is that because those studies were invalidated, is it just too new, should we be thinking about that for dangerous sports? This is not a book that will answer, but instead will push you to wonder what about. "

This is more than a book about the human genome, its also an analysis of the social, political and scientific implications of understanding the human genetic map. Each area he analyses from health and healing to death and immortalit, from instinct and intelligence to personality and behavior is illustrated with examples of experiments used to prove the point and is analysed with a laymans eye so even those of us without a scientific background can absorb and understand the complexity, possibilities and even the threats this ""new"" science presents us with. Thankfully for me, he also steers away from the spiritual/religious debate and concentrates on evidentiary argument.I enjoyed this book so much I came straight back and bought his follow up ""Nature via Nurture"", also an excellent read.Highly recommended."

Under the cover of biology, the book is really about humans on a philosophical level - the interesting balance between social determinism and biological determinism, the philosophical debate on if human have free will, and also who defined ""self"" - the genes, the brain, the mind, the body, or us? It triggers a waterfall of questions related to religion (belief systems) and buddhist ideologies - what is us? What is consciousness, awareness? Yet at the same time the book did give me hope, that even though we are determined/told to operate by these full body of genes, these genes are the army that support our day to day functions. Not a single gene can exert absolute influence on any feature of us, personality trait of us, meaning we have room to grow, to improve, to fulfill what we believe on this earth.

It has all sorts of mischievous genes on it, he explained.Imagine that the genome is a book. There are twenty-three chapters, called CHROMOSOMES. Each chapter contains several thousand stories, called GENES. Each story is made up of paragraphs, called EXONS, which are interrupted by advertisements called INTRONS. Each paragraph is made up of words, called COD ON s. Each word is written in letters called BASES.The genome is a very clever book, because in the right conditions it can both photocopy itself and read itself. The photocopying is known as REPLICATION, and the reading as TRANSLATION. In fact, the usual state of DNA is the famous DOUBLE HELIX of the original strand and its complementary pair intertwined.RNA, too, can carry a linear code and it uses the same letters as DNA except that it uses U, for uracil, in place of T. This RNA copy, called the MESSENGER RNA, is then edited by the excision of all introns and the splicing together of all exons (see above).Almost everything in the body, from hair to hormones, is either made of proteins or made by them. Every protein is a translated gene.Proteins are also responsible for switching genes on and off, by physically attaching themselves to PROMOTER and ENHANCER sequences near the start of a gene’s text.about one hundred mutations per generation, which may not seem much given that there are more than a million codons in the human genome, but in the wrong place even a single one can be fatal.Not all human genes are found on the twenty-three principal chromosomes; a few live inside little blobs called mitochondriaIn the beginning was the word.

Shannon’s idea is that information and entropy are opposite faces of the same coin and that both have an intimate link with energy. The less entropy a system has, the more information it contains.Samuel Buder, a protein is just a gene’s way of making another gene; and a gene is just a protein’s way of making another protein.there is growing evidence that RNA came before proteins. RNA is a chemical substance that links the two worlds of DNA and protein.the most primitive and basic functions require the presence of RNA. It is an RNA-dependent enzyme l8 GENOME that takes the message, made of RNA, from the gene.The discovery of these remarkable properties of RNA in the early 1980s, made by Thomas Cech and Sidney Altaian, transformed our understanding of the origin of life.These ribo-organisms had a big problem. RNA is an unstable substance, which falls apart within hours. Had these organisms ventured anywhere hot, or tried to grow too large, they would have faced what geneticists call an error catastrophe — a rapid decay of the message in their genes.If this was so, Carl Woese points out, the organism was not yet an enduring entity. It was a temporary team of genes.As Patrick Forterre has long argued, it now looks as if bacteria came later, highly specialised and simplified descendants of the Lucas, long after the invention of the DNA-protein world.bacteria are much more ‘highly evolved’ than we are.supported by the existence of molecular ‘fossils’ — little bits of RN A that hang about inside the nucleus of your ceils doing unnecessary things such as splicing themselves out of genes: guide RNA, vault RN A, small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA, self-splicing introns.We put a premium instead on being complicated, in having as many genes as possible, rather than a streamlined machine for using them.CGA means arginine and GCG means alanine — in bats, in beetles, in beech trees, in bacteria.This means — and religious people might find this a useful argument — that there was only one creation, one single event when life was born. Of course, that life might have been born on a different planet and seeded here by spacecraft, or there might even have been thousands of kinds of life at first, but only Luca survived in the ruthless free-for-all of the primeval soup.the fact that large, single-celled creatures were probably the ancestors of bacteria, not vice versa.Man with all his noble qualities still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.

282,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073465-carlos-martinez,3,"A very well-written, chatty, enjoyable and wide-ranging introduction to genomics. Ridley does a reasonably good job of keeping his political philosophy - nutty right-wing libertarianism - to himself until the last couple of chapters, at which it emerges in the most unfortunate (and unscientific) fashion with the soft-pedalling of eugenics. Eugenics, we are told, is not bad science but bad _politics_; we could breed a population of really smart, slim, law-abiding people if we as individuals wanted to, but the real problem is the government telling us what to do. Absurd. If nothing else, it's well established that phenomena like 'intelligence' are extremely complex and that their genetic component corresponds to a large variety of genes that you couldn't possibly breed for.Partly the problem is that the book was published in 1999, which is a long time ago in a fast-changing world; but I think a particular political bias is the bigger issue here.If you were planning to read 5-10 books on genomics, this should probably be one of them. If however you wanted a single book to give you a flavour of the topic, I'd go for either The Gene: An Intimate History or A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Stories in Our Genes - both are more up-to-date and less Tory."
283,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2832262-misterfweem,4,"So, what are you?A complicated biological machine beset by innate programming and external conditions bent both on keeping you alive and eventually killing you?Or are you the creation of a supreme being, both soul and body, possessed of a free will?And though Matt Ridley, in his 2000 book “Genome: The Autobiography of A Species in 23 Chapters,” leans to the left in this equation, he still writes an incredibly balanced and above all scientific book about the human genome, what we know about it, how we think it works and how we misunderstand the science that’s delving into figuring out how that double helix of DNA can turn two germ cells into a complicated biological masterpiece.Ridley, in the footnotes to his book, acknowledges that it was, at its printing, already out of date. Ten years further along, of course, it is certainly even more out of date. But what’s not out of date in this wonderful book is the critical approach Ridley takes to this science. And it’s not critical in any political way, but critical in a scientific way. He reminds the reader constantly that what is known about the human genome is small compared to what is not known, that cause does not necessarily mean effect, that a firm belief in genetic determinism is just as foolish on the left as is a firm belief in free will is on the right. More importantly, he reminds us all that what we have, as far as genetics goes, is some knowledge bolstered by a lot of unsupported belief.Here’s an example: We instinctively assume that bodily biochemistry is cause whereas behavior is effect, an assumption we have taken to a ridiculous extent in considering the impact of genes upon our lives. If genes are involved in behavior then it is they that are the cause and they that are deemed immutable. This is a mistake made not just by genetic determinists, but by their vociferous opponents, the people who say behavior is “not in the genes”; the people who deplore the fatalism and predestination implied, they say, by behavior genetics. They give too much ground to their opponents by allowing this assumption to stand, for they tacitly admit that if genes are involved at all, then they area t the top of the hierarchy. They forget that genes need to be switched on, and external events – or free-willed behavior – can switch on genes. Far from us lying at the mercy of our omnipotent genes, it is often our genes that lie at the mercy of us. If you go bungee jumping or take a stressful job, or repeatedly imagine a terrible fear, you will raise your cortisol levels, and the cortisol will dash about the body busy switching on genes. (It is an indisputable fact that you can rigger activity in the “happiness centers” of the brain with a deliberate smile, as surely as you can trigger a smile with happy thoughts. It really does make you feel better to smile. The physical can be at the beck and call of the behavioral.)Ridley, I believe, successfully finds and holds that middle ground. Our genes certainly influence who we are and what we become. But our behavior can, in turn, influence our genes. We are machines, beautiful, free-willed machines, capable to some extent of reprogramming ourselves.Here’s a thought I had on the bus this morning: Our genes are like the model tank kit we can buy at the hobby store. We follow the instructions religiously and build that magnificent tank. Everything works. The wheels turn. The gun turrets rotate. The tracks allow the tank to maneuver through any kind of terrain. And then we take that tank not into the battlefield, but gently down a city street, to the park, to the grocery store, trundling along. It is still there in its essence of tankness; everything that makes it a tank is still there. And yet our use of it for domestic purposes does not mean that its innate tankness takes over; we drive it to the grocery store and load it with groceries, we do not drive it to the grocery store to level the building with our tank shells.So brain and genome, tank and the purpose we put with it, work together. As Ridley writes: The human brain is a far more impressive machine than the genome. If you like quantitative measure, it has trillions of synapses instead of billions of bases and it weighs kilograms in stead of micrograms. If you prefer geometry, it is an analogue, three-dimensional machine, rather than a digital, one-dimensional one. If you like thermodynamics, it generates large quantities of heat as it works, like a steam engine. For biochemists, it requires many thousands of different proteins, neurotransmitters, and other chemicals, not just the four nucleotides of DNA. For the impatient, it literally changes while you watch, as synapses are altered to create learned memories, whereas the genome changes more slowly than a glacier. For the lover of free will, the pruning of the neural networks in our grains, by the ruthless gardener called experience, is vital to the proper functioning of the organ, whereas genomes play out their messages in a predetermined way with comparatively little flexibility. Yet . . . the dichotomy is a false one. The brain is created by genes. It is only as good as its innate design. The very fact that it is a machine designed to be modified by experience is written in the genes. The mystery of how is one of the greatest challenges of modern biology. But that the human brain is the finest monument to the capacities of genes there is no doubt. It is the mark of a great leader that he knows when to delegate. The genome knew when to delegate.I think what I enjoyed most about reading this book is that I learned a few things. Genetics is a pretty fascinating field of science, and I think if we all learned about it a bit more, we could have more intelligent discussions on the subject that what we see in political and media circles. Politics tends to get too black and white in this subject, and the media, for the most part, either boils things down too simply or merely presents both sides of the argument without really bothering to explain anything to the layman about what's being discussed. Ridley does a wonderful job explaining to the layman, but keeping it intelligent enough that the curious layman is able to keep exploring and asking questions. "

Especially the last two chapters cover the topics of eugenics & free will in a captivating & thought provoking fashion. On eugenics: “these things should be kept away from people who think they know best... I am trying to see genetic decisions put in the hands of users, which governments aren’t”And a great quote on science: “Science is like a hungry furnace that must be fed by logs from the forests of ignorance that surround us. In the process, the clearing we call knowledge expands, but the more it expands, the larger its perimeter and the more ignorance comes into view. [...] A true scientist is bored by knowledge, it is the assault on ignorance that motivates him - the mysteries that previous discoveries have revealed. The forest is more interesting than the clearing.”"

The inevitable genetic engineering and rewriting the genome to enhance humans are mind-blowing and horrifying ideas. Analogous to 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells, the book has 23 chapters. In each chapter, Ridely picks an appealing gene from the corresponding chromosome and discusses it. Sometimes he tells the story of how the gene was discovered. Sometimes he explains the role the gene plays in our life, or its necessity, or how it evolved through natural selection, or how and why it causes a disease. However, my favorite parts of the book were the side stories about the people who were somehow related to the discovery of the genes or affected by a disease caused by the genes. "
286,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105387858-stetson,4,"Matt Ridley's Genome engagingly narrates the major stories of genetic science and the insight it provides on the human condition one chromosome at a time. This clever device obviously requires some finagling from Ridley to work, but it is fun way to organize a book about the genome and allows Ridley to connect disparate topics and themes throughout the course of the book, giving in it at least the semblance of unity and a central thesis. Regardless of the organizational conceit, Ridley maintains a breezy and engaging prose style that gives lay readers digestible and enjoyable information about the science of genetics and genomics.It is notable as well as remarkable that this book was originally published the book in 1999. I read the 2011 updated version, but I don't think much about the structure or even content of the book changed radically, which is both to the benefit and detriment of Ridley's Genome. It's beneficial in that it allows Ridley to focus in on well elucidated genetic observations that come in neat anecdotal packages and really provide interesting insight about human biology and behavior, but it's detrimental in that Ridley is unable to address the massive advancements that have occurred in the genome sciences after the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and the very real prospect of germline genomic engineering in humans because of technologies like CRISPR/Cas9. It is undoubtedly true that these development would significantly shift Ridley analyses and discussions.One of the most interesting aspects of Genome is Ridley's tendency to want to leverage the science of genetics to make a nature versus nurture argument and generally extemporize about the effect of genetics on complex behaviors and social organization (ostensibly controversial but deeply interesting content). For the most part, Ridley's commentary on these subjects is fairly measured and largely fits within the orthodoxy of modern science; however, there are times where his analysis is glib or superficial. For instance, Ridley's commentary on the arguments made my Charles Murray in The Bell Curve is largely an unfledged regurgitation of the many motivated critiques from Murray-detractors who often misrepresent and malign Murray's work because of its political valence. Moreover, Ridley's reflexive and complete embrace of evolutionary linguistic theories (i.e. universal grammar) argued for by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker appears naive to elucidated limitations of such theories and their fraught relationship with neo-Darwinism. Ultimately, these shortcoming are small and should not dissuade readers eager for popular science content from picking up Genome."

Not only is this book informative of the rich scientific history and the inner workings of DNA and genes, it excites the reader to learn and hope for more to come from the scientific community. This book highlights the importance of science and the era of understanding the genome, as the world transitions into the emerging subfield of understanding proteins. The only downfall of this book is the detailed writing can be somewhat confusing. Nonetheless, Ridley does an excellent job at trying to alleviate the complexity of the subject by giving a great background and avoiding words that are extremely genre specific. Therefore, this book could be read by anyone, as the reader does not need a previous background in genetics or biology. As a result, this book is perfect for those looking to learn more about genes, epigenetics, DNA, and/or the future of medicine. "

This book is easy to read, well researched and presented, and full of unexpected concepts and information that challenge preconceptions. This book is an informal read, as he uses the central idea of 23 chromosomes as a vehicle without being hidebound over where the content goes. It is very entertaining as well as informative. Anyone with an interest in the field will find the text delightful devoid of unnecessary jargon. "

I personally love molecular genetics, so something like this that isn't too dense is a nice treat. It threw in some ethics and philosophy which is fun to think about. I recommend it if you're interested in understanding how humans work."
291,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10709207-iftekhar-alam-himel,4,"I am not a big fan of autobiographies: but this looked like something one shouldn't miss reading. And right I was: this books made genes very ""human"" and easy-to-understand. If you liked The Selfish Gene, this is highly recommended!"
292,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18991112-ricky-valles,2,DNFed after chapter 11 @50% I feel like there was a lot of rabbling in each chapter. There was also a lot of tangents about free will and evolution. I was expecting more stories and science. This would be a good book if you are interested in philosophy/evoution.
293,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18426886-partha,4,"Good introductory book to get the basic idea of genetics, but occasionally covers too many technical details."
294,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7997979-maureen,4,An enjoyable and informative read. 
295,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41670073-mariam-w-k,4,i liked that book so much 
296,0060894083,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108743659-arthur-kipel,4,"Rather interesting book, which explains modern knowledge about genetics in user-friendly manner. It is not boring because filled with a lot of examples and life stories about investigations and discoveries in this field of science."

He comes across very clearly as a polymath man of letters, who engages intelligently with a range of ideas. Plus, he has a deliciously plain evil streak that makes him so much more interesting than the others in this genre. The Rational Optimist was a rare find for me, exciting me with intuitively objectionable yet logically consistent counter-arguments to intuitively black&white morality topics like climate change, precisely the sort of topics that need more of the sort of challenging intellectualism that drives a rational view of the topic deeper instead of doubling down emotionally and calling out the particularly stupid dissent in order to call dissent itself stupid. Genetics is a similarly intuitively black&white morality that I imagined evil freemason rationalist Ridley would have challenging views on. This didn’t turn out in the same way as the first book, mostly because this time I was firmly on the side that didn’t quite know black from white in the ethics of genetics, even tending more towards the black than white, for which Ridley’s evil would be a powerful and compelling ally. For someone who complains non-stop about the irritating politicization in popular science books, I think maybe I was disappointed this wasn’t political enough, maybe I mean it wasn’t controversial enough in its choice of subject matter or courageous enough in its edginess of stance on it. This book revealed just how shockingly low my recollection of the online course on Behavioral Genetics has been. NotesWhat an amazing period of science the 1940s/50s are. Norbert Wiener/Neumann are seeing similarities between programmable machine and organism - cybernetics. Turing makes a Universal Machine. Schrodinger postulates the code-script for organisms. Avery finds DNA. Rosalind Franklin’s experiments. Crick and Watson. Claude Shannon on information. RNA came before DNA or proteins. Life began as RNA. RNA transcribes DNA to RNA and then translates to proteins. Somewhere it became advantageous to be coded into DNA that can then be replicated, using RNA as the intermediary. An opposing theory to the idea that we all started as bacteria/archaea type branches off from the tree of life, is that we are more like initial life than bacteria, which branched off and started shaving off unnecessary DNA to become highly specialized for extreme environments. Occams razor suggests more likely bacteria shed the basic common genes than we gained new ones. We’re more like chimps than chimps are like gorillas. Compared to great apes, we have 1 less chromosome (23 vs 24), seems like our Chromosome 2 is a fused version of 2 chromosomes. Does that explain our soul?Maybe we didn’t climb down and head into the savanna, but it came to us. Sahara desert is born. Rift valley is born, creating a dry eastern highland where we’re separated from the chimp population. Aquatic hypothesis where Gibraltar cataract creates many marooned islands where we’re forced to wade for shellfish etc. Explains why we’re so comfortable in the water.There’s actually a tension created by Mendel’s neat mathematical quanta of genotypes, for Darwin’s gradual natural selection. Recessive genes shouldn’t be coming back according to Darwin. It took decades until Robert Fischer solved this problem, partly by recognizing the chromosome received separately from 2 parentsCrick was effortlessly brilliant and meandering 35yr old while Watson was precocious 19yr old. Crick had the elegant idea called the greatest wrong idea of the century, 3-letter word from 4 alphabets ATGC can account for exactly 20 amino acids (not 64), if you remove all combinations that might be misread if you start from the wrong place. Later this was shown to be wrong because phenylalanine was coded by just UUU, which Crick had ruled out by his rules. Nature it seems was more forgiving of errors by building redundancies. By identifying gene sequences and the change in a single letter that leads to a disease, now had a concrete example to Mendel’s abstract theory. Happened on a small part of Chromosome 3.Slippery slope of base pair mistakes, when there are more mistakes, it is easier to make further more mistakes (count 6 things accurately vs count 36 things). Less than 36 CAG (Glutamine), normal, more = Huntington’s, exponentially decreasing life expectancy with number of additional CAGsChromosome 4 has Huntington’s. What are the ethics around diagnosing an incurable illness? Also, 50% chance of getting it is a mathematical construct, you either have 100% or 0%. Similarly, half your children will get it is meaningless, each one has a 50% chance of getting it.Y-chromosomes are only in males, so they’re incentivized to selfishly put male interests over female. Genes that induce women to stop feeding and start ovulating for instance.X-chromosomes spend 3 times more time in females than in males, so they’re optimized for women, yet they’re in men so can act against their own body. Is this an explanation for homosexuality? Male with male elder brothers chance of being gay jumps by 33%, yet no such connection for lesbians. AB protects against Cholera. But O protects against Malaria. O protects against Syphilis also. Does this explain why Americas are primarily O, since syphilis came from there and cholera came from old world?Cholesterol is responsible for turning on important steroids, progesterone, cortisol, testosterone etc. A missing hormone on a gene in Chromosome 10 fails to turn on additional steroidal hormones, so you get feminine males for example. Cortisol turns off immune response, lymphocytes, get sick when stressed. Why has he ignored the most obvious explanation that energy-expensive long-term infection-fighting immunity is not as important as immediate danger of lion that needs shunting energy to muscles? Instead goes to sexual selection, testosterone higher for impressing females, saying hey look I can afford to get by with suppressed immunity. Insulin triggers absorption of tryptophan, needed to make serotonin, needed to make melatonin. So in dark wintry months, melatonin triggered drops serotonin, which drops tryptophan, needs insulin, so craving for carb-rich foods.Low cholesterol diet reduced heart disease by 14% but increased violent deaths by 78% because serotonin is reduced. High serotonin is OCD but low is depression, impulsive behavior.Blue eyes, pale skin, selected for cold-tolerance in nordics, also produces shy/anxious behavior. In interviews we select for confident people with interpersonal skills, yet selecting against blue eyes is considered inappropriate?Ashkenazi Jews all get assigned a number at birth, so when wanting to get married they check with a registry(Dor Yeshorim) which matches their numbers to validate no genetic diseases. Cystic fibrosis has been wipd out in the community (descended from just 350 ppl 800yrs ago). Similarly, Tay-Sachs has been eliminated. Genomic imprinting: epigenetic process that expresses genes based on parent of origin. Placental mammals: father wants the embryo to parasitize mother, mother wants to conserve resources. Embryo created from 2 mother cells does not develop placenta. Some rats A have litter with different fathers, father wants his embryo to monopolize. Arms race, so mother resists as much as possible. Take A-fathers and put them in B-mothers (single father, not evolved to resist) and kid is obese. Support for parental-conflict hypothesis is lack of imprinted genes in eggs/marsupials where embryo isn’t fighting to share mother resourcesDeadly prion disease (Creutzfeld-Jakob disease), scrapie in sheep. Jumped. Mad Cow disease’s panicky govt response. Banned beef, meat. After a while, though risk was 1 death in 4 years, still banned, instead of letting consumers make their risk-choices. Consumers who were allowed riskier choices like driving and vending machines. On all other chromosomes, a third chromosome is a death sentence, embryo never develops. But on chromosome 21, the smallest chromosome, it can develop. Down syndrome.USA culled 40k people. Sweden, Germany quickly followed suit. UK held out until Churchill shows up championing it in 1910. Full support of scientific community, and socialists who love social engineering. One hold-out in parliament, a libertarian who said state cannot have such coercive power. The fact that it was better for the community that ‘inferior humans’ not procreate was irrelevant when the unit of analysis should be the individual. Why don’t stepchildren of abusive parents become abusive? Isn’t it just as deterministic defeatism on the part of gene-critics who say everything is environmentally determined? Wouldn’t you rather be determined by something within you than something without?Difference between determinism and fatalism. Can there be free will without determinism against which to be free?"
