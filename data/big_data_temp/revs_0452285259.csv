I had heard about the Riemann Hypothesis a zillion times and never understood what the fuss was about. After going through this book, it all made sense! Requires college-level math, but if you have that, can't recommend too highly. ______________________________An anecdote from Lambert's biography of Georges Lemaître which may amuse mathematicians. At one stage, young Lemaître was being supervised by the famous number theorist de Vallée-Poussin, who appears in this book. Impressed by his precocious talent, de Vallée-Poussin suggested to Lemaître that he should try to solve the Riemann conjecture as his thesis project.After about a year of work, Lemaître was forced to admit that he had got nowhere and was allowed to switch to another topic. He eventually justified his supervisor's faith in him by inventing the Big Bang theory and finding the first experimental evidence for it. He also made contributions to spinor algebra which were praised by Einstein. But the Riemann conjecture was just too hard._______________________________Inspired by yesterday's discussion with Nandakishore and Matt and the famous Up Goer Five XKCD cartoon (soon to become a book), I wrote the following:Can I explain Mr Riemann's very important number idea with only the ten hundred most used words? It is about how many numbers that don't have pieces there are that are less than some number. Mr Riemann found a way to work it out. You add four things together. One of them means you must add a lot of other things first. But where are those things? Mr Riemann thought he knew but he wasn't sure. He said they are all made of things you find on a line and the real part of that line is a half. People have looked for those things. They have found more than a hundred hundred hundred hundred hundred hundred of them. They are all on Mr Riemann's line. But maybe some of the things are not on the line. No one knows. They want to find out and they have looked for more than one hundred years but it is very hard.Maybe someone can improve on this?_______________________________Following on from that, is it possible to explain the Riemann Hypothesis to an eight-year-old? I have discussed this question with Dodecahedron, who very sensibly said after a while that there was no point in theorizing, you just have to try it. I have formulated a plan of attack, which goes through several increasingly challenging steps. Last night, after getting his parents' permission, I tried out Step 1 on Jenkyn, a very smart eight-year-old we know. The conversation went roughly as follows:- So Jenkyn, do you know what a prime number is?- Uh-uh.- Well, think about numbers. You can turn some numbers into rectangles. Like, 8 is 4 by 2. [I illustrated using pieces on a chessboard.] Or 10 is 5 by 2. Or 9 is 3 by 3. You see, some numbers are rectangles.- Or squares.- Okay, some of them are squares. But some other numbers don't make rectangles. You see, you can't turn 5 into a rectangle. Or 7.- Uh-huh.- Well, those are called prime numbers. So, 5 is prime and 7 is prime. What else do you think would be a prime number? Is 9 prime?- Uh-uh.- Is 11 prime?- Uh-huh.- So what else is prime?- 113.[Pause while all the adults sit and work it out]- Uh, yes, 113 is prime. How did you know?!- I dunno. I just did."
1,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,4,"Gift or Neurosis?Obsession is something with irresistible psychic power. I take Derbyshire’s use of the term literally. Explaining this power is like explaining any other mental abnormality. From the outside, obsession appears irrational. From the inside its logic is compelling and justifies itself entirely. But only because some unstated fundamental premise is where the logic starts. This is the only really interesting thing about obsession; everything else provokes only a sort of mild voyeurism. Finding that premise is what much of classic biography, as well as psychoanalysis, is about. Without the premise, the obsession is merely strange.I can understand fascination with the topic of prime numbers and the mathematicians who devoted their lives to their unusual properties. I am fascinated by their fascination, as I am by the experiences of the great mystics. With fascination, one can take it or leave it, however; obsession drives one’s being. And as far as I can tell the great mathematicians are remarkably similar in their obsessions to the great mystics. But we know considerably more about what goes on in the minds of the latter, I suppose because their fixation is more common in the general population. With mathematicians as with mystics, what interests them most, and what they report about to the rest of us, is technique, that is how they get from one state of knowledge or awareness to another. How could it be otherwise? Without technique they are left with nothing really to communicate except subjective reports of their own psychic states. But as we know all too well, the subjective reports of any of us are probably the least reliable source of information about personal development, spiritual or scientific (See postscript below). So they, and we, construct ‘methods’ to hide our lack of understanding of our real motivations. The main function of these narratives is not their general applicability, but their role as evidence that we are in fact sane.The foundational premise behind the logic of the mystic and the mathematician is obscured by the description of their technique, their methods, as it is by their bare biographical details. We learn nothing about the reason for their obsession, nor what justifies it in their own minds. We learn nothing about the event or sequence of events that led to their discoveries. They therefore appear as prodigies, freaks, automatons, professional celebrities or idols to be worshipped rather than human beings intent on achieving some intellectual or spiritual objective. Their talent is apparent; what they’re trying to do with it is not.Derbyshire is quite candid about the almost complete lack of documentary information regarding the intimate life of Riemann. Aside from the remarkable fact that he began life as essentially a rural hick and ended as one of the most productive mathematician of the 19th century, there is little that can be said about him which is personal. His travels, his appointments, his professional habits explain nothing about the man’s mind and his intentions. To say that his purpose in life was to solve mathematical problems is simply uninteresting, and probably false. So Derbyshire is forced to create a sort of Whig history of the man by, on the one hand giving the history of relevant mathematical thought and Riemann’s place in it; and on the other hand telling us about other mathematicians and their equally odd obsessional idiosyncrasies. Everything inevitably leads precisely where it had to. The stars converge, and out pops Riemann and his Hypothesis, which has puzzled every generation of mathematicians since, just as Ignatius Loyola’s Spiritual Exercises have puzzled generations of aspiring religious novices.The combination of mathematical derivations and historical vignettes in Prime Obsession is frustrating because neither ‘track’ explains Riemann’s obsession. So it is also with others who constitute Riemann’s oeuvre. A man like Gauss, for example, had no ambition for influence or power. Born an uneducated peasant, he was likeable but taciturn to the point of rudeness. Are we to think that he was simply taken over by his talent as a mystic is taken over by faith? Was there some fundamental youthful insight, perhaps, that guided his life and found its place in academic mathematics? Could these people have decided to be great novelists instead? I can understand Derbyshire’s excitement when he writes, “The Riemann Hypothesis was born out of an encounter, ...a great fusion, between counting logic and measuring logic. To put it in precise mathematical terms; it arose when some ideas from arithmetic were combined with some from analysis to form a new thing, a new branch of the mathematical tree, analytic number theory.” I get it; it is an important historical moment. But this is how it is interpreted after the fact, not as Riemann viewed the situation. What was Reimann proving about himself, not just with his Hypothesis but with all his work?It is of course unfair to burden Derbyshire with these sorts of issues. He has his own obsessions. But I am left wanting something which Derbyshire doesn’t provide, perhaps no one can, namely, a reason for why Riemann did what he did, not merely a description of the deeds. Riemann himself noted that there are an infinite number of mathematical hypotheses which are difficult to prove or disprove. Why make this one? And why has it become central? Is there an unstated aesthetic among mathematicians which is provoked by it? Or does it now simply represent a possibility for professional recognition?Riemann’s obsession, and Derbyshire’s, sit there, therefore, as the behemoth in the room. As Derbyshire says clearly, “mathematical thinking is a deeply unnatural way of thinking, and this is probably why it repels so many people.” This makes someone like Riemann even more interesting. If he is so unnatural, perhaps that’s part of the explanation for the obsession. My suggestion is that this is what needs to be explored, perhaps even more urgently than the Riemann Hypothesis itself.Postscript: I was reminded while reading this of something written by an academic acquaintance almost 50 years ago. Ian Mitroff in his book The Subjective Side of Science studied the moon rock scientists while they studied the moon rocks. What he found, as I recall, was an ability to predict their conclusions based on their personalities. At this point I have no idea about the validity or follow-on from his work. Perhaps, however, it is he who is responsible for creating my expectations of Derbyshire! See: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1..."
2,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,3,"You remember the smartest kid in your high school calculus class? Remember the math major in your college dorm, the one doing advanced physics with more Greek symbols than Roman numerals? Both brainiacs at the time, right? Well, the book Prime Obsession deals with mathematical concepts magnitudes of order more complex than those brainiacs could ever wish to comprehend. John Derbyshire describes the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) and the mathematical titans that have tried unsuccessfully to prove the hypothesis since 1859. Open the book and you'll be transported to the rarefied air of the Prime Number Theorem and the notorious zeta function.Derbyshire does a nice shuffle between chapters, alternating between math concepts and biographical background. This does two things: it guides you slowly through the math of Greek symbols and presents the human side of the computational oracle known as Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann. I'm not a math guy. I don't even enjoy math. However, after struggling in several higher level calculus classes in college, I have a humble appreciation for and stark awe of folks who can turn, transform, and invert insanely dense and convoluted proofs and theorems. I also realize math is hidden behind many of the technological advances we take for granted as our lives get easier. I don't stop to make the connections between prime number theory and secure internet transactions, but I know it's there, below, hidden, operating, critical to my life.When I saw several books about the RH, I read a dustcover and, at once, needed to be educated about a theorem that's remained relatively unchanged, and is still only as advanced as when it was presented by Riemann 150 years ago, despite Cray-1 supercomputers crunching possible solutions for 40 years and programmed by myriad math geniuses produced by the 20th century. If it hasn't been solved, then I thought—having never heard of the RH before—Riemann was either a genius among geniuses, or he stumbled upon something mankind was perhaps not to discover for many, many generations to come. Either way, I figured the book would give me a few buzz words to finesse around a cocktail party in the extraordinary event math was discussed over finger foods and wine.I picked up some buzz words, indeed, and I can use them to parry myself through the initial awkward questions about math. However, I'd have to duck and run from the party because Derbyshire didn't do the best job making the RH understandable. The author is a mathematician, and though he promised to use nothing more advanced than calculus to explain the RH, he was quickly over my head. I know general calculus (quadratic polynomials, convergent & divergent limit functions, matricies, harmonic series, derivation & integration). But, let me walk you through what Derbyshire introduced to me in some 350-odd pages.--pi(N), but not the pi that is 3.14159....--the Euler-Mascheroni number--the Rieman Hypothesis: All non-trivial zeros of the zeta funtion have real part one-half--the Golden Key--the sieve of Eratosthenes--the Prime Number Theorem, pi(N)~Li(N)--complex conjugates--zeta function critical strip--Gram's zeros--Riemann surface--value plane from the critical line--Big Oh and Mobius Mu--Matricies (eigenvalues, trace, characteristic polynomials of)--operators--Guassian-random Hermitan matricies--Guassian Unitary Ensemble--Chaos theory--And many, many, many complex, irrational formulas without Roman numeralsTo give Derbyshire credit, what Prime Obsession attempts to do is chronologize the different attempts by which mathematicians have tried to solve the RH. Our 20th century boys have not been completely stumped. They've made minor inroads, cracking stone off the monolithic RH, using tactics, techniques, and procedures that are au courant at the time. The book shows calculus, geometry, analytical theory, physics, quantam theory—all specific modus operendi that offer tools of analysis, and which could each stand to benefit from a solution to the RH.Still, this book is not for the math novice. Also, I think Derbyshire fell short presenting, in plain language, what exactly the RH would prove, and if solved, how it would change the world of mathematics. 3 stars for a solid book, but it won't appear on anybody's favorite list. New word: ruction"
3,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12966934-j-c,5,"First of all, this is pretty well-researched, being a 150 year-long history and all. Also, while quite thorough about the math, it wasn't really that involved. Of course, like all attempts to give a popular account of complicated math, it tread too heavily while not penetrating deep enough. So I was a bit disappointed. I gave it five stars because despite this, it was a real page turner. The prose is light and clear, and the pace is good. Reminds me of James Gleick's Chaos and Genius, at least in terms of how Derbyshire managed to continually pull off subtle extended metaphors while painting lively portraits of his characters. So what's the Riemann hypothesis? It turns out to really be quite a trivial-sounding conjecture that Riemann didn't even feel the need to prove in order to come up with some interesting results. Basically, in his analytically continued zeta-function, taking in complex values, he says that all the non trivial zeros have a real part one-half. It's difficult to comprehend why this is significant, and what the significance of those values really are. More interesting results for me was the expression of zeta in terms of a product solely involving an expression of primes,and the analytic continuation of the zeta function, which you can generate by taking the more-likely-to-converge eta function and manipulating a bit, or taking this, which I have no idea how to derive from anything:Also the gamma function is mind-blowing....So apart from the math that I still don't really understand, I got a pretty good survey of the interesting historical figures that have populated math since Euler, including Gauss, Dirichlet, Riemann himself, Dedekind, Hilbert, (these five excluding Euler surrounded by the quirky atmosphere of Gottingen which I imagined as a black gothic fort), i forgot what Poussin Hadamard Chebyshev and Landau did, and then of course you have math's Tom and Jerry - Hardy and littlewood, who proved that there were a infinite number of non-trivial zeroes and that Li(x) intersects with pi(n) an infinite number of times (which was very surprising), respectively. ______________Rant______________1. A big deal was made about big oh of the error term, ie the error term would not exceed modulus x^1/2 logx but okay... I thought Riemann already made a precise formulation of pi(x), given the truth of the hypotheses so... isn't this just a far weaker statement... I did not understand this section at all including the Mobius Mu stuff. So M(k) = O(k^1/2) ????? the inverse of zeta s is equivalent to sqrt(k)??? what does that even mean....??? :((Apparently this is a way of saying that if the zeta zeroes don't misbehave, the error term does not misbehave, which was not explicit in Riemann's formulations)2. So at least we know that the primes are distributed as randomly as one would expect of a Normal or Gaussian distribution and that this may somehow be related to GUEs in QM, which are Hermitian matrices with coeffecients plucked randomly from a normal distribution. But what's the relation??? Idk :( 3. Then there's J(x), which assigns a weighted value to pi of the roots of x. ieIt wasn't explained how or why these values were weighted.So you can forumlate zeta in terms of this weird shit in terms of J(x)  Idk why it's so important that you'd wanna see zeta in terms of this sort of integral but okay...4. And fina-fuckin-lly we return to Riemann who manages to formulate J(x) in terms of the zeta function (I thought we already did that????)(and how exactly do you do that?????  So now we have a way of formulating pi(x) in terms of J(x) in terms of zeta (by means of the non-trivial zeta zeroes, in terms of sum of x^all the roots). So we have this really mysterious relation between the values of the zeroes and the more significant ""error term"" of J(x). Li(x^row) gives you a spiral that winds around pi(the real transcendental number)i and -pi(i)(why pi?) and SOMEHOW this ALL MANAGES TO WORK OUT? ______________________________________And thus we get a super complicated way of counting the primes (and I sock the guy who says it's elegant, cos wtf is this beast of a thing?). The zeta zeroes seem just as complicated as the distribution of primes themselves (could one say equivalently complicated), so one would wonder why you would represent one intractable problem in terms of another.Maybe they're just far too random and unlike most things in the universe of mathematics, don't bear the special transcendental hand print of god. Nevertheless, we choose how to bide our time, and maybe playing games with numbers is just the same as anything else..."

7,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65398513-steve,5,"If you are interested in mathematics in general, enjoy recreational mathematics or have even a curiosity and affinity for numbers then I think you’ll enjoy this book. It’s ‘popular’, in that it’s aimed at non specialists but there are minimum requirements for you to make the most of it. I think in the UK you probably need advanced level maths, or in the US have included some calculus at high school or early college. My background is the advanced maths that go with non-theoretical physics degrees and the complex functions associated with elasticity theory (in mechanical engineering). Even so, I found it required a good degree of concentration in the latter sections of the book!Formally the author states he’s intending to explain the Riemann Hypothesis; “All non trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part 1/2”. That probably doesn’t mean much to you, as it didn’t to me either. But the journey to understanding what that means, and why it’s important in understanding how prime numbers are distributed amongst all numbers, is the mission of the book.The author is very good at reintroducing mathematical topics you’ll need to understand his ultimate aims concerning Prime Numbers and the functions to model their distribution. So he gradually goes through basic definitions of numbers (real, integers, transcendental, etc); important functions for later work (ln x, and e^x); infinite series, converging and diverging, and order dependent; elementary calculus; complex numbers. It’s probably a bit much to be learning these for the first time via the book. I saw these as useful refreshers. He spends time, of course, on prime numbers, and how empirically they are distributed amongst other numbers, before moving onto the important modelling of their distribution. The functions used to model how prime numbers are distributed and differences to the real distribution of numbers is getting us to the meat of the book.The zeta function is introduced, examined, and importantly the way it can be reconstructed as other (geometrical) series. The link between ‘zeros’ of the function and prime numbers is introduced, thus meeting the first part of this book’s mission.I started to concentrate seriously when the zeta function was ‘mapped’ to allow you to understand what these solutions mean. My reading rate slowed and I deliberately read in short spells so that I could understand bit by bit.After this the discussion is a little less targeted, mainly because there seems to be a lack of momentum to proving it. Some interesting general discussion on why prime numbers may follow the apparently statistical functions that model their distribution. Coming from a practical technical background I sometimes asked if the full blown theoretical proof mattered much given that the hypothesis seems valid numerically, as shown by computers, to numbers beyond practical use. But the possible links between prime numbers and various natural phenomena (certainly some aspects of atomic theory, and possibly sub-atomic particle physics - which was why I read up on this subject) mean that a theoretical proof would reinforce the importance of the physical links if demonstrated.In addition, a bit of work by Littlewood in the 1920s proving that the difference between functions modelling prime numbers, and the actual distribution, does some strange things at uncountable large numbers was interesting. And maybe a reason that the theory could be false theoretically while apparently valid for practically useful numbers.Let me also mention the book structure., which was effective for me. The heavy duty mathematics was dealt with in alternate chapters, with the intermediate chapters, as light relief, discussing background subjects such as the mathematicians doing the signifcant work (Euler, Gauss, Riemann, and more modern mathematicians). OK, they are not normally a bundle of laughs but even learning how they applied themselves to their life’s work was good to discover, and did make the book as a whole easier to read.All in all, I think the author did an excellent job in explaining a difficult subject. I’m glad I persevered. Though again with the caveat that it’s not really for absolute beginners to the sort of maths one covers in the final stages of school, or 1st year technical degrees."
8,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108138-trivialchemy,3,"This comparison will probably strike most as directly from left field, but Derbyshire reminds me a lot of Jon Krakauer. Topically, of course, they have nothing in common. But their style both depends heavily on the conspicuousness of the author in the narrative. This isn't necessarily because Krakauer and Derbyshire are narcissistic or self-absorbed, but that their writing is very self-conscious and they feel a continual impetus to advise the reader of where they stand on the issues they are presenting.In some ways, these two are more journalists than they are chroniclers of history. And I suspect that neither would be more uncomfortable with that characterization. But something about this self-aware presentism has always bothered me. It bothers me deeply in Krakauer's work -- which is somehow concerned with what it means to be a flawed human animal in a time that mistrusts impulse and animalism; and though it bothers me somewhat less in Derbyshire -- who is dealing with the mirror aspect of humanity -- it still bothers me.I guess the truth is that I would rather have just had a really good story than have to also hear what Derbyshire thought about it himself. Which is not to say there isn't a good story here! On the contrary. It's quite an excellent story! This book deserves at least the half a star above three that I'm forbidden from giving it. "

He takes an extremely esoteric mathematical puzzle and shows how it emerges organically starting from the simple math we learned in high school. He also provides several excellent character sketches of famous mathematicians who made the key discoveries that allowed the Riemann Hypothesis to come into being in the first place. Most importantly, Derbyshire manages to convey the sense that the field mathematics is a lively and active attempt to deduce new truths, not just a collection of proofs solved long ago."

There's a lot of handwaving around high level calculus but he explains what he's handwaving away enough that I was able to independently research most of it. One note though: although this book is (accurately!) billed as presenting the Reimann Hypothesis in the simplest, most understandable mathematics possible it's still pretty advanced.

Even the mathematics of Riemann from the middle of the 19th c. is too abstract to explain with simple numerical examples and plots and graphs.

Why he feels the need so desperately to kowtow to idiots by disparaging the subject, the profession, the people in the profession, and so on, is difficult to comprehend for anyone unfamiliar with the atmosphere in general from early schools to colleges to universities - indeed generally any institutions short of stature compared to, say, Princeton or thereabouts - where jocks are worshipped and those capable of thought are abused verbally and in almost every other way beginning with epithets such as nerd, geek et al (and then comes the resentment against other cultures that actually do study, worship knowledge, and reap benefits of intelligence era in work and employment); but still, he need not have assumed the reader of such a book would have the same idiot bully attitude or that he would be stoned to death if he did not disparage his subject and badmouth it. All that is bad enough, but having gone through the book it is far more maddening to find extremely important clues missing, almost as if he is afraid a stray reader might solve the Riemann hypothesis while reading this if he provided the important clues. He covers his back by mentioning that Mathematicians do handwave and leave gaps that are expected to be filled by the audience, but those are the sort that are more obvious, and one is not expected in the course of a lecture or a series of lectures in the subject to know why a sum of an infinite series of powers of positive integers becomes zero at negative even numbers even if the said sum can be shown to equal an infinite product of inverse terms involving primes, all primes. If one is needled, one has to go through the book over and over to find somewhere hidden in a corner a mention that a third expression for the same function is a product including sine function with half pi integer multiple, but if he has given why the third expression is equal to the other two infinite ones, one a sum and another a product, that is far too well hidden - or one has missed it due to some miracle. All this exasperation and the double wish the book generates, one regarding going into the subject and another about bopping the fellow a few times on the head, still strangely enough does not do away with the fact that the book is very worth reading for someone not already deep in the subject. For those very familiar with all the mathematics herein I suppose the history nevertheless is extremely interesting. One does feel an immense sense of gratitude to all those great geniuses for not bending their minds to reap immediate rewards for personal benefit. "
27,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935582-dan-cohen,4,"This is a really good book. It attempts to explain the Riemann Hypothesis (""RH"") to anyone with only ""high school"" mathematical knowledge, or maybe a little bit more. It also contains a lot of historical material on the mathematicians involved and makes many delightful observations and asides on the way.The book includes a lot of mathematical reasoning. But the author avoids making it a mathematical text-book by simplifying, cheating, and joking his way along. This is a very refreshing and effective approach and makes the book far more engaging than one might expect. Readers with more than the supposedly sufficient ""high school"" mathematical knowledge may find some parts puzzling as the author appears to be getting things wrong, but this is just a device to avoid introducing too much complexity too early - the author backtracks on these seeming errors once he is in position to introduce the concepts required to get them right. I do not think the author really succeeds in explaining RH in the terms he has set, although I doubt that anyone else could make a better job of it. I think that RH and the mathematics around it is just too difficult to understand without at least a full mathematics degree. For example, a good understanding of the foundations of complex analysis (something I singularly failed to achieve in my undergraduate degree course) seems to be essential to understanding RH. The author does a good job of trying to explain some of the concepts of complex analysis to the non-mathematical reader, but I do not think that the level of understanding such a reader will achieve based on these sections is anywhere near high enough for readers without a prior understanding of complex analysis to be able to grasp what follows. That's not the author's fault - he does a good job - it's just that the problem he has set himself is too difficult to achieve.Not content with trying to introduce the non-mathematical reader to complex analysis, he goes on to introduce field theory and operator theory! This really is very ambitious and is only partially successful as he inevitably has to leave most things out.However, despite this (heroic) failure, the book is so engagingly written that it doesn't matter if readers are unable to follow all of the mathematical reasoning - I found myself skimming over some of the mathematical arguments and I suspect most readers will do likewise. Despite this, I found the book had mathematical insights that I hadn't previously heard or had perhaps forgotten in the 27 years since I last did any mathematics. For example, the idea that the log function is ""trying"" to be like exponentiation to the power of zero but not quite managing it. I also found the author's discussion on the standard categorisation of the different parts of mathematics very useful.This book is well worth a read for mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike. The latter may find they have to skim over some sections but that does not detract from the value of the book."
28,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47707278-tyler,5,"The author, John Derbyshire, has a wonderful achievement in this book. It is extremely impressive how much he was able to explain for a lay audience about the Riemann Hypothesis. While it is not comprehensive, any close reading of this book will leave the reader with a elementary understanding of the RH, and while that might not sound too impressive, it is a rather mighty feat. This book shows the beauty and excitement that math can have, and it made me fall in love with the subject even more. Anyone who has the slightest inkling in mathematics will throughly enjoy this book.Interesting fact: John Derbyshire is apparently an alt-right figure, which surprised me. I don’t think that shows itself in this book at all, but just letting you know."
29,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030419-fraser-kinnear,4,"Prime numbers are powerful things. If you multiply one or more primes together, you can create any other positive integer that's bigger than one. And we suspect that every even positive integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.But primes are strange as well - there doesn't appear to be any order to their appearance. The higher you count, the less often you run into them and you'll never stop seeing them. But can we tell when the next one will occur? In other words, is there some sort of pattern to their appearance? And could that pattern tell us something fundamental about numbers in general?Bernhard Riemann made a suggestion about how prime numbers were distributed along the number line in 1859. This suggestion became known as the Riemann Hypothesis, and stated that the pattern of distribution of primes is connected to non-trivial zeros of the zeta function. What the hell does that mean? The majority of the book is spent answering that question by unpacking the zeta function.We have a proof that describes how prime numbers are distributed - it's called the prime number theorem, and Riemann's work was crucial to its development. However, we haven't yet proven the Riemann Hypothesis, which is a much stronger statement than PNT.Compared to other math books, Derbyshire does a great job of getting into the meaty details and walking through them in a clear manner. The tone was very conversational, doesn't require much linear algebra or calculus, and stuck to the topic at hand (he would often hint at enormous tangents while declaring that he will be avoiding them for our own sake). I have one main concern, and is the reason why I didn't give this more stars. While I can appreciate the mystery of prime numbers, and I could follow all of the book's content(after much concentration on my part), I had trouble grasping the importance of the Riemann Hypothesis after Prime Number Theorem was proven. However, I suspect that at some point he did explain it, and I since forgot it. For its density, this is a pretty long book (about 400 pages, including the notes, which I read). I'll need to, at some point, return to the book to re-learn the significance of RH from the detailed explanation of its composition.At the end of the day, RH doesn't excite me as much as the continuum hypothesis or the incompleteness theorems. I know full well this is because RH is far more obscure than, say, the continuum hypothesis or the incompleteness theorems in relation to my pedestrian ontological/epistemological interests. I guess that's why I'm not a mathematician. If you're interested in this specific topic matter, pick it up. If you just have a pedestrian interest in mathematics like I do, this book is interesting, fun and clear, but there are probably more engaging topics out there than the Riemann Hypothesis."
30,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7607345-lars,3,"Having had my first impressions of Derbyshire formed by his absurdly offensive ""The Talk: Nonblack Version."", and the scandal it evoked, I went into this book with a certain sense of apprehension. Somehow I was not convinced that anyone capable of such crude and disgusting racism would have something appealing to say about, well, anything. The author's politics are thankfully not on display in Prime Obsession, nor is his trademark crankiness. However, there is a certain sense of stubbornness and disregard for the audience. For example, he flat out states at the beginning of the book that unless you have the prerequisite mathematical knowledge that he has arbitrarily defined, you will never be able to understand the Riemann Hypothesis. Parts of the book have a very unsophisticated structure. Derbyshire will sometimes make little attempt at all to explain his material and just solve some equations in a textbook fashion. Some people might find this kind of brazen attitude intriguing. Judging by the ratings this book have received, there are quite a number of them. But to me, it just seems like a rather crass way of bludgeoning the reader into accepting bad handiwork. Reading Ian Stewart's In Pursuit of the Unknown: 17 Equations That Changed the World, I'm struck by how elegantly Stewart (a fellow Brit) is able to convey the wonder of his material without dumbing it down. It makes Derbyshire's attempts seem quite shoddy by comparison. The book does have a lot redeeming qualities. Derbyshire is clearly enthusiastic about the material and handles the biographical portions of the book well. Prime Obsession succeeds convincingly at a meta level, demonstrating why math at this level of abstraction is something that people would care about and even devote major portions of their lives to. Having never heard of the Zeta function going in, and barely grasping complex numbers, I still felt compelled by the deep mystery of the RH as Derbyshire pulled me down the rabbit hole. I am rather conflicted about Prime Obsession. It will bore you out of your skull unless you have some mathematical foreknowledge, and I do not feel the author did as good as he could (or, as some have suggested, as good a job as could be done) to explain the RH to a lay audience. But it still manages to have qualities in spite of this that make it very worth reading. To the right person, I would probably recommend it. But part of me hopes a better alternative will come along, where the material is not burdened by an author of Derbyshire's nature and reputation."
31,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,4,"This book is one of several books on a mathematical topic, ostensibly for laypersons. The topic in this case is the Riemann Hypothesis, which is one of the -- perhaps THE -- most important unsolved problems in Mathematics. The style and layout of the book follows one that I have seen in other such books, where the chapters alternate between the history and personalities and social and political context for those involved in trying to solve the problem, and an explanation of the mathematical topic or related topics.In the case of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), the mathematical explanations are not easy. The hypothesis itself is not easy to understand. The author defines the RH on page xi in the book's prologue: ""The Riemann Hypothesis: All non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part one-half."" He then spends a considerable part of the book explaining what that means. This involves introducing number systems, complex numbers, some integral calculus, and a lot of manipulation of infinite series.I have a solid background in mathematics (my Ph.D. is in Elementary Particle Physics), albeit I'm on the rusty side, not having used my math much in recent years. I found some of the math explanations somewhat challenging, so I'm not sure what a genuine ""intelligent layperson"" would make of them. I found them interesting, and sometimes innovative, but towards the end I was growing tired and losing interest.The chapters on the mathematicians, their history and social and political context were more interesting (and I am one who found history in high school to be boring in the extreme!)On the whole, I liked the book, but I have also read Marcus du Sautoy's ""The Music of the Primes"", which is also focused on the RH, and I prefer that book.Towards the end of this book, one starts to wonder what makes the RH so important to mathematicians. In Chapter 22, the author addresses the question ""What use is it?"", and then goes on to say that he, along with most pure mathematicians, don't really care whether there are applications or could be. But that is not the same as the question ""Why is it important in mathematics?"", and I felt after finishing the book that this latter question hadn't really been answered (unless you consider the entire contents of the book an answer; if so, it certainly isn't a succinct answer!)"
32,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6949571-thomas-paul,5,"In 1859, Bernhard Riemann, one of the greatest mathematicians of his day, wrote a paper about the distribution of prime numbers. In that paper as an incidental remark he wrote, ""All non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have real part one-half."" Riemann had no proof that this was true but he suspected that it was true based on his intuition and his understanding of prime numbers. For nearly 150 years, mathematicians have been trying to either prove or disprove Riemann's hypothesis.Writing a book about something as obscure as the zeta function for the non-mathematician is a daunting proposition but John Derbyshire is up to the challenge. In a book on a topic like this, you expect the author to not be afraid to discuss complicated mathematics. By starting off slowly and holding our hands as he moves through the math, Derbyshire makes complex mathematical functions understandable even to someone who hasn't looked at calculus in more than twenty years. So even if non-trivial zeros, natural logs, and prime number distribution theories sound over your head, Derbyshire will explain it in a way that will make it clear and interesting. Derbyshire breaks the book up so that the odd-numbered chapters cover mathematical details and the even-numbered chapters cover historical background of the story. So even if you do get lost in the math, you still can still follow the story which is fascinating in itself.At the time of writing this review, a possible solution proving the Riemann hypothesis to be true has been produced by Louis de Branges of Purdue University. That makes ""Prime Obsession"" both fascinating and timely."
33,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85584217-lance-johnson,4,"I enjoyed this book. It is written a bit like a mystery novel, in the sense that the full picture of things is withheld from view until the final chapters. This style is a bit annoying in the beginning, since the repeated phrase ""... but I will hold off explaining that until a later chapter"" gets old fast, but once the final chapters are reached and ll is laid bare, it is worth it. To be honest, I do not normally have more than a passing interest in number theory. I recognize it as an important field but have generally found it boring. This book helps to illuminate the field and show what a deep and profound field it is. I appreciate the tie-ins to other areas of math and to quantum physics. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in math, or more specifically prime numbers."
34,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448346-saran,3,"Prime Obsession has chapters alternating between describing the social, cultural and political history of several mathematicians who've contributed to our understanding of Prime numbers, and a gradual mathematical exposition of concepts building up to the Riemann Hypothesis. The lazy part in me took this up for light reading as an alternative to working out the maths from Wikipedia, and I wasn't totally disappointed if a little bored. I wasn't familiar with the concept of ""domain expansion"" of a series defining a function, or had a visual appreciation of function of complex numbers prior to reading this. It might not be too far fetched to suggest that most people will have gained something from this book. History of mathematicians, their eccentric anecdotes, their engagement in social lives and their outlook on the prevalent social norms is interesting to me. I'm often surprised how widely non-mathematical opinions of mathematicians can vary considering the rigourous and analytical nature of their profession. The -2 stars is because of the style of writing - it isn't impersonal enough for biography or maths. The author frequently reminds us of his own limitations and that of the requirement to dumb it down to popular audience. If I've accorded 5 starts to Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges, giving this 4 stars isn't justified. "
35,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16130362-karl,4,"Excellent pop-science work. As a mathematician, it was a little simplistic for me (although as a mathematician who did not specialise in number theory I still got a lot out of this book; mathematics is an evolving and complex discipline with many subfields for specialisation and, as Derbyshire points out in this book, it is no longer possible for a mathematician to be an expert in all fields of mathematics anymore. There's simply not enough time in the day); equally, I can see that a non-practitioner might be left behind here and there, but not consistently.Derbyshire has presented what is probably THE great puzzle in number theory in a combination of elementary mathematics (because, let's be honest, he couldn't explain it without) and the usual character sketches and biographical sections. For the most part, he managed to contain the urge for wry asides, but here and there his sense of humour peeks out, making for lightening of the overall mood. Unsurprisingly, the reader will get the most out of this book if they fully engage with the mathematics; the most complex stuff in there is at a first-year university level. Number theory is the field of mathematics with all the fun puzzles in it - this book gives you the biggest and best of them all."
36,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,2,"I bought this book thinking it was a biography of Riemann. It's not. Riemann shows up for a little bit at the beginning, but the vast majority of this book is not about him. Fair enough, allegedly he kept no diary and made no friends, so there's very little known about him. But the title is exceptionally misleading.My second concern is ""who is the intended audience of this book?"" Like, it goes through exceptional trouble to explain natural numbers, but a few chapters later assumes you're capable of following difficult arguments requiring calculus over infinite series. It goes on forever about what a matrix is, but then completely glosses over eigenvalues, despite using them heavily for its later arguments. The final chapter is just one huge derivation of a result that nobody outside of analysis would ever care about.If you're a math hobbiest, this book is going to be too hard for you. If you have a math undergraduate degree, this book is going to be both too hard for you AND immensely boring at the beginning. The history presented is grantedly interesting. I'd suggest just skipping over the math bits regardless of your skill and skimming through the history. Save yourself some time and frustration."

In this case, Derbyshire talks about the Riemann Hypothesis, as well as parts of the biographies of the people whose work related to it. The odd numbered chapters are the mathematically focused ones, while the even numbered chapters are the biographical ones.While I'm not sure that I agree with the author's claim that someone who does not understand the RH after reading this book will never understand it, I certainly learned a lot from this book, despite the reluctance to explain or prove many of the mathematical results he states, though I guess that's what I get for deciding to read a popular math book on the RH. In contrast with ""Unknown Quantity,"" I did not already know most of the math that's presented in the book, so I definitely learned a lot, and I look forward to learning Complex Analysis, upon which many of the results presented in the book will become more clear.Overall, this was a great introduction to the RH for those with less than ideal math background, and the biographies were informative and often amusing. "
38,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62886336-kevin-roche,4,"A very thorough, but readable guide to the Riemann hypothesis. This book is divided into Mathematical (odd numbered) and Historical chapters (even numbered) that serve together to give a very thorough layman's study of the hypothesis. The historic chapters introduce the players and mathematical environment in the history of the study of prime numbers that lead to the Riemann hypothesis, and follows on to detail the involvement of those players who have since sought to prove its truth or falsehood. The mathematical chapters can get quite challenging, especially during the final chapters, but reward careful reading. They cover of ground in the area of sequences and series, prime numbers and the prime number theorem, up through subjects in complex analysis (especially conformal mappings and analytic continuation), and of course the zeta function itself. I've previously read Marcus du Sautoy's Music of the Primes on this same subject, and whilst that book is excellent, I think there is a little more depth to John Derbyshire treatment of it.A very worthwhile read for anyone interested in mathematics generally and number theory in particular."
39,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350004-josh-hamacher,3,"Reading this reminded me of how much I always enjoyed math back in college. The chapters alternate; odd chapters are a mathematical-oriented exposition of what the Reimann Hypothesis is, what it means, and what it implies. Even chapters give an historical overview of the key players, places, and events in the search.I can't say I kept up with all of the math. The first third was a review, the second third I felt like I should understand because I had it in college but hadn't used since, and the last third was mostly beyond me. Derbyshire does a remarkably good job of explaining complicated math well, although I do have some complaints:1. He's too informal and too chatty.2. He often repeats the same point multiple times within the same paragraph or neighboring paragraphs, to the point of even using the same sentence fragments.Still, this book is a reasonably fast and very enjoyable read for anyone who has any interest in math at all."
40,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456844-theresa-leone-davidson,2,"If you know of the Riemann Hypothesis and how no one has been able to solve it, or if you have a whole lot of interest in mathematics, particularly calculus, or if you are the type of person who enjoys solving difficult math problems just for fun, then you would probably enjoy this book. I did not learn to love math until college, which I have written about in past reviews, but I do not have an inordinate amount of love for the subject, and this book I found to be tedious and overwhelming. I do admit, however, that I enjoyed Derbyshire's book on algebra much more, read about a year ago, before I knew anything about the author. The fact that I now know what Derbyshire's politics are may actually have colored my perception of the book, but I don't really believe so. As fascinating as an unsolved problem can be, this one just did not capture my attention, although, as I said, if you really love college level math, then this might work for you. "
41,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11578144-jason,5,"Prime Obsession goes deep into the history of the quest to unlock the secrets of prime numbers. Every other chapter (the odd-numbered ones) delve into the mathematics and I learned a lot. The mathematics involved is often remarkable, like peeling back a layer of the universe and seeing what God is doing behind the scenes. We still don't really know what the heck it is but we see clues that it's all interconnected somehow (e^(pi*i)=-1 for example). Anyways you learn the proof to the Prime Number Theorem and all how it connects to Riemann's Hypothesis. The bulk of the book is about the Riemann Hypothesis and how hard it is to solve, being the last of the great unsolved mathematics problems. Every even-numbered chapter is more biographical/historical. A really interesting narrative about the lives of the mathematicians and the conditions in which they're making these great discoveries and inventing new fields of math (analysis, field theory, operators).

There is math and history of those mathematicians featured. He does a decent job of putting some sections in layman's terms, which put me off, I get the need, but I highly doubt many of those without a math interest and background are going to read this. The author's writing style is very informal. I wanted to love this book, it has good books, but I don't feel the author really ever gets to the bare bones of what the RH is, its importance and its implications, he brings it up, but it isn't nearly as detailed as it could have been. Check out numberphile and singingbanana on youtube, their videos do a great job of talking about the RH. I may reread this when I can give it my full attention, I was reading between this and another book, so it may have hurt my experience. Plus reading difficult math a second time can really be beneficial to grasping everything. "

Many are far too full of dense equations and seem geared to those with a math Ph.D. This one, however, can be understood by an undergraduate with a few math courses completed.He starts with the basics and slowly shows how the zeta function can be calculated with only prime numbers, shows how analytic continuation works, and then gets deeper into the non-trivial zeros of the function and how those zeros and prime numbers relate.That is one half of the book. Every other chapter is a history lesson focusing on people and events at the times and places where advances in the zeta function and its hypothesis took place.I have been asked if there is a ""Riemann Hypothesis for Dummies"" book. This could be it. It is understandable by those that lack an advanced STEM degree, and, for a math book, is rather enjoyable. I have read it twice."

I disagree. Trolling Euclid gave a really good and easy to understand explanation of the Riemann Hypothesis in less pages with a lot of math too found in this book. This book doesn’t really give a good explanation of it, instead it spreads it out over the entire book of what the Riemann Hypothesis is, i.e., it leads you up to it. I disliked the alternating chapters of math and history. I felt like I was getting off topic many times. While this isn’t bad, it’s not executed well. Fermat’s Enigma also used math and history but presented it a lot better. I think this book doesn’t do a good job many times explaining the math to the average reader, at least, even those curious about math. There is a lot of math in this book though, and I might reread it again someday. "

The author strikes a balance between giving a historical account of the development of, the interest in, and the evidence for the Riemann Hypothesis, and for explaining as much of the mathematics as he can. As a mathematician, I can't say how the effort to explain the mathematics would play to someone who doesn't know much advanced mathematics. For me, it was generally a quick read, mostly enjoyable. I do have some issues with the tone of the book overall -- I think the author is very invested in what I think is the ""great man"" theory of the advancement of science and mathematics.

Need to go back and look more at this.Perfect complement to du Sautoy's Music of the Primes - both excellent books. This is the best if you want more hard maths.

When the book raised the politically charged issue of the Dreyfuss affair, it was distinctly critical of anti-semitism.

There have of course been some blots on the record, but I don't see how it can be denied that net-net, white Europeans have made a better job of running fair and stable societies than has any other group''.But leaving that aside, as an explanation of the Riemann zeta function and the Riemann hypothesis it was pretty good."

To those who feel the book may be too narrowly focused to be of interest: rest assured there is a lot more covered than the title eludes to. A very interesting historical context that include fun characters such as Euler, Gauss, etc. is slipped into the storyline.

One, occasionally the author would make the steps between the derivations of proofs a little two far for me. (Requiring me to reach for paper and pencil.) And two, his somewhat annoying habit of saying “which I will discuss in more detail in chapter ...” or “As I introduced back in ...”Two particularly bright spots were the many of the authors extremely interesting notes and a number of cute plays on words.

It's astounding to think that there are people out there working away at this crazy problem, and how much they have accomplished. I was fascinated by the brilliant leaps of logic and understanding across mathematical disciplines and methods. Yet the Reimann Hypothesis is still unproved. Derbyshire's writing has piqued my curiosity and interest in both the different fields of mathematics and the principal historical figures of the Reimann Hypothesis. His writing is so immediate, the book sometimes reads like a whodunit, and the ""characters"" like Gauss, Euler, and Reimann come across as very soulful and human. "
52,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7244685-bowman-dickson,4,"Hmm, I found this interesting overall - loved some of the historical sections about mathematicians and loved just getting a feel for in general how a singular problem from one little function has plagued mathematicians for a few centuries now. Not sure who the audience is. He explained ridiculously simple math and then slipped a lot of steps as we got further up the abstraction latter. I mean, the guy explained properties of exponents, which is ridiculous because there is NO WAY someone who doesn't understand that could understand even 30% of the rest of the book. Overall worth it for someone interested in math!"
53,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4573141-shayne,5,"Really raises the bar for pop-math books. My only complaint is that the educational level of the intended reader is somewhat bizarre. On the one hand, only the very minimum amount of calculus is provided to keep the concepts approachable. On the other hand, towards the end of the book Derbyshire writes tangentially about things like p-adic numbers which I didn't encounter until my senior-level number theory class. Part of me wishes he'd dropped the pretense of writing for a lay-audience and just gone more or less full bore into the mathematics involved. Still an excellent introduction to the topic, especially regarding the historical details."
54,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119638-flora,2,"The author alternates between more narrative-type chapters and mathematical explanation chapters, and explains early on that if you don't get the math you can just read every other chapter. I tried to follow, but somewhere in the last six chapters I just fell and couldn't keep up. Fabulous writing. Awesome footnotes. Thanks for jogging my memory about some long-unused keys on my scientific calculator, and for the lovely mathematicians' biographies. But at the end of the day, yeah, it was kind of incomprehensible."
55,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3696598-doug,4,"Very well written, both in terms of the history and in terms of the math. About every other chapter is fairly hardcore mathematics, proofs and integrals and whatnot. The author warns you that you'll need at least freshman year calculus to really get the meat of RH and how approaches to solving it have morphed and changed as the culture of math research has changed.Mixed in with a straight history of the Riemann Hypothesis and its soldiers is an accidental anthropological analysis of mathematics as a human discipline and the psychology that makes it both hard and necessary."
56,0452285259,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12186085-david-joseph,4," Another pop math book that makes my short list entitled: ""Best Guided Tours Anywhere. The book is evenly divided up between odd numbered chapters of historical narrative and even numbered chapters of tutoring sessions that familiarize the reader with some abstract mathematical animals. I skipped the history, and used the time I expected to save, carrying out some of the suggested proof exercises. Later I went back to the odd numbered chapters. They were amusing."

The author has made his task very challengeable - to explain high level abstract math to a layman almost without even using calculus. And i have to say he succeeded! On the top of knowing the subject he is great storyteller. I wish I would have such a teacher for the Calculus when i was at the University;-)It is not for everyone, but of you are seriously fascinated with math and have some knowledge in the subject I think you would enjoy it."

I can't help but wish it was aimed at a slightly more math literate audience. The book tries hard to assume no knowledge of calculus in the reader, which has a tendency to slow things down quite a bit. Still, I understand why that assumption was made and Derbyshire achieves his aim of presenting some fabulous mathematics to the widest possible audience."
