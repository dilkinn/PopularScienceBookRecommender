0,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Now this is how an honest-to-goodness popular science book ought to be like. The book basically tracks the same story as A Universe from Nothing by Lawrence M. Krauss and even has Lawrence as a character every now and then. Because I was familiar with the story and its ending, this time around I could concentrate on the telling of the story more than the actual events themselves and I was struck by the high contrast of how Richard Panek handles the material and how Krauss had presented it in his book.Krauss comes at it with a vehemence and a rejoicing attitude as if science has finally solved the big problems with the confirmation of the 'dunkel stuff' and from the extension of the flatness of the universe to how it was possible for it to have come from nothing. Throughout the book, the language is forceful and the story is convincing. The scientists know what they are doing and they are finally getting things right was the sonorous message. 'No doubts entertained' was Krauss's attitude and the percentages and the fractions were thrown at us as if there was no contention on those measurements whatsoever. I was convinced and I accepted them. After all, they were coming from a respected scientist who was part of these very breakthroughs. So with a few reservations about how Krauss had not really closed the door with the book, I had concluded my review.
The 4% Universe
 - 4% science... 96% stories.Panek on the other hand has shown me the human version of what happened behind the scenes. Those astronomers and observers who found the standard candles and made the measurements, those theorists who made the elegant theories and the physicists who ran the accelerators in patient search of extreme particles, they were not really all that, exactly. They were mostly guessing and fumbling and playing scattergun. They had no idea whether Type Ia supernovae would really be standard candles, they had no clue why lambda should be non zero or for that matter, what dark matter or dark energy really is.These uncertainties of the scientific procedure too should be captured when science is written or commented upon and Panek has done that in wonderful fashion. At times his obsession with detail and the pages and pages of detail about the letters exchanged and the worries of each group member of the High-z team and the SCP team does get tedious when the reader already knows the outcome of this famous spat and Panek doesn't quite manage to achieve the suspense that he tries so hard to build up. But what the detail does provide is an insight into the insecurities and the many mistakes of these Nobel laureates and exposes how almost everything they thought of the universe was wrong and that the Nobel they got was mostly for proving themselves and almost everyone else so completely wrong.Let There Be DarkThat said, anyone who approaches the book to get answers to the big questions will quickly realize that the book is not about providing answers but about how circuitous the route to finding answers can be. The first half of the book details the work of astronomers discovering in steps, starting from Galileo, that there is more to the universe than what meets the eye. The astronomers progress to seeing the planets, the moon, then the stars and then even the galaxy and then, horror of horrors, other galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The theorists could not keep pace with the speed at which discovery was progressing, lockstep with technology and the theorists lagged far behind, still in the armchair with Newton and Einstein. Meanwhile, the astronomers were going ahead and finding out weirder and weirder things about the universe - they found that the Big Bang was real and had proof in the form of CMBR, they found that the universe is expanding, then that the expansion is accelerating. Then they found that the galaxies rotate too and that the rotation does not slow down towards the edges. The only way they could explain this was to posit a huge amount of 'dark matter' on the edges, stabilizing the rotation, only to be derided for reincarnating the discredited 'ether' of old days. But, evidence gathered and soon it was accepted. Weird thing, that. It was accepted purely because it solved problems, not because anyone could explain why it was there or what it was doing there, a trend that was soon going to dominate cosmology.The next step was to come from the laggard theorists. Out of nowhere came the breakthrough idea of an 'Inflationary universe' - now this solved even more problems and also made acceptable a few arbitrary assumptions that the cosmologists had made about the universe such as homogeneity and isotropy. Who could resist that? It was soon standard truth. Now that universe was inflationary and the current state of the universe was satisfactorily explained, the question was how will it end, what is its future? The answer was to find out if the universe was 'flat'. The mathematics seemed to indicate that it indeed was. But for this, with the existing dark matter and matter put together, there still had to be much more energy (many orders of magnitude) than what the universe we can measure contains. Dark Energy was born, at least on paper. So there we have it, the universe we know, perhaps the universe we can ever know (baryonic matter) is just 4.56% (?) of the real thing. They had to accept now that there might be less to the universe than what meets the eye. Of course, the theorists and the physicists are still devising new theories to explain away or to prove these unseen problems and millions are spent every month in remote corners with hopes of detecting these elusive stuff, the stuff of the universe.The best response then, from scientists as well as from those of us trying to make sense of all this, should be humility and a willingness to entertain and rigorously examine the wildest ideas - they seem to have made a habit of coming true."
1,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"What a very strange book this is, and what a very strange guy Richard Panek seems to be. I know many autistic-spectrum people, and I wonder if he isn't a little autistic. One of the most characteristic things about autistic people is the unevenness in their range of abilities. They are usually extremely good at some things and staggeringly incompetent at others. Panek is definitely a bit in that direction.Panek sets out to tell us about the most recent chapters in the exciting history of cosmology, the discovery of dark matter and dark energy. As everyone now knows, most of the universe is invisible. The 4% in the title is the part we can see: planets, stars, nebulae, things like that. Then there's about another 25% which is dark matter - we can't see it, but we can quite easily see the gravitational effects it causes - and the rest is dark energy, the evidence for which is considerably more indirect. The greater part of the book is about the discovery of dark energy during the 90s. Its presence is detectable by the fact that it acts to stretch the universe apart over time (you sometimes see it called ""anti-gravity""), and finding proof that the stretching existed was very difficult. It involved accurately measuring the distances to galaxies which are many billions of light years away, obviously a challenging thing to do. But scientists can be ingenious when there is a good reason for displaying ingenuity. The brightest things there are (simplifying a little) are the huge stellar explosions called supernovae, and it turns out that a certain type of supernova has predictable enough behavior that it can be used to carry out the accurate measurements that were needed. A supernova is so bright that you're able to see it more or less literally from the other end of the universe, and because their behavior is well understood you can also figure out from careful examination of the rate of change of intensity what their true brightness is. Comparing the true and apparent brightness gives you their distance. But the details are complicated. So why are Panek and the book strange? Well, let me start with the good news. He is an incredibly dogged and hardworking journalist. He seems to have talked with virtually everyone who was involved in the story, he has read their papers, he has looked at their emails and PowerPoint slides, and he is certainly able to present you with some rather striking details. Where Vera Rubin was standing when she received a critical phone call; Alan Sandage's loss of his sense of balance causing him problems on the high telescope platform towards the end of his career; how the cosmology community reacted when they heard that David Schramm's private plane had crashed. He's got all the gossip, and, given that the discovery of dark energy was an acrimonious race between two teams, there's plenty to write about. On all of this, I can't fault him. He's booked you a ringside seat, and you can see the drops of blood flying every time someone lands a solid punch.Now for the middling news. Panek, alas, is not a particularly gifted writer. His prose is cliché-ridden and pedestrian. He is not good at sketching character. There are a bewildering number of people in the story, and it's frequently impossible to tell them apart. A lot of the time, you just have to remember that X is the person who's responsible for Y on the blue team, and Z is the person responsible for W on the red team. Luckily, a few people are such appalling assholes that their personalities shine through. (I hasten to add that there are also some truly admirable characters; the one I liked best was Vera Rubin). But they're the exceptions. And finally for the bad. Oddly enough, for someone who's an award-winning science journalist, Panek seems to be rather sketchy on science. There are some remarkable bloopers. He says that the Casimir effect integrally involves gravity. He tells us that the hypothetical neutralino (important to dark matter theorists) is the supersymmetric partner of the neutrino. Most astonishingly of all, he misquotes Kepler's Third Law - something your average scientist learns in their early teens - and even gives some incorrect examples of how to apply it. So, unfortunately, when he's explaining something I don't already know, I'm never sure whether to trust him. I doubt I've spotted all the glitches.To summarize, then, a mixed bag. But despite the weaknesses, I give him a clear thumbs-up. He's got an incredible story to tell you about how science actually gets done."
2,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,2,"This was another book that ended up being sold on false advertising. Now, you might be forgiven for thinking a book called the 4% universe is going to be about, well, cosmology or something crazy like that. This was mostly about the infighting between groups of cosmologists and as such it goes to prove that a physics degree is no protection from being a wanker. The cosmology, far too often, comes second.That a tedious obsession with ‘being first’ and ‘beating the other guy’ is as bad for science as it is for, well, everything else in the world should hardly come as too much of a surprise. That it makes for tedious reading too should also hardly come as a surprise.The best bits of this book where the bits where he discussed the cosmology, he is actually very good at this and incredibly clear. Now, it might just be that I find the sort of business school stuff so boring that I’ve exaggerated how much of this book seemed to be devoted to that rather than the science, but I don’t think I have, to be honest. When the science is so infinitely interesting the idea you might spend any time at all talking about the all too human nonsense and fluff about whose name should go on which discovery or all of the back-biting and funding applications and whose name goes first on a paper – my eyes just glaze over, I’m sorry, but then, I have spent a lifetime in similar meetings wishing for sudden and painful deaths – either mine (sudden) or someone else’s (painful) – so this generally isn’t how I like to spend my recreation.My favourite paradox which was explained in this book is the horizon problem. You look south into the night sky as far as you can see, then you look north into the night sky as far as you can and the universe is at exactly the same temperature and looks exactly the same – but the light that reaches you has taken the life of the universe to have travelled to you and the two distant and opposite parts of the universe have not had time to be in any contact with each other – so, how did they get to be quite so ‘the same’? This is explained by inflation – and the idea of inflation is explained beautifully in this book.What is also really interesting is how recent most of these discoveries are – as he points out, a young man getting shot in WW1 knew nearly as little about the universe as someone looking out from his cave 300,000 years before. Not quite true, obviously, but then given dark energy only became accepted in about 2006 the shocking recentness of this all is quite something. The idea there dark matter must be other than actual matter is something I hadn’t quite realised previously either – that so much more of the universe needs to be something other than the stuff we see and eat and love and dream about, well, that’s a tad disturbing.A lot of this is written with a bad attitude, not quite Phillip Marlow, but heading down that path – again, it is a book with too much fluff so as to provide atmosphere and it really could have done without that as (and, again, it might just be me) but surely people would read pick up this book for the science, rather than the fluff. All the same, there is my favourite Australian expression included (when something is obvious it is said to ‘stick out like dog’s balls’) – and it is an expression that needs further publicity. But this really could have done with someone attacking it with a red pen reading it before publication. Or it could have been subtitled, ‘all is vanity’. Some warning would have been nice – as I had thought I was going to read a book on science.(A better review of this book – and more forgiving of the fascination with the personal stories involved - is here http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...)"
3,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10326608-lindsay,5,"This is a superb look at the one of the principle mysteries of modern science: that the observable universe is dominated by matter we can't directly see (dark matter) and a bizarre unexplained force that drives the expansion of the universe (dark energy).The book is broken down into three main parts, the first part looking at the origins of the science of cosmology and discoveries around the existence of other galaxies, the expansion of the universe and the cosmic background radiation. The second goes into the discovery and search for dark matter and the third about the two scientific teams that are jointly credited with the discovery of dark energy.On the way we get a lot on Vera Rubin and her life's contribution to the discovery of dark matter and the various interesting personalities and politics around the dark energy work. It's all fascinating. I would have liked to read more on the actual science of dark matter and dark energy, but it's clear that most of such material would be highly speculative and probably too mathematical for a popular science book.I recommend this as a great narrative on the progress of cosmology through the last 100 years or so."
4,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"I've been on something of a science kick lately. This is my third science-based audiobook this year, and it's only early April. I've enjoyed them all, even if I can't say that I understood everything in them. This book, though, felt like a desert triathlon compared to the other two leisurely strolls in the park. This book was exhausting. But I say that in the best way possible. I think. First, let me just say that this book is seriously fascinating. I love astronomy and cosmology, so I'm fascinated with books and shows about what exists beyond our planet, as well as how it came to be. So books like this one are always going to strike my fancy. I just like to learn about what there is! And this book definitely provided information about the cosmos, for sure. It's well researched and so very, very, very, very detailed. I don't know if all the details are accurate, because I think I only really understood 4% of this book (the real meaning of the title!), but that was not for lack of trying on Panek's part. Not only was this a science book about dark matter and dark energy and the universe's creation and make-up, but it's a history of the science along the way, as well as more than a little bit of the drama involved in the competitive arena of science. And keeping all of these things straight in my head was exhausting. There were a ton of people involved, a whopping shit-ton of science and physics and astronomy and math and math and math for days, all of which was more than enough to make my brain cramp up, but then there was a whole lot of the bitchfighting between teams and specialties because everyone wanted to be first. Which I get, I do. Everyone wants their name marked down in the logs for posterity... but a little professionalism would be nice, gentlemen. This is definitely a good read, but so technical that it was a bit overwhelming at times, especially in audio format, so I think I'd like to re-read this one day and maybe snag some additional understanding from the air above my head. Still, I can't blame the book for my lack of knowledge; that's a shortcoming on my part, because I lack even a single doctorate degree. Some of the INTERNS in this book were on their 3rd or 4th doctorate, so right away I knew that this was going to be over my head. I still really enjoyed the 4% I could understand though... so 4 stars. "
5,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"This is really an enjoyable, easy-to-read book on the recent history of cosmology. Read this book and you will understand the big questions in cosmology--there are no answers yet. I especially appreciate the descriptions of recent advances in astronomical observation techniques, and the telescopes (optical and radio) that are used. I thought that a bit too much of the book is devoted to the competition to find and measure supernovae, and the squabbles that ensued. "
6,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2327558-eric-rasmussen,2,"I have a lot of respect for this book, but after reading it (and rereading large portions of it), I was unable to retain anything from it. First, it is primarily the story of the scientists behind the recent advances in cosmology and the search for dark matter and energy, and without the benefit of any character development, I was unable to keep anyone straight. I could not recount any of the story of discovery, the teams involved, or the people that won the awards, as there is not much establishment of these characters as people; instead, they are simply names. Second, there is actually very little focus on the explanation of the science behind cosmology and dark matter; instead, this book is clearly geared towards those with a much stronger background in physics and astronomy than I have.Although this certainly earns me the derision of the ""real"" scientists out there, I need a pop-science, science for dummies, Bill Bryson style approach to topics like this, especially ones as incomprehensible as cosmology. Give me some metaphors. Walk me through the math. After finishing the book, I cannot recount the story of the people involved, nor can really discuss what dark matter is. So why did I read it?As a pretty smart dude, I hate to admit that this book went right over my head. But, then again, it wasn't meant for me."
7,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna,3,"This book has been hanging around on my shelf for a while, and I finally picked it up after having an amusing conversation about spherical cows which reminded me that I should really re-read The Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum MechanicsLet there be dark. Let there be doubtI have chosen this quote because it links contemporary cosmology with my current favourite book, The Left Hand of Darkness in which my favourite character ‘prays’ at night “praise now darkness and creation unfinished”. Indeed, let there be dark, doubt, and creation unfinished, futures unknowable because the timing of any particular interaction can by no means be predicted. Let there be deep knowledge and stirring mystery.It’s me, not the author, but I was pretty disappointed with this book. The resonance of the glorious physics therein was muffled for me by three factors:The absence of diagrams – even though there are innumerable references to graphs, curves on graphs, points on graphs, crucial data from images and so on. Please, SHOW ME THE DATA. I can’t think of any excuse for thisThe absence of equations, although there are many references to equations. I understand that many people are put off by the sight of equations in a book, but if the aim is to write something that appeals to and can be understood by a wide audience, then it would be better to include at least the simpler equations and thoroughly explain them, or to at the very least put them in an appendix so those who would like to see them can have a look.The excessive focus on the soap-opera of rivalry between teams of physicists and astronomers (who coalesce into cosmologists by the end of the story, perhaps?). This bored the hell out of me. I couldn’t care less who came up with a theory first or found the most supernovae. This stuff just gets in the way here. It’s not that I want a textbook - Leonard Susskind does a perfect job of dramatising the oppositing between himself and Stephen Hawking in The Black Hole War ,and I think it’s essential to have texts that reveal and remind that science is a human activity and has a sociology that affects what it produces. But I want more physics, less jockeying. At times, the tone is comically overexcited which might be considered a noble effort to enliven the material:On this occasion, however, Alan Guth received a midnight visit from the Muse of Maths. The next morning he bicycled to his office at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (in the process establishing a new personal best of nine minutes and thirty-two seconds) and immediately sat down at his desk to summarize his long night’s work“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION” he wrote near the top of a fresh page, and then he did something he’d never done before with a notebook entry. He drew two boxes around it.I did stash away a couple of gems from Vera Rubin’s biography for feminist history: When an admissions officer at Swarthmore College told her that because astronomy was her profession of choice and painting was one of her favourite hobbies, she might want to consider a career as a painter of astronomical scenes, she laughed and applied to rival Vasser. When she got a scholarship to Vasser and a teacher told her, “As long as you stay away from science, you should do OK,” she shrugged and pursued a degree in astronomy (with a heavy load of philosophy of science on the side). When a Cornell professor told her that because she had a one-month-old son he would have to take her place at the Haverford AAS meeting and present her paper in his own name, she said, “Oh, I can go,” and, nursing newborn and all, she went.:)"
8,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,1,"This is a deeply frustrating book to read because Panek took no time to craft an overall meta-analysis to tie together all of the elements of his story. This is a subtle point and I will try to briefly explain what I mean below. I am all the more frustrated because the story of dark matter and dark energy, however the scientific understanding plays out in the future, is absolutely fascinating. But upon reflection, I have to issue what is perhaps the most damning verdict that can be passed on a book: after reading The 4% Universe, I could not tell a friend how the story of dark matter/dark energy hangs together. I will return to the “hang together” notion presently.Just to make clear, while I am a layman in physics, I am a doctoral student in sociology with an interest in science and technology studies and organizations. That makes me a professional writer and I may be somewhat more sensitive to the weaknesses of Panek’s argument as a result. When I say that Panek’s story does not “hang together”, I mean to say that the events that Panek presents come forth from the prose in a breathless way and there is a rush from event to event without anywhere near enough discussion of how to understand the event in question and how it relates to other events. (For an example of this sort of analysis in physics, I would refer you at the very least to Brian Greene’s work. In engineering, Henry Petroski does a very nice job of providing analysis.) What this means is that I don’t have an overall sense of the story. When taking on a task like this, namely presenting a complicated argument in physics and cosmology to a lay audience, the writer must be an experienced and solicitous dance partner and have in mind both the overall pattern and structure of the dance as well as to be able to “cue” the reader/dance partner as to what is coming next. Panek on the whole falls down on the “cue” part and as a result, I have no intellectual structure to tie the material in the book together in my head. In fact, the book reads like a long newspaper article rather than a book, and that is not a good thing. In a newspaper article, the lack of length is both a detriment and an advantage. The brevity of the format means the writer cannot supply much information but that same feature means that the article does not need the same type of narrative structure that holds a book together. The reader can be expected to fill in the missing structure and in any case because an article is short, the reader can re-read it a second or third time without too much of a time penalty.The same does not hold true of a book. A reader cannot be expected to read a book two or three times in one sitting. Consequently, the book author must take pains to supply an overall narrative structure – like a dance – and to supply cues to the reader to enable the reader to know what is coming next as well as to how it ties in with what has been said before. If this is not done, then the result is a chaos of information without structure. That is how I felt with respect to 4% Universe. Just as a measure of how much this book challenged me, in my time with social theory, I have read a fair amount of Marxism, a discipline (in)famous for the turgidity of its prose, and I have to say that Panek – for different reasons – was about as challenging.There is much information that is useful in this book and I intend to retain it for two reasons. The first is that as a student of science and technology, there is a huge amount of evidence for how science is a social enterprise as well as being a search for the truth. But second, I keep it as a warning and a lesson for how not to write and for why a good narrative structure is absolutely essential in long-format writing. If you, the reader of this review, are looking for a general book that will educate you on dark matter/dark energy, then I would advise you to look elsewhere. "
9,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1478144-john,3,"This is an attempt to tell the human story behind the discoveries that led to our modern conception of the universe being made up mostly of dark energy, plus about 25% dark matter, and finally about 4% in the form of the matter and energy that we can directly detect, including ourselves. In addition, Panek goes some distance toward explaining in simple terms some pretty abstruse cosmological concepts.So far, so good. I read the book for relaxation as much as anything else, and at that level I very much enjoyed it -- although I did have difficulty keeping track of all the names and the acronyms/contractions.But I was a tad alarmed to trip over odd little errors. On page 85 there's an error in the units for the Hubble ""constant"" (there's a crucially omitted ""per second""). On page 188, discussing primordial and current levels of deuterium and helium-3 in the universe, Panek has his ""most"" and his ""least"" back to front. (The explanation on that page is also, I'd suggest, a bit oversimplified, but I don't offer that as a criticism: it's always hard to know where to draw the line between oversimplification and opacity.) On a page that I can now no longer find there's a false explanation of Kepler's third law. That sort of thing.These instances got me worried: how many other slips might there be that I wasn't spotting? Was it possible that some of the insights I thought I was gaining were misleading me?The 4% Universe is a great read, and can be thoroughly recommended at that level. I'm not sure that it tells the story behind dark matter and dark energy so much as it tells the stories, in the plural -- at the end I didn't feel everything had been pulled together, although perhaps that's inevitable when the science itself is still a work in progress. Hum ho."
10,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4606808-paul-preuss,5,"For 20 years or so after the first Star Wars movie came out, most people who mentioned ""dark"" and ""universe"" in the same breath were talking about Darth Vader and the Dark Side. Doubtless some of the movie's fans were also astronomy fans who'd heard about the evidence for real dark matter -- not what it is (nobody yet knows what it is) but what it does, flattening galaxies, speeding up their rotation, and invisibly sculpting the structure of the visible night sky. Yet the import of that particular dark stuff had not yet excited a wider public. Things started to change in 1998, when two teams of supernova collectors -- the Supernova Cosmology Project led by Saul Perlmutter, based at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California (Berkeley Lab), and the competing High-z Supernova Search Team, led by Brian Schmidt of the Mount Stromlo and Siding Springs Observatories in Australia -- announced they'd found strong evidence for a universe whose expansion wasn't slowing under the mutual gravitational attraction of matter, visible or dark, but instead was accelerating, propelled by something unknown. It couldn't be matter so presumably it was energy. Dark energy. Within weeks, interest in the dark universe had accelerated beyond fans of astronomy and science fiction. Word swiftly got around: what we see, to the farthest reaches of the night, is a small fraction of the stuff that fills the universe. What we know is only four percent of what is. Or, as Richard Panek puts it in the prologue of his extraordinary new book, ""It's 1610 all over again."" That was the year Galileo Galilei (physicist and master publicist) astounded Europe with his Starry Messenger, detailing the telescopic observations that proved Nicholas Copernicus's description of a sun-centered universe was more than just a mathematical convenience. Panek set out to be a fiction writer, but he was bitten by the science-writing bug early on. He has produced quiet masterpieces, including Seeing and Believing: How the Telescope Opened Our Eyes and Minds to the Heavens (Viking, 1998). He knows a paradigm shift when he sees one, and in 2006 he began investigating how dark matter and dark energy had been dragged into the light. Dark matter is the quiet backstory of his narrative. Part of Panek's gift is sketching distinctive personal qualities in a few words, as he does for the dark-matter pioneers. Vera Rubin ""didn't like the controversy ... didn't like everyone challenging her on every number."" Jim Peebles was ""all angles ... elbows and knees ... a man of conflicting sensibilities."" Panek lets the reader see how these utterly unquantifiable variables of character have shaped our rational understanding of the universe we live in. The scientific exchanges over whether the shapes of galaxies and clusters of galaxies demand that there be some extra invisible matter in the universe were generally civil; over the decades there were arguments about dark matter, some even ""virulent"" and ""rancorous"" by Panek's account, but never a cut-throat competition, with one group of researchers trying to beat a competing group to the right answer by any means at hand. When it comes to the story of dark energy, virulent and rancorous are mild adjectives. From its beginnings there was head-butting opposition to the very existence of the Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP). The SCP was part of the program of the Center for Particle Astrophysics, jointly established by Berkeley Lab, a Department of Energy national laboratory, and the University of California at Berkeley. Although the center was supported by the National Science Foundation, its name gave away its genesis. Astronomers don't do particle astrophysics. Physicists do.  Nevertheless the center's founders thought it would be politic to include some people in the star-gazing business on its advisory board. One of those was Harvard's doyen of supernovae, Robert Kirshner, who opposed the Supernova Cosmology Project virtually from the moment he heard about it. The physicists who started the SCP claimed they were going to weigh the universe, measure its shape, and learn its fate. ""They used this giddy language in proposals to solicit funding,"" Panek writes, ""they all told themselves that they were the ones who were finally going to solve some of the most profound mysteries of cosmology -- of civilization itself."" To do this they proposed to measure how fast the universe was expanding, or rather how quickly that expansion was slowing down. Expansion started with the big bang, and everyone assumed it was now slowing because of matter's mutual gravitational attraction. But would it finally stop and reverse, leading to a big crunch? Would it coast to a standstill? Or would the universe expand forever? To answer these questions the SCP intended to use distant supernovae of a particular type, Type Ia, as standard candles -- objects whose distance could be calculated with confidence because they were bright enough to be seen across billions of light years and were also, or so the physicists believed, very similar in their brightness. Brightness was one measurement. Redshift was another. How much the wavelength of light from these standard candles stretched before it reached Earth, shifting the identifying frequencies of cosmic objects toward the red end of the spectrum, indicated how much space itself had expanded and stretched since the light left the supernovae. So by comparing the brightness of Type Ia's to their redshifts, the SCP would be able to compare the present expansion of the universe to its expansion in the past. In Robert Kirshner's opinion, the SCP didn't know what it was doing. At first, ""Kirshner emphasized that the Berkeley search team hadn't yet found a supernova, needed to be careful about photometry [measuring brightness], couldn't account for dust [which reddened the light] -- and didn't know whether Type Ia supernovae were standard candles,"" Panek writes. When, after much tribulation, the SCP did find a distant supernova in 1992, ""Kirshner complained that they still needed to be careful about photometry, still couldn't account for dust -- and still didn't know whether Type Ia supernovae were standard candles."" Invited by the editors of Astrophysical Journal Letters to review the SCP's paper describing their first supernova, Kirshner delayed their paper on the grounds that ""They hadn't yet learned anything about cosmology."" With an initial small sample the SCP did indeed make bad guesses about the universe's weight and shape. But in 1994 they started collecting Type Ia supernovae by the fistful, having developed and applied methods that should have been obvious -- particularly to doubting astronomers. A Type Ia supernova goes off in a typical galaxy perhaps once in a century. By photographing thousands of distant galaxies and then photographing the same batch some weeks later, a few supernovae are statistically certain to have gone off somewhere in that vast collection of stars. Sorting them out wasn't easy, but with the right detectors and computer programs it was inevitable; Type Ia supernovae could be had on demand. The size of SCP's dataset began to multiply. Once the SCP and several other supernova hunters had shown that distant Type Ia's could be used to do cosmology, and once the SCP proved they could be found on demand, competition to measure and weigh the universe quickly got organized. Large datasets are a physicist's playground. Astronomers are content with fewer data but pride themselves on analyzing each with great discrimination. Brian Schmidt and Nicholas Suntzeff formed a team of astronomers that called itself the High-z Supernova Search Team (z stands for redshift). Ironically, many of its members were past or current students of Kirshner's, who was now enthusiastic about using Type Ia supernovae to do cosmology. When he offered to lead the new High-z team, however, its members declined. What had begun as astronomers versus physicists took on the added flavor of East Coast versus West Coast. The SCP was a large group (including some astronomers, in fact) with many members from European and other institutions, but its core was at Berkeley Lab. The smaller High-z team was more randomly dispersed, but with some exceptions -- notably Adam Riess, a Kirshner graduate student who by 1997 was a postdoc at UC Berkeley – its center of gravity was in the East. Gradually that center coalesced around the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which manages the Hubble Space Telescope -- and which Adam Riess would soon join. A key episode related by Panek shows why what might have been a purely scientific race became tinged with bitterness. In 1996 Saul Perlmutter had approached Robert Williams, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute, to apply for Hubble Telescope time, which was much in demand and hard come by. Perlmutter argued that the SCP's ability to deliver supernovae on demand met the Hubble's high standards. The Hubble was needed to search for the most distant supernovae, in Panek's words, to ""make a supernova pop out of its host galaxy."" Williams's response was to request a formal proposal and then, some months later, to convene a private meeting with Robert Kirshner, Nicholas Suntzeff, and Mark Phillips, all members of the High-z team, all of whom argued vigorously against giving the SCP any time at all on the Hubble. Williams's position, according to those at the meeting, was that ""This is really good science, and I [Williams] think the Space Telescope ought to do anything that's really good."" Panek continues, ""at some point each of the High-z members at the meeting understood what Williams was really saying. If they asked for time, right then and there, they'd get it too."" In high-energy physics, proposals for the use of important resources were usually confidential. That was normally the case when astronomers applied for telescope time too. So from the West Coast perspective, says Panek, the dots were not hard to connect: ""If you wanted to see evidence of an old boys' network, you didn't have to look very hard."" Both teams got Hubble time, and the suspense increased as both began to converge on an answer. Early in the fall of 1997, in data from 42 supernovae, SCP team member Gerson Goldhaber found evidence that only a small part of the universe is matter. High z team member Adam Riess soon reached the same conclusion. Early in 1998 both teams announced their findings that expansion isn't slowing at all; it's accelerating, because some three-quarters of the cosmos is made up of a ""cosmological constant"" or other form of what soon came to be called dark energy. All agreed the universe is accelerating -- and they agreed that knowing why will require more data and new research methods. So the competition continues to this day, with opponents still grouped roughly as in the beginning, fielding different proposals for funding the space satellites and ground-based surveys that will be needed to assess the nature of dark energy. Unless it's an illusion, a flaw in Einstein's theory of gravity -- and maybe even if it is -- dark energy is the most profound cosmological discovery since, well, 1610. It's the stuff of Nobel Prizes. Talk about competition. To their credit many, if not all, of the scientists on both sides have tried hard to rise above the snide blogs and dueling press releases that marred the decade of rivalry following the 1998 announcements. (It's time to confess that this reviewer wrote many of those press releases on behalf of the SCP.) Panek quotes Brian Schmidt speaking at a press conference the day before the bestowal of the prestigious Gruber Prize in Cosmology at Cambridge University in 2007, a prize shared between the leaders of the competing teams and also equally among the team members. ""Our teams, certainly in the U.S., were known for sort of squabbling a bit,"" said Schmidt. ""The accelerating universe was the first thing that our teams ever agreed on."" Panek writes, ""The award ceremony at Cambridge wasn't only about posterity.... It was about history ... posterity in motion."" He tells how Perlmutter and Schmidt, in the lecture that followed the ceremony, narrated ""the history of modern cosmology, sometimes finishing each other's sentences,"" a modern history that began in 1965 with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background and brought with it a new way to do cosmology, opening new vistas on the possible. It was a time when ""Perlmutter and Schmidt were themselves as young as the universe."" The most profound discoveries since Galileo deserve a chronicler whose passion for accuracy, love for the human story, and grace with words is the equal of the tale he tells. In Richard Panek, the scientific saga of dark matter, dark energy, and the other four-percent of the universe -- all that's left to us to see with our own eyes -- has found a spell-binding bard. "

Unfortunately, and contrary to all expectations (I was expecting a science book), the entirety of the book is dedicated to a description of the people who made various discoveries that led to our current understanding of dark matter and dark energy (in other words ... this is a history book). While it’s possible that an insider would find the details of the individuals, teams, rivalries and the petty intrigues that make up the book to be of interest, I found it to be little more than standard office politics and about as appealing. While there is some cosmology scattered amongst the banalities, you really have to work for it. Instead of dark matter, we are subjected to details of a competitor’s underhanded dealings to publish a paper ahead of a rival ... Oooh burn!Rather than dark energy we are treated to excruciating detail of the minutia that goes into real science … hours spent in a computer room debugging code?!? ... I’m on the edge of my seat!The reality is that the process of doing science is tedious and boring. It’s full of false starts, hard work, mistakes, corrections and endless hours of drudgery. The reward for this effort, if all goes well, is that a small slice of the world becomes slightly less fuzzy.

Does anyone really know what these things/entities are? No, but they do make up the majority of the cosmos and dark energy appears to be responsible for the fact that our universe is neither static (as Einstein thought) nor are its boundaries beginning to collapse (as might be predicted by the inflationary/Big Bang model). Instead, the universe is expanding, and it is doing so at an ever-increasing rate as galaxies accelerate away from one another. Panek's book is not a scientific tome although there's a fair amount of easily understandable cosmology; you don't need to remember calculus to get what's going on here. Panek has instead focused on the race toward discovery: the personalities involved, the misjudgments, and--to be fair--some subterfuge and academic backbiting. Anyone who's involved in research will know whereof I speak; academics can be cunning, devious, ruthless, and egotistical. But many are dogged, and most are relentless in their drive to understand the universe's deepest mysteries. Some of this otherwise wonderful book is a slog; it bogs down a bit in the middle; but this is a book about personalities as much as it is about science.

Pretty big title and the mystery still is what the rest of reality is. But he did cover the race to discover it between a group of physicists and astronomers which in the process birthed the science of cosmology. Read the epilogue first. In there on page 242 Panek says, “In early 2010 . . . the results arrived bearing the latest refinements of the numbers that define our universe.

The astronomers who set out to write the final chapter in the history of the universe had to content themselves instead with a more modest conclusion: to be continued.” Isn't it amazing? We don't know what dark energy and dark matter is and this composes most of the our universe. Of course, we now have to think about parallel universes and multiverses.

The rest is dark matter and dark energy.* I had heard before that there wasn't enough observed matter in the universe to keep it from imploding (exploding?), but I hadn't realized that the reason the universe doesn't actually crash down on us is because of dark energy as well as dark matter. * This is connected to Einstein's E=mc squared. Matter and energy are the same thing, so it's ok not to be able to observe sufficient matter (or even dark matter) so long as there's enough energy to make up the difference.* Physicists and astronomers are extremely clever at devising experiments and observations to test theories.

Where lambda was concerned, for instance, also known as the cosmological constant, there was so much uncertainty about whether it should hold a value of zero or not and Panek hammered home this point in his characterization of various conferences, conversations, and experiments that sought to figure out the math. Also, while it is the most obvious candidate to explain dark energy, the truth is that dark energy in and of itself is poorly understood at a fundamental level. All that's known about it is that it functions as a type of anti-gravity, diluting more slowly and clustering more weakly than matter as the the universe expands. There was also sufficient doubt and guesswork when it came to supernova, with astronomers scrambling to prove or disprove with telescopes - much like competitive foragers in the dark - that Type 1a supernova could or would be standard candles. They mostly didn't know. The reason for that was because what they found often opposed what they thought they were looking for in the first place, so what about that isn't fascinating?

This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.""(Tips hat to Douglas Adams.) Ok, not quite. But the universe has made a lot of people very puzzled and been widely regarding is a mind-boggling mystery. The scientific hunt to find the solution to this mystery is the focus of Richard Panek's book.In the mid-20th century, humanity (not for the first time) thought it understood the universe. Though there were a handful of physics problems to solve, we looked around and felt like we had a handle on things. The universe was Einsteinian and made sense. We knew that Einstein was right (still do, in fact) in part because, if he were wrong, then humanity would never be able to detonate a nuclear weapon or land a man on the moon or do a thousand other things predicted by theory. So far, so good.Then the data started coming in. Slowly, over the course of several decades, we discovered -- based on numerous observations using multiple, independent measuring techniques -- that Einstein's general relativity was completely insufficient to explain the behavior and structure of the universe. Galaxies and clusters of galaxies simply don't behave they way they should if the observed matter were acting purely in accordance with Einstein's predictions. If it did, then galaxies would have ripped themselves apart long ago.Thus, we are faced with paradox: The (correct) astronomical observations don't match with Einstein's (correct) theories. Therefore, there must be something else that explains the paradox and, incidentally, provides structure to the universe.That ""something else"" is some mysterious substance. Something... dark.Shortly after the Big Bang, some kind incredibly numerous but incredibly small particle clustered together gravitationally. Those clusters of ""dark matter,"" in turn, gravitationally attracted normal matter, which in turn coalesced into galaxies. Dark matter was the midwife of galactic formation -- and made galaxies, stars, and (rather importantly) life possible.More bizarrely, it appears that only a small fraction of the universe is made of the stuff we thought it's made of... the stuff of us. Baryonic matter -- stars, planets, people, ham sandwiches -- comprises only 15 percent of the matter of the the universe. Dark matter makes up the remaining 85 percent of matter -- some sort of material that we can't see and doesn't interact with normal matter (except through gravity).All well and good, as soon as find a particle dark matter and figure out what the hell it is -- something scientists are working on as we speak. Problem (potentially) solved.Not quite. The story doesn't end there. It turns out the universe is even weirder than that. Dark matter is only half the story -- or more accurately, about one-quarter.Imagine throwing a baseball into the air. What happens? Naturally, it moves fast as it leaves your hand and then, as gravity starts asserting its power, the ball slows as it rises, until finally it tops out and falls back down to the ground.The same principle SHOULD apply to the universe. The models predicted the Big Bang was like a giant baseball thrown into the air. The universe expanded very rapidly at first -- as any explosion does -- but then, as gravity started asserting itself and matter (normal and dark) began clumping together, the expansion slowed and would eventually stop (perhaps even reversing itself and ending the universe in the Big Crunch).Except, we now know that's not how the universe will end at all. We know this because the expansion of the universe is ACCELERATING.The universe is like a baseball you throw straight up in the air that, after it leaves your hand, starts accelerating.There's something much more powerful in the universe, something much more significant than either normal or dark matter: the fabric of space itself. Perhaps to preserve the sense of mystery, this property of space is known as ""dark energy."" It is a repulsive property that only started manifesting itself recently in the universe's history (only the last few billion years or so) as matter became thinner and more spread out.This repulsive dark energy is weak whenever it's in the presence of matter. There is dark energy in the room you're sitting in, in your brain, in the air in the space between your eyes and these words. But the gravity that is also acting on your eyes, on your brain, on the air in that room is much more powerful than dark energy. Your room isn't expanding because there's enough mass for gravity to hold it all together.But if you move out into intergalactic space, there isn't that much matter. Dark energy roams free; it starts pushing. Space itself expands, pushing galaxies further and further apart. Ultimately, as the universe continues to expand and the density of matter thins (and therefore, the power of gravity weakens), dark matter will take over. The universe will end not in a crunch, but in the cold, emptiness of nothingness. It will expand and stretch out forever.This dark energy is so pervasive that it makes up 73 percent of the mass-energy of the universe, leaving the other 27 percent to matter -- 23 percent dark matter and only 4 percent normal matter. Only 4 percent of the universe is the stuff of us.The 2011 Nobel prize in physics was awarded for this collective discovery. Richard Panek does a good job of relaying this great adventure. I won't quibble with his presentation of the material (others have) but for an educated layman like me, I found the slow rolling-out of the process of discovery thrilling.Today, the hunt is still on for what dark matter and dark energy are, and for how they fit with the standard model of physics.Still, broad questions remain. What IS the universe? We've explained what it is, but not how or why. Why is there something instead of nothing? The book cannot reveal the ""answers"" because we don't have them yet. The universe -- at least, certain crucial aspects of it -- remains a mystery.Finally, two random, unrelated observations:1. It is clear from this text alone that the Hubble Space Telescope is one of the wisest investments humanity has ever undertaken.2. The story of ""epicycles"" -- as an example of ever escalating and unnecessary complexity to make an obviously false theory fit with divergent facts and evidence -- has great metaphorical possibility to the economics profession."

And by certain I mean certain right now :) What I liked about this book more than some other science books is that Panek writes a story about how science groups work and the ""race"" to discover or prove dark matter. The hurdles and roadblocks aren't anything I had ever thought about and the different types of personalities are ones that I encounter frequently in my own work, it was ""fun"" reading about the same types in another field.I think I finally have a grasp on the case for dark matter but I will probably need a couple more books like this to fully understand it. A science read I would recommend to anyone."

It's a fascinating read and while it won't leave you any clearer on what dark matter and especially dark energy are, it will explain how we got to a place where such a bizarre theory now seems to be the leading explanation for the universe in which we find ourselves.For anyone interested in astronomy, physics or the scientific process in general, this makes a great overview of cosmology up through about ten years ago."

35,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90743-gala,3,"I read this book as a way to get my mind around the idea of dark matter before being paired with a dark matter researcher for an artist/scientist collaborative exhibition. While I really enjoyed the seismic idea movement in my understanding of the cosmos, I found that my understanding of the science was not great once I sat down with someone who is actually in the field. This could be, and probably is, a fault of my own, a lack of scientific background on which to hang these still exploratory concepts, but it also belies the danger behind popular scientific texts. Simplification of concepts sometimes obscures the data unintentionally. "

37,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This a highly readable history of the transformation of cosmology from metaphysics to physics, from philosophy and speculation to hard science, and in the process, the discovery of most of the universe.Historically, astronomy and physics didn't have a great deal to do with each other. Astronomers studied the stars by observation, very patient and detailed observation and record-keeping. Theoretical physicists theorized and calculated, and experimental physicists experimented, and they fed each other's work, very occasionally coming up with something, most notably gravity, that made a real difference to astronomy. Then Einstein gave us general relativity, and began a century of ever-deeper entanglement of physics and astronomy, and the transformation of cosmology--the study of the nature and origins of the entire universe--from something utterly beyond the scope of physics into its core. The questions of how big the universe is, whether it is eternal in space and time or had a beginning and might have an end, became real questions.Edwin Hubble, early in the century, discovered that the universe is expanding, but also that there are other galaxies beyond our own, and that they're all moving away from us. This was a major, exciting, and initially controversial change in our conception of the universe. In the 1960s, Vera Rubin, looking for a research project she could do within the constraints of raising two young children, studied other astronomers' observations and discovered that the galaxies were rotating as well as moving away from us. Also in the mid-1960s, Robert Dicke, Jim Peebles, and a small group of theoretical physicists had a prediction for which they had no supporting data: If the Big Bang theory of the history of the universe were correct, there should be low-level cosmic microwave radiation, at a temperature of about 3 degrees Kelvin. Then two astronomers at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, had data for which they had no explanation: While trying to calibrate the Bell Labs' Crawford Hill antenna to study radio waves from the fringes of the Milky Way, they found they had a tiny background hiss which no amount of calibration would eliminate. They'd found the background cosmic radiation, echo of the Big Bang.That's one small step along the way, from Einstein to the discovery that most of our universe is invisible. As the back and forth played out between the theoretical physicists and the experimental and observational scientists, increasingly astronomers, each theoretical question drew forth an observation, a find, a discovery that answered that question, and raised another. The most startling of these was the discovery that visible, directly detectable matter is just over 4% of the total make-up of a universe far larger and more complex than ever suspected at the start of the 20th century. If what we see were all there were, the galaxies would not be, could not be, relatively compact, stable spirals (or their other shapes), but should be torn apart by the speed of their rotation. Outside, among, around, the visible matter of the galaxies was dark matter.Dark matter was soon joined by the even more mysterious dark energy.The largest part of Panek's book is devoted to the research to detect and identify dark matter and dark energy, He takes us through not only the science, fascinating enough in itself, but also the human drama as two teams, one primarily physicists and the other primarily astronomers, raced against each other to gather enough observations of sufficiently distant (and therefore ancient) supernovae to answer essential questions about the conditions of the early universe. In the answers to those questions, and questions about changes since that early time, would lie the answers to the reality of dark energy, dark matter, and maybe the ultimate fate of the universe.Highly recommended.This book is not yet published but can be pre-ordered from Amazon or Barnes & Noble.I received a free electronic galley of this book from the publisher via NetGalley."
38,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131838-alan,5,"First of all, I am not a physicist or a cosmologist, though I am a scientist (biologist). Even so, I found this book to be fascinating. If you are like me you have learned or at least heard something about recent changes in our understanding of the universe. For example, there was the refinement of Newton's explanation of gravity by Einstein through his theories of relativity (the description of space time), then there was the Big Bang model of the universe developed by Hubble when he applied Einstein's physics to the developing field of cosmology. Later on there was the discovery that stars at the edges of spiral galaxies were going WAY faster than they should have been going based on the calcualted mass of stars in those galaxies (this was Vera Rubin's work), and from that the need for a larger mass than observed led to the concept of Dark Matter. Then, later, not only the inflation of the universe, but an accelerating rate of expansion called for a force large enough to overcome the force of gravity that should have eventually caused the universe to expand and then collapse on itself, though recent observations show that this is not to be...the universe really is accelerating its rate of inflation...and the need for Dark Energy was born. These ideas of an inflating universe, a Big Bang + Dark Matter + Dark Energy increasing acceleration universe is a fascinating model of our universe. If you are like me, you may periodically wonder not only how such a universe works, but how in the world observations were made that led to these conclusions. THIS is what this book is about. The book starts with a brief introduction to the field of cosmology (the structure and fate of the universe) starting with Aristotle and Ptolemy's geocentric model. That model was then revised into the heliocentric model through the work of Copernicus and the observations of Galileo. Then Newton revised things with his universal law of gravitation, only to be modified yet again by Einstein's explanation of space-time fabric and Hubble's expanding Big Bang universe that is made of many galaxies. The bulk of the book, however, focuses on work done in the last 50 years or so, including work done since 2000 when large teams of collaborating scientists raced to try to describe the universe and demonstrate through theory and observation what it is really like. Fortunately for someone like me, Panek describes all of this without delving into the deep end of physics and cosmology...the math. Even so, if you decide to tackle this book you need to be prepared to keep track of a variety of acronyms and terms about cosmic backround microwaves, lambda, omega, and other terms scientists use to refer to the nature of the universe. And, not only do we get a nice overview of the science, but we get an interesting view of how modern cosmology and physics are done. Be prepared to read about issues in scientific ethics, jealousy, mind-bending breakthroughts, and discovery after discovery that led to our modern view of the universe and how it works. I found this book to be a tough, but good 5-star offering, though it's probably a 4 star offering for the non-scientist...it will take some serious effort to keep everything straight, and I don't think I can claim that myself. Still, this is a fascinating tale of discovery."
39,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20534403-sue-von-roedern,4,Fascinating and mostly understandable introduction to the fate of the universe. I want to be an astrophysicist when I grow up. I guess that will have to be in my next life.
40,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,4,"The 4% Universe - 4% science...96% stories.That is this book in a nutshell. If you are looking for a book on the science behind Dark Matter and Dark Energy, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for the stories about the astonomers behind the discovery of both Dark Matter and Dark Energy, definitely pick up this book.Panek gives a lively account of how the discovery of these two elusive subjects came about. I would say the first 1/3 of the book focuses on Dark Matter, with the rest heavily revolving around Dark Energy. At times the writing was a bit over the top for me, however this book is anything but boring and Panek clearly did his research. There are lots of astronomers/physicists to keep track of, and at times Panek introduced a new name without ever telling us about them. For the most part, the narrative is easy to follow despite the many names, and the science is easy to understand. I don't know that I have ever read shorter descriptions of science that so easily and clearly got their point across.We learn about Vera Rubin and her discovery that galaxies rotate at the same speed no matter the distance from the galactic center, the intersection of particle physics and astronomy (cosmology), and the search for the 2 main questions in cosmology: what is the value of the Hubble Constant and how much has the expansion rate changed over time. But the majority of the narrative focuses on the two competing teams who discovered that the universe isn't just expanding...it's accelerating; the Supernova Cosmology project headed by Saul Perlmutter at Berkely and the High-z team headed by Brian Schmidt.In the first chapter Panek brings up an interesting theme of astronomy. We as humans are constantly thinking we can't understand something, only to figure it out through science. Ptolemy believed we would never understand the heavens, but with the invention of the telescope came that understanding. Or more recently thinking we can never know how the universe began because we can't go back in time, yet with the discovery of the CMB we came to an understanding for that too. Currently, there are theorists and astronomers who believe we will never truly know the nature of dark matter and dark energy. I think if history tells us anything, we need only have some patience and wait for that understanding to come as well."
41,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,2,"Cosmology, the science of the origin, evolution and the ultimate fate of the Universe, is a surprisingly young scientific discipline. For the most of history cosmological questions were dealt with through a philosophical or theological inquiry, but in the early part of the twentieth century it became possible to inquire about these things in a more systematic and scientific manner. The research in Cosmology really gained steam since the 1960s, when the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) put the Big Bang Theory on a very firm footing. However, the subsequent inquiry revealed something really intellectually curious and potentially disturbing about the Universe: we can only see a very tiny fraction of it. The vast proportion of the “stuff” that makes up the Universe, about 96% of it to be more precise, is invisible. We can only infer its existence from the gravitational effects it has on the “visible” matter. This “invisible” stuff came to be known by a very prosaic couple of names: dark matter and dark energy. The aim of “The 4% Universe” is to explain our best current understanding of what the dark matter and the dark energy are. The book provides some good physics background to all of these phenomena, and tries to explain how the observation and the research into these topics have progressed over the last half a century or so. Unfortunately, this book goes way overboard in taking the inside look at the workings of the physicists and the astronomers who do research on dark matter and dark energy. It narrates, in painful details sometimes, the comings and goings of the select groups of scientists as they conduct their research, grapple with work-family balance, and engage in petty turf wars with their colleagues and other competing research collaborations. For the most of the book I found myself bored to death with these minutiae – and I am a scientist! Furthermore, I found the information on the actual science, and physics aspects of it in particular, incredibly thin. Reading the Wikipedia articles on this topic is way more informative. This is definitely not a book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the Universe and its dark secrets. "
42,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"This is an excellent book detailing the birth of cosmology and the search for the true nature of the universe. More of a history book than anything else, there's no better account of the Copernican legacy and the evolution of metaphysics into a true field of science.One of the most compelling aspects of the book is the fact that it's all so new that ideas become risky and technology becomes the limiting factor for what we can discover. And while not having the complete story is nagging, it's a torturous glimpse into the necessity to understand that plagues these very scientists.A big plus is that the book is very well written. For example, the author employs a nice stylistic hook at the beginning of every chapter; He describes a scene where the people and setting remain anonymous for a paragraph or so, letting the story slowly come into view. ""What's he talking about? Where are they? Oh, Antarctica? Awesome.""One aspect of the book that was a bit of a bummer was that it painted the race to discovery as more of a frantic, sometimes bitter competition rather than a series of exciting innovations. The idea that a scientific career often hangs in the balance is very clear — and perhaps I'm being naive — but that sort of doe-eyed wonder that humans get looking up at the stars seemed lost on the protagonists from time to time.As is often a complaint of mine when reading such a book, I would have liked to hear more about the details of the experiments and the meat of the theories. The author could have easily gone a little more in depth without losing lay persons, if that was the concern. Or how about an appendix for the more dedicated reader in the next addition, Panek?Though a little heavy on squabbling scientists and light on the actual physics, The 4-Percent Universe is an extremely thorough historical account of the current state of knowledge regarding the fate of our reality. I really enjoyed it."
43,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7078788-christine-leov-lealand,5,"There isn't a lot to say about dark matter and dark energy - since everything we know about these prevalent universal items is from inferences. No one seems to have found or measured either yet. So reading a long scientific book about these alleged 'dark' ie unknown things isn't going to convince many people that they exist.What IS convincing is Panek's social history of modern cosmology. How generations of scientists working around the planet both collaborating and competing with each other - as they still are - and yet independently coming to the SAME Conclusion!Two competing teams trying to prove each other's findings wrong and failing. Amusing and convincing to laypeople like myself.This book is not dry or boring like most science seems to like to be. The concept of our universe [that which we perceive] being the equivalent of the froth on the coffee of the rapidly expanding universe is HUGE and I recommend this book to any science fiction writers to include these findings in your new work. I would remind all scientists that science is far from scientific. The topics studied and researched depend very much upon the very personal and far from objective decisions of the individuals involved. Not to mention the choices of funding organisations and institutions and even the time available on the telescopes! No amount of pretentiousness can disguise these human subjective limitations to scientific processes and achievements. 'The 4% Universe' underlines for the reader the fact that personal choices, competition and rivalry have had more of an impact upon cosmological research and the results reported today, than any over-reaching humanitarian goal to benefit mankind with their 'objective' findings about the history of the universe. Nobel Prize anyone?"
44,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"There are several things Panek does well in this book: if you've seen, out of the corner of your eye, headlines about ""universe inflation"", ""dark matter"", ""dark energy"", he does a good job of explaining what those are (at least, the stuff that's known about these things; there are still a lot of unanswered questions, like ""what the heck is dark energy, anyway?"")Just as importantly, he explains how scientists know what they know: the observations and experiments that led them to their conclusions. And he also talks about the people behind the science, their motivations and emotions, their doubts and rivalries, their hopes and arguments. And in the process, he shows us something about the process by which science is done, something we the public don't get to see very often.Unfortunately, the cast of characters is rather large, and I couldn't keep them all straight, or remember who was on the Princeton and who was on the Berkeley team, or even how the two teams differed in their approach and social structure. Some sort of chart would have been helpful, or at least photos of the main players, but the book offered no such help; at least, my ebook edition didn't.The picture that emerges is one of a weirder universe than I imagined, where scientists are led to accept seemingly-preposterous ideas – like the idea of a type of matter other than our usual protons and neutrons; and that there is several times more of this stuff than of ordinary stuff – by the force of observation. Like it or not, that's where the data points."
45,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241853-erin,4,"I'm not done yet, but my initial impression is positive. The thing I like about this book so far is how Panek puts the various discoveries in perspective. As an example, I definitely understood the concept of supernovas, as well as the fact that they pulsate and also the concept of red/blue light refraction. However, the way that Panek succinctly describes how that constant enabled discoveries about the way galaxies revolve, well, I dare you to find another writer who could have gotten the whole story into fewer words. I could give example after example of that type of synopsis in this book.I suppose if you're a PHD in Astronomy, you might find this book a very dummied-down review of the science with a few interesting anecdotes about the personal lives of the scientists covered. However, Panek is able to put scientific concepts in layman's terms in a way that is very accessible for non-scientists. Secondly, he tells the history in an entertaining way that you don't get in most textbooks. So, for the people who are writing reviews that Panek is not a good writer - I think you're wrong. In our textbooks and classrooms we are so concerned with ensuring students memorize the facts and the math that we don't teach the historical context in which discoveries were made (particularly in the field of cosmology). That, in turn stifles creativity and inhibits students from seeing the ""big picture"". So, kudo's to Panek for being able to write about cosmology in a way the average person can relate to. I'm definitely enjoying this book so far..."
46,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,5,"The 4 Percent Universe is classic PBS-bait. I mean that as a good thing: it is the story of the High-Z Supernova Search Team that competed against the Supernova Cosmology Project in order to determine the answer to the question: What is the ultimate fate of the universe?Panek brings his own philosophy of science to the book: experiments are necessary to prove things. He isn't going to throw around theory like Kaku or Krauss or Greene. He has no desire to explain to us the latest permutation of quantum gibberish being thrown around in theoretical departments. He wants to give us the chronology from Newton to where we are now, and he does a wonderful job. Experiment by experiment he conveys to us the chronology of cosmology up to the present state:a universe that has an accelerating expansion drive by dark energy, and giant filament structures of galaxies bound by dark matter halos. My favorite part of the book was about the trials and tribulations of Vera Rubin, a lady born around the time my grandmother who nailed down the evidence that made dark matter an indisputable fact of reality. She continually gets crap in the male dominated field of astronomy, but never gave up her interest in understanding the universe.I would call this book ""a romp."" If you've been missing the NOVA of 2008, when Brian Greene helped start the cascade of science documentaries that would end up in the Cosmos flop and YouTube taking over as physics-knowledge-distributor, this book is for you.

47,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,3,"I did myself a disservice by listening to this audiobook while running. I usually choose lighter fare for that -- since I must also attend to my immediate environment (i.e., traffic!). Some days I didn't feel like concentrating too hard and would listen to Steve Earle songs instead. I am also one of those ""innumerate"" types, and even though there wasn't much math the numbers would cause me to zone-out and then have to re-focus. So I kept losing the narrative thread, over days and sometimes over a single hour.Panek chronicles a gradually-amassing story of discovery: early cosmological science, quantum theory, Einstein, the earliest astronomical telescopes (he's written another book on telescopes alone), Hubble, supernovas, Guth, inflation... It's told largely through biographies of physicists and astronomers and their research, collaborations, and rivalries. Panek takes a really long time to even get to dark matter and dark energy -- since appreciating what they represent means understanding what we thought we knew before. It's a story of questions -- and what happens (is happening now) when the answer is even bigger question mark. "
48,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15155099-jacob,4,"This is the book about people who thought, or perhaps only hoped, they were on the third book of a sci-fi trilogy. The facts of the super massive and the super tiny were known, there just remained the small task of connecting the two by means of bridge. Unfortunately the bridge was Escheresque in its construction and utterly riddled with wormholes. And so it came to pass that like the Italian plumbers before them their princess was in another castle, quite possibly another universe entirely. And so what was the thought to be the last book turned out to be the end of prequel, or more(?) charitably, the first in a sequence of books by an author maliciously set upon milking every quid and copper from the wallets of their readership.Maybe.It’s really much too soon to say. It could still be a trilogy, but I doubt it.This book tells a series of stories that leads us to the precipice of human knowledge regarding the cosmos. Written in the rather wide middle space between overly remedial and too academic, it is a book that contrasts the vastness of the cosmos with the tales of ego and error that inevitably suffuse the people who search its depths.

That alone as the premise of a book should be mind-blowing but Panek fails to capture the magic of this fact. He perfectly captures the facts of it, the history, the personalities, the triumphs, the rivalries, but none of wonder that should be embedded in a story about discovering how little of the universe we can see.The stories presented were fresh. I knew of Alan Guth's double boxed discovery of cosmic inflation, I knew of the history of supernova identification, and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation but these received short treatment as the author knew they'd be covered elsewhere. The race for better methods, the wars between methods, and the press gambits were new and dare I say exciting but again, there was nothing behind it. This is a book about the triumph of the experimentalist to elucidate a weird universe we don't get. If that's the entire point, good job, Panek but that rings hollow to me."
50,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,4,"Sometimes I get stuck on an author and compare everything else I read in that genre to that author. Such is the case with Michio Kaku. I read Parallel Universes when it first came out and was blown away. As I wrote in my review, most of the book was way over my head but somehow I got a feel and glimmer of understanding for even those parts of the book that were. Kaku has a genius that makes the almost incomprehensible concepts in physics sometimes seem simple and obvious. The 4 Percent Universe did not leave me feeling that way. I would not say that Panek was unclear in the 4 Percent Universe. Actually, I had the feel that it was more a flat lesson in the history of science. It was a book that just had fewer revelations for me. With Kaku there were just so many ""Ah Ha"" moments. Hopefully, without sounding too hokey, when reading Kaku, there were moments of what felt like transcendence, an altered state of consciousness. Pretty high bar to set huh? Yeah, I know. Sorry, Richard Panek. You were just fine... just not Michio Kaku. "
51,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8731895-r-j-gilbert,2,"This book does one thing well: it provides a good example of both inspired science and Grant Theory. The first half of the book features individuals whose contribution to science begins with a personal passion and are driven onward by inspiration. The last half of the book is a wonderful look into the battles for funding, for recognition (which brings funding), and the politics of collaboration that is so often found in the scientific fields being choked by the weeds of Grant Theory. You can see quite clearly where the players begin to veer from the search for truth onto the quest for funding.I'm not sure why, but the author chose to organize his chapters by projects and discoveries rather than chronological events. At one point, this caused a player to die in one chapter only to give a news interview in the next. Was that an argument for entanglement (another GT buzz-word)?Okay, I'm done ranting. Suffice it to say, this book further shows me that science will only be advanced by those willing to follow the truth and not the path that funding tells them to follow."
52,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060228-michelle,2,"I listened to the 9 cd audio version of this book. Probably would have been better to read rather than listen to since the narrative tried to include a mention of almost every scientific discovery relating to dark matter and dark energy starting in 1964, but not in chronological order, and the mixture of acronyms and unfamiliar names of people and scientific terms made it difficult to follow. The author focused a great deal on the politics and egos involved in the discoveries rather than the science. That may appeal to a broader readership, but I was looking for more science. If you find the process and personalities of scientific research interesting and enjoy physics, this is probably a good way to get a glimpse inside extremely recent and potentially revolutionary developments that connect physics on the largest scales in astronomy with the smallest scales in particle physics. If you're looking for a careful explanation of the science, you will need to look elsewhere."

The other 96% is dark energy or dark matter. Isn’t that crazy! This book tells the story of the discoveries that led up to this amazing factoid. While some of the book contains technical jargon and facts that went right over my head, most of it tells the sometimes melodramatic story of scientists rushing to discover if the universe is expanding, contracting, or stable. Turns out that scientists can be petty, dramatic, and mean, but despite these human traits they still discovered amazing things. I enjoyed learning that even really smart people can be catty, and found the discoveries fascinating. Most astounding is that despite everything we do know, there is still so much more to learn!

These stories show the individuals who worked at science, and gives a sense of their humanity and personal struggles. It also depicts the struggle to discover and to accept a new and powerful understanding that the entire universe and all the stars and galaxies that we can see towards all infinity, all the stars that anyone has ever seen, is in reality a tiny, tiny fraction of all the matter and energy that inhabits the universe.The reviewing of these stories, to me, becomes a bit of mythology, like a hall of heroes"

These physicist have egos for sure. Both teams came to this same conclusion almost at the same time (Jan 1998)based on two entirely different data sets. Only 4% of the universe consists of atoms which emit energy so we can see them. 26% is dark matter (has mass but doesn't emit any energy so we can't see it). The rest is dark energy."

But the answers that they hope to find will change the way we look at the universe forever!

While I really enjoyed the seismic idea movement in my understanding of the cosmos, I found that my understanding of the science was not great once I sat down with someone who is actually in the field. This could be, and probably is, a fault of my own, a lack of scientific background on which to hang these still exploratory concepts, but it also belies the danger behind popular scientific texts. Simplification of concepts sometimes obscures the data unintentionally. "

67,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This a highly readable history of the transformation of cosmology from metaphysics to physics, from philosophy and speculation to hard science, and in the process, the discovery of most of the universe.Historically, astronomy and physics didn't have a great deal to do with each other. Astronomers studied the stars by observation, very patient and detailed observation and record-keeping. Theoretical physicists theorized and calculated, and experimental physicists experimented, and they fed each other's work, very occasionally coming up with something, most notably gravity, that made a real difference to astronomy. Then Einstein gave us general relativity, and began a century of ever-deeper entanglement of physics and astronomy, and the transformation of cosmology--the study of the nature and origins of the entire universe--from something utterly beyond the scope of physics into its core. The questions of how big the universe is, whether it is eternal in space and time or had a beginning and might have an end, became real questions.Edwin Hubble, early in the century, discovered that the universe is expanding, but also that there are other galaxies beyond our own, and that they're all moving away from us. This was a major, exciting, and initially controversial change in our conception of the universe. In the 1960s, Vera Rubin, looking for a research project she could do within the constraints of raising two young children, studied other astronomers' observations and discovered that the galaxies were rotating as well as moving away from us. Also in the mid-1960s, Robert Dicke, Jim Peebles, and a small group of theoretical physicists had a prediction for which they had no supporting data: If the Big Bang theory of the history of the universe were correct, there should be low-level cosmic microwave radiation, at a temperature of about 3 degrees Kelvin. Then two astronomers at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, had data for which they had no explanation: While trying to calibrate the Bell Labs' Crawford Hill antenna to study radio waves from the fringes of the Milky Way, they found they had a tiny background hiss which no amount of calibration would eliminate. They'd found the background cosmic radiation, echo of the Big Bang.That's one small step along the way, from Einstein to the discovery that most of our universe is invisible. As the back and forth played out between the theoretical physicists and the experimental and observational scientists, increasingly astronomers, each theoretical question drew forth an observation, a find, a discovery that answered that question, and raised another. The most startling of these was the discovery that visible, directly detectable matter is just over 4% of the total make-up of a universe far larger and more complex than ever suspected at the start of the 20th century. If what we see were all there were, the galaxies would not be, could not be, relatively compact, stable spirals (or their other shapes), but should be torn apart by the speed of their rotation. Outside, among, around, the visible matter of the galaxies was dark matter.Dark matter was soon joined by the even more mysterious dark energy.The largest part of Panek's book is devoted to the research to detect and identify dark matter and dark energy, He takes us through not only the science, fascinating enough in itself, but also the human drama as two teams, one primarily physicists and the other primarily astronomers, raced against each other to gather enough observations of sufficiently distant (and therefore ancient) supernovae to answer essential questions about the conditions of the early universe. In the answers to those questions, and questions about changes since that early time, would lie the answers to the reality of dark energy, dark matter, and maybe the ultimate fate of the universe.Highly recommended.This book is not yet published but can be pre-ordered from Amazon or Barnes & Noble.I received a free electronic galley of this book from the publisher via NetGalley."
68,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131838-alan,5,"First of all, I am not a physicist or a cosmologist, though I am a scientist (biologist). Even so, I found this book to be fascinating. If you are like me you have learned or at least heard something about recent changes in our understanding of the universe. For example, there was the refinement of Newton's explanation of gravity by Einstein through his theories of relativity (the description of space time), then there was the Big Bang model of the universe developed by Hubble when he applied Einstein's physics to the developing field of cosmology. Later on there was the discovery that stars at the edges of spiral galaxies were going WAY faster than they should have been going based on the calcualted mass of stars in those galaxies (this was Vera Rubin's work), and from that the need for a larger mass than observed led to the concept of Dark Matter. Then, later, not only the inflation of the universe, but an accelerating rate of expansion called for a force large enough to overcome the force of gravity that should have eventually caused the universe to expand and then collapse on itself, though recent observations show that this is not to be...the universe really is accelerating its rate of inflation...and the need for Dark Energy was born. These ideas of an inflating universe, a Big Bang + Dark Matter + Dark Energy increasing acceleration universe is a fascinating model of our universe. If you are like me, you may periodically wonder not only how such a universe works, but how in the world observations were made that led to these conclusions. THIS is what this book is about. The book starts with a brief introduction to the field of cosmology (the structure and fate of the universe) starting with Aristotle and Ptolemy's geocentric model. That model was then revised into the heliocentric model through the work of Copernicus and the observations of Galileo. Then Newton revised things with his universal law of gravitation, only to be modified yet again by Einstein's explanation of space-time fabric and Hubble's expanding Big Bang universe that is made of many galaxies. The bulk of the book, however, focuses on work done in the last 50 years or so, including work done since 2000 when large teams of collaborating scientists raced to try to describe the universe and demonstrate through theory and observation what it is really like. Fortunately for someone like me, Panek describes all of this without delving into the deep end of physics and cosmology...the math. Even so, if you decide to tackle this book you need to be prepared to keep track of a variety of acronyms and terms about cosmic backround microwaves, lambda, omega, and other terms scientists use to refer to the nature of the universe. And, not only do we get a nice overview of the science, but we get an interesting view of how modern cosmology and physics are done. Be prepared to read about issues in scientific ethics, jealousy, mind-bending breakthroughts, and discovery after discovery that led to our modern view of the universe and how it works. I found this book to be a tough, but good 5-star offering, though it's probably a 4 star offering for the non-scientist...it will take some serious effort to keep everything straight, and I don't think I can claim that myself. Still, this is a fascinating tale of discovery."

70,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,4,"The 4% Universe - 4% science...96% stories.That is this book in a nutshell. If you are looking for a book on the science behind Dark Matter and Dark Energy, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for the stories about the astonomers behind the discovery of both Dark Matter and Dark Energy, definitely pick up this book.Panek gives a lively account of how the discovery of these two elusive subjects came about. I would say the first 1/3 of the book focuses on Dark Matter, with the rest heavily revolving around Dark Energy. At times the writing was a bit over the top for me, however this book is anything but boring and Panek clearly did his research. There are lots of astronomers/physicists to keep track of, and at times Panek introduced a new name without ever telling us about them. For the most part, the narrative is easy to follow despite the many names, and the science is easy to understand. I don't know that I have ever read shorter descriptions of science that so easily and clearly got their point across.We learn about Vera Rubin and her discovery that galaxies rotate at the same speed no matter the distance from the galactic center, the intersection of particle physics and astronomy (cosmology), and the search for the 2 main questions in cosmology: what is the value of the Hubble Constant and how much has the expansion rate changed over time. But the majority of the narrative focuses on the two competing teams who discovered that the universe isn't just expanding...it's accelerating; the Supernova Cosmology project headed by Saul Perlmutter at Berkely and the High-z team headed by Brian Schmidt.In the first chapter Panek brings up an interesting theme of astronomy. We as humans are constantly thinking we can't understand something, only to figure it out through science. Ptolemy believed we would never understand the heavens, but with the invention of the telescope came that understanding. Or more recently thinking we can never know how the universe began because we can't go back in time, yet with the discovery of the CMB we came to an understanding for that too. Currently, there are theorists and astronomers who believe we will never truly know the nature of dark matter and dark energy. I think if history tells us anything, we need only have some patience and wait for that understanding to come as well."
71,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,2,"Cosmology, the science of the origin, evolution and the ultimate fate of the Universe, is a surprisingly young scientific discipline. For the most of history cosmological questions were dealt with through a philosophical or theological inquiry, but in the early part of the twentieth century it became possible to inquire about these things in a more systematic and scientific manner. The research in Cosmology really gained steam since the 1960s, when the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) put the Big Bang Theory on a very firm footing. However, the subsequent inquiry revealed something really intellectually curious and potentially disturbing about the Universe: we can only see a very tiny fraction of it. The vast proportion of the “stuff” that makes up the Universe, about 96% of it to be more precise, is invisible. We can only infer its existence from the gravitational effects it has on the “visible” matter. This “invisible” stuff came to be known by a very prosaic couple of names: dark matter and dark energy. The aim of “The 4% Universe” is to explain our best current understanding of what the dark matter and the dark energy are. The book provides some good physics background to all of these phenomena, and tries to explain how the observation and the research into these topics have progressed over the last half a century or so. Unfortunately, this book goes way overboard in taking the inside look at the workings of the physicists and the astronomers who do research on dark matter and dark energy. It narrates, in painful details sometimes, the comings and goings of the select groups of scientists as they conduct their research, grapple with work-family balance, and engage in petty turf wars with their colleagues and other competing research collaborations. For the most of the book I found myself bored to death with these minutiae – and I am a scientist! Furthermore, I found the information on the actual science, and physics aspects of it in particular, incredibly thin. Reading the Wikipedia articles on this topic is way more informative. This is definitely not a book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the Universe and its dark secrets. "
72,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"This is an excellent book detailing the birth of cosmology and the search for the true nature of the universe. More of a history book than anything else, there's no better account of the Copernican legacy and the evolution of metaphysics into a true field of science.One of the most compelling aspects of the book is the fact that it's all so new that ideas become risky and technology becomes the limiting factor for what we can discover. And while not having the complete story is nagging, it's a torturous glimpse into the necessity to understand that plagues these very scientists.A big plus is that the book is very well written. For example, the author employs a nice stylistic hook at the beginning of every chapter; He describes a scene where the people and setting remain anonymous for a paragraph or so, letting the story slowly come into view. ""What's he talking about? Where are they? Oh, Antarctica? Awesome.""One aspect of the book that was a bit of a bummer was that it painted the race to discovery as more of a frantic, sometimes bitter competition rather than a series of exciting innovations. The idea that a scientific career often hangs in the balance is very clear — and perhaps I'm being naive — but that sort of doe-eyed wonder that humans get looking up at the stars seemed lost on the protagonists from time to time.As is often a complaint of mine when reading such a book, I would have liked to hear more about the details of the experiments and the meat of the theories. The author could have easily gone a little more in depth without losing lay persons, if that was the concern. Or how about an appendix for the more dedicated reader in the next addition, Panek?Though a little heavy on squabbling scientists and light on the actual physics, The 4-Percent Universe is an extremely thorough historical account of the current state of knowledge regarding the fate of our reality. I really enjoyed it."
73,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7078788-christine-leov-lealand,5,"There isn't a lot to say about dark matter and dark energy - since everything we know about these prevalent universal items is from inferences. No one seems to have found or measured either yet. So reading a long scientific book about these alleged 'dark' ie unknown things isn't going to convince many people that they exist.What IS convincing is Panek's social history of modern cosmology. How generations of scientists working around the planet both collaborating and competing with each other - as they still are - and yet independently coming to the SAME Conclusion!Two competing teams trying to prove each other's findings wrong and failing. Amusing and convincing to laypeople like myself.This book is not dry or boring like most science seems to like to be. The concept of our universe [that which we perceive] being the equivalent of the froth on the coffee of the rapidly expanding universe is HUGE and I recommend this book to any science fiction writers to include these findings in your new work. I would remind all scientists that science is far from scientific. The topics studied and researched depend very much upon the very personal and far from objective decisions of the individuals involved. Not to mention the choices of funding organisations and institutions and even the time available on the telescopes! No amount of pretentiousness can disguise these human subjective limitations to scientific processes and achievements. 'The 4% Universe' underlines for the reader the fact that personal choices, competition and rivalry have had more of an impact upon cosmological research and the results reported today, than any over-reaching humanitarian goal to benefit mankind with their 'objective' findings about the history of the universe. Nobel Prize anyone?"
74,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"There are several things Panek does well in this book: if you've seen, out of the corner of your eye, headlines about ""universe inflation"", ""dark matter"", ""dark energy"", he does a good job of explaining what those are (at least, the stuff that's known about these things; there are still a lot of unanswered questions, like ""what the heck is dark energy, anyway?"")Just as importantly, he explains how scientists know what they know: the observations and experiments that led them to their conclusions. And he also talks about the people behind the science, their motivations and emotions, their doubts and rivalries, their hopes and arguments. And in the process, he shows us something about the process by which science is done, something we the public don't get to see very often.Unfortunately, the cast of characters is rather large, and I couldn't keep them all straight, or remember who was on the Princeton and who was on the Berkeley team, or even how the two teams differed in their approach and social structure. Some sort of chart would have been helpful, or at least photos of the main players, but the book offered no such help; at least, my ebook edition didn't.The picture that emerges is one of a weirder universe than I imagined, where scientists are led to accept seemingly-preposterous ideas – like the idea of a type of matter other than our usual protons and neutrons; and that there is several times more of this stuff than of ordinary stuff – by the force of observation. Like it or not, that's where the data points."
75,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241853-erin,4,"I'm not done yet, but my initial impression is positive. The thing I like about this book so far is how Panek puts the various discoveries in perspective. As an example, I definitely understood the concept of supernovas, as well as the fact that they pulsate and also the concept of red/blue light refraction. However, the way that Panek succinctly describes how that constant enabled discoveries about the way galaxies revolve, well, I dare you to find another writer who could have gotten the whole story into fewer words. I could give example after example of that type of synopsis in this book.I suppose if you're a PHD in Astronomy, you might find this book a very dummied-down review of the science with a few interesting anecdotes about the personal lives of the scientists covered. However, Panek is able to put scientific concepts in layman's terms in a way that is very accessible for non-scientists. Secondly, he tells the history in an entertaining way that you don't get in most textbooks. So, for the people who are writing reviews that Panek is not a good writer - I think you're wrong. In our textbooks and classrooms we are so concerned with ensuring students memorize the facts and the math that we don't teach the historical context in which discoveries were made (particularly in the field of cosmology). That, in turn stifles creativity and inhibits students from seeing the ""big picture"". So, kudo's to Panek for being able to write about cosmology in a way the average person can relate to. I'm definitely enjoying this book so far..."
76,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,5,"The 4 Percent Universe is classic PBS-bait. I mean that as a good thing: it is the story of the High-Z Supernova Search Team that competed against the Supernova Cosmology Project in order to determine the answer to the question: What is the ultimate fate of the universe?Panek brings his own philosophy of science to the book: experiments are necessary to prove things. He isn't going to throw around theory like Kaku or Krauss or Greene. He has no desire to explain to us the latest permutation of quantum gibberish being thrown around in theoretical departments. He wants to give us the chronology from Newton to where we are now, and he does a wonderful job. Experiment by experiment he conveys to us the chronology of cosmology up to the present state:a universe that has an accelerating expansion drive by dark energy, and giant filament structures of galaxies bound by dark matter halos. My favorite part of the book was about the trials and tribulations of Vera Rubin, a lady born around the time my grandmother who nailed down the evidence that made dark matter an indisputable fact of reality. She continually gets crap in the male dominated field of astronomy, but never gave up her interest in understanding the universe.I would call this book ""a romp."" If you've been missing the NOVA of 2008, when Brian Greene helped start the cascade of science documentaries that would end up in the Cosmos flop and YouTube taking over as physics-knowledge-distributor, this book is for you.

77,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,3,"I did myself a disservice by listening to this audiobook while running. I usually choose lighter fare for that -- since I must also attend to my immediate environment (i.e., traffic!). Some days I didn't feel like concentrating too hard and would listen to Steve Earle songs instead. I am also one of those ""innumerate"" types, and even though there wasn't much math the numbers would cause me to zone-out and then have to re-focus. So I kept losing the narrative thread, over days and sometimes over a single hour.Panek chronicles a gradually-amassing story of discovery: early cosmological science, quantum theory, Einstein, the earliest astronomical telescopes (he's written another book on telescopes alone), Hubble, supernovas, Guth, inflation... It's told largely through biographies of physicists and astronomers and their research, collaborations, and rivalries. Panek takes a really long time to even get to dark matter and dark energy -- since appreciating what they represent means understanding what we thought we knew before. It's a story of questions -- and what happens (is happening now) when the answer is even bigger question mark. "
78,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15155099-jacob,4,"This is the book about people who thought, or perhaps only hoped, they were on the third book of a sci-fi trilogy. The facts of the super massive and the super tiny were known, there just remained the small task of connecting the two by means of bridge. Unfortunately the bridge was Escheresque in its construction and utterly riddled with wormholes. And so it came to pass that like the Italian plumbers before them their princess was in another castle, quite possibly another universe entirely. And so what was the thought to be the last book turned out to be the end of prequel, or more(?) charitably, the first in a sequence of books by an author maliciously set upon milking every quid and copper from the wallets of their readership.Maybe.It’s really much too soon to say. It could still be a trilogy, but I doubt it.This book tells a series of stories that leads us to the precipice of human knowledge regarding the cosmos. Written in the rather wide middle space between overly remedial and too academic, it is a book that contrasts the vastness of the cosmos with the tales of ego and error that inevitably suffuse the people who search its depths.

79,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,2,"We can only see (EM spectrum) about 1/25th of the mass in the known universe. That alone as the premise of a book should be mind-blowing but Panek fails to capture the magic of this fact. He perfectly captures the facts of it, the history, the personalities, the triumphs, the rivalries, but none of wonder that should be embedded in a story about discovering how little of the universe we can see.The stories presented were fresh. I knew of Alan Guth's double boxed discovery of cosmic inflation, I knew of the history of supernova identification, and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation but these received short treatment as the author knew they'd be covered elsewhere. The race for better methods, the wars between methods, and the press gambits were new and dare I say exciting but again, there was nothing behind it. This is a book about the triumph of the experimentalist to elucidate a weird universe we don't get. If that's the entire point, good job, Panek but that rings hollow to me."
80,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,4,"Sometimes I get stuck on an author and compare everything else I read in that genre to that author. Such is the case with Michio Kaku. I read Parallel Universes when it first came out and was blown away. As I wrote in my review, most of the book was way over my head but somehow I got a feel and glimmer of understanding for even those parts of the book that were. Kaku has a genius that makes the almost incomprehensible concepts in physics sometimes seem simple and obvious. The 4 Percent Universe did not leave me feeling that way. I would not say that Panek was unclear in the 4 Percent Universe. Actually, I had the feel that it was more a flat lesson in the history of science. It was a book that just had fewer revelations for me. With Kaku there were just so many ""Ah Ha"" moments. Hopefully, without sounding too hokey, when reading Kaku, there were moments of what felt like transcendence, an altered state of consciousness. Pretty high bar to set huh? Yeah, I know. Sorry, Richard Panek. You were just fine... just not Michio Kaku. "
81,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8731895-r-j-gilbert,2,"This book does one thing well: it provides a good example of both inspired science and Grant Theory. The first half of the book features individuals whose contribution to science begins with a personal passion and are driven onward by inspiration. The last half of the book is a wonderful look into the battles for funding, for recognition (which brings funding), and the politics of collaboration that is so often found in the scientific fields being choked by the weeds of Grant Theory. You can see quite clearly where the players begin to veer from the search for truth onto the quest for funding.I'm not sure why, but the author chose to organize his chapters by projects and discoveries rather than chronological events. At one point, this caused a player to die in one chapter only to give a news interview in the next. Was that an argument for entanglement (another GT buzz-word)?Okay, I'm done ranting. Suffice it to say, this book further shows me that science will only be advanced by those willing to follow the truth and not the path that funding tells them to follow."
82,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060228-michelle,2,"I listened to the 9 cd audio version of this book. Probably would have been better to read rather than listen to since the narrative tried to include a mention of almost every scientific discovery relating to dark matter and dark energy starting in 1964, but not in chronological order, and the mixture of acronyms and unfamiliar names of people and scientific terms made it difficult to follow. The author focused a great deal on the politics and egos involved in the discoveries rather than the science. That may appeal to a broader readership, but I was looking for more science. If you find the process and personalities of scientific research interesting and enjoy physics, this is probably a good way to get a glimpse inside extremely recent and potentially revolutionary developments that connect physics on the largest scales in astronomy with the smallest scales in particle physics. If you're looking for a careful explanation of the science, you will need to look elsewhere."

The other 96% is dark energy or dark matter. Isn’t that crazy! This book tells the story of the discoveries that led up to this amazing factoid. While some of the book contains technical jargon and facts that went right over my head, most of it tells the sometimes melodramatic story of scientists rushing to discover if the universe is expanding, contracting, or stable. Turns out that scientists can be petty, dramatic, and mean, but despite these human traits they still discovered amazing things. I enjoyed learning that even really smart people can be catty, and found the discoveries fascinating. Most astounding is that despite everything we do know, there is still so much more to learn!

Unlike some of the quantum mechanics stuff, I had a harder time following the science so I had to do some translating as I tried following along (why are they trying to find what now?). It could be my concentration simply wasn't as focused as during other simliar books.I loved the descriptions of the differences between the astronomers and the physicists in personality and politics.

These stories show the individuals who worked at science, and gives a sense of their humanity and personal struggles. It also depicts the struggle to discover and to accept a new and powerful understanding that the entire universe and all the stars and galaxies that we can see towards all infinity, all the stars that anyone has ever seen, is in reality a tiny, tiny fraction of all the matter and energy that inhabits the universe.The reviewing of these stories, to me, becomes a bit of mythology, like a hall of heroes"

The most interesting part of the story deals with two research teams (one at MIT and one at Berkeley) who are competing to see if Super Nova can be used a light references to determine how old the universe is and confirm that the universe is still expanding and will continue to expand forever (so the current theory goes). These physicist have egos for sure. Both teams came to this same conclusion almost at the same time (Jan 1998)based on two entirely different data sets. Only 4% of the universe consists of atoms which emit energy so we can see them. 26% is dark matter (has mass but doesn't emit any energy so we can't see it). The rest is dark energy."

Modern cosmology has two groups of scientist working (the astronomers and the physicists) to solve this puzzle. Both are very different in how they work and how they think. But the answers that they hope to find will change the way we look at the universe forever!

His style and approach reminded me a lot of Dennis Overbye's The Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, which chronicled the developments in physical and theoretical astronomy up through the 1980s.

95,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90743-gala,3,"I read this book as a way to get my mind around the idea of dark matter before being paired with a dark matter researcher for an artist/scientist collaborative exhibition. While I really enjoyed the seismic idea movement in my understanding of the cosmos, I found that my understanding of the science was not great once I sat down with someone who is actually in the field. This could be, and probably is, a fault of my own, a lack of scientific background on which to hang these still exploratory concepts, but it also belies the danger behind popular scientific texts. Simplification of concepts sometimes obscures the data unintentionally. "

97,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This a highly readable history of the transformation of cosmology from metaphysics to physics, from philosophy and speculation to hard science, and in the process, the discovery of most of the universe.Historically, astronomy and physics didn't have a great deal to do with each other. Astronomers studied the stars by observation, very patient and detailed observation and record-keeping. Theoretical physicists theorized and calculated, and experimental physicists experimented, and they fed each other's work, very occasionally coming up with something, most notably gravity, that made a real difference to astronomy. Then Einstein gave us general relativity, and began a century of ever-deeper entanglement of physics and astronomy, and the transformation of cosmology--the study of the nature and origins of the entire universe--from something utterly beyond the scope of physics into its core. The questions of how big the universe is, whether it is eternal in space and time or had a beginning and might have an end, became real questions.Edwin Hubble, early in the century, discovered that the universe is expanding, but also that there are other galaxies beyond our own, and that they're all moving away from us. This was a major, exciting, and initially controversial change in our conception of the universe. In the 1960s, Vera Rubin, looking for a research project she could do within the constraints of raising two young children, studied other astronomers' observations and discovered that the galaxies were rotating as well as moving away from us. Also in the mid-1960s, Robert Dicke, Jim Peebles, and a small group of theoretical physicists had a prediction for which they had no supporting data: If the Big Bang theory of the history of the universe were correct, there should be low-level cosmic microwave radiation, at a temperature of about 3 degrees Kelvin. Then two astronomers at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, had data for which they had no explanation: While trying to calibrate the Bell Labs' Crawford Hill antenna to study radio waves from the fringes of the Milky Way, they found they had a tiny background hiss which no amount of calibration would eliminate. They'd found the background cosmic radiation, echo of the Big Bang.That's one small step along the way, from Einstein to the discovery that most of our universe is invisible. As the back and forth played out between the theoretical physicists and the experimental and observational scientists, increasingly astronomers, each theoretical question drew forth an observation, a find, a discovery that answered that question, and raised another. The most startling of these was the discovery that visible, directly detectable matter is just over 4% of the total make-up of a universe far larger and more complex than ever suspected at the start of the 20th century. If what we see were all there were, the galaxies would not be, could not be, relatively compact, stable spirals (or their other shapes), but should be torn apart by the speed of their rotation. Outside, among, around, the visible matter of the galaxies was dark matter.Dark matter was soon joined by the even more mysterious dark energy.The largest part of Panek's book is devoted to the research to detect and identify dark matter and dark energy, He takes us through not only the science, fascinating enough in itself, but also the human drama as two teams, one primarily physicists and the other primarily astronomers, raced against each other to gather enough observations of sufficiently distant (and therefore ancient) supernovae to answer essential questions about the conditions of the early universe. In the answers to those questions, and questions about changes since that early time, would lie the answers to the reality of dark energy, dark matter, and maybe the ultimate fate of the universe.Highly recommended.This book is not yet published but can be pre-ordered from Amazon or Barnes & Noble.I received a free electronic galley of this book from the publisher via NetGalley."
98,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131838-alan,5,"First of all, I am not a physicist or a cosmologist, though I am a scientist (biologist). Even so, I found this book to be fascinating. If you are like me you have learned or at least heard something about recent changes in our understanding of the universe. For example, there was the refinement of Newton's explanation of gravity by Einstein through his theories of relativity (the description of space time), then there was the Big Bang model of the universe developed by Hubble when he applied Einstein's physics to the developing field of cosmology. Later on there was the discovery that stars at the edges of spiral galaxies were going WAY faster than they should have been going based on the calcualted mass of stars in those galaxies (this was Vera Rubin's work), and from that the need for a larger mass than observed led to the concept of Dark Matter. Then, later, not only the inflation of the universe, but an accelerating rate of expansion called for a force large enough to overcome the force of gravity that should have eventually caused the universe to expand and then collapse on itself, though recent observations show that this is not to be...the universe really is accelerating its rate of inflation...and the need for Dark Energy was born. These ideas of an inflating universe, a Big Bang + Dark Matter + Dark Energy increasing acceleration universe is a fascinating model of our universe. If you are like me, you may periodically wonder not only how such a universe works, but how in the world observations were made that led to these conclusions. THIS is what this book is about. The book starts with a brief introduction to the field of cosmology (the structure and fate of the universe) starting with Aristotle and Ptolemy's geocentric model. That model was then revised into the heliocentric model through the work of Copernicus and the observations of Galileo. Then Newton revised things with his universal law of gravitation, only to be modified yet again by Einstein's explanation of space-time fabric and Hubble's expanding Big Bang universe that is made of many galaxies. The bulk of the book, however, focuses on work done in the last 50 years or so, including work done since 2000 when large teams of collaborating scientists raced to try to describe the universe and demonstrate through theory and observation what it is really like. Fortunately for someone like me, Panek describes all of this without delving into the deep end of physics and cosmology...the math. Even so, if you decide to tackle this book you need to be prepared to keep track of a variety of acronyms and terms about cosmic backround microwaves, lambda, omega, and other terms scientists use to refer to the nature of the universe. And, not only do we get a nice overview of the science, but we get an interesting view of how modern cosmology and physics are done. Be prepared to read about issues in scientific ethics, jealousy, mind-bending breakthroughts, and discovery after discovery that led to our modern view of the universe and how it works. I found this book to be a tough, but good 5-star offering, though it's probably a 4 star offering for the non-scientist...it will take some serious effort to keep everything straight, and I don't think I can claim that myself. Still, this is a fascinating tale of discovery."
99,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20534403-sue-von-roedern,4,Fascinating and mostly understandable introduction to the fate of the universe. I want to be an astrophysicist when I grow up. I guess that will have to be in my next life.
100,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,4,"The 4% Universe - 4% science...96% stories.That is this book in a nutshell. If you are looking for a book on the science behind Dark Matter and Dark Energy, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for the stories about the astonomers behind the discovery of both Dark Matter and Dark Energy, definitely pick up this book.Panek gives a lively account of how the discovery of these two elusive subjects came about. I would say the first 1/3 of the book focuses on Dark Matter, with the rest heavily revolving around Dark Energy. At times the writing was a bit over the top for me, however this book is anything but boring and Panek clearly did his research. There are lots of astronomers/physicists to keep track of, and at times Panek introduced a new name without ever telling us about them. For the most part, the narrative is easy to follow despite the many names, and the science is easy to understand. I don't know that I have ever read shorter descriptions of science that so easily and clearly got their point across.We learn about Vera Rubin and her discovery that galaxies rotate at the same speed no matter the distance from the galactic center, the intersection of particle physics and astronomy (cosmology), and the search for the 2 main questions in cosmology: what is the value of the Hubble Constant and how much has the expansion rate changed over time. But the majority of the narrative focuses on the two competing teams who discovered that the universe isn't just expanding...it's accelerating; the Supernova Cosmology project headed by Saul Perlmutter at Berkely and the High-z team headed by Brian Schmidt.In the first chapter Panek brings up an interesting theme of astronomy. We as humans are constantly thinking we can't understand something, only to figure it out through science. Ptolemy believed we would never understand the heavens, but with the invention of the telescope came that understanding. Or more recently thinking we can never know how the universe began because we can't go back in time, yet with the discovery of the CMB we came to an understanding for that too. Currently, there are theorists and astronomers who believe we will never truly know the nature of dark matter and dark energy. I think if history tells us anything, we need only have some patience and wait for that understanding to come as well."
101,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,2,"Cosmology, the science of the origin, evolution and the ultimate fate of the Universe, is a surprisingly young scientific discipline. For the most of history cosmological questions were dealt with through a philosophical or theological inquiry, but in the early part of the twentieth century it became possible to inquire about these things in a more systematic and scientific manner. The research in Cosmology really gained steam since the 1960s, when the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) put the Big Bang Theory on a very firm footing. However, the subsequent inquiry revealed something really intellectually curious and potentially disturbing about the Universe: we can only see a very tiny fraction of it. The vast proportion of the “stuff” that makes up the Universe, about 96% of it to be more precise, is invisible. We can only infer its existence from the gravitational effects it has on the “visible” matter. This “invisible” stuff came to be known by a very prosaic couple of names: dark matter and dark energy. The aim of “The 4% Universe” is to explain our best current understanding of what the dark matter and the dark energy are. The book provides some good physics background to all of these phenomena, and tries to explain how the observation and the research into these topics have progressed over the last half a century or so. Unfortunately, this book goes way overboard in taking the inside look at the workings of the physicists and the astronomers who do research on dark matter and dark energy. It narrates, in painful details sometimes, the comings and goings of the select groups of scientists as they conduct their research, grapple with work-family balance, and engage in petty turf wars with their colleagues and other competing research collaborations. For the most of the book I found myself bored to death with these minutiae – and I am a scientist! Furthermore, I found the information on the actual science, and physics aspects of it in particular, incredibly thin. Reading the Wikipedia articles on this topic is way more informative. This is definitely not a book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the Universe and its dark secrets. "
102,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"This is an excellent book detailing the birth of cosmology and the search for the true nature of the universe. More of a history book than anything else, there's no better account of the Copernican legacy and the evolution of metaphysics into a true field of science.One of the most compelling aspects of the book is the fact that it's all so new that ideas become risky and technology becomes the limiting factor for what we can discover. And while not having the complete story is nagging, it's a torturous glimpse into the necessity to understand that plagues these very scientists.A big plus is that the book is very well written. For example, the author employs a nice stylistic hook at the beginning of every chapter; He describes a scene where the people and setting remain anonymous for a paragraph or so, letting the story slowly come into view. ""What's he talking about? Where are they? Oh, Antarctica? Awesome.""One aspect of the book that was a bit of a bummer was that it painted the race to discovery as more of a frantic, sometimes bitter competition rather than a series of exciting innovations. The idea that a scientific career often hangs in the balance is very clear — and perhaps I'm being naive — but that sort of doe-eyed wonder that humans get looking up at the stars seemed lost on the protagonists from time to time.As is often a complaint of mine when reading such a book, I would have liked to hear more about the details of the experiments and the meat of the theories. The author could have easily gone a little more in depth without losing lay persons, if that was the concern. Or how about an appendix for the more dedicated reader in the next addition, Panek?Though a little heavy on squabbling scientists and light on the actual physics, The 4-Percent Universe is an extremely thorough historical account of the current state of knowledge regarding the fate of our reality. I really enjoyed it."
103,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7078788-christine-leov-lealand,5,"There isn't a lot to say about dark matter and dark energy - since everything we know about these prevalent universal items is from inferences. No one seems to have found or measured either yet. So reading a long scientific book about these alleged 'dark' ie unknown things isn't going to convince many people that they exist.What IS convincing is Panek's social history of modern cosmology. How generations of scientists working around the planet both collaborating and competing with each other - as they still are - and yet independently coming to the SAME Conclusion!Two competing teams trying to prove each other's findings wrong and failing. Amusing and convincing to laypeople like myself.This book is not dry or boring like most science seems to like to be. The concept of our universe [that which we perceive] being the equivalent of the froth on the coffee of the rapidly expanding universe is HUGE and I recommend this book to any science fiction writers to include these findings in your new work. I would remind all scientists that science is far from scientific. The topics studied and researched depend very much upon the very personal and far from objective decisions of the individuals involved. Not to mention the choices of funding organisations and institutions and even the time available on the telescopes! No amount of pretentiousness can disguise these human subjective limitations to scientific processes and achievements. 'The 4% Universe' underlines for the reader the fact that personal choices, competition and rivalry have had more of an impact upon cosmological research and the results reported today, than any over-reaching humanitarian goal to benefit mankind with their 'objective' findings about the history of the universe. Nobel Prize anyone?"
104,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"There are several things Panek does well in this book: if you've seen, out of the corner of your eye, headlines about ""universe inflation"", ""dark matter"", ""dark energy"", he does a good job of explaining what those are (at least, the stuff that's known about these things; there are still a lot of unanswered questions, like ""what the heck is dark energy, anyway?"")Just as importantly, he explains how scientists know what they know: the observations and experiments that led them to their conclusions. And he also talks about the people behind the science, their motivations and emotions, their doubts and rivalries, their hopes and arguments. And in the process, he shows us something about the process by which science is done, something we the public don't get to see very often.Unfortunately, the cast of characters is rather large, and I couldn't keep them all straight, or remember who was on the Princeton and who was on the Berkeley team, or even how the two teams differed in their approach and social structure. Some sort of chart would have been helpful, or at least photos of the main players, but the book offered no such help; at least, my ebook edition didn't.The picture that emerges is one of a weirder universe than I imagined, where scientists are led to accept seemingly-preposterous ideas – like the idea of a type of matter other than our usual protons and neutrons; and that there is several times more of this stuff than of ordinary stuff – by the force of observation. Like it or not, that's where the data points."
105,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241853-erin,4,"I'm not done yet, but my initial impression is positive. The thing I like about this book so far is how Panek puts the various discoveries in perspective. As an example, I definitely understood the concept of supernovas, as well as the fact that they pulsate and also the concept of red/blue light refraction. However, the way that Panek succinctly describes how that constant enabled discoveries about the way galaxies revolve, well, I dare you to find another writer who could have gotten the whole story into fewer words. I could give example after example of that type of synopsis in this book.I suppose if you're a PHD in Astronomy, you might find this book a very dummied-down review of the science with a few interesting anecdotes about the personal lives of the scientists covered. However, Panek is able to put scientific concepts in layman's terms in a way that is very accessible for non-scientists. Secondly, he tells the history in an entertaining way that you don't get in most textbooks. So, for the people who are writing reviews that Panek is not a good writer - I think you're wrong. In our textbooks and classrooms we are so concerned with ensuring students memorize the facts and the math that we don't teach the historical context in which discoveries were made (particularly in the field of cosmology). That, in turn stifles creativity and inhibits students from seeing the ""big picture"". So, kudo's to Panek for being able to write about cosmology in a way the average person can relate to. I'm definitely enjoying this book so far..."
106,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,5,"The 4 Percent Universe is classic PBS-bait. I mean that as a good thing: it is the story of the High-Z Supernova Search Team that competed against the Supernova Cosmology Project in order to determine the answer to the question: What is the ultimate fate of the universe?Panek brings his own philosophy of science to the book: experiments are necessary to prove things. He isn't going to throw around theory like Kaku or Krauss or Greene. He has no desire to explain to us the latest permutation of quantum gibberish being thrown around in theoretical departments. He wants to give us the chronology from Newton to where we are now, and he does a wonderful job. Experiment by experiment he conveys to us the chronology of cosmology up to the present state:a universe that has an accelerating expansion drive by dark energy, and giant filament structures of galaxies bound by dark matter halos. My favorite part of the book was about the trials and tribulations of Vera Rubin, a lady born around the time my grandmother who nailed down the evidence that made dark matter an indisputable fact of reality. She continually gets crap in the male dominated field of astronomy, but never gave up her interest in understanding the universe.I would call this book ""a romp."" If you've been missing the NOVA of 2008, when Brian Greene helped start the cascade of science documentaries that would end up in the Cosmos flop and YouTube taking over as physics-knowledge-distributor, this book is for you.

107,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,3,"I did myself a disservice by listening to this audiobook while running. I usually choose lighter fare for that -- since I must also attend to my immediate environment (i.e., traffic!). Some days I didn't feel like concentrating too hard and would listen to Steve Earle songs instead. I am also one of those ""innumerate"" types, and even though there wasn't much math the numbers would cause me to zone-out and then have to re-focus. So I kept losing the narrative thread, over days and sometimes over a single hour.Panek chronicles a gradually-amassing story of discovery: early cosmological science, quantum theory, Einstein, the earliest astronomical telescopes (he's written another book on telescopes alone), Hubble, supernovas, Guth, inflation... It's told largely through biographies of physicists and astronomers and their research, collaborations, and rivalries. Panek takes a really long time to even get to dark matter and dark energy -- since appreciating what they represent means understanding what we thought we knew before. It's a story of questions -- and what happens (is happening now) when the answer is even bigger question mark. "
108,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15155099-jacob,4,"This is the book about people who thought, or perhaps only hoped, they were on the third book of a sci-fi trilogy. The facts of the super massive and the super tiny were known, there just remained the small task of connecting the two by means of bridge. Unfortunately the bridge was Escheresque in its construction and utterly riddled with wormholes. And so it came to pass that like the Italian plumbers before them their princess was in another castle, quite possibly another universe entirely. And so what was the thought to be the last book turned out to be the end of prequel, or more(?) charitably, the first in a sequence of books by an author maliciously set upon milking every quid and copper from the wallets of their readership.Maybe.It’s really much too soon to say. It could still be a trilogy, but I doubt it.This book tells a series of stories that leads us to the precipice of human knowledge regarding the cosmos. Written in the rather wide middle space between overly remedial and too academic, it is a book that contrasts the vastness of the cosmos with the tales of ego and error that inevitably suffuse the people who search its depths. "
109,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,2,"We can only see (EM spectrum) about 1/25th of the mass in the known universe. That alone as the premise of a book should be mind-blowing but Panek fails to capture the magic of this fact. He perfectly captures the facts of it, the history, the personalities, the triumphs, the rivalries, but none of wonder that should be embedded in a story about discovering how little of the universe we can see.The stories presented were fresh. I knew of Alan Guth's double boxed discovery of cosmic inflation, I knew of the history of supernova identification, and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation but these received short treatment as the author knew they'd be covered elsewhere. The race for better methods, the wars between methods, and the press gambits were new and dare I say exciting but again, there was nothing behind it. This is a book about the triumph of the experimentalist to elucidate a weird universe we don't get. If that's the entire point, good job, Panek but that rings hollow to me."
110,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,4,"Sometimes I get stuck on an author and compare everything else I read in that genre to that author. Such is the case with Michio Kaku. I read Parallel Universes when it first came out and was blown away. As I wrote in my review, most of the book was way over my head but somehow I got a feel and glimmer of understanding for even those parts of the book that were. Kaku has a genius that makes the almost incomprehensible concepts in physics sometimes seem simple and obvious. The 4 Percent Universe did not leave me feeling that way. I would not say that Panek was unclear in the 4 Percent Universe. Actually, I had the feel that it was more a flat lesson in the history of science. It was a book that just had fewer revelations for me. With Kaku there were just so many ""Ah Ha"" moments. Hopefully, without sounding too hokey, when reading Kaku, there were moments of what felt like transcendence, an altered state of consciousness. Pretty high bar to set huh? Yeah, I know. Sorry, Richard Panek. You were just fine... just not Michio Kaku. "
111,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8731895-r-j-gilbert,2,"This book does one thing well: it provides a good example of both inspired science and Grant Theory. The first half of the book features individuals whose contribution to science begins with a personal passion and are driven onward by inspiration. The last half of the book is a wonderful look into the battles for funding, for recognition (which brings funding), and the politics of collaboration that is so often found in the scientific fields being choked by the weeds of Grant Theory. You can see quite clearly where the players begin to veer from the search for truth onto the quest for funding.I'm not sure why, but the author chose to organize his chapters by projects and discoveries rather than chronological events. At one point, this caused a player to die in one chapter only to give a news interview in the next. Was that an argument for entanglement (another GT buzz-word)?Okay, I'm done ranting. Suffice it to say, this book further shows me that science will only be advanced by those willing to follow the truth and not the path that funding tells them to follow."
112,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060228-michelle,2,"I listened to the 9 cd audio version of this book. Probably would have been better to read rather than listen to since the narrative tried to include a mention of almost every scientific discovery relating to dark matter and dark energy starting in 1964, but not in chronological order, and the mixture of acronyms and unfamiliar names of people and scientific terms made it difficult to follow. The author focused a great deal on the politics and egos involved in the discoveries rather than the science. That may appeal to a broader readership, but I was looking for more science. If you find the process and personalities of scientific research interesting and enjoy physics, this is probably a good way to get a glimpse inside extremely recent and potentially revolutionary developments that connect physics on the largest scales in astronomy with the smallest scales in particle physics. If you're looking for a careful explanation of the science, you will need to look elsewhere."

The other 96% is dark energy or dark matter. Isn’t that crazy! This book tells the story of the discoveries that led up to this amazing factoid. While some of the book contains technical jargon and facts that went right over my head, most of it tells the sometimes melodramatic story of scientists rushing to discover if the universe is expanding, contracting, or stable. Turns out that scientists can be petty, dramatic, and mean, but despite these human traits they still discovered amazing things. I enjoyed learning that even really smart people can be catty, and found the discoveries fascinating. Most astounding is that despite everything we do know, there is still so much more to learn! What a great time to be alive!"

Unlike some of the quantum mechanics stuff, I had a harder time following the science so I had to do some translating as I tried following along (why are they trying to find what now?). It could be my concentration simply wasn't as focused as during other simliar books.I loved the descriptions of the differences between the astronomers and the physicists in personality and politics.

These stories show the individuals who worked at science, and gives a sense of their humanity and personal struggles. It also depicts the struggle to discover and to accept a new and powerful understanding that the entire universe and all the stars and galaxies that we can see towards all infinity, all the stars that anyone has ever seen, is in reality a tiny, tiny fraction of all the matter and energy that inhabits the universe.The reviewing of these stories, to me, becomes a bit of mythology, like a hall of heroes"

The most interesting part of the story deals with two research teams (one at MIT and one at Berkeley) who are competing to see if Super Nova can be used a light references to determine how old the universe is and confirm that the universe is still expanding and will continue to expand forever (so the current theory goes). These physicist have egos for sure. Both teams came to this same conclusion almost at the same time (Jan 1998)based on two entirely different data sets. Only 4% of the universe consists of atoms which emit energy so we can see them. 26% is dark matter (has mass but doesn't emit any energy so we can't see it). The rest is dark energy."

The book covers one of the greatest mysteries facing science today, the universe’s missing mass. Modern cosmology has two groups of scientist working (the astronomers and the physicists) to solve this puzzle. Both are very different in how they work and how they think. But the answers that they hope to find will change the way we look at the universe forever! The book covers some very complex theories and concepts but Mr. Panek does a good job making the complex simpler to read and understand.

His style and approach reminded me a lot of Dennis Overbye's The Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, which chronicled the developments in physical and theoretical astronomy up through the 1980s.

While I really enjoyed the seismic idea movement in my understanding of the cosmos, I found that my understanding of the science was not great once I sat down with someone who is actually in the field. This could be, and probably is, a fault of my own, a lack of scientific background on which to hang these still exploratory concepts, but it also belies the danger behind popular scientific texts. Simplification of concepts sometimes obscures the data unintentionally. "

127,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This a highly readable history of the transformation of cosmology from metaphysics to physics, from philosophy and speculation to hard science, and in the process, the discovery of most of the universe.Historically, astronomy and physics didn't have a great deal to do with each other. Astronomers studied the stars by observation, very patient and detailed observation and record-keeping. Theoretical physicists theorized and calculated, and experimental physicists experimented, and they fed each other's work, very occasionally coming up with something, most notably gravity, that made a real difference to astronomy. Then Einstein gave us general relativity, and began a century of ever-deeper entanglement of physics and astronomy, and the transformation of cosmology--the study of the nature and origins of the entire universe--from something utterly beyond the scope of physics into its core. The questions of how big the universe is, whether it is eternal in space and time or had a beginning and might have an end, became real questions.Edwin Hubble, early in the century, discovered that the universe is expanding, but also that there are other galaxies beyond our own, and that they're all moving away from us. This was a major, exciting, and initially controversial change in our conception of the universe. In the 1960s, Vera Rubin, looking for a research project she could do within the constraints of raising two young children, studied other astronomers' observations and discovered that the galaxies were rotating as well as moving away from us. Also in the mid-1960s, Robert Dicke, Jim Peebles, and a small group of theoretical physicists had a prediction for which they had no supporting data: If the Big Bang theory of the history of the universe were correct, there should be low-level cosmic microwave radiation, at a temperature of about 3 degrees Kelvin. Then two astronomers at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, had data for which they had no explanation: While trying to calibrate the Bell Labs' Crawford Hill antenna to study radio waves from the fringes of the Milky Way, they found they had a tiny background hiss which no amount of calibration would eliminate. They'd found the background cosmic radiation, echo of the Big Bang.That's one small step along the way, from Einstein to the discovery that most of our universe is invisible. As the back and forth played out between the theoretical physicists and the experimental and observational scientists, increasingly astronomers, each theoretical question drew forth an observation, a find, a discovery that answered that question, and raised another. The most startling of these was the discovery that visible, directly detectable matter is just over 4% of the total make-up of a universe far larger and more complex than ever suspected at the start of the 20th century. If what we see were all there were, the galaxies would not be, could not be, relatively compact, stable spirals (or their other shapes), but should be torn apart by the speed of their rotation. Outside, among, around, the visible matter of the galaxies was dark matter.Dark matter was soon joined by the even more mysterious dark energy.The largest part of Panek's book is devoted to the research to detect and identify dark matter and dark energy, He takes us through not only the science, fascinating enough in itself, but also the human drama as two teams, one primarily physicists and the other primarily astronomers, raced against each other to gather enough observations of sufficiently distant (and therefore ancient) supernovae to answer essential questions about the conditions of the early universe. In the answers to those questions, and questions about changes since that early time, would lie the answers to the reality of dark energy, dark matter, and maybe the ultimate fate of the universe.Highly recommended.This book is not yet published but can be pre-ordered from Amazon or Barnes & Noble.I received a free electronic galley of this book from the publisher via NetGalley."
128,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131838-alan,5,"First of all, I am not a physicist or a cosmologist, though I am a scientist (biologist). Even so, I found this book to be fascinating. If you are like me you have learned or at least heard something about recent changes in our understanding of the universe. For example, there was the refinement of Newton's explanation of gravity by Einstein through his theories of relativity (the description of space time), then there was the Big Bang model of the universe developed by Hubble when he applied Einstein's physics to the developing field of cosmology. Later on there was the discovery that stars at the edges of spiral galaxies were going WAY faster than they should have been going based on the calcualted mass of stars in those galaxies (this was Vera Rubin's work), and from that the need for a larger mass than observed led to the concept of Dark Matter. Then, later, not only the inflation of the universe, but an accelerating rate of expansion called for a force large enough to overcome the force of gravity that should have eventually caused the universe to expand and then collapse on itself, though recent observations show that this is not to be...the universe really is accelerating its rate of inflation...and the need for Dark Energy was born. These ideas of an inflating universe, a Big Bang + Dark Matter + Dark Energy increasing acceleration universe is a fascinating model of our universe. If you are like me, you may periodically wonder not only how such a universe works, but how in the world observations were made that led to these conclusions. THIS is what this book is about. The book starts with a brief introduction to the field of cosmology (the structure and fate of the universe) starting with Aristotle and Ptolemy's geocentric model. That model was then revised into the heliocentric model through the work of Copernicus and the observations of Galileo. Then Newton revised things with his universal law of gravitation, only to be modified yet again by Einstein's explanation of space-time fabric and Hubble's expanding Big Bang universe that is made of many galaxies. The bulk of the book, however, focuses on work done in the last 50 years or so, including work done since 2000 when large teams of collaborating scientists raced to try to describe the universe and demonstrate through theory and observation what it is really like. Fortunately for someone like me, Panek describes all of this without delving into the deep end of physics and cosmology...the math. Even so, if you decide to tackle this book you need to be prepared to keep track of a variety of acronyms and terms about cosmic backround microwaves, lambda, omega, and other terms scientists use to refer to the nature of the universe. And, not only do we get a nice overview of the science, but we get an interesting view of how modern cosmology and physics are done. Be prepared to read about issues in scientific ethics, jealousy, mind-bending breakthroughts, and discovery after discovery that led to our modern view of the universe and how it works. I found this book to be a tough, but good 5-star offering, though it's probably a 4 star offering for the non-scientist...it will take some serious effort to keep everything straight, and I don't think I can claim that myself. Still, this is a fascinating tale of discovery."
129,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20534403-sue-von-roedern,4,Fascinating and mostly understandable introduction to the fate of the universe. I want to be an astrophysicist when I grow up. I guess that will have to be in my next life.
130,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,4,"The 4% Universe - 4% science...96% stories.That is this book in a nutshell. If you are looking for a book on the science behind Dark Matter and Dark Energy, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for the stories about the astonomers behind the discovery of both Dark Matter and Dark Energy, definitely pick up this book.Panek gives a lively account of how the discovery of these two elusive subjects came about. I would say the first 1/3 of the book focuses on Dark Matter, with the rest heavily revolving around Dark Energy. At times the writing was a bit over the top for me, however this book is anything but boring and Panek clearly did his research. There are lots of astronomers/physicists to keep track of, and at times Panek introduced a new name without ever telling us about them. For the most part, the narrative is easy to follow despite the many names, and the science is easy to understand. I don't know that I have ever read shorter descriptions of science that so easily and clearly got their point across.We learn about Vera Rubin and her discovery that galaxies rotate at the same speed no matter the distance from the galactic center, the intersection of particle physics and astronomy (cosmology), and the search for the 2 main questions in cosmology: what is the value of the Hubble Constant and how much has the expansion rate changed over time. But the majority of the narrative focuses on the two competing teams who discovered that the universe isn't just expanding...it's accelerating; the Supernova Cosmology project headed by Saul Perlmutter at Berkely and the High-z team headed by Brian Schmidt.In the first chapter Panek brings up an interesting theme of astronomy. We as humans are constantly thinking we can't understand something, only to figure it out through science. Ptolemy believed we would never understand the heavens, but with the invention of the telescope came that understanding. Or more recently thinking we can never know how the universe began because we can't go back in time, yet with the discovery of the CMB we came to an understanding for that too. Currently, there are theorists and astronomers who believe we will never truly know the nature of dark matter and dark energy. I think if history tells us anything, we need only have some patience and wait for that understanding to come as well."
131,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,2,"Cosmology, the science of the origin, evolution and the ultimate fate of the Universe, is a surprisingly young scientific discipline. For the most of history cosmological questions were dealt with through a philosophical or theological inquiry, but in the early part of the twentieth century it became possible to inquire about these things in a more systematic and scientific manner. The research in Cosmology really gained steam since the 1960s, when the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) put the Big Bang Theory on a very firm footing. However, the subsequent inquiry revealed something really intellectually curious and potentially disturbing about the Universe: we can only see a very tiny fraction of it. The vast proportion of the “stuff” that makes up the Universe, about 96% of it to be more precise, is invisible. We can only infer its existence from the gravitational effects it has on the “visible” matter. This “invisible” stuff came to be known by a very prosaic couple of names: dark matter and dark energy. The aim of “The 4% Universe” is to explain our best current understanding of what the dark matter and the dark energy are. The book provides some good physics background to all of these phenomena, and tries to explain how the observation and the research into these topics have progressed over the last half a century or so. Unfortunately, this book goes way overboard in taking the inside look at the workings of the physicists and the astronomers who do research on dark matter and dark energy. It narrates, in painful details sometimes, the comings and goings of the select groups of scientists as they conduct their research, grapple with work-family balance, and engage in petty turf wars with their colleagues and other competing research collaborations. For the most of the book I found myself bored to death with these minutiae – and I am a scientist! Furthermore, I found the information on the actual science, and physics aspects of it in particular, incredibly thin. Reading the Wikipedia articles on this topic is way more informative. This is definitely not a book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the Universe and its dark secrets. "
132,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"This is an excellent book detailing the birth of cosmology and the search for the true nature of the universe. More of a history book than anything else, there's no better account of the Copernican legacy and the evolution of metaphysics into a true field of science.One of the most compelling aspects of the book is the fact that it's all so new that ideas become risky and technology becomes the limiting factor for what we can discover. And while not having the complete story is nagging, it's a torturous glimpse into the necessity to understand that plagues these very scientists.A big plus is that the book is very well written. For example, the author employs a nice stylistic hook at the beginning of every chapter; He describes a scene where the people and setting remain anonymous for a paragraph or so, letting the story slowly come into view. ""What's he talking about? Where are they? Oh, Antarctica? Awesome.""One aspect of the book that was a bit of a bummer was that it painted the race to discovery as more of a frantic, sometimes bitter competition rather than a series of exciting innovations. The idea that a scientific career often hangs in the balance is very clear — and perhaps I'm being naive — but that sort of doe-eyed wonder that humans get looking up at the stars seemed lost on the protagonists from time to time.As is often a complaint of mine when reading such a book, I would have liked to hear more about the details of the experiments and the meat of the theories. The author could have easily gone a little more in depth without losing lay persons, if that was the concern. Or how about an appendix for the more dedicated reader in the next addition, Panek?Though a little heavy on squabbling scientists and light on the actual physics, The 4-Percent Universe is an extremely thorough historical account of the current state of knowledge regarding the fate of our reality. I really enjoyed it."
133,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7078788-christine-leov-lealand,5,"There isn't a lot to say about dark matter and dark energy - since everything we know about these prevalent universal items is from inferences. No one seems to have found or measured either yet. So reading a long scientific book about these alleged 'dark' ie unknown things isn't going to convince many people that they exist.What IS convincing is Panek's social history of modern cosmology. How generations of scientists working around the planet both collaborating and competing with each other - as they still are - and yet independently coming to the SAME Conclusion!Two competing teams trying to prove each other's findings wrong and failing. Amusing and convincing to laypeople like myself.This book is not dry or boring like most science seems to like to be. The concept of our universe [that which we perceive] being the equivalent of the froth on the coffee of the rapidly expanding universe is HUGE and I recommend this book to any science fiction writers to include these findings in your new work. I would remind all scientists that science is far from scientific. The topics studied and researched depend very much upon the very personal and far from objective decisions of the individuals involved. Not to mention the choices of funding organisations and institutions and even the time available on the telescopes! No amount of pretentiousness can disguise these human subjective limitations to scientific processes and achievements. 'The 4% Universe' underlines for the reader the fact that personal choices, competition and rivalry have had more of an impact upon cosmological research and the results reported today, than any over-reaching humanitarian goal to benefit mankind with their 'objective' findings about the history of the universe. Nobel Prize anyone?"
134,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"There are several things Panek does well in this book: if you've seen, out of the corner of your eye, headlines about ""universe inflation"", ""dark matter"", ""dark energy"", he does a good job of explaining what those are (at least, the stuff that's known about these things; there are still a lot of unanswered questions, like ""what the heck is dark energy, anyway?"")Just as importantly, he explains how scientists know what they know: the observations and experiments that led them to their conclusions. And he also talks about the people behind the science, their motivations and emotions, their doubts and rivalries, their hopes and arguments. And in the process, he shows us something about the process by which science is done, something we the public don't get to see very often.Unfortunately, the cast of characters is rather large, and I couldn't keep them all straight, or remember who was on the Princeton and who was on the Berkeley team, or even how the two teams differed in their approach and social structure. Some sort of chart would have been helpful, or at least photos of the main players, but the book offered no such help; at least, my ebook edition didn't.The picture that emerges is one of a weirder universe than I imagined, where scientists are led to accept seemingly-preposterous ideas – like the idea of a type of matter other than our usual protons and neutrons; and that there is several times more of this stuff than of ordinary stuff – by the force of observation. Like it or not, that's where the data points."
135,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241853-erin,4,"I'm not done yet, but my initial impression is positive. The thing I like about this book so far is how Panek puts the various discoveries in perspective. As an example, I definitely understood the concept of supernovas, as well as the fact that they pulsate and also the concept of red/blue light refraction. However, the way that Panek succinctly describes how that constant enabled discoveries about the way galaxies revolve, well, I dare you to find another writer who could have gotten the whole story into fewer words. I could give example after example of that type of synopsis in this book.I suppose if you're a PHD in Astronomy, you might find this book a very dummied-down review of the science with a few interesting anecdotes about the personal lives of the scientists covered. However, Panek is able to put scientific concepts in layman's terms in a way that is very accessible for non-scientists. Secondly, he tells the history in an entertaining way that you don't get in most textbooks. So, for the people who are writing reviews that Panek is not a good writer - I think you're wrong. In our textbooks and classrooms we are so concerned with ensuring students memorize the facts and the math that we don't teach the historical context in which discoveries were made (particularly in the field of cosmology). That, in turn stifles creativity and inhibits students from seeing the ""big picture"". So, kudo's to Panek for being able to write about cosmology in a way the average person can relate to. I'm definitely enjoying this book so far..."
136,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,5,"The 4 Percent Universe is classic PBS-bait. I mean that as a good thing: it is the story of the High-Z Supernova Search Team that competed against the Supernova Cosmology Project in order to determine the answer to the question: What is the ultimate fate of the universe?Panek brings his own philosophy of science to the book: experiments are necessary to prove things. He isn't going to throw around theory like Kaku or Krauss or Greene. He has no desire to explain to us the latest permutation of quantum gibberish being thrown around in theoretical departments. He wants to give us the chronology from Newton to where we are now, and he does a wonderful job. Experiment by experiment he conveys to us the chronology of cosmology up to the present state:a universe that has an accelerating expansion drive by dark energy, and giant filament structures of galaxies bound by dark matter halos. My favorite part of the book was about the trials and tribulations of Vera Rubin, a lady born around the time my grandmother who nailed down the evidence that made dark matter an indisputable fact of reality. She continually gets crap in the male dominated field of astronomy, but never gave up her interest in understanding the universe.I would call this book ""a romp."" If you've been missing the NOVA of 2008, when Brian Greene helped start the cascade of science documentaries that would end up in the Cosmos flop and YouTube taking over as physics-knowledge-distributor, this book is for you.

I usually choose lighter fare for that -- since I must also attend to my immediate environment (i.e., traffic!). Some days I didn't feel like concentrating too hard and would listen to Steve Earle songs instead. I am also one of those ""innumerate"" types, and even though there wasn't much math the numbers would cause me to zone-out and then have to re-focus. So I kept losing the narrative thread, over days and sometimes over a single hour.Panek chronicles a gradually-amassing story of discovery: early cosmological science, quantum theory, Einstein, the earliest astronomical telescopes (he's written another book on telescopes alone), Hubble, supernovas, Guth, inflation... It's told largely through biographies of physicists and astronomers and their research, collaborations, and rivalries. Panek takes a really long time to even get to dark matter and dark energy -- since appreciating what they represent means understanding what we thought we knew before. It's a story of questions -- and what happens (is happening now) when the answer is even bigger question mark. "

The facts of the super massive and the super tiny were known, there just remained the small task of connecting the two by means of bridge. Unfortunately the bridge was Escheresque in its construction and utterly riddled with wormholes. And so it came to pass that like the Italian plumbers before them their princess was in another castle, quite possibly another universe entirely. And so what was the thought to be the last book turned out to be the end of prequel, or more(?) charitably, the first in a sequence of books by an author maliciously set upon milking every quid and copper from the wallets of their readership.Maybe.It’s really much too soon to say. It could still be a trilogy, but I doubt it.This book tells a series of stories that leads us to the precipice of human knowledge regarding the cosmos. Written in the rather wide middle space between overly remedial and too academic, it is a book that contrasts the vastness of the cosmos with the tales of ego and error that inevitably suffuse the people who search its depths.

That alone as the premise of a book should be mind-blowing but Panek fails to capture the magic of this fact. He perfectly captures the facts of it, the history, the personalities, the triumphs, the rivalries, but none of wonder that should be embedded in a story about discovering how little of the universe we can see.The stories presented were fresh. I knew of Alan Guth's double boxed discovery of cosmic inflation, I knew of the history of supernova identification, and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation but these received short treatment as the author knew they'd be covered elsewhere. The race for better methods, the wars between methods, and the press gambits were new and dare I say exciting but again, there was nothing behind it. This is a book about the triumph of the experimentalist to elucidate a weird universe we don't get. If that's the entire point, good job, Panek but that rings hollow to me."
140,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,4,"Sometimes I get stuck on an author and compare everything else I read in that genre to that author. Such is the case with Michio Kaku. I read Parallel Universes when it first came out and was blown away. As I wrote in my review, most of the book was way over my head but somehow I got a feel and glimmer of understanding for even those parts of the book that were. Kaku has a genius that makes the almost incomprehensible concepts in physics sometimes seem simple and obvious. The 4 Percent Universe did not leave me feeling that way. I would not say that Panek was unclear in the 4 Percent Universe. Actually, I had the feel that it was more a flat lesson in the history of science. It was a book that just had fewer revelations for me. With Kaku there were just so many ""Ah Ha"" moments. Hopefully, without sounding too hokey, when reading Kaku, there were moments of what felt like transcendence, an altered state of consciousness. Pretty high bar to set huh? Yeah, I know. Sorry, Richard Panek. You were just fine... just not Michio Kaku. "
141,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8731895-r-j-gilbert,2,"This book does one thing well: it provides a good example of both inspired science and Grant Theory. The first half of the book features individuals whose contribution to science begins with a personal passion and are driven onward by inspiration. The last half of the book is a wonderful look into the battles for funding, for recognition (which brings funding), and the politics of collaboration that is so often found in the scientific fields being choked by the weeds of Grant Theory. You can see quite clearly where the players begin to veer from the search for truth onto the quest for funding.I'm not sure why, but the author chose to organize his chapters by projects and discoveries rather than chronological events. At one point, this caused a player to die in one chapter only to give a news interview in the next. Was that an argument for entanglement (another GT buzz-word)?Okay, I'm done ranting. Suffice it to say, this book further shows me that science will only be advanced by those willing to follow the truth and not the path that funding tells them to follow."

Probably would have been better to read rather than listen to since the narrative tried to include a mention of almost every scientific discovery relating to dark matter and dark energy starting in 1964, but not in chronological order, and the mixture of acronyms and unfamiliar names of people and scientific terms made it difficult to follow. The author focused a great deal on the politics and egos involved in the discoveries rather than the science. That may appeal to a broader readership, but I was looking for more science. If you find the process and personalities of scientific research interesting and enjoy physics, this is probably a good way to get a glimpse inside extremely recent and potentially revolutionary developments that connect physics on the largest scales in astronomy with the smallest scales in particle physics. If you're looking for a careful explanation of the science, you will need to look elsewhere."

The other 96% is dark energy or dark matter. Isn’t that crazy! This book tells the story of the discoveries that led up to this amazing factoid. While some of the book contains technical jargon and facts that went right over my head, most of it tells the sometimes melodramatic story of scientists rushing to discover if the universe is expanding, contracting, or stable. Turns out that scientists can be petty, dramatic, and mean, but despite these human traits they still discovered amazing things. I enjoyed learning that even really smart people can be catty, and found the discoveries fascinating. Most astounding is that despite everything we do know, there is still so much more to learn!

These stories show the individuals who worked at science, and gives a sense of their humanity and personal struggles. It also depicts the struggle to discover and to accept a new and powerful understanding that the entire universe and all the stars and galaxies that we can see towards all infinity, all the stars that anyone has ever seen, is in reality a tiny, tiny fraction of all the matter and energy that inhabits the universe.The reviewing of these stories, to me, becomes a bit of mythology, like a hall of heroes"

These physicist have egos for sure. Both teams came to this same conclusion almost at the same time (Jan 1998)based on two entirely different data sets. Only 4% of the universe consists of atoms which emit energy so we can see them. 26% is dark matter (has mass but doesn't emit any energy so we can't see it). The rest is dark energy."

While I really enjoyed the seismic idea movement in my understanding of the cosmos, I found that my understanding of the science was not great once I sat down with someone who is actually in the field. This could be, and probably is, a fault of my own, a lack of scientific background on which to hang these still exploratory concepts, but it also belies the danger behind popular scientific texts.

157,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This a highly readable history of the transformation of cosmology from metaphysics to physics, from philosophy and speculation to hard science, and in the process, the discovery of most of the universe.Historically, astronomy and physics didn't have a great deal to do with each other. Astronomers studied the stars by observation, very patient and detailed observation and record-keeping. Theoretical physicists theorized and calculated, and experimental physicists experimented, and they fed each other's work, very occasionally coming up with something, most notably gravity, that made a real difference to astronomy. Then Einstein gave us general relativity, and began a century of ever-deeper entanglement of physics and astronomy, and the transformation of cosmology--the study of the nature and origins of the entire universe--from something utterly beyond the scope of physics into its core. The questions of how big the universe is, whether it is eternal in space and time or had a beginning and might have an end, became real questions.Edwin Hubble, early in the century, discovered that the universe is expanding, but also that there are other galaxies beyond our own, and that they're all moving away from us. This was a major, exciting, and initially controversial change in our conception of the universe. In the 1960s, Vera Rubin, looking for a research project she could do within the constraints of raising two young children, studied other astronomers' observations and discovered that the galaxies were rotating as well as moving away from us. Also in the mid-1960s, Robert Dicke, Jim Peebles, and a small group of theoretical physicists had a prediction for which they had no supporting data: If the Big Bang theory of the history of the universe were correct, there should be low-level cosmic microwave radiation, at a temperature of about 3 degrees Kelvin. Then two astronomers at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, had data for which they had no explanation: While trying to calibrate the Bell Labs' Crawford Hill antenna to study radio waves from the fringes of the Milky Way, they found they had a tiny background hiss which no amount of calibration would eliminate. They'd found the background cosmic radiation, echo of the Big Bang.That's one small step along the way, from Einstein to the discovery that most of our universe is invisible. As the back and forth played out between the theoretical physicists and the experimental and observational scientists, increasingly astronomers, each theoretical question drew forth an observation, a find, a discovery that answered that question, and raised another. The most startling of these was the discovery that visible, directly detectable matter is just over 4% of the total make-up of a universe far larger and more complex than ever suspected at the start of the 20th century. If what we see were all there were, the galaxies would not be, could not be, relatively compact, stable spirals (or their other shapes), but should be torn apart by the speed of their rotation. Outside, among, around, the visible matter of the galaxies was dark matter.Dark matter was soon joined by the even more mysterious dark energy.The largest part of Panek's book is devoted to the research to detect and identify dark matter and dark energy, He takes us through not only the science, fascinating enough in itself, but also the human drama as two teams, one primarily physicists and the other primarily astronomers, raced against each other to gather enough observations of sufficiently distant (and therefore ancient) supernovae to answer essential questions about the conditions of the early universe. In the answers to those questions, and questions about changes since that early time, would lie the answers to the reality of dark energy, dark matter, and maybe the ultimate fate of the universe.Highly recommended.This book is not yet published but can be pre-ordered from Amazon or Barnes & Noble.I received a free electronic galley of this book from the publisher via NetGalley."

If you are like me you have learned or at least heard something about recent changes in our understanding of the universe. For example, there was the refinement of Newton's explanation of gravity by Einstein through his theories of relativity (the description of space time), then there was the Big Bang model of the universe developed by Hubble when he applied Einstein's physics to the developing field of cosmology. Later on there was the discovery that stars at the edges of spiral galaxies were going WAY faster than they should have been going based on the calcualted mass of stars in those galaxies (this was Vera Rubin's work), and from that the need for a larger mass than observed led to the concept of Dark Matter. Then, later, not only the inflation of the universe, but an accelerating rate of expansion called for a force large enough to overcome the force of gravity that should have eventually caused the universe to expand and then collapse on itself, though recent observations show that this is not to be...the universe really is accelerating its rate of inflation...and the need for Dark Energy was born. These ideas of an inflating universe, a Big Bang + Dark Matter + Dark Energy increasing acceleration universe is a fascinating model of our universe. If you are like me, you may periodically wonder not only how such a universe works, but how in the world observations were made that led to these conclusions. THIS is what this book is about. The book starts with a brief introduction to the field of cosmology (the structure and fate of the universe) starting with Aristotle and Ptolemy's geocentric model. That model was then revised into the heliocentric model through the work of Copernicus and the observations of Galileo. Then Newton revised things with his universal law of gravitation, only to be modified yet again by Einstein's explanation of space-time fabric and Hubble's expanding Big Bang universe that is made of many galaxies. The bulk of the book, however, focuses on work done in the last 50 years or so, including work done since 2000 when large teams of collaborating scientists raced to try to describe the universe and demonstrate through theory and observation what it is really like. Fortunately for someone like me, Panek describes all of this without delving into the deep end of physics and cosmology...the math. Even so, if you decide to tackle this book you need to be prepared to keep track of a variety of acronyms and terms about cosmic backround microwaves, lambda, omega, and other terms scientists use to refer to the nature of the universe. And, not only do we get a nice overview of the science, but we get an interesting view of how modern cosmology and physics are done. Be prepared to read about issues in scientific ethics, jealousy, mind-bending breakthroughts, and discovery after discovery that led to our modern view of the universe and how it works. I found this book to be a tough, but good 5-star offering, though it's probably a 4 star offering for the non-scientist...it will take some serious effort to keep everything straight, and I don't think I can claim that myself. Still, this is a fascinating tale of discovery."
159,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20534403-sue-von-roedern,4,Fascinating and mostly understandable introduction to the fate of the universe. I want to be an astrophysicist when I grow up. I guess that will have to be in my next life.
160,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,4,"The 4% Universe - 4% science...96% stories.That is this book in a nutshell. If you are looking for a book on the science behind Dark Matter and Dark Energy, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for the stories about the astonomers behind the discovery of both Dark Matter and Dark Energy, definitely pick up this book.Panek gives a lively account of how the discovery of these two elusive subjects came about. I would say the first 1/3 of the book focuses on Dark Matter, with the rest heavily revolving around Dark Energy. At times the writing was a bit over the top for me, however this book is anything but boring and Panek clearly did his research. There are lots of astronomers/physicists to keep track of, and at times Panek introduced a new name without ever telling us about them. For the most part, the narrative is easy to follow despite the many names, and the science is easy to understand. I don't know that I have ever read shorter descriptions of science that so easily and clearly got their point across.We learn about Vera Rubin and her discovery that galaxies rotate at the same speed no matter the distance from the galactic center, the intersection of particle physics and astronomy (cosmology), and the search for the 2 main questions in cosmology: what is the value of the Hubble Constant and how much has the expansion rate changed over time. But the majority of the narrative focuses on the two competing teams who discovered that the universe isn't just expanding...it's accelerating; the Supernova Cosmology project headed by Saul Perlmutter at Berkely and the High-z team headed by Brian Schmidt.In the first chapter Panek brings up an interesting theme of astronomy. We as humans are constantly thinking we can't understand something, only to figure it out through science. Ptolemy believed we would never understand the heavens, but with the invention of the telescope came that understanding. Or more recently thinking we can never know how the universe began because we can't go back in time, yet with the discovery of the CMB we came to an understanding for that too. Currently, there are theorists and astronomers who believe we will never truly know the nature of dark matter and dark energy. I think if history tells us anything, we need only have some patience and wait for that understanding to come as well."
161,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,2,"Cosmology, the science of the origin, evolution and the ultimate fate of the Universe, is a surprisingly young scientific discipline. For the most of history cosmological questions were dealt with through a philosophical or theological inquiry, but in the early part of the twentieth century it became possible to inquire about these things in a more systematic and scientific manner. The research in Cosmology really gained steam since the 1960s, when the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) put the Big Bang Theory on a very firm footing. However, the subsequent inquiry revealed something really intellectually curious and potentially disturbing about the Universe: we can only see a very tiny fraction of it. The vast proportion of the “stuff” that makes up the Universe, about 96% of it to be more precise, is invisible. We can only infer its existence from the gravitational effects it has on the “visible” matter. This “invisible” stuff came to be known by a very prosaic couple of names: dark matter and dark energy. The aim of “The 4% Universe” is to explain our best current understanding of what the dark matter and the dark energy are. The book provides some good physics background to all of these phenomena, and tries to explain how the observation and the research into these topics have progressed over the last half a century or so. Unfortunately, this book goes way overboard in taking the inside look at the workings of the physicists and the astronomers who do research on dark matter and dark energy. It narrates, in painful details sometimes, the comings and goings of the select groups of scientists as they conduct their research, grapple with work-family balance, and engage in petty turf wars with their colleagues and other competing research collaborations. For the most of the book I found myself bored to death with these minutiae – and I am a scientist! Furthermore, I found the information on the actual science, and physics aspects of it in particular, incredibly thin. Reading the Wikipedia articles on this topic is way more informative. This is definitely not a book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the Universe and its dark secrets. "
162,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"This is an excellent book detailing the birth of cosmology and the search for the true nature of the universe. More of a history book than anything else, there's no better account of the Copernican legacy and the evolution of metaphysics into a true field of science.One of the most compelling aspects of the book is the fact that it's all so new that ideas become risky and technology becomes the limiting factor for what we can discover. And while not having the complete story is nagging, it's a torturous glimpse into the necessity to understand that plagues these very scientists.A big plus is that the book is very well written. For example, the author employs a nice stylistic hook at the beginning of every chapter; He describes a scene where the people and setting remain anonymous for a paragraph or so, letting the story slowly come into view. ""What's he talking about? Where are they? Oh, Antarctica? Awesome.""One aspect of the book that was a bit of a bummer was that it painted the race to discovery as more of a frantic, sometimes bitter competition rather than a series of exciting innovations. The idea that a scientific career often hangs in the balance is very clear — and perhaps I'm being naive — but that sort of doe-eyed wonder that humans get looking up at the stars seemed lost on the protagonists from time to time.As is often a complaint of mine when reading such a book, I would have liked to hear more about the details of the experiments and the meat of the theories. The author could have easily gone a little more in depth without losing lay persons, if that was the concern. Or how about an appendix for the more dedicated reader in the next addition, Panek?Though a little heavy on squabbling scientists and light on the actual physics, The 4-Percent Universe is an extremely thorough historical account of the current state of knowledge regarding the fate of our reality. I really enjoyed it."
163,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7078788-christine-leov-lealand,5,"There isn't a lot to say about dark matter and dark energy - since everything we know about these prevalent universal items is from inferences. No one seems to have found or measured either yet. So reading a long scientific book about these alleged 'dark' ie unknown things isn't going to convince many people that they exist.What IS convincing is Panek's social history of modern cosmology. How generations of scientists working around the planet both collaborating and competing with each other - as they still are - and yet independently coming to the SAME Conclusion!Two competing teams trying to prove each other's findings wrong and failing. Amusing and convincing to laypeople like myself.This book is not dry or boring like most science seems to like to be. The concept of our universe [that which we perceive] being the equivalent of the froth on the coffee of the rapidly expanding universe is HUGE and I recommend this book to any science fiction writers to include these findings in your new work. I would remind all scientists that science is far from scientific. The topics studied and researched depend very much upon the very personal and far from objective decisions of the individuals involved. Not to mention the choices of funding organisations and institutions and even the time available on the telescopes! No amount of pretentiousness can disguise these human subjective limitations to scientific processes and achievements. 'The 4% Universe' underlines for the reader the fact that personal choices, competition and rivalry have had more of an impact upon cosmological research and the results reported today, than any over-reaching humanitarian goal to benefit mankind with their 'objective' findings about the history of the universe. Nobel Prize anyone?"
164,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"There are several things Panek does well in this book: if you've seen, out of the corner of your eye, headlines about ""universe inflation"", ""dark matter"", ""dark energy"", he does a good job of explaining what those are (at least, the stuff that's known about these things; there are still a lot of unanswered questions, like ""what the heck is dark energy, anyway?"")Just as importantly, he explains how scientists know what they know: the observations and experiments that led them to their conclusions. And he also talks about the people behind the science, their motivations and emotions, their doubts and rivalries, their hopes and arguments. And in the process, he shows us something about the process by which science is done, something we the public don't get to see very often.Unfortunately, the cast of characters is rather large, and I couldn't keep them all straight, or remember who was on the Princeton and who was on the Berkeley team, or even how the two teams differed in their approach and social structure. Some sort of chart would have been helpful, or at least photos of the main players, but the book offered no such help; at least, my ebook edition didn't.The picture that emerges is one of a weirder universe than I imagined, where scientists are led to accept seemingly-preposterous ideas – like the idea of a type of matter other than our usual protons and neutrons; and that there is several times more of this stuff than of ordinary stuff – by the force of observation. Like it or not, that's where the data points."
165,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241853-erin,4,"I'm not done yet, but my initial impression is positive. The thing I like about this book so far is how Panek puts the various discoveries in perspective. As an example, I definitely understood the concept of supernovas, as well as the fact that they pulsate and also the concept of red/blue light refraction. However, the way that Panek succinctly describes how that constant enabled discoveries about the way galaxies revolve, well, I dare you to find another writer who could have gotten the whole story into fewer words. I could give example after example of that type of synopsis in this book.I suppose if you're a PHD in Astronomy, you might find this book a very dummied-down review of the science with a few interesting anecdotes about the personal lives of the scientists covered. However, Panek is able to put scientific concepts in layman's terms in a way that is very accessible for non-scientists. Secondly, he tells the history in an entertaining way that you don't get in most textbooks. So, for the people who are writing reviews that Panek is not a good writer - I think you're wrong. In our textbooks and classrooms we are so concerned with ensuring students memorize the facts and the math that we don't teach the historical context in which discoveries were made (particularly in the field of cosmology). That, in turn stifles creativity and inhibits students from seeing the ""big picture"". So, kudo's to Panek for being able to write about cosmology in a way the average person can relate to. I'm definitely enjoying this book so far..."
166,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,5,"The 4 Percent Universe is classic PBS-bait. I mean that as a good thing: it is the story of the High-Z Supernova Search Team that competed against the Supernova Cosmology Project in order to determine the answer to the question: What is the ultimate fate of the universe?Panek brings his own philosophy of science to the book: experiments are necessary to prove things. He isn't going to throw around theory like Kaku or Krauss or Greene. He has no desire to explain to us the latest permutation of quantum gibberish being thrown around in theoretical departments. He wants to give us the chronology from Newton to where we are now, and he does a wonderful job. Experiment by experiment he conveys to us the chronology of cosmology up to the present state:a universe that has an accelerating expansion drive by dark energy, and giant filament structures of galaxies bound by dark matter halos. My favorite part of the book was about the trials and tribulations of Vera Rubin, a lady born around the time my grandmother who nailed down the evidence that made dark matter an indisputable fact of reality. She continually gets crap in the male dominated field of astronomy, but never gave up her interest in understanding the universe.I would call this book ""a romp."" If you've been missing the NOVA of 2008, when Brian Greene helped start the cascade of science documentaries that would end up in the Cosmos flop and YouTube taking over as physics-knowledge-distributor, this book is for you.

167,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,3,"I did myself a disservice by listening to this audiobook while running. I usually choose lighter fare for that -- since I must also attend to my immediate environment (i.e., traffic!). Some days I didn't feel like concentrating too hard and would listen to Steve Earle songs instead. I am also one of those ""innumerate"" types, and even though there wasn't much math the numbers would cause me to zone-out and then have to re-focus. So I kept losing the narrative thread, over days and sometimes over a single hour.Panek chronicles a gradually-amassing story of discovery: early cosmological science, quantum theory, Einstein, the earliest astronomical telescopes (he's written another book on telescopes alone), Hubble, supernovas, Guth, inflation... It's told largely through biographies of physicists and astronomers and their research, collaborations, and rivalries. Panek takes a really long time to even get to dark matter and dark energy -- since appreciating what they represent means understanding what we thought we knew before. It's a story of questions -- and what happens (is happening now) when the answer is even bigger question mark. "
168,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15155099-jacob,4,"This is the book about people who thought, or perhaps only hoped, they were on the third book of a sci-fi trilogy. The facts of the super massive and the super tiny were known, there just remained the small task of connecting the two by means of bridge. Unfortunately the bridge was Escheresque in its construction and utterly riddled with wormholes. And so it came to pass that like the Italian plumbers before them their princess was in another castle, quite possibly another universe entirely. And so what was the thought to be the last book turned out to be the end of prequel, or more(?) charitably, the first in a sequence of books by an author maliciously set upon milking every quid and copper from the wallets of their readership.Maybe.It’s really much too soon to say. It could still be a trilogy, but I doubt it.This book tells a series of stories that leads us to the precipice of human knowledge regarding the cosmos. Written in the rather wide middle space between overly remedial and too academic, it is a book that contrasts the vastness of the cosmos with the tales of ego and error that inevitably suffuse the people who search its depths.

That alone as the premise of a book should be mind-blowing but Panek fails to capture the magic of this fact. He perfectly captures the facts of it, the history, the personalities, the triumphs, the rivalries, but none of wonder that should be embedded in a story about discovering how little of the universe we can see.The stories presented were fresh. I knew of Alan Guth's double boxed discovery of cosmic inflation, I knew of the history of supernova identification, and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation but these received short treatment as the author knew they'd be covered elsewhere. The race for better methods, the wars between methods, and the press gambits were new and dare I say exciting but again, there was nothing behind it. This is a book about the triumph of the experimentalist to elucidate a weird universe we don't get. If that's the entire point, good job, Panek but that rings hollow to me."
170,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,4,"Sometimes I get stuck on an author and compare everything else I read in that genre to that author. Such is the case with Michio Kaku. I read Parallel Universes when it first came out and was blown away. As I wrote in my review, most of the book was way over my head but somehow I got a feel and glimmer of understanding for even those parts of the book that were. Kaku has a genius that makes the almost incomprehensible concepts in physics sometimes seem simple and obvious. The 4 Percent Universe did not leave me feeling that way. I would not say that Panek was unclear in the 4 Percent Universe. Actually, I had the feel that it was more a flat lesson in the history of science. It was a book that just had fewer revelations for me. With Kaku there were just so many ""Ah Ha"" moments. Hopefully, without sounding too hokey, when reading Kaku, there were moments of what felt like transcendence, an altered state of consciousness. Pretty high bar to set huh? Yeah, I know. Sorry, Richard Panek. You were just fine... just not Michio Kaku. "
171,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8731895-r-j-gilbert,2,"This book does one thing well: it provides a good example of both inspired science and Grant Theory. The first half of the book features individuals whose contribution to science begins with a personal passion and are driven onward by inspiration. The last half of the book is a wonderful look into the battles for funding, for recognition (which brings funding), and the politics of collaboration that is so often found in the scientific fields being choked by the weeds of Grant Theory. You can see quite clearly where the players begin to veer from the search for truth onto the quest for funding.I'm not sure why, but the author chose to organize his chapters by projects and discoveries rather than chronological events. At one point, this caused a player to die in one chapter only to give a news interview in the next. Was that an argument for entanglement (another GT buzz-word)?Okay, I'm done ranting. Suffice it to say, this book further shows me that science will only be advanced by those willing to follow the truth and not the path that funding tells them to follow."

Probably would have been better to read rather than listen to since the narrative tried to include a mention of almost every scientific discovery relating to dark matter and dark energy starting in 1964, but not in chronological order, and the mixture of acronyms and unfamiliar names of people and scientific terms made it difficult to follow. The author focused a great deal on the politics and egos involved in the discoveries rather than the science. That may appeal to a broader readership, but I was looking for more science. If you find the process and personalities of scientific research interesting and enjoy physics, this is probably a good way to get a glimpse inside extremely recent and potentially revolutionary developments that connect physics on the largest scales in astronomy with the smallest scales in particle physics. If you're looking for a careful explanation of the science, you will need to look elsewhere."

The other 96% is dark energy or dark matter. Isn’t that crazy! This book tells the story of the discoveries that led up to this amazing factoid. While some of the book contains technical jargon and facts that went right over my head, most of it tells the sometimes melodramatic story of scientists rushing to discover if the universe is expanding, contracting, or stable. Turns out that scientists can be petty, dramatic, and mean, but despite these human traits they still discovered amazing things. I enjoyed learning that even really smart people can be catty, and found the discoveries fascinating. Most astounding is that despite everything we do know, there is still so much more to learn!

These stories show the individuals who worked at science, and gives a sense of their humanity and personal struggles. It also depicts the struggle to discover and to accept a new and powerful understanding that the entire universe and all the stars and galaxies that we can see towards all infinity, all the stars that anyone has ever seen, is in reality a tiny, tiny fraction of all the matter and energy that inhabits the universe.The reviewing of these stories, to me, becomes a bit of mythology, like a hall of heroes"

These physicist have egos for sure. Both teams came to this same conclusion almost at the same time (Jan 1998)based on two entirely different data sets. Only 4% of the universe consists of atoms which emit energy so we can see them. 26% is dark matter (has mass but doesn't emit any energy so we can't see it). The rest is dark energy."

185,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90743-gala,3,"I read this book as a way to get my mind around the idea of dark matter before being paired with a dark matter researcher for an artist/scientist collaborative exhibition. While I really enjoyed the seismic idea movement in my understanding of the cosmos, I found that my understanding of the science was not great once I sat down with someone who is actually in the field. This could be, and probably is, a fault of my own, a lack of scientific background on which to hang these still exploratory concepts, but it also belies the danger behind popular scientific texts. Simplification of concepts sometimes obscures the data unintentionally. "

187,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This a highly readable history of the transformation of cosmology from metaphysics to physics, from philosophy and speculation to hard science, and in the process, the discovery of most of the universe.Historically, astronomy and physics didn't have a great deal to do with each other. Astronomers studied the stars by observation, very patient and detailed observation and record-keeping. Theoretical physicists theorized and calculated, and experimental physicists experimented, and they fed each other's work, very occasionally coming up with something, most notably gravity, that made a real difference to astronomy. Then Einstein gave us general relativity, and began a century of ever-deeper entanglement of physics and astronomy, and the transformation of cosmology--the study of the nature and origins of the entire universe--from something utterly beyond the scope of physics into its core. The questions of how big the universe is, whether it is eternal in space and time or had a beginning and might have an end, became real questions.Edwin Hubble, early in the century, discovered that the universe is expanding, but also that there are other galaxies beyond our own, and that they're all moving away from us. This was a major, exciting, and initially controversial change in our conception of the universe. In the 1960s, Vera Rubin, looking for a research project she could do within the constraints of raising two young children, studied other astronomers' observations and discovered that the galaxies were rotating as well as moving away from us. Also in the mid-1960s, Robert Dicke, Jim Peebles, and a small group of theoretical physicists had a prediction for which they had no supporting data: If the Big Bang theory of the history of the universe were correct, there should be low-level cosmic microwave radiation, at a temperature of about 3 degrees Kelvin. Then two astronomers at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, had data for which they had no explanation: While trying to calibrate the Bell Labs' Crawford Hill antenna to study radio waves from the fringes of the Milky Way, they found they had a tiny background hiss which no amount of calibration would eliminate. They'd found the background cosmic radiation, echo of the Big Bang.That's one small step along the way, from Einstein to the discovery that most of our universe is invisible. As the back and forth played out between the theoretical physicists and the experimental and observational scientists, increasingly astronomers, each theoretical question drew forth an observation, a find, a discovery that answered that question, and raised another. The most startling of these was the discovery that visible, directly detectable matter is just over 4% of the total make-up of a universe far larger and more complex than ever suspected at the start of the 20th century. If what we see were all there were, the galaxies would not be, could not be, relatively compact, stable spirals (or their other shapes), but should be torn apart by the speed of their rotation. Outside, among, around, the visible matter of the galaxies was dark matter.Dark matter was soon joined by the even more mysterious dark energy.The largest part of Panek's book is devoted to the research to detect and identify dark matter and dark energy, He takes us through not only the science, fascinating enough in itself, but also the human drama as two teams, one primarily physicists and the other primarily astronomers, raced against each other to gather enough observations of sufficiently distant (and therefore ancient) supernovae to answer essential questions about the conditions of the early universe. In the answers to those questions, and questions about changes since that early time, would lie the answers to the reality of dark energy, dark matter, and maybe the ultimate fate of the universe.Highly recommended.This book is not yet published but can be pre-ordered from Amazon or Barnes & Noble.I received a free electronic galley of this book from the publisher via NetGalley."
188,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131838-alan,5,"First of all, I am not a physicist or a cosmologist, though I am a scientist (biologist). Even so, I found this book to be fascinating. If you are like me you have learned or at least heard something about recent changes in our understanding of the universe. For example, there was the refinement of Newton's explanation of gravity by Einstein through his theories of relativity (the description of space time), then there was the Big Bang model of the universe developed by Hubble when he applied Einstein's physics to the developing field of cosmology. Later on there was the discovery that stars at the edges of spiral galaxies were going WAY faster than they should have been going based on the calcualted mass of stars in those galaxies (this was Vera Rubin's work), and from that the need for a larger mass than observed led to the concept of Dark Matter. Then, later, not only the inflation of the universe, but an accelerating rate of expansion called for a force large enough to overcome the force of gravity that should have eventually caused the universe to expand and then collapse on itself, though recent observations show that this is not to be...the universe really is accelerating its rate of inflation...and the need for Dark Energy was born. These ideas of an inflating universe, a Big Bang + Dark Matter + Dark Energy increasing acceleration universe is a fascinating model of our universe. If you are like me, you may periodically wonder not only how such a universe works, but how in the world observations were made that led to these conclusions. THIS is what this book is about. The book starts with a brief introduction to the field of cosmology (the structure and fate of the universe) starting with Aristotle and Ptolemy's geocentric model. That model was then revised into the heliocentric model through the work of Copernicus and the observations of Galileo. Then Newton revised things with his universal law of gravitation, only to be modified yet again by Einstein's explanation of space-time fabric and Hubble's expanding Big Bang universe that is made of many galaxies. The bulk of the book, however, focuses on work done in the last 50 years or so, including work done since 2000 when large teams of collaborating scientists raced to try to describe the universe and demonstrate through theory and observation what it is really like. Fortunately for someone like me, Panek describes all of this without delving into the deep end of physics and cosmology...the math. Even so, if you decide to tackle this book you need to be prepared to keep track of a variety of acronyms and terms about cosmic backround microwaves, lambda, omega, and other terms scientists use to refer to the nature of the universe. And, not only do we get a nice overview of the science, but we get an interesting view of how modern cosmology and physics are done. Be prepared to read about issues in scientific ethics, jealousy, mind-bending breakthroughts, and discovery after discovery that led to our modern view of the universe and how it works. I found this book to be a tough, but good 5-star offering, though it's probably a 4 star offering for the non-scientist...it will take some serious effort to keep everything straight, and I don't think I can claim that myself. Still, this is a fascinating tale of discovery."
189,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20534403-sue-von-roedern,4,Fascinating and mostly understandable introduction to the fate of the universe. I want to be an astrophysicist when I grow up. I guess that will have to be in my next life.
190,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,4,"The 4% Universe - 4% science...96% stories.That is this book in a nutshell. If you are looking for a book on the science behind Dark Matter and Dark Energy, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for the stories about the astonomers behind the discovery of both Dark Matter and Dark Energy, definitely pick up this book.Panek gives a lively account of how the discovery of these two elusive subjects came about. I would say the first 1/3 of the book focuses on Dark Matter, with the rest heavily revolving around Dark Energy. At times the writing was a bit over the top for me, however this book is anything but boring and Panek clearly did his research. There are lots of astronomers/physicists to keep track of, and at times Panek introduced a new name without ever telling us about them. For the most part, the narrative is easy to follow despite the many names, and the science is easy to understand. I don't know that I have ever read shorter descriptions of science that so easily and clearly got their point across.We learn about Vera Rubin and her discovery that galaxies rotate at the same speed no matter the distance from the galactic center, the intersection of particle physics and astronomy (cosmology), and the search for the 2 main questions in cosmology: what is the value of the Hubble Constant and how much has the expansion rate changed over time. But the majority of the narrative focuses on the two competing teams who discovered that the universe isn't just expanding...it's accelerating; the Supernova Cosmology project headed by Saul Perlmutter at Berkely and the High-z team headed by Brian Schmidt.In the first chapter Panek brings up an interesting theme of astronomy. We as humans are constantly thinking we can't understand something, only to figure it out through science. Ptolemy believed we would never understand the heavens, but with the invention of the telescope came that understanding. Or more recently thinking we can never know how the universe began because we can't go back in time, yet with the discovery of the CMB we came to an understanding for that too. Currently, there are theorists and astronomers who believe we will never truly know the nature of dark matter and dark energy. I think if history tells us anything, we need only have some patience and wait for that understanding to come as well."
191,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,2,"Cosmology, the science of the origin, evolution and the ultimate fate of the Universe, is a surprisingly young scientific discipline. For the most of history cosmological questions were dealt with through a philosophical or theological inquiry, but in the early part of the twentieth century it became possible to inquire about these things in a more systematic and scientific manner. The research in Cosmology really gained steam since the 1960s, when the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) put the Big Bang Theory on a very firm footing. However, the subsequent inquiry revealed something really intellectually curious and potentially disturbing about the Universe: we can only see a very tiny fraction of it. The vast proportion of the “stuff” that makes up the Universe, about 96% of it to be more precise, is invisible. We can only infer its existence from the gravitational effects it has on the “visible” matter. This “invisible” stuff came to be known by a very prosaic couple of names: dark matter and dark energy. The aim of “The 4% Universe” is to explain our best current understanding of what the dark matter and the dark energy are. The book provides some good physics background to all of these phenomena, and tries to explain how the observation and the research into these topics have progressed over the last half a century or so. Unfortunately, this book goes way overboard in taking the inside look at the workings of the physicists and the astronomers who do research on dark matter and dark energy. It narrates, in painful details sometimes, the comings and goings of the select groups of scientists as they conduct their research, grapple with work-family balance, and engage in petty turf wars with their colleagues and other competing research collaborations. For the most of the book I found myself bored to death with these minutiae – and I am a scientist! Furthermore, I found the information on the actual science, and physics aspects of it in particular, incredibly thin. Reading the Wikipedia articles on this topic is way more informative. This is definitely not a book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the Universe and its dark secrets. "
192,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"This is an excellent book detailing the birth of cosmology and the search for the true nature of the universe. More of a history book than anything else, there's no better account of the Copernican legacy and the evolution of metaphysics into a true field of science.One of the most compelling aspects of the book is the fact that it's all so new that ideas become risky and technology becomes the limiting factor for what we can discover. And while not having the complete story is nagging, it's a torturous glimpse into the necessity to understand that plagues these very scientists.A big plus is that the book is very well written. For example, the author employs a nice stylistic hook at the beginning of every chapter; He describes a scene where the people and setting remain anonymous for a paragraph or so, letting the story slowly come into view. ""What's he talking about? Where are they? Oh, Antarctica? Awesome.""One aspect of the book that was a bit of a bummer was that it painted the race to discovery as more of a frantic, sometimes bitter competition rather than a series of exciting innovations. The idea that a scientific career often hangs in the balance is very clear — and perhaps I'm being naive — but that sort of doe-eyed wonder that humans get looking up at the stars seemed lost on the protagonists from time to time.As is often a complaint of mine when reading such a book, I would have liked to hear more about the details of the experiments and the meat of the theories. The author could have easily gone a little more in depth without losing lay persons, if that was the concern. Or how about an appendix for the more dedicated reader in the next addition, Panek?Though a little heavy on squabbling scientists and light on the actual physics, The 4-Percent Universe is an extremely thorough historical account of the current state of knowledge regarding the fate of our reality. I really enjoyed it."
193,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7078788-christine-leov-lealand,5,"There isn't a lot to say about dark matter and dark energy - since everything we know about these prevalent universal items is from inferences. No one seems to have found or measured either yet. So reading a long scientific book about these alleged 'dark' ie unknown things isn't going to convince many people that they exist.What IS convincing is Panek's social history of modern cosmology. How generations of scientists working around the planet both collaborating and competing with each other - as they still are - and yet independently coming to the SAME Conclusion!Two competing teams trying to prove each other's findings wrong and failing. Amusing and convincing to laypeople like myself.This book is not dry or boring like most science seems to like to be. The concept of our universe [that which we perceive] being the equivalent of the froth on the coffee of the rapidly expanding universe is HUGE and I recommend this book to any science fiction writers to include these findings in your new work. I would remind all scientists that science is far from scientific. The topics studied and researched depend very much upon the very personal and far from objective decisions of the individuals involved. Not to mention the choices of funding organisations and institutions and even the time available on the telescopes! No amount of pretentiousness can disguise these human subjective limitations to scientific processes and achievements. 'The 4% Universe' underlines for the reader the fact that personal choices, competition and rivalry have had more of an impact upon cosmological research and the results reported today, than any over-reaching humanitarian goal to benefit mankind with their 'objective' findings about the history of the universe. Nobel Prize anyone?"
194,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"There are several things Panek does well in this book: if you've seen, out of the corner of your eye, headlines about ""universe inflation"", ""dark matter"", ""dark energy"", he does a good job of explaining what those are (at least, the stuff that's known about these things; there are still a lot of unanswered questions, like ""what the heck is dark energy, anyway?"")Just as importantly, he explains how scientists know what they know: the observations and experiments that led them to their conclusions. And he also talks about the people behind the science, their motivations and emotions, their doubts and rivalries, their hopes and arguments. And in the process, he shows us something about the process by which science is done, something we the public don't get to see very often.Unfortunately, the cast of characters is rather large, and I couldn't keep them all straight, or remember who was on the Princeton and who was on the Berkeley team, or even how the two teams differed in their approach and social structure. Some sort of chart would have been helpful, or at least photos of the main players, but the book offered no such help; at least, my ebook edition didn't.The picture that emerges is one of a weirder universe than I imagined, where scientists are led to accept seemingly-preposterous ideas – like the idea of a type of matter other than our usual protons and neutrons; and that there is several times more of this stuff than of ordinary stuff – by the force of observation. Like it or not, that's where the data points."
195,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241853-erin,4,"I'm not done yet, but my initial impression is positive. The thing I like about this book so far is how Panek puts the various discoveries in perspective. As an example, I definitely understood the concept of supernovas, as well as the fact that they pulsate and also the concept of red/blue light refraction. However, the way that Panek succinctly describes how that constant enabled discoveries about the way galaxies revolve, well, I dare you to find another writer who could have gotten the whole story into fewer words. I could give example after example of that type of synopsis in this book.I suppose if you're a PHD in Astronomy, you might find this book a very dummied-down review of the science with a few interesting anecdotes about the personal lives of the scientists covered. However, Panek is able to put scientific concepts in layman's terms in a way that is very accessible for non-scientists. Secondly, he tells the history in an entertaining way that you don't get in most textbooks. So, for the people who are writing reviews that Panek is not a good writer - I think you're wrong. In our textbooks and classrooms we are so concerned with ensuring students memorize the facts and the math that we don't teach the historical context in which discoveries were made (particularly in the field of cosmology). That, in turn stifles creativity and inhibits students from seeing the ""big picture"". So, kudo's to Panek for being able to write about cosmology in a way the average person can relate to. I'm definitely enjoying this book so far..."
196,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,5,"The 4 Percent Universe is classic PBS-bait. I mean that as a good thing: it is the story of the High-Z Supernova Search Team that competed against the Supernova Cosmology Project in order to determine the answer to the question: What is the ultimate fate of the universe?Panek brings his own philosophy of science to the book: experiments are necessary to prove things. He isn't going to throw around theory like Kaku or Krauss or Greene. He has no desire to explain to us the latest permutation of quantum gibberish being thrown around in theoretical departments. He wants to give us the chronology from Newton to where we are now, and he does a wonderful job. Experiment by experiment he conveys to us the chronology of cosmology up to the present state:a universe that has an accelerating expansion drive by dark energy, and giant filament structures of galaxies bound by dark matter halos. My favorite part of the book was about the trials and tribulations of Vera Rubin, a lady born around the time my grandmother who nailed down the evidence that made dark matter an indisputable fact of reality. She continually gets crap in the male dominated field of astronomy, but never gave up her interest in understanding the universe.I would call this book ""a romp."" If you've been missing the NOVA of 2008, when Brian Greene helped start the cascade of science documentaries that would end up in the Cosmos flop and YouTube taking over as physics-knowledge-distributor, this book is for you.

I usually choose lighter fare for that -- since I must also attend to my immediate environment (i.e., traffic!). Some days I didn't feel like concentrating too hard and would listen to Steve Earle songs instead. I am also one of those ""innumerate"" types, and even though there wasn't much math the numbers would cause me to zone-out and then have to re-focus. So I kept losing the narrative thread, over days and sometimes over a single hour.Panek chronicles a gradually-amassing story of discovery: early cosmological science, quantum theory, Einstein, the earliest astronomical telescopes (he's written another book on telescopes alone), Hubble, supernovas, Guth, inflation... It's told largely through biographies of physicists and astronomers and their research, collaborations, and rivalries. Panek takes a really long time to even get to dark matter and dark energy -- since appreciating what they represent means understanding what we thought we knew before. It's a story of questions -- and what happens (is happening now) when the answer is even bigger question mark. "

The facts of the super massive and the super tiny were known, there just remained the small task of connecting the two by means of bridge. Unfortunately the bridge was Escheresque in its construction and utterly riddled with wormholes. And so it came to pass that like the Italian plumbers before them their princess was in another castle, quite possibly another universe entirely. And so what was the thought to be the last book turned out to be the end of prequel, or more(?) charitably, the first in a sequence of books by an author maliciously set upon milking every quid and copper from the wallets of their readership.Maybe.It’s really much too soon to say. It could still be a trilogy, but I doubt it.This book tells a series of stories that leads us to the precipice of human knowledge regarding the cosmos. Written in the rather wide middle space between overly remedial and too academic, it is a book that contrasts the vastness of the cosmos with the tales of ego and error that inevitably suffuse the people who search its depths.

That alone as the premise of a book should be mind-blowing but Panek fails to capture the magic of this fact. He perfectly captures the facts of it, the history, the personalities, the triumphs, the rivalries, but none of wonder that should be embedded in a story about discovering how little of the universe we can see.The stories presented were fresh. I knew of Alan Guth's double boxed discovery of cosmic inflation, I knew of the history of supernova identification, and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation but these received short treatment as the author knew they'd be covered elsewhere. The race for better methods, the wars between methods, and the press gambits were new and dare I say exciting but again, there was nothing behind it. This is a book about the triumph of the experimentalist to elucidate a weird universe we don't get. If that's the entire point, good job, Panek but that rings hollow to me."

As I wrote in my review, most of the book was way over my head but somehow I got a feel and glimmer of understanding for even those parts of the book that were. Kaku has a genius that makes the almost incomprehensible concepts in physics sometimes seem simple and obvious. The 4 Percent Universe did not leave me feeling that way. I would not say that Panek was unclear in the 4 Percent Universe. Actually, I had the feel that it was more a flat lesson in the history of science. It was a book that just had fewer revelations for me. With Kaku there were just so many ""Ah Ha"" moments. Hopefully, without sounding too hokey, when reading Kaku, there were moments of what felt like transcendence, an altered state of consciousness. Pretty high bar to set huh? Yeah, I know. Sorry, Richard Panek. You were just fine... just not Michio Kaku. "
201,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8731895-r-j-gilbert,2,"This book does one thing well: it provides a good example of both inspired science and Grant Theory. The first half of the book features individuals whose contribution to science begins with a personal passion and are driven onward by inspiration. The last half of the book is a wonderful look into the battles for funding, for recognition (which brings funding), and the politics of collaboration that is so often found in the scientific fields being choked by the weeds of Grant Theory. You can see quite clearly where the players begin to veer from the search for truth onto the quest for funding.I'm not sure why, but the author chose to organize his chapters by projects and discoveries rather than chronological events. At one point, this caused a player to die in one chapter only to give a news interview in the next. Was that an argument for entanglement (another GT buzz-word)?Okay, I'm done ranting. Suffice it to say, this book further shows me that science will only be advanced by those willing to follow the truth and not the path that funding tells them to follow."
202,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060228-michelle,2,"I listened to the 9 cd audio version of this book. Probably would have been better to read rather than listen to since the narrative tried to include a mention of almost every scientific discovery relating to dark matter and dark energy starting in 1964, but not in chronological order, and the mixture of acronyms and unfamiliar names of people and scientific terms made it difficult to follow. The author focused a great deal on the politics and egos involved in the discoveries rather than the science. That may appeal to a broader readership, but I was looking for more science. If you find the process and personalities of scientific research interesting and enjoy physics, this is probably a good way to get a glimpse inside extremely recent and potentially revolutionary developments that connect physics on the largest scales in astronomy with the smallest scales in particle physics. If you're looking for a careful explanation of the science, you will need to look elsewhere."

The other 96% is dark energy or dark matter. Isn’t that crazy! This book tells the story of the discoveries that led up to this amazing factoid. While some of the book contains technical jargon and facts that went right over my head, most of it tells the sometimes melodramatic story of scientists rushing to discover if the universe is expanding, contracting, or stable. Turns out that scientists can be petty, dramatic, and mean, but despite these human traits they still discovered amazing things. I enjoyed learning that even really smart people can be catty, and found the discoveries fascinating. Most astounding is that despite everything we do know, there is still so much more to learn!

These stories show the individuals who worked at science, and gives a sense of their humanity and personal struggles. It also depicts the struggle to discover and to accept a new and powerful understanding that the entire universe and all the stars and galaxies that we can see towards all infinity, all the stars that anyone has ever seen, is in reality a tiny, tiny fraction of all the matter and energy that inhabits the universe.The reviewing of these stories, to me, becomes a bit of mythology, like a hall of heroes"

These physicist have egos for sure. Both teams came to this same conclusion almost at the same time (Jan 1998)based on two entirely different data sets. Only 4% of the universe consists of atoms which emit energy so we can see them. 26% is dark matter (has mass but doesn't emit any energy so we can't see it). The rest is dark energy."

While I really enjoyed the seismic idea movement in my understanding of the cosmos, I found that my understanding of the science was not great once I sat down with someone who is actually in the field. This could be, and probably is, a fault of my own, a lack of scientific background on which to hang these still exploratory concepts, but it also belies the danger behind popular scientific texts. Simplification of concepts sometimes obscures the data unintentionally. "

217,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This a highly readable history of the transformation of cosmology from metaphysics to physics, from philosophy and speculation to hard science, and in the process, the discovery of most of the universe.Historically, astronomy and physics didn't have a great deal to do with each other. Astronomers studied the stars by observation, very patient and detailed observation and record-keeping. Theoretical physicists theorized and calculated, and experimental physicists experimented, and they fed each other's work, very occasionally coming up with something, most notably gravity, that made a real difference to astronomy. Then Einstein gave us general relativity, and began a century of ever-deeper entanglement of physics and astronomy, and the transformation of cosmology--the study of the nature and origins of the entire universe--from something utterly beyond the scope of physics into its core. The questions of how big the universe is, whether it is eternal in space and time or had a beginning and might have an end, became real questions.Edwin Hubble, early in the century, discovered that the universe is expanding, but also that there are other galaxies beyond our own, and that they're all moving away from us. This was a major, exciting, and initially controversial change in our conception of the universe. In the 1960s, Vera Rubin, looking for a research project she could do within the constraints of raising two young children, studied other astronomers' observations and discovered that the galaxies were rotating as well as moving away from us. Also in the mid-1960s, Robert Dicke, Jim Peebles, and a small group of theoretical physicists had a prediction for which they had no supporting data: If the Big Bang theory of the history of the universe were correct, there should be low-level cosmic microwave radiation, at a temperature of about 3 degrees Kelvin. Then two astronomers at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, had data for which they had no explanation: While trying to calibrate the Bell Labs' Crawford Hill antenna to study radio waves from the fringes of the Milky Way, they found they had a tiny background hiss which no amount of calibration would eliminate. They'd found the background cosmic radiation, echo of the Big Bang.That's one small step along the way, from Einstein to the discovery that most of our universe is invisible. As the back and forth played out between the theoretical physicists and the experimental and observational scientists, increasingly astronomers, each theoretical question drew forth an observation, a find, a discovery that answered that question, and raised another. The most startling of these was the discovery that visible, directly detectable matter is just over 4% of the total make-up of a universe far larger and more complex than ever suspected at the start of the 20th century. If what we see were all there were, the galaxies would not be, could not be, relatively compact, stable spirals (or their other shapes), but should be torn apart by the speed of their rotation. Outside, among, around, the visible matter of the galaxies was dark matter.Dark matter was soon joined by the even more mysterious dark energy.The largest part of Panek's book is devoted to the research to detect and identify dark matter and dark energy, He takes us through not only the science, fascinating enough in itself, but also the human drama as two teams, one primarily physicists and the other primarily astronomers, raced against each other to gather enough observations of sufficiently distant (and therefore ancient) supernovae to answer essential questions about the conditions of the early universe. In the answers to those questions, and questions about changes since that early time, would lie the answers to the reality of dark energy, dark matter, and maybe the ultimate fate of the universe.Highly recommended.This book is not yet published but can be pre-ordered from Amazon or Barnes & Noble.I received a free electronic galley of this book from the publisher via NetGalley."
218,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131838-alan,5,"First of all, I am not a physicist or a cosmologist, though I am a scientist (biologist). Even so, I found this book to be fascinating. If you are like me you have learned or at least heard something about recent changes in our understanding of the universe. For example, there was the refinement of Newton's explanation of gravity by Einstein through his theories of relativity (the description of space time), then there was the Big Bang model of the universe developed by Hubble when he applied Einstein's physics to the developing field of cosmology. Later on there was the discovery that stars at the edges of spiral galaxies were going WAY faster than they should have been going based on the calcualted mass of stars in those galaxies (this was Vera Rubin's work), and from that the need for a larger mass than observed led to the concept of Dark Matter. Then, later, not only the inflation of the universe, but an accelerating rate of expansion called for a force large enough to overcome the force of gravity that should have eventually caused the universe to expand and then collapse on itself, though recent observations show that this is not to be...the universe really is accelerating its rate of inflation...and the need for Dark Energy was born. These ideas of an inflating universe, a Big Bang + Dark Matter + Dark Energy increasing acceleration universe is a fascinating model of our universe. If you are like me, you may periodically wonder not only how such a universe works, but how in the world observations were made that led to these conclusions. THIS is what this book is about. The book starts with a brief introduction to the field of cosmology (the structure and fate of the universe) starting with Aristotle and Ptolemy's geocentric model. That model was then revised into the heliocentric model through the work of Copernicus and the observations of Galileo. Then Newton revised things with his universal law of gravitation, only to be modified yet again by Einstein's explanation of space-time fabric and Hubble's expanding Big Bang universe that is made of many galaxies. The bulk of the book, however, focuses on work done in the last 50 years or so, including work done since 2000 when large teams of collaborating scientists raced to try to describe the universe and demonstrate through theory and observation what it is really like. Fortunately for someone like me, Panek describes all of this without delving into the deep end of physics and cosmology...the math. Even so, if you decide to tackle this book you need to be prepared to keep track of a variety of acronyms and terms about cosmic backround microwaves, lambda, omega, and other terms scientists use to refer to the nature of the universe. And, not only do we get a nice overview of the science, but we get an interesting view of how modern cosmology and physics are done. Be prepared to read about issues in scientific ethics, jealousy, mind-bending breakthroughts, and discovery after discovery that led to our modern view of the universe and how it works. I found this book to be a tough, but good 5-star offering, though it's probably a 4 star offering for the non-scientist...it will take some serious effort to keep everything straight, and I don't think I can claim that myself. Still, this is a fascinating tale of discovery."

220,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,4,"The 4% Universe - 4% science...96% stories.That is this book in a nutshell. If you are looking for a book on the science behind Dark Matter and Dark Energy, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for the stories about the astonomers behind the discovery of both Dark Matter and Dark Energy, definitely pick up this book.Panek gives a lively account of how the discovery of these two elusive subjects came about. I would say the first 1/3 of the book focuses on Dark Matter, with the rest heavily revolving around Dark Energy. At times the writing was a bit over the top for me, however this book is anything but boring and Panek clearly did his research. There are lots of astronomers/physicists to keep track of, and at times Panek introduced a new name without ever telling us about them. For the most part, the narrative is easy to follow despite the many names, and the science is easy to understand. I don't know that I have ever read shorter descriptions of science that so easily and clearly got their point across.We learn about Vera Rubin and her discovery that galaxies rotate at the same speed no matter the distance from the galactic center, the intersection of particle physics and astronomy (cosmology), and the search for the 2 main questions in cosmology: what is the value of the Hubble Constant and how much has the expansion rate changed over time. But the majority of the narrative focuses on the two competing teams who discovered that the universe isn't just expanding...it's accelerating; the Supernova Cosmology project headed by Saul Perlmutter at Berkely and the High-z team headed by Brian Schmidt.In the first chapter Panek brings up an interesting theme of astronomy. We as humans are constantly thinking we can't understand something, only to figure it out through science. Ptolemy believed we would never understand the heavens, but with the invention of the telescope came that understanding. Or more recently thinking we can never know how the universe began because we can't go back in time, yet with the discovery of the CMB we came to an understanding for that too. Currently, there are theorists and astronomers who believe we will never truly know the nature of dark matter and dark energy. I think if history tells us anything, we need only have some patience and wait for that understanding to come as well."
221,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,2,"Cosmology, the science of the origin, evolution and the ultimate fate of the Universe, is a surprisingly young scientific discipline. For the most of history cosmological questions were dealt with through a philosophical or theological inquiry, but in the early part of the twentieth century it became possible to inquire about these things in a more systematic and scientific manner. The research in Cosmology really gained steam since the 1960s, when the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) put the Big Bang Theory on a very firm footing. However, the subsequent inquiry revealed something really intellectually curious and potentially disturbing about the Universe: we can only see a very tiny fraction of it. The vast proportion of the “stuff” that makes up the Universe, about 96% of it to be more precise, is invisible. We can only infer its existence from the gravitational effects it has on the “visible” matter. This “invisible” stuff came to be known by a very prosaic couple of names: dark matter and dark energy. The aim of “The 4% Universe” is to explain our best current understanding of what the dark matter and the dark energy are. The book provides some good physics background to all of these phenomena, and tries to explain how the observation and the research into these topics have progressed over the last half a century or so. Unfortunately, this book goes way overboard in taking the inside look at the workings of the physicists and the astronomers who do research on dark matter and dark energy. It narrates, in painful details sometimes, the comings and goings of the select groups of scientists as they conduct their research, grapple with work-family balance, and engage in petty turf wars with their colleagues and other competing research collaborations. For the most of the book I found myself bored to death with these minutiae – and I am a scientist! Furthermore, I found the information on the actual science, and physics aspects of it in particular, incredibly thin. Reading the Wikipedia articles on this topic is way more informative. This is definitely not a book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the Universe and its dark secrets. "
222,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"This is an excellent book detailing the birth of cosmology and the search for the true nature of the universe. More of a history book than anything else, there's no better account of the Copernican legacy and the evolution of metaphysics into a true field of science.One of the most compelling aspects of the book is the fact that it's all so new that ideas become risky and technology becomes the limiting factor for what we can discover. And while not having the complete story is nagging, it's a torturous glimpse into the necessity to understand that plagues these very scientists.A big plus is that the book is very well written. For example, the author employs a nice stylistic hook at the beginning of every chapter; He describes a scene where the people and setting remain anonymous for a paragraph or so, letting the story slowly come into view. ""What's he talking about? Where are they? Oh, Antarctica? Awesome.""One aspect of the book that was a bit of a bummer was that it painted the race to discovery as more of a frantic, sometimes bitter competition rather than a series of exciting innovations. The idea that a scientific career often hangs in the balance is very clear — and perhaps I'm being naive — but that sort of doe-eyed wonder that humans get looking up at the stars seemed lost on the protagonists from time to time.As is often a complaint of mine when reading such a book, I would have liked to hear more about the details of the experiments and the meat of the theories. The author could have easily gone a little more in depth without losing lay persons, if that was the concern. Or how about an appendix for the more dedicated reader in the next addition, Panek?Though a little heavy on squabbling scientists and light on the actual physics, The 4-Percent Universe is an extremely thorough historical account of the current state of knowledge regarding the fate of our reality. I really enjoyed it."
223,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7078788-christine-leov-lealand,5,"There isn't a lot to say about dark matter and dark energy - since everything we know about these prevalent universal items is from inferences. No one seems to have found or measured either yet. So reading a long scientific book about these alleged 'dark' ie unknown things isn't going to convince many people that they exist.What IS convincing is Panek's social history of modern cosmology. How generations of scientists working around the planet both collaborating and competing with each other - as they still are - and yet independently coming to the SAME Conclusion!Two competing teams trying to prove each other's findings wrong and failing. Amusing and convincing to laypeople like myself.This book is not dry or boring like most science seems to like to be. The concept of our universe [that which we perceive] being the equivalent of the froth on the coffee of the rapidly expanding universe is HUGE and I recommend this book to any science fiction writers to include these findings in your new work. I would remind all scientists that science is far from scientific. The topics studied and researched depend very much upon the very personal and far from objective decisions of the individuals involved. Not to mention the choices of funding organisations and institutions and even the time available on the telescopes! No amount of pretentiousness can disguise these human subjective limitations to scientific processes and achievements. 'The 4% Universe' underlines for the reader the fact that personal choices, competition and rivalry have had more of an impact upon cosmological research and the results reported today, than any over-reaching humanitarian goal to benefit mankind with their 'objective' findings about the history of the universe. Nobel Prize anyone?"
224,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"There are several things Panek does well in this book: if you've seen, out of the corner of your eye, headlines about ""universe inflation"", ""dark matter"", ""dark energy"", he does a good job of explaining what those are (at least, the stuff that's known about these things; there are still a lot of unanswered questions, like ""what the heck is dark energy, anyway?"")Just as importantly, he explains how scientists know what they know: the observations and experiments that led them to their conclusions. And he also talks about the people behind the science, their motivations and emotions, their doubts and rivalries, their hopes and arguments. And in the process, he shows us something about the process by which science is done, something we the public don't get to see very often.Unfortunately, the cast of characters is rather large, and I couldn't keep them all straight, or remember who was on the Princeton and who was on the Berkeley team, or even how the two teams differed in their approach and social structure. Some sort of chart would have been helpful, or at least photos of the main players, but the book offered no such help; at least, my ebook edition didn't.The picture that emerges is one of a weirder universe than I imagined, where scientists are led to accept seemingly-preposterous ideas – like the idea of a type of matter other than our usual protons and neutrons; and that there is several times more of this stuff than of ordinary stuff – by the force of observation. Like it or not, that's where the data points."
225,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241853-erin,4,"I'm not done yet, but my initial impression is positive. The thing I like about this book so far is how Panek puts the various discoveries in perspective. As an example, I definitely understood the concept of supernovas, as well as the fact that they pulsate and also the concept of red/blue light refraction. However, the way that Panek succinctly describes how that constant enabled discoveries about the way galaxies revolve, well, I dare you to find another writer who could have gotten the whole story into fewer words. I could give example after example of that type of synopsis in this book.I suppose if you're a PHD in Astronomy, you might find this book a very dummied-down review of the science with a few interesting anecdotes about the personal lives of the scientists covered. However, Panek is able to put scientific concepts in layman's terms in a way that is very accessible for non-scientists. Secondly, he tells the history in an entertaining way that you don't get in most textbooks. So, for the people who are writing reviews that Panek is not a good writer - I think you're wrong. In our textbooks and classrooms we are so concerned with ensuring students memorize the facts and the math that we don't teach the historical context in which discoveries were made (particularly in the field of cosmology). That, in turn stifles creativity and inhibits students from seeing the ""big picture"". So, kudo's to Panek for being able to write about cosmology in a way the average person can relate to. I'm definitely enjoying this book so far..."
226,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,5,"The 4 Percent Universe is classic PBS-bait. I mean that as a good thing: it is the story of the High-Z Supernova Search Team that competed against the Supernova Cosmology Project in order to determine the answer to the question: What is the ultimate fate of the universe?Panek brings his own philosophy of science to the book: experiments are necessary to prove things. He isn't going to throw around theory like Kaku or Krauss or Greene. He has no desire to explain to us the latest permutation of quantum gibberish being thrown around in theoretical departments. He wants to give us the chronology from Newton to where we are now, and he does a wonderful job. Experiment by experiment he conveys to us the chronology of cosmology up to the present state:a universe that has an accelerating expansion drive by dark energy, and giant filament structures of galaxies bound by dark matter halos. My favorite part of the book was about the trials and tribulations of Vera Rubin, a lady born around the time my grandmother who nailed down the evidence that made dark matter an indisputable fact of reality. She continually gets crap in the male dominated field of astronomy, but never gave up her interest in understanding the universe.I would call this book ""a romp."" If you've been missing the NOVA of 2008, when Brian Greene helped start the cascade of science documentaries that would end up in the Cosmos flop and YouTube taking over as physics-knowledge-distributor, this book is for you.

227,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,3,"I did myself a disservice by listening to this audiobook while running. I usually choose lighter fare for that -- since I must also attend to my immediate environment (i.e., traffic!). Some days I didn't feel like concentrating too hard and would listen to Steve Earle songs instead. I am also one of those ""innumerate"" types, and even though there wasn't much math the numbers would cause me to zone-out and then have to re-focus. So I kept losing the narrative thread, over days and sometimes over a single hour.Panek chronicles a gradually-amassing story of discovery: early cosmological science, quantum theory, Einstein, the earliest astronomical telescopes (he's written another book on telescopes alone), Hubble, supernovas, Guth, inflation... It's told largely through biographies of physicists and astronomers and their research, collaborations, and rivalries. Panek takes a really long time to even get to dark matter and dark energy -- since appreciating what they represent means understanding what we thought we knew before. It's a story of questions -- and what happens (is happening now) when the answer is even bigger question mark. "
228,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15155099-jacob,4,"This is the book about people who thought, or perhaps only hoped, they were on the third book of a sci-fi trilogy. The facts of the super massive and the super tiny were known, there just remained the small task of connecting the two by means of bridge. Unfortunately the bridge was Escheresque in its construction and utterly riddled with wormholes. And so it came to pass that like the Italian plumbers before them their princess was in another castle, quite possibly another universe entirely. And so what was the thought to be the last book turned out to be the end of prequel, or more(?) charitably, the first in a sequence of books by an author maliciously set upon milking every quid and copper from the wallets of their readership.Maybe.It’s really much too soon to say. It could still be a trilogy, but I doubt it.This book tells a series of stories that leads us to the precipice of human knowledge regarding the cosmos. Written in the rather wide middle space between overly remedial and too academic, it is a book that contrasts the vastness of the cosmos with the tales of ego and error that inevitably suffuse the people who search its depths.

229,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,2,"We can only see (EM spectrum) about 1/25th of the mass in the known universe. That alone as the premise of a book should be mind-blowing but Panek fails to capture the magic of this fact. He perfectly captures the facts of it, the history, the personalities, the triumphs, the rivalries, but none of wonder that should be embedded in a story about discovering how little of the universe we can see.The stories presented were fresh. I knew of Alan Guth's double boxed discovery of cosmic inflation, I knew of the history of supernova identification, and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation but these received short treatment as the author knew they'd be covered elsewhere. The race for better methods, the wars between methods, and the press gambits were new and dare I say exciting but again, there was nothing behind it. This is a book about the triumph of the experimentalist to elucidate a weird universe we don't get. If that's the entire point, good job, Panek but that rings hollow to me."
230,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,4,"Sometimes I get stuck on an author and compare everything else I read in that genre to that author. Such is the case with Michio Kaku. I read Parallel Universes when it first came out and was blown away. As I wrote in my review, most of the book was way over my head but somehow I got a feel and glimmer of understanding for even those parts of the book that were. Kaku has a genius that makes the almost incomprehensible concepts in physics sometimes seem simple and obvious. The 4 Percent Universe did not leave me feeling that way. I would not say that Panek was unclear in the 4 Percent Universe. Actually, I had the feel that it was more a flat lesson in the history of science. It was a book that just had fewer revelations for me. With Kaku there were just so many ""Ah Ha"" moments. Hopefully, without sounding too hokey, when reading Kaku, there were moments of what felt like transcendence, an altered state of consciousness. Pretty high bar to set huh? Yeah, I know. Sorry, Richard Panek. You were just fine... just not Michio Kaku. "
231,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8731895-r-j-gilbert,2,"This book does one thing well: it provides a good example of both inspired science and Grant Theory. The first half of the book features individuals whose contribution to science begins with a personal passion and are driven onward by inspiration. The last half of the book is a wonderful look into the battles for funding, for recognition (which brings funding), and the politics of collaboration that is so often found in the scientific fields being choked by the weeds of Grant Theory. You can see quite clearly where the players begin to veer from the search for truth onto the quest for funding.I'm not sure why, but the author chose to organize his chapters by projects and discoveries rather than chronological events. At one point, this caused a player to die in one chapter only to give a news interview in the next. Was that an argument for entanglement (another GT buzz-word)?Okay, I'm done ranting. Suffice it to say, this book further shows me that science will only be advanced by those willing to follow the truth and not the path that funding tells them to follow."
232,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060228-michelle,2,"I listened to the 9 cd audio version of this book. Probably would have been better to read rather than listen to since the narrative tried to include a mention of almost every scientific discovery relating to dark matter and dark energy starting in 1964, but not in chronological order, and the mixture of acronyms and unfamiliar names of people and scientific terms made it difficult to follow. The author focused a great deal on the politics and egos involved in the discoveries rather than the science. That may appeal to a broader readership, but I was looking for more science. If you find the process and personalities of scientific research interesting and enjoy physics, this is probably a good way to get a glimpse inside extremely recent and potentially revolutionary developments that connect physics on the largest scales in astronomy with the smallest scales in particle physics. If you're looking for a careful explanation of the science, you will need to look elsewhere."

The other 96% is dark energy or dark matter. Isn’t that crazy! This book tells the story of the discoveries that led up to this amazing factoid. While some of the book contains technical jargon and facts that went right over my head, most of it tells the sometimes melodramatic story of scientists rushing to discover if the universe is expanding, contracting, or stable. Turns out that scientists can be petty, dramatic, and mean, but despite these human traits they still discovered amazing things. I enjoyed learning that even really smart people can be catty, and found the discoveries fascinating. Most astounding is that despite everything we do know, there is still so much more to learn!

Unlike some of the quantum mechanics stuff, I had a harder time following the science so I had to do some translating as I tried following along (why are they trying to find what now?).

These stories show the individuals who worked at science, and gives a sense of their humanity and personal struggles. It also depicts the struggle to discover and to accept a new and powerful understanding that the entire universe and all the stars and galaxies that we can see towards all infinity, all the stars that anyone has ever seen, is in reality a tiny, tiny fraction of all the matter and energy that inhabits the universe.The reviewing of these stories, to me, becomes a bit of mythology, like a hall of heroes"

The most interesting part of the story deals with two research teams (one at MIT and one at Berkeley) who are competing to see if Super Nova can be used a light references to determine how old the universe is and confirm that the universe is still expanding and will continue to expand forever (so the current theory goes). These physicist have egos for sure. Both teams came to this same conclusion almost at the same time (Jan 1998)based on two entirely different data sets. Only 4% of the universe consists of atoms which emit energy so we can see them. 26% is dark matter (has mass but doesn't emit any energy so we can't see it). The rest is dark energy."

Modern cosmology has two groups of scientist working (the astronomers and the physicists) to solve this puzzle. Both are very different in how they work and how they think. But the answers that they hope to find will change the way we look at the universe forever!

While I really enjoyed the seismic idea movement in my understanding of the cosmos, I found that my understanding of the science was not great once I sat down with someone who is actually in the field. This could be, and probably is, a fault of my own, a lack of scientific background on which to hang these still exploratory concepts, but it also belies the danger behind popular scientific texts. Simplification of concepts sometimes obscures the data unintentionally. "

247,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This a highly readable history of the transformation of cosmology from metaphysics to physics, from philosophy and speculation to hard science, and in the process, the discovery of most of the universe.Historically, astronomy and physics didn't have a great deal to do with each other. Astronomers studied the stars by observation, very patient and detailed observation and record-keeping. Theoretical physicists theorized and calculated, and experimental physicists experimented, and they fed each other's work, very occasionally coming up with something, most notably gravity, that made a real difference to astronomy. Then Einstein gave us general relativity, and began a century of ever-deeper entanglement of physics and astronomy, and the transformation of cosmology--the study of the nature and origins of the entire universe--from something utterly beyond the scope of physics into its core. The questions of how big the universe is, whether it is eternal in space and time or had a beginning and might have an end, became real questions.Edwin Hubble, early in the century, discovered that the universe is expanding, but also that there are other galaxies beyond our own, and that they're all moving away from us. This was a major, exciting, and initially controversial change in our conception of the universe. In the 1960s, Vera Rubin, looking for a research project she could do within the constraints of raising two young children, studied other astronomers' observations and discovered that the galaxies were rotating as well as moving away from us. Also in the mid-1960s, Robert Dicke, Jim Peebles, and a small group of theoretical physicists had a prediction for which they had no supporting data: If the Big Bang theory of the history of the universe were correct, there should be low-level cosmic microwave radiation, at a temperature of about 3 degrees Kelvin. Then two astronomers at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, had data for which they had no explanation: While trying to calibrate the Bell Labs' Crawford Hill antenna to study radio waves from the fringes of the Milky Way, they found they had a tiny background hiss which no amount of calibration would eliminate. They'd found the background cosmic radiation, echo of the Big Bang.That's one small step along the way, from Einstein to the discovery that most of our universe is invisible. As the back and forth played out between the theoretical physicists and the experimental and observational scientists, increasingly astronomers, each theoretical question drew forth an observation, a find, a discovery that answered that question, and raised another. The most startling of these was the discovery that visible, directly detectable matter is just over 4% of the total make-up of a universe far larger and more complex than ever suspected at the start of the 20th century. If what we see were all there were, the galaxies would not be, could not be, relatively compact, stable spirals (or their other shapes), but should be torn apart by the speed of their rotation. Outside, among, around, the visible matter of the galaxies was dark matter.Dark matter was soon joined by the even more mysterious dark energy.The largest part of Panek's book is devoted to the research to detect and identify dark matter and dark energy, He takes us through not only the science, fascinating enough in itself, but also the human drama as two teams, one primarily physicists and the other primarily astronomers, raced against each other to gather enough observations of sufficiently distant (and therefore ancient) supernovae to answer essential questions about the conditions of the early universe. In the answers to those questions, and questions about changes since that early time, would lie the answers to the reality of dark energy, dark matter, and maybe the ultimate fate of the universe.Highly recommended.This book is not yet published but can be pre-ordered from Amazon or Barnes & Noble.I received a free electronic galley of this book from the publisher via NetGalley."
248,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131838-alan,5,"First of all, I am not a physicist or a cosmologist, though I am a scientist (biologist). Even so, I found this book to be fascinating. If you are like me you have learned or at least heard something about recent changes in our understanding of the universe. For example, there was the refinement of Newton's explanation of gravity by Einstein through his theories of relativity (the description of space time), then there was the Big Bang model of the universe developed by Hubble when he applied Einstein's physics to the developing field of cosmology. Later on there was the discovery that stars at the edges of spiral galaxies were going WAY faster than they should have been going based on the calcualted mass of stars in those galaxies (this was Vera Rubin's work), and from that the need for a larger mass than observed led to the concept of Dark Matter. Then, later, not only the inflation of the universe, but an accelerating rate of expansion called for a force large enough to overcome the force of gravity that should have eventually caused the universe to expand and then collapse on itself, though recent observations show that this is not to be...the universe really is accelerating its rate of inflation...and the need for Dark Energy was born. These ideas of an inflating universe, a Big Bang + Dark Matter + Dark Energy increasing acceleration universe is a fascinating model of our universe. If you are like me, you may periodically wonder not only how such a universe works, but how in the world observations were made that led to these conclusions. THIS is what this book is about. The book starts with a brief introduction to the field of cosmology (the structure and fate of the universe) starting with Aristotle and Ptolemy's geocentric model. That model was then revised into the heliocentric model through the work of Copernicus and the observations of Galileo. Then Newton revised things with his universal law of gravitation, only to be modified yet again by Einstein's explanation of space-time fabric and Hubble's expanding Big Bang universe that is made of many galaxies. The bulk of the book, however, focuses on work done in the last 50 years or so, including work done since 2000 when large teams of collaborating scientists raced to try to describe the universe and demonstrate through theory and observation what it is really like. Fortunately for someone like me, Panek describes all of this without delving into the deep end of physics and cosmology...the math. Even so, if you decide to tackle this book you need to be prepared to keep track of a variety of acronyms and terms about cosmic backround microwaves, lambda, omega, and other terms scientists use to refer to the nature of the universe. And, not only do we get a nice overview of the science, but we get an interesting view of how modern cosmology and physics are done. Be prepared to read about issues in scientific ethics, jealousy, mind-bending breakthroughts, and discovery after discovery that led to our modern view of the universe and how it works. I found this book to be a tough, but good 5-star offering, though it's probably a 4 star offering for the non-scientist...it will take some serious effort to keep everything straight, and I don't think I can claim that myself. Still, this is a fascinating tale of discovery."
249,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20534403-sue-von-roedern,4,Fascinating and mostly understandable introduction to the fate of the universe. I want to be an astrophysicist when I grow up. I guess that will have to be in my next life.
250,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,4,"The 4% Universe - 4% science...96% stories.That is this book in a nutshell. If you are looking for a book on the science behind Dark Matter and Dark Energy, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for the stories about the astonomers behind the discovery of both Dark Matter and Dark Energy, definitely pick up this book.Panek gives a lively account of how the discovery of these two elusive subjects came about. I would say the first 1/3 of the book focuses on Dark Matter, with the rest heavily revolving around Dark Energy. At times the writing was a bit over the top for me, however this book is anything but boring and Panek clearly did his research. There are lots of astronomers/physicists to keep track of, and at times Panek introduced a new name without ever telling us about them. For the most part, the narrative is easy to follow despite the many names, and the science is easy to understand. I don't know that I have ever read shorter descriptions of science that so easily and clearly got their point across.We learn about Vera Rubin and her discovery that galaxies rotate at the same speed no matter the distance from the galactic center, the intersection of particle physics and astronomy (cosmology), and the search for the 2 main questions in cosmology: what is the value of the Hubble Constant and how much has the expansion rate changed over time. But the majority of the narrative focuses on the two competing teams who discovered that the universe isn't just expanding...it's accelerating; the Supernova Cosmology project headed by Saul Perlmutter at Berkely and the High-z team headed by Brian Schmidt.In the first chapter Panek brings up an interesting theme of astronomy. We as humans are constantly thinking we can't understand something, only to figure it out through science. Ptolemy believed we would never understand the heavens, but with the invention of the telescope came that understanding. Or more recently thinking we can never know how the universe began because we can't go back in time, yet with the discovery of the CMB we came to an understanding for that too. Currently, there are theorists and astronomers who believe we will never truly know the nature of dark matter and dark energy. I think if history tells us anything, we need only have some patience and wait for that understanding to come as well."
251,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,2,"Cosmology, the science of the origin, evolution and the ultimate fate of the Universe, is a surprisingly young scientific discipline. For the most of history cosmological questions were dealt with through a philosophical or theological inquiry, but in the early part of the twentieth century it became possible to inquire about these things in a more systematic and scientific manner. The research in Cosmology really gained steam since the 1960s, when the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) put the Big Bang Theory on a very firm footing. However, the subsequent inquiry revealed something really intellectually curious and potentially disturbing about the Universe: we can only see a very tiny fraction of it. The vast proportion of the “stuff” that makes up the Universe, about 96% of it to be more precise, is invisible. We can only infer its existence from the gravitational effects it has on the “visible” matter. This “invisible” stuff came to be known by a very prosaic couple of names: dark matter and dark energy. The aim of “The 4% Universe” is to explain our best current understanding of what the dark matter and the dark energy are. The book provides some good physics background to all of these phenomena, and tries to explain how the observation and the research into these topics have progressed over the last half a century or so. Unfortunately, this book goes way overboard in taking the inside look at the workings of the physicists and the astronomers who do research on dark matter and dark energy. It narrates, in painful details sometimes, the comings and goings of the select groups of scientists as they conduct their research, grapple with work-family balance, and engage in petty turf wars with their colleagues and other competing research collaborations. For the most of the book I found myself bored to death with these minutiae – and I am a scientist! Furthermore, I found the information on the actual science, and physics aspects of it in particular, incredibly thin. Reading the Wikipedia articles on this topic is way more informative. This is definitely not a book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the Universe and its dark secrets. "
252,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"This is an excellent book detailing the birth of cosmology and the search for the true nature of the universe. More of a history book than anything else, there's no better account of the Copernican legacy and the evolution of metaphysics into a true field of science.One of the most compelling aspects of the book is the fact that it's all so new that ideas become risky and technology becomes the limiting factor for what we can discover. And while not having the complete story is nagging, it's a torturous glimpse into the necessity to understand that plagues these very scientists.A big plus is that the book is very well written. For example, the author employs a nice stylistic hook at the beginning of every chapter; He describes a scene where the people and setting remain anonymous for a paragraph or so, letting the story slowly come into view. ""What's he talking about? Where are they? Oh, Antarctica? Awesome.""One aspect of the book that was a bit of a bummer was that it painted the race to discovery as more of a frantic, sometimes bitter competition rather than a series of exciting innovations. The idea that a scientific career often hangs in the balance is very clear — and perhaps I'm being naive — but that sort of doe-eyed wonder that humans get looking up at the stars seemed lost on the protagonists from time to time.As is often a complaint of mine when reading such a book, I would have liked to hear more about the details of the experiments and the meat of the theories. The author could have easily gone a little more in depth without losing lay persons, if that was the concern. Or how about an appendix for the more dedicated reader in the next addition, Panek?Though a little heavy on squabbling scientists and light on the actual physics, The 4-Percent Universe is an extremely thorough historical account of the current state of knowledge regarding the fate of our reality. I really enjoyed it."
253,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7078788-christine-leov-lealand,5,"There isn't a lot to say about dark matter and dark energy - since everything we know about these prevalent universal items is from inferences. No one seems to have found or measured either yet. So reading a long scientific book about these alleged 'dark' ie unknown things isn't going to convince many people that they exist.What IS convincing is Panek's social history of modern cosmology. How generations of scientists working around the planet both collaborating and competing with each other - as they still are - and yet independently coming to the SAME Conclusion!Two competing teams trying to prove each other's findings wrong and failing. Amusing and convincing to laypeople like myself.This book is not dry or boring like most science seems to like to be. The concept of our universe [that which we perceive] being the equivalent of the froth on the coffee of the rapidly expanding universe is HUGE and I recommend this book to any science fiction writers to include these findings in your new work. I would remind all scientists that science is far from scientific. The topics studied and researched depend very much upon the very personal and far from objective decisions of the individuals involved. Not to mention the choices of funding organisations and institutions and even the time available on the telescopes! No amount of pretentiousness can disguise these human subjective limitations to scientific processes and achievements. 'The 4% Universe' underlines for the reader the fact that personal choices, competition and rivalry have had more of an impact upon cosmological research and the results reported today, than any over-reaching humanitarian goal to benefit mankind with their 'objective' findings about the history of the universe. Nobel Prize anyone?"
254,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"There are several things Panek does well in this book: if you've seen, out of the corner of your eye, headlines about ""universe inflation"", ""dark matter"", ""dark energy"", he does a good job of explaining what those are (at least, the stuff that's known about these things; there are still a lot of unanswered questions, like ""what the heck is dark energy, anyway?"")Just as importantly, he explains how scientists know what they know: the observations and experiments that led them to their conclusions. And he also talks about the people behind the science, their motivations and emotions, their doubts and rivalries, their hopes and arguments. And in the process, he shows us something about the process by which science is done, something we the public don't get to see very often.Unfortunately, the cast of characters is rather large, and I couldn't keep them all straight, or remember who was on the Princeton and who was on the Berkeley team, or even how the two teams differed in their approach and social structure. Some sort of chart would have been helpful, or at least photos of the main players, but the book offered no such help; at least, my ebook edition didn't.The picture that emerges is one of a weirder universe than I imagined, where scientists are led to accept seemingly-preposterous ideas – like the idea of a type of matter other than our usual protons and neutrons; and that there is several times more of this stuff than of ordinary stuff – by the force of observation. Like it or not, that's where the data points."
255,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241853-erin,4,"I'm not done yet, but my initial impression is positive. The thing I like about this book so far is how Panek puts the various discoveries in perspective. As an example, I definitely understood the concept of supernovas, as well as the fact that they pulsate and also the concept of red/blue light refraction. However, the way that Panek succinctly describes how that constant enabled discoveries about the way galaxies revolve, well, I dare you to find another writer who could have gotten the whole story into fewer words. I could give example after example of that type of synopsis in this book.I suppose if you're a PHD in Astronomy, you might find this book a very dummied-down review of the science with a few interesting anecdotes about the personal lives of the scientists covered. However, Panek is able to put scientific concepts in layman's terms in a way that is very accessible for non-scientists. Secondly, he tells the history in an entertaining way that you don't get in most textbooks. So, for the people who are writing reviews that Panek is not a good writer - I think you're wrong. In our textbooks and classrooms we are so concerned with ensuring students memorize the facts and the math that we don't teach the historical context in which discoveries were made (particularly in the field of cosmology). That, in turn stifles creativity and inhibits students from seeing the ""big picture"". So, kudo's to Panek for being able to write about cosmology in a way the average person can relate to. I'm definitely enjoying this book so far..."
256,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,5,"The 4 Percent Universe is classic PBS-bait. I mean that as a good thing: it is the story of the High-Z Supernova Search Team that competed against the Supernova Cosmology Project in order to determine the answer to the question: What is the ultimate fate of the universe?Panek brings his own philosophy of science to the book: experiments are necessary to prove things. He isn't going to throw around theory like Kaku or Krauss or Greene. He has no desire to explain to us the latest permutation of quantum gibberish being thrown around in theoretical departments. He wants to give us the chronology from Newton to where we are now, and he does a wonderful job. Experiment by experiment he conveys to us the chronology of cosmology up to the present state:a universe that has an accelerating expansion drive by dark energy, and giant filament structures of galaxies bound by dark matter halos. My favorite part of the book was about the trials and tribulations of Vera Rubin, a lady born around the time my grandmother who nailed down the evidence that made dark matter an indisputable fact of reality. She continually gets crap in the male dominated field of astronomy, but never gave up her interest in understanding the universe.I would call this book ""a romp."" If you've been missing the NOVA of 2008, when Brian Greene helped start the cascade of science documentaries that would end up in the Cosmos flop and YouTube taking over as physics-knowledge-distributor, this book is for you.

257,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,3,"I did myself a disservice by listening to this audiobook while running. I usually choose lighter fare for that -- since I must also attend to my immediate environment (i.e., traffic!). Some days I didn't feel like concentrating too hard and would listen to Steve Earle songs instead. I am also one of those ""innumerate"" types, and even though there wasn't much math the numbers would cause me to zone-out and then have to re-focus. So I kept losing the narrative thread, over days and sometimes over a single hour.Panek chronicles a gradually-amassing story of discovery: early cosmological science, quantum theory, Einstein, the earliest astronomical telescopes (he's written another book on telescopes alone), Hubble, supernovas, Guth, inflation... It's told largely through biographies of physicists and astronomers and their research, collaborations, and rivalries. Panek takes a really long time to even get to dark matter and dark energy -- since appreciating what they represent means understanding what we thought we knew before. It's a story of questions -- and what happens (is happening now) when the answer is even bigger question mark. "
258,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15155099-jacob,4,"This is the book about people who thought, or perhaps only hoped, they were on the third book of a sci-fi trilogy. The facts of the super massive and the super tiny were known, there just remained the small task of connecting the two by means of bridge. Unfortunately the bridge was Escheresque in its construction and utterly riddled with wormholes. And so it came to pass that like the Italian plumbers before them their princess was in another castle, quite possibly another universe entirely. And so what was the thought to be the last book turned out to be the end of prequel, or more(?) charitably, the first in a sequence of books by an author maliciously set upon milking every quid and copper from the wallets of their readership.Maybe.It’s really much too soon to say. It could still be a trilogy, but I doubt it.This book tells a series of stories that leads us to the precipice of human knowledge regarding the cosmos. Written in the rather wide middle space between overly remedial and too academic, it is a book that contrasts the vastness of the cosmos with the tales of ego and error that inevitably suffuse the people who search its depths.

259,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,2,"We can only see (EM spectrum) about 1/25th of the mass in the known universe. That alone as the premise of a book should be mind-blowing but Panek fails to capture the magic of this fact. He perfectly captures the facts of it, the history, the personalities, the triumphs, the rivalries, but none of wonder that should be embedded in a story about discovering how little of the universe we can see.The stories presented were fresh. I knew of Alan Guth's double boxed discovery of cosmic inflation, I knew of the history of supernova identification, and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation but these received short treatment as the author knew they'd be covered elsewhere. The race for better methods, the wars between methods, and the press gambits were new and dare I say exciting but again, there was nothing behind it. This is a book about the triumph of the experimentalist to elucidate a weird universe we don't get. If that's the entire point, good job, Panek but that rings hollow to me."
260,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,4,"Sometimes I get stuck on an author and compare everything else I read in that genre to that author. Such is the case with Michio Kaku. I read Parallel Universes when it first came out and was blown away. As I wrote in my review, most of the book was way over my head but somehow I got a feel and glimmer of understanding for even those parts of the book that were. Kaku has a genius that makes the almost incomprehensible concepts in physics sometimes seem simple and obvious. The 4 Percent Universe did not leave me feeling that way. I would not say that Panek was unclear in the 4 Percent Universe. Actually, I had the feel that it was more a flat lesson in the history of science. It was a book that just had fewer revelations for me. With Kaku there were just so many ""Ah Ha"" moments. Hopefully, without sounding too hokey, when reading Kaku, there were moments of what felt like transcendence, an altered state of consciousness. Pretty high bar to set huh? Yeah, I know. Sorry, Richard Panek. You were just fine... just not Michio Kaku. "
261,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8731895-r-j-gilbert,2,"This book does one thing well: it provides a good example of both inspired science and Grant Theory. The first half of the book features individuals whose contribution to science begins with a personal passion and are driven onward by inspiration. The last half of the book is a wonderful look into the battles for funding, for recognition (which brings funding), and the politics of collaboration that is so often found in the scientific fields being choked by the weeds of Grant Theory. You can see quite clearly where the players begin to veer from the search for truth onto the quest for funding.I'm not sure why, but the author chose to organize his chapters by projects and discoveries rather than chronological events. At one point, this caused a player to die in one chapter only to give a news interview in the next. Was that an argument for entanglement (another GT buzz-word)?Okay, I'm done ranting. Suffice it to say, this book further shows me that science will only be advanced by those willing to follow the truth and not the path that funding tells them to follow."

Probably would have been better to read rather than listen to since the narrative tried to include a mention of almost every scientific discovery relating to dark matter and dark energy starting in 1964, but not in chronological order, and the mixture of acronyms and unfamiliar names of people and scientific terms made it difficult to follow. The author focused a great deal on the politics and egos involved in the discoveries rather than the science. That may appeal to a broader readership, but I was looking for more science. If you find the process and personalities of scientific research interesting and enjoy physics, this is probably a good way to get a glimpse inside extremely recent and potentially revolutionary developments that connect physics on the largest scales in astronomy with the smallest scales in particle physics. If you're looking for a careful explanation of the science, you will need to look elsewhere."

The other 96% is dark energy or dark matter. Isn’t that crazy! This book tells the story of the discoveries that led up to this amazing factoid. While some of the book contains technical jargon and facts that went right over my head, most of it tells the sometimes melodramatic story of scientists rushing to discover if the universe is expanding, contracting, or stable. Turns out that scientists can be petty, dramatic, and mean, but despite these human traits they still discovered amazing things. I enjoyed learning that even really smart people can be catty, and found the discoveries fascinating. Most astounding is that despite everything we do know, there is still so much more to learn!

These stories show the individuals who worked at science, and gives a sense of their humanity and personal struggles. It also depicts the struggle to discover and to accept a new and powerful understanding that the entire universe and all the stars and galaxies that we can see towards all infinity, all the stars that anyone has ever seen, is in reality a tiny, tiny fraction of all the matter and energy that inhabits the universe.The reviewing of these stories, to me, becomes a bit of mythology, like a hall of heroes"

These physicist have egos for sure. Both teams came to this same conclusion almost at the same time (Jan 1998)based on two entirely different data sets. Only 4% of the universe consists of atoms which emit energy so we can see them. 26% is dark matter (has mass but doesn't emit any energy so we can't see it). The rest is dark energy."

But the answers that they hope to find will change the way we look at the universe forever!

His style and approach reminded me a lot of Dennis Overbye's The Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, which chronicled the developments in physical and theoretical astronomy up through the 1980s.

It tells about some of the zany characters in the search of the matter in ther universe which radiates no waves of any kind.I think it may be millions of singularities (black holes) that are making up the ""missing mass""that holds the universe together, myself--but that's just speculation. It could be a combination of both dark matter and black holes.A fascinating read, anyway. You don't need a degree in advanced maths to understand it."

It's a fascinating read and while it won't leave you any clearer on what dark matter and especially dark energy are, it will explain how we got to a place where such a bizarre theory now seems to be the leading explanation for the universe in which we find ourselves.For anyone interested in astronomy, physics or the scientific process in general, this makes a great overview of cosmology up through about ten years ago."

275,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90743-gala,3,"I read this book as a way to get my mind around the idea of dark matter before being paired with a dark matter researcher for an artist/scientist collaborative exhibition. While I really enjoyed the seismic idea movement in my understanding of the cosmos, I found that my understanding of the science was not great once I sat down with someone who is actually in the field. This could be, and probably is, a fault of my own, a lack of scientific background on which to hang these still exploratory concepts, but it also belies the danger behind popular scientific texts. Simplification of concepts sometimes obscures the data unintentionally. "

277,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"This a highly readable history of the transformation of cosmology from metaphysics to physics, from philosophy and speculation to hard science, and in the process, the discovery of most of the universe.Historically, astronomy and physics didn't have a great deal to do with each other. Astronomers studied the stars by observation, very patient and detailed observation and record-keeping. Theoretical physicists theorized and calculated, and experimental physicists experimented, and they fed each other's work, very occasionally coming up with something, most notably gravity, that made a real difference to astronomy. Then Einstein gave us general relativity, and began a century of ever-deeper entanglement of physics and astronomy, and the transformation of cosmology--the study of the nature and origins of the entire universe--from something utterly beyond the scope of physics into its core. The questions of how big the universe is, whether it is eternal in space and time or had a beginning and might have an end, became real questions.Edwin Hubble, early in the century, discovered that the universe is expanding, but also that there are other galaxies beyond our own, and that they're all moving away from us. This was a major, exciting, and initially controversial change in our conception of the universe. In the 1960s, Vera Rubin, looking for a research project she could do within the constraints of raising two young children, studied other astronomers' observations and discovered that the galaxies were rotating as well as moving away from us. Also in the mid-1960s, Robert Dicke, Jim Peebles, and a small group of theoretical physicists had a prediction for which they had no supporting data: If the Big Bang theory of the history of the universe were correct, there should be low-level cosmic microwave radiation, at a temperature of about 3 degrees Kelvin. Then two astronomers at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, had data for which they had no explanation: While trying to calibrate the Bell Labs' Crawford Hill antenna to study radio waves from the fringes of the Milky Way, they found they had a tiny background hiss which no amount of calibration would eliminate. They'd found the background cosmic radiation, echo of the Big Bang.That's one small step along the way, from Einstein to the discovery that most of our universe is invisible. As the back and forth played out between the theoretical physicists and the experimental and observational scientists, increasingly astronomers, each theoretical question drew forth an observation, a find, a discovery that answered that question, and raised another. The most startling of these was the discovery that visible, directly detectable matter is just over 4% of the total make-up of a universe far larger and more complex than ever suspected at the start of the 20th century. If what we see were all there were, the galaxies would not be, could not be, relatively compact, stable spirals (or their other shapes), but should be torn apart by the speed of their rotation. Outside, among, around, the visible matter of the galaxies was dark matter.Dark matter was soon joined by the even more mysterious dark energy.The largest part of Panek's book is devoted to the research to detect and identify dark matter and dark energy, He takes us through not only the science, fascinating enough in itself, but also the human drama as two teams, one primarily physicists and the other primarily astronomers, raced against each other to gather enough observations of sufficiently distant (and therefore ancient) supernovae to answer essential questions about the conditions of the early universe. In the answers to those questions, and questions about changes since that early time, would lie the answers to the reality of dark energy, dark matter, and maybe the ultimate fate of the universe.Highly recommended.This book is not yet published but can be pre-ordered from Amazon or Barnes & Noble.I received a free electronic galley of this book from the publisher via NetGalley."
278,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4131838-alan,5,"First of all, I am not a physicist or a cosmologist, though I am a scientist (biologist). Even so, I found this book to be fascinating. If you are like me you have learned or at least heard something about recent changes in our understanding of the universe. For example, there was the refinement of Newton's explanation of gravity by Einstein through his theories of relativity (the description of space time), then there was the Big Bang model of the universe developed by Hubble when he applied Einstein's physics to the developing field of cosmology. Later on there was the discovery that stars at the edges of spiral galaxies were going WAY faster than they should have been going based on the calcualted mass of stars in those galaxies (this was Vera Rubin's work), and from that the need for a larger mass than observed led to the concept of Dark Matter. Then, later, not only the inflation of the universe, but an accelerating rate of expansion called for a force large enough to overcome the force of gravity that should have eventually caused the universe to expand and then collapse on itself, though recent observations show that this is not to be...the universe really is accelerating its rate of inflation...and the need for Dark Energy was born. These ideas of an inflating universe, a Big Bang + Dark Matter + Dark Energy increasing acceleration universe is a fascinating model of our universe. If you are like me, you may periodically wonder not only how such a universe works, but how in the world observations were made that led to these conclusions. THIS is what this book is about. The book starts with a brief introduction to the field of cosmology (the structure and fate of the universe) starting with Aristotle and Ptolemy's geocentric model. That model was then revised into the heliocentric model through the work of Copernicus and the observations of Galileo. Then Newton revised things with his universal law of gravitation, only to be modified yet again by Einstein's explanation of space-time fabric and Hubble's expanding Big Bang universe that is made of many galaxies. The bulk of the book, however, focuses on work done in the last 50 years or so, including work done since 2000 when large teams of collaborating scientists raced to try to describe the universe and demonstrate through theory and observation what it is really like. Fortunately for someone like me, Panek describes all of this without delving into the deep end of physics and cosmology...the math. Even so, if you decide to tackle this book you need to be prepared to keep track of a variety of acronyms and terms about cosmic backround microwaves, lambda, omega, and other terms scientists use to refer to the nature of the universe. And, not only do we get a nice overview of the science, but we get an interesting view of how modern cosmology and physics are done. Be prepared to read about issues in scientific ethics, jealousy, mind-bending breakthroughts, and discovery after discovery that led to our modern view of the universe and how it works. I found this book to be a tough, but good 5-star offering, though it's probably a 4 star offering for the non-scientist...it will take some serious effort to keep everything straight, and I don't think I can claim that myself. Still, this is a fascinating tale of discovery."
279,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20534403-sue-von-roedern,4,Fascinating and mostly understandable introduction to the fate of the universe. I want to be an astrophysicist when I grow up. I guess that will have to be in my next life.
280,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,4,"The 4% Universe - 4% science...96% stories.That is this book in a nutshell. If you are looking for a book on the science behind Dark Matter and Dark Energy, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for the stories about the astonomers behind the discovery of both Dark Matter and Dark Energy, definitely pick up this book.Panek gives a lively account of how the discovery of these two elusive subjects came about. I would say the first 1/3 of the book focuses on Dark Matter, with the rest heavily revolving around Dark Energy. At times the writing was a bit over the top for me, however this book is anything but boring and Panek clearly did his research. There are lots of astronomers/physicists to keep track of, and at times Panek introduced a new name without ever telling us about them. For the most part, the narrative is easy to follow despite the many names, and the science is easy to understand. I don't know that I have ever read shorter descriptions of science that so easily and clearly got their point across.We learn about Vera Rubin and her discovery that galaxies rotate at the same speed no matter the distance from the galactic center, the intersection of particle physics and astronomy (cosmology), and the search for the 2 main questions in cosmology: what is the value of the Hubble Constant and how much has the expansion rate changed over time. But the majority of the narrative focuses on the two competing teams who discovered that the universe isn't just expanding...it's accelerating; the Supernova Cosmology project headed by Saul Perlmutter at Berkely and the High-z team headed by Brian Schmidt.In the first chapter Panek brings up an interesting theme of astronomy. We as humans are constantly thinking we can't understand something, only to figure it out through science. Ptolemy believed we would never understand the heavens, but with the invention of the telescope came that understanding. Or more recently thinking we can never know how the universe began because we can't go back in time, yet with the discovery of the CMB we came to an understanding for that too. Currently, there are theorists and astronomers who believe we will never truly know the nature of dark matter and dark energy. I think if history tells us anything, we need only have some patience and wait for that understanding to come as well."
281,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,2,"Cosmology, the science of the origin, evolution and the ultimate fate of the Universe, is a surprisingly young scientific discipline. For the most of history cosmological questions were dealt with through a philosophical or theological inquiry, but in the early part of the twentieth century it became possible to inquire about these things in a more systematic and scientific manner. The research in Cosmology really gained steam since the 1960s, when the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) put the Big Bang Theory on a very firm footing. However, the subsequent inquiry revealed something really intellectually curious and potentially disturbing about the Universe: we can only see a very tiny fraction of it. The vast proportion of the “stuff” that makes up the Universe, about 96% of it to be more precise, is invisible. We can only infer its existence from the gravitational effects it has on the “visible” matter. This “invisible” stuff came to be known by a very prosaic couple of names: dark matter and dark energy. The aim of “The 4% Universe” is to explain our best current understanding of what the dark matter and the dark energy are. The book provides some good physics background to all of these phenomena, and tries to explain how the observation and the research into these topics have progressed over the last half a century or so. Unfortunately, this book goes way overboard in taking the inside look at the workings of the physicists and the astronomers who do research on dark matter and dark energy. It narrates, in painful details sometimes, the comings and goings of the select groups of scientists as they conduct their research, grapple with work-family balance, and engage in petty turf wars with their colleagues and other competing research collaborations. For the most of the book I found myself bored to death with these minutiae – and I am a scientist! Furthermore, I found the information on the actual science, and physics aspects of it in particular, incredibly thin. Reading the Wikipedia articles on this topic is way more informative. This is definitely not a book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about the Universe and its dark secrets. "
282,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,4,"This is an excellent book detailing the birth of cosmology and the search for the true nature of the universe. More of a history book than anything else, there's no better account of the Copernican legacy and the evolution of metaphysics into a true field of science.One of the most compelling aspects of the book is the fact that it's all so new that ideas become risky and technology becomes the limiting factor for what we can discover. And while not having the complete story is nagging, it's a torturous glimpse into the necessity to understand that plagues these very scientists.A big plus is that the book is very well written. For example, the author employs a nice stylistic hook at the beginning of every chapter; He describes a scene where the people and setting remain anonymous for a paragraph or so, letting the story slowly come into view. ""What's he talking about? Where are they? Oh, Antarctica? Awesome.""One aspect of the book that was a bit of a bummer was that it painted the race to discovery as more of a frantic, sometimes bitter competition rather than a series of exciting innovations. The idea that a scientific career often hangs in the balance is very clear — and perhaps I'm being naive — but that sort of doe-eyed wonder that humans get looking up at the stars seemed lost on the protagonists from time to time.As is often a complaint of mine when reading such a book, I would have liked to hear more about the details of the experiments and the meat of the theories. The author could have easily gone a little more in depth without losing lay persons, if that was the concern. Or how about an appendix for the more dedicated reader in the next addition, Panek?Though a little heavy on squabbling scientists and light on the actual physics, The 4-Percent Universe is an extremely thorough historical account of the current state of knowledge regarding the fate of our reality. I really enjoyed it."
283,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7078788-christine-leov-lealand,5,"There isn't a lot to say about dark matter and dark energy - since everything we know about these prevalent universal items is from inferences. No one seems to have found or measured either yet. So reading a long scientific book about these alleged 'dark' ie unknown things isn't going to convince many people that they exist.What IS convincing is Panek's social history of modern cosmology. How generations of scientists working around the planet both collaborating and competing with each other - as they still are - and yet independently coming to the SAME Conclusion!Two competing teams trying to prove each other's findings wrong and failing. Amusing and convincing to laypeople like myself.This book is not dry or boring like most science seems to like to be. The concept of our universe [that which we perceive] being the equivalent of the froth on the coffee of the rapidly expanding universe is HUGE and I recommend this book to any science fiction writers to include these findings in your new work. I would remind all scientists that science is far from scientific. The topics studied and researched depend very much upon the very personal and far from objective decisions of the individuals involved. Not to mention the choices of funding organisations and institutions and even the time available on the telescopes! No amount of pretentiousness can disguise these human subjective limitations to scientific processes and achievements. 'The 4% Universe' underlines for the reader the fact that personal choices, competition and rivalry have had more of an impact upon cosmological research and the results reported today, than any over-reaching humanitarian goal to benefit mankind with their 'objective' findings about the history of the universe. Nobel Prize anyone?"
284,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11254454-arensb,4,"There are several things Panek does well in this book: if you've seen, out of the corner of your eye, headlines about ""universe inflation"", ""dark matter"", ""dark energy"", he does a good job of explaining what those are (at least, the stuff that's known about these things; there are still a lot of unanswered questions, like ""what the heck is dark energy, anyway?"")Just as importantly, he explains how scientists know what they know: the observations and experiments that led them to their conclusions. And he also talks about the people behind the science, their motivations and emotions, their doubts and rivalries, their hopes and arguments. And in the process, he shows us something about the process by which science is done, something we the public don't get to see very often.Unfortunately, the cast of characters is rather large, and I couldn't keep them all straight, or remember who was on the Princeton and who was on the Berkeley team, or even how the two teams differed in their approach and social structure. Some sort of chart would have been helpful, or at least photos of the main players, but the book offered no such help; at least, my ebook edition didn't.The picture that emerges is one of a weirder universe than I imagined, where scientists are led to accept seemingly-preposterous ideas – like the idea of a type of matter other than our usual protons and neutrons; and that there is several times more of this stuff than of ordinary stuff – by the force of observation. Like it or not, that's where the data points."
285,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241853-erin,4,"I'm not done yet, but my initial impression is positive. The thing I like about this book so far is how Panek puts the various discoveries in perspective. As an example, I definitely understood the concept of supernovas, as well as the fact that they pulsate and also the concept of red/blue light refraction. However, the way that Panek succinctly describes how that constant enabled discoveries about the way galaxies revolve, well, I dare you to find another writer who could have gotten the whole story into fewer words. I could give example after example of that type of synopsis in this book.I suppose if you're a PHD in Astronomy, you might find this book a very dummied-down review of the science with a few interesting anecdotes about the personal lives of the scientists covered. However, Panek is able to put scientific concepts in layman's terms in a way that is very accessible for non-scientists. Secondly, he tells the history in an entertaining way that you don't get in most textbooks. So, for the people who are writing reviews that Panek is not a good writer - I think you're wrong. In our textbooks and classrooms we are so concerned with ensuring students memorize the facts and the math that we don't teach the historical context in which discoveries were made (particularly in the field of cosmology). That, in turn stifles creativity and inhibits students from seeing the ""big picture"". So, kudo's to Panek for being able to write about cosmology in a way the average person can relate to. I'm definitely enjoying this book so far..."
286,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,5,"The 4 Percent Universe is classic PBS-bait. I mean that as a good thing: it is the story of the High-Z Supernova Search Team that competed against the Supernova Cosmology Project in order to determine the answer to the question: What is the ultimate fate of the universe?Panek brings his own philosophy of science to the book: experiments are necessary to prove things. He isn't going to throw around theory like Kaku or Krauss or Greene. He has no desire to explain to us the latest permutation of quantum gibberish being thrown around in theoretical departments. He wants to give us the chronology from Newton to where we are now, and he does a wonderful job. Experiment by experiment he conveys to us the chronology of cosmology up to the present state:a universe that has an accelerating expansion drive by dark energy, and giant filament structures of galaxies bound by dark matter halos. My favorite part of the book was about the trials and tribulations of Vera Rubin, a lady born around the time my grandmother who nailed down the evidence that made dark matter an indisputable fact of reality. She continually gets crap in the male dominated field of astronomy, but never gave up her interest in understanding the universe.I would call this book ""a romp."" If you've been missing the NOVA of 2008, when Brian Greene helped start the cascade of science documentaries that would end up in the Cosmos flop and YouTube taking over as physics-knowledge-distributor, this book is for you.

I usually choose lighter fare for that -- since I must also attend to my immediate environment (i.e., traffic!). Some days I didn't feel like concentrating too hard and would listen to Steve Earle songs instead. I am also one of those ""innumerate"" types, and even though there wasn't much math the numbers would cause me to zone-out and then have to re-focus. So I kept losing the narrative thread, over days and sometimes over a single hour.Panek chronicles a gradually-amassing story of discovery: early cosmological science, quantum theory, Einstein, the earliest astronomical telescopes (he's written another book on telescopes alone), Hubble, supernovas, Guth, inflation... It's told largely through biographies of physicists and astronomers and their research, collaborations, and rivalries. Panek takes a really long time to even get to dark matter and dark energy -- since appreciating what they represent means understanding what we thought we knew before. It's a story of questions -- and what happens (is happening now) when the answer is even bigger question mark. "

The facts of the super massive and the super tiny were known, there just remained the small task of connecting the two by means of bridge. Unfortunately the bridge was Escheresque in its construction and utterly riddled with wormholes. And so it came to pass that like the Italian plumbers before them their princess was in another castle, quite possibly another universe entirely. And so what was the thought to be the last book turned out to be the end of prequel, or more(?) charitably, the first in a sequence of books by an author maliciously set upon milking every quid and copper from the wallets of their readership.Maybe.It’s really much too soon to say. It could still be a trilogy, but I doubt it.This book tells a series of stories that leads us to the precipice of human knowledge regarding the cosmos. Written in the rather wide middle space between overly remedial and too academic, it is a book that contrasts the vastness of the cosmos with the tales of ego and error that inevitably suffuse the people who search its depths.

289,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,2,"We can only see (EM spectrum) about 1/25th of the mass in the known universe. That alone as the premise of a book should be mind-blowing but Panek fails to capture the magic of this fact. He perfectly captures the facts of it, the history, the personalities, the triumphs, the rivalries, but none of wonder that should be embedded in a story about discovering how little of the universe we can see.The stories presented were fresh. I knew of Alan Guth's double boxed discovery of cosmic inflation, I knew of the history of supernova identification, and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation but these received short treatment as the author knew they'd be covered elsewhere. The race for better methods, the wars between methods, and the press gambits were new and dare I say exciting but again, there was nothing behind it. This is a book about the triumph of the experimentalist to elucidate a weird universe we don't get. If that's the entire point, good job, Panek but that rings hollow to me."
290,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,4,"Sometimes I get stuck on an author and compare everything else I read in that genre to that author. Such is the case with Michio Kaku. I read Parallel Universes when it first came out and was blown away. As I wrote in my review, most of the book was way over my head but somehow I got a feel and glimmer of understanding for even those parts of the book that were. Kaku has a genius that makes the almost incomprehensible concepts in physics sometimes seem simple and obvious. The 4 Percent Universe did not leave me feeling that way. I would not say that Panek was unclear in the 4 Percent Universe. Actually, I had the feel that it was more a flat lesson in the history of science. It was a book that just had fewer revelations for me. With Kaku there were just so many ""Ah Ha"" moments. Hopefully, without sounding too hokey, when reading Kaku, there were moments of what felt like transcendence, an altered state of consciousness. Pretty high bar to set huh? Yeah, I know. Sorry, Richard Panek. You were just fine... just not Michio Kaku. "
291,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8731895-r-j-gilbert,2,"This book does one thing well: it provides a good example of both inspired science and Grant Theory. The first half of the book features individuals whose contribution to science begins with a personal passion and are driven onward by inspiration. The last half of the book is a wonderful look into the battles for funding, for recognition (which brings funding), and the politics of collaboration that is so often found in the scientific fields being choked by the weeds of Grant Theory. You can see quite clearly where the players begin to veer from the search for truth onto the quest for funding.I'm not sure why, but the author chose to organize his chapters by projects and discoveries rather than chronological events. At one point, this caused a player to die in one chapter only to give a news interview in the next. Was that an argument for entanglement (another GT buzz-word)?Okay, I'm done ranting. Suffice it to say, this book further shows me that science will only be advanced by those willing to follow the truth and not the path that funding tells them to follow."
292,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5060228-michelle,2,"I listened to the 9 cd audio version of this book. Probably would have been better to read rather than listen to since the narrative tried to include a mention of almost every scientific discovery relating to dark matter and dark energy starting in 1964, but not in chronological order, and the mixture of acronyms and unfamiliar names of people and scientific terms made it difficult to follow. The author focused a great deal on the politics and egos involved in the discoveries rather than the science. That may appeal to a broader readership, but I was looking for more science. If you find the process and personalities of scientific research interesting and enjoy physics, this is probably a good way to get a glimpse inside extremely recent and potentially revolutionary developments that connect physics on the largest scales in astronomy with the smallest scales in particle physics. If you're looking for a careful explanation of the science, you will need to look elsewhere."
293,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40655720-tonya-woodbury,3,"Fun fact: visible matter, including anything that creates light or can be seen anywhere along the electromagnetic spectrum and all matter consisting of protons, neutrons, etc. – consists of only 4% of the universe!! The other 96% is dark energy or dark matter. Isn’t that crazy! This book tells the story of the discoveries that led up to this amazing factoid. While some of the book contains technical jargon and facts that went right over my head, most of it tells the sometimes melodramatic story of scientists rushing to discover if the universe is expanding, contracting, or stable. Turns out that scientists can be petty, dramatic, and mean, but despite these human traits they still discovered amazing things. I enjoyed learning that even really smart people can be catty, and found the discoveries fascinating. Most astounding is that despite everything we do know, there is still so much more to learn! What a great time to be alive!"
294,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/377421-heather-denkmire,3,"While I have really enjoyed the kinds of science books that have a strong focus on the personalities of the processes, I had a hard time ""getting into"" these ""characters."" That, combined with the seriously challenging levels of science, made it not my favorite of the science books I've read recently. However, overall, it was interesting and engaging. Unlike some of the quantum mechanics stuff, I had a harder time following the science so I had to do some translating as I tried following along (why are they trying to find what now?). It could be my concentration simply wasn't as focused as during other simliar books.I loved the descriptions of the differences between the astronomers and the physicists in personality and politics. Or the different kinds of physicists (""romantic"" or ""classical"") that were used from time to time..."
295,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2487127-mark,3,"A review of the recent history of Astronomy, Physics, and Cosmology focusing the last 40 or so years, ""The 4 Percent Universe..."" presents together many of the stories that I learned from PBS Broadcasts of 'Nova', or public seminar presentations at Fermilab and Argonne National Labs, or viewing nights at the local Astronomical Society. These stories show the individuals who worked at science, and gives a sense of their humanity and personal struggles. It also depicts the struggle to discover and to accept a new and powerful understanding that the entire universe and all the stars and galaxies that we can see towards all infinity, all the stars that anyone has ever seen, is in reality a tiny, tiny fraction of all the matter and energy that inhabits the universe.The reviewing of these stories, to me, becomes a bit of mythology, like a hall of heroes"
296,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6868760-merritt-phillips,3,"Interesting topic, I learned several things about discoveries made by man have helped formulate theories about the universe we live in. The most interesting part of the story deals with two research teams (one at MIT and one at Berkeley) who are competing to see if Super Nova can be used a light references to determine how old the universe is and confirm that the universe is still expanding and will continue to expand forever (so the current theory goes). These physicist have egos for sure. Both teams came to this same conclusion almost at the same time (Jan 1998)based on two entirely different data sets. Only 4% of the universe consists of atoms which emit energy so we can see them. 26% is dark matter (has mass but doesn't emit any energy so we can't see it). The rest is dark energy."
297,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1833319-christopher-obert,3,"In his book the 4% Universe Richard Panek gives us the history behind the baffling concept of dark matter and dark energy. The book covers one of the greatest mysteries facing science today, the universe’s missing mass. Modern cosmology has two groups of scientist working (the astronomers and the physicists) to solve this puzzle. Both are very different in how they work and how they think. But the answers that they hope to find will change the way we look at the universe forever! The book covers some very complex theories and concepts but Mr. Panek does a good job making the complex simpler to read and understand. I feel the book could have been improved by adding a few illustrations. "
298,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/942528-steven,4,"We live in a surprising universe--only 4% of which we can see. Astrophysicists made startling discoveries in the 1990s and Panek reports these discoveries as well as several decades of astronomy leading up to the ""discovery"" of dark matter and then ""dark energy.""Panek is focused on story of the science here and ventures seldom into anecdotes about the people involved. His style and approach reminded me a lot of Dennis Overbye's The Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, which chronicled the developments in physical and theoretical astronomy up through the 1980s. The 4 Percent Universe nicely extends this history into the most recent developments."
299,0618982442,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7426172-henry,4,"It really covers the topic, from its inception isnpired by Einsteinm moving on to radio astronomy and the opening up of cosmology as a science (not a philosophy and theorists' toy). It tells about some of the zany characters in the search of the matter in ther universe which radiates no waves of any kind.I think it may be millions of singularities (black holes) that are making up the ""missing mass""that holds the universe together, myself--but that's just speculation. It could be a combination of both dark matter and black holes.A fascinating read, anyway. You don't need a degree in advanced maths to understand it."
