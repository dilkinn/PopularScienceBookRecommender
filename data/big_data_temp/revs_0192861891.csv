0,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368200-nathan,5,"Michio Kaku apparently spent his childhood building super-colliders in his parents' garage. It paid off. He's clearly brilliant, and best of all, he's not lost his imagination. One sad fact of modern physicists is that precious few of them have any imagination, and are incapable of thought experiments and relative flights of fantasy. As Kaku has pointed out, fantasy fueled more great discoveries in science than pure science ever did on its own. In this book he uses what we know about quantum physics to explore possibilities formerly relegated exclusively to science fiction. In doing so, he should be admired. He is merely asking us to consider what some great minds in both literature and physics have imagined, and in doing so, manages to make what we do know seem almost simple by showing us how much we truly don't know. He's amazingly talented, imaginative, and best of all, he knows his math. He also knows how to use that math to dream of what's possible. An absolutely fun book to read.NC"

It is a really good crash course on just what the hell Quantum, String, Unified Field Theory ad Superstring actually are. Lays down the history and concepts in a way that makes sense and makes you get it.Particularly savvy readers will start making the other logical leaps. If we are thinking energy vibrating along a 10-dimensional string, what does that say about the frequency of sentience in the universe? Since energy can't go anywhere and sentience is a factor of energy, what the hell really does happen to us when we die?Enjoy your trip down the rabbit hole."
2,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45364364-kelvin,1,"DNF at chapter 10. It was a bit too dry and technical for me. While the chapter names were intriguing and there were interesting anecdotes in each chapter, it was still slightly too boring, even with the pictures, for me to read into and understand the developments of modern physics. There wasn't much holding it together, i.e. the book only follows the overthrow of each theory as its organizing structure. It also seemed to ramble on with analogies that weren't that great to follow, eg the wood vs marble and flatland comparisons. Though I'm sure that Michio Kaku is quite knowledgable about the theories mentioned in the book (as evidenced by his other books) I expected this book to be more in story form like Flatterland and thus easier to read. Overall, this book was just disappointing for me. I expected it to be a fun and informative telling of the evolution of dimensional theories but ended up getting a book that was difficult to read and closer to a paper than novel."

4,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1846986-kesseljunkie,2,"It was OK just because the science fiction at the end was a lot of fun.Dr. Kaku alternates through two styles -- talking to the reader like they're completely stupid and then talking to them like they've taken a college physics class. I'm neither, I understood what he was writing, and was just insulted. The cornerstone of Hyperspace theory is that there were 10 dimensions for a fraction of a fraction of time in the first fraction of time of existence for this universe, but 6 of them probably don't exist since. Um, so there aren't 10 dimensions -- there might have been. And then the whole premise is that I should accept the premises in the book even though he acknowledges there may never be proof? And the difference between this and religion is....oh, I see, there is none. Fifth dimensional beings could exist, but not God? Interesting assertion. So long as we're just accepting things on faith, let me toss this one out there: God is a 5th dimensional being.But of course, it's sexy to act like you're smart -- and when someone like Dr. Kaku publishes a sexy bit of science fiction and calls it researched science, everyone's afraid to look like they don't ""get it."" It's like living in a Rand novel. It's OK to call bullsh*t on someone in the sciences, people. And in this instance, I do."
5,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/227682-steve,5,"If you've thought science is dull or perhaps too far beyond you, then please meet Michio Kaku. He writes about theoretical physics in a way that will fill you with wonder and possibility. He takes what would otherwise be very complex concepts and conveys them using metaphors that every average joe can understand. The number of a-ha moments I had reading this book were too many to count. What a terrific read."
6,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1287856-david,3,"Started strong. An introduction to non-Euclidian geometry, string theory, and related concepts. Made me fantasize about learning the math. Got more and more speculative toward the end, and not so interestingly so. Like many books, this one would have been improved by a ruthless editor. Still, worth a read if the topic interests you. "
7,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/477898-shawna,4,"This is one of the popular science books that got me so interested in doing physics in the first place. Accessible to me before I even took a physics class, it should be accessible to most anyone with interest. Very interesting questions raised about space and time/parallel universes/etc. New ideas (as of date published: 1994) are discussed in a non-technical way. Also, very well written and easy to read (with humor and everything!)."
8,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7289539-rich-paz,5,I am now officially a Michio Kaku fan. This book explains physics as it should be taught in school. His simplistic approach begs the reader for more information. I also love physics now because I understand it a lot more thanks to Mr. Kaku's books. The school systems should think about this book as part of their cirriculum to teach the importance of understanding physics. Highly recommended.
9,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc,4,"Michio Kaku makes some amazingly complex and mind-bending concepts accessible to the lay reader (i.e., me, and maybe you, too, if you're also not a physicist). He sprinkles the book with entertaining and informative anecdotes and his passion for the topic is infectious. Still, I shudder to think that no author ever addresses Schr√∂dinger's ailurophobia. Here's hoping the 6-dimensional universe opens up just as this one closes!"
10,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3081303-aloha,5,Michio Kaku did a terrific job of explaining to the layman scientific possibilities often depicted in sci-fi.

It's a bit dated, as it was written in the 1990s, but I wanted to start with some of Kaku's earliest works to get a solid foundation of the concepts in here, before moving to his more recent books.Hyperspace has left my mind buzzing with possibilities, with the wonder of the universe, as it took me through concepts like quantum physics, string theory, and higher dimensions.This has been rewarding as a theoretical physics fan, and inspiring as a science fiction writer.I'm excited to read Kaku's next book. It's already sitting on my shelf! üòåThis was my first hardcore science book, but it definitely won't be the last. :)))"

In fact, according to this theory, matter is nothing but the harmonies created by this vibrating string. Since there are an infinite number of harmonies that can be composed for the violin, there are an infinite number of forms of matter that can be constructed out of vibrating strings. This explains the richness of the particles in nature. Likewise, the laws of physics can be compared to the laws of harmony allowed on the string. The universe itself, composed of countless vibrating strings, would then be comparable to a symphony.‚Äù"
13,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1335294-ricardo,3,"It's up there, though not as accessible, as Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Universe in a Nutshell"". Dr. Kaku does spend a considerable time walking the reader through how the theories of space-time and hyperspace arose and some of the historical and more mathematical stuff can be a little dense. However, the book opens really nicely with very vivid and amazing explanations of just how freaky hyperspace can be as well as the implications for the world of physics. The book also ends really well with how hyperspace can tell us something about how the universe will end as well as how it may help us, if we're still around, at that time as well as how to build a time machine and the potential evolution of an intelligent species into one capable of manipulating time and space.I imagine his other book ""Physics of The Impossible"" which focuses more on trying to explain with physics for well-known sci-fi concepts would be as good as the beginning and end of this book. However, if you find that kind of topic, theoretical physics, black holes, time travel, 10 dimensional space, then I would recommend this book. "
14,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63821926-logan-scoles,3,"Intriguing topics and Dr. Kaku is one of the few people who writes for the science enthusiast. Lot of information here. However, it was not conveyed in terms understandable for the general reader. Multitude of topics discussed without ever being broken down as to why I should care or what that means in terms I can relate to. Good book for someone well versed in mathematics or physics. I enjoy the topics discussed, but they need to be broken down in a way in which anyone could understand and relate to."
15,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67164439-aenea-jones,5,"I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone interested in Quantum Physics.Kaku covers both the basics (Schroedinger's Cat, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, double-slit experiment, etc) and the newest insights into the String Theory. One reason why his books are so popular is because he manages to explain difficult and logic-defying processes in an understandable way."

If you're looking forward to seeing another triangle drawn on a saddle or reading another synopsis of that Heinlein story about the girl who became her own parents, Kaku's your guy. (For a while he had me wondering if I'd already read this one and just forgot to review it, but no.)The physics stuff is mostly‚Å∞ covered in the exact same (shallow) way almost everyone else has covered it,¬π but he doesn't stick to that, because other writers don't. His inevitable discussion of things like the anthropic principle and the cosmological argument (you know: those things that were in all pop-sci from, say, the '80s all through The God Delusion, after which they mysteriously became less fashionable) seem calculated to miss the point in a way that's meant to annoy literally anyone with any opinion at all, but they're not even the most embarrassing sections of the book‚Äîthat would be the ``futurology''¬≤ that takes up most of the last quarter of it (I hope you like reading about the Kardashev scale again!).In fairness I should also point out that this book was published in 1994, so it does predate a few hundred (but by no means all) of the books that made popular physics such a tired and derivative cottage industry; I don't think that excuses this one.Writers who have written this exact book in a more competent way include Brian Greene, Brian Cox, and Michio Kaku.--------‚Å∞ His discussion of Schr√∂dinger's cat is notably worse.¬π Kaku did manage to do something Lee Smolin and Peter Woit never could: make me doubt that string theory is actually a meaningful thing and not just a mathematical artefact; a lot of the big insights in his own actual work that he brings up do seem to come down to realising something he came up with was just a way of rephrasing older laws.¬≤ A ``futurologist'', of course, being a sci-fi nerd with delusions of grandeur."

The most egregious spoiler is when he recounts Asimov's The Last Question. Do yourself a favor, before you read this, go read that one first at the very least. Other than the story spoilers this is a great and accessible synthesis of twentieth century physics."
22,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2925334-anusha-sridharan,5,The most intriguing book I have read in recent times. Michio Kaku's books are simply beautiful in explaining the most complicated things in a simplistic manner.

A good portion of the book discusses the history and progression of humanity's conceptions of higher dimensions, and how those ideas affected art, religion, and other aspects of society (and how, in turn, the science was affected by the results of that cross-pollination). While the science has surely matured since this was written, it's a thought-provoking read about the nature of our universe, and our quest to understand it."
25,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55798799-veronika,4,"Good book. Toward the end I felt like I am reading sci-fi instead of science, which is great. Where would all the science be, without a good dose of imagination. "
26,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56926561-ameya,5,"Although most of the stuff about String theory and 10 dimensions was largely not understood, the book in itself was very engrossing. I liked the history of the development of the theories of higher dimensions. It was surprising to know a lot of the development started in the 19th century. "
27,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44370756-benjamin-park,4,Hyperspace makes the obtuse and opaque concepts of theoretical physics accessible to anyone with an interest in science. I was delighted to learn about the world of physics that lies beyond the three dimensions that we perceive. I did find parts of the book to be too dense or technical so I just skipped over those sections.
28,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6770267-chris,3,"Whew!! The evolution of theoretical physics up to 1994. Was waiting for a more current book, but started this in the interim. Part I, the first four chapters and Parts III & IV, which covered 6 chapters were pretty easy to read for this non-physics person and quite interesting especially those things involving cosmology. Part II, had my brain often saying Whaaaat???! More technical definitely. So why would a non-physics person, much less theoretical physics want to read this book? Well the novel Dark Matter to be precise. It piqued my interest in the titled Dark Matter-what is it? Parallel worlds, wormholes and the like. "
29,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24160488-jim-nielsen,4,"I found this to be an enjoyable, relatively accessible look at some of the most advanced theories of physics (and mathematics) in modern science. Granted, I didn't understand everything in this book, The overview on the brilliant theories of specific and general relativity and their consequences I found fascinating and understandable. Once you start getting into quantum theory and its mathematics things get a little strange and complicated. But why shouldn't they? Quantum mechanics, as the author explains, is a convoluted, ugly theory that is only still around because of its abilities to quite precisely predict experimental data. After an overview in these theories you begin to see the dichotomy between the two and how string theory represents a possibly elegant solution to unify all the laws of physics under a single theory. As the author states many times in the book, you begin to see how the laws of physics can be much more elegantly and beautifully expressed when brought into higher dimensions, an intriguing and fascinating concept. I couldn't put this book down!"

Although some of the book was way over my head, I read the rest with great interest and learned a busload of new things about Quantum Theory. I enjoyed the read though it took me a long time to get through the book. I did have to skip some of the more technical stuff, but every once in a while a light would go on and I would be elated.I can't comment on the book professionally of course, but if you are interested in Quantum Theory, Dr. Kaku's writing style is extremely easy to read, entertaining in some spots and thoroughly engaging."
32,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2833296-bob,4," Good general history of 20th century physics. I enjoyed the layout of the book -- first half of the book is the history of hyperspace, second half is what can come out of the theory. Loved this part. Wormholes, time travel, black holes and the death of the universe. The author does a good job bringing in sci-fi stories to explain or illustrate the various theories. Some times he would go off on a tangent and try to bring the point back in a rough way."

52,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66626170-sairica,4,"I picked up this book randomly because I knew it would be considerably easy to finish as I was familiar with the subject matter of the book.Michio Kaku writes well and included additional data that I was unaware of, which made this book worth my while. He also explained a few concepts, which I had come across before but not fully understood, and made it clear. This book as the tagline explains takes the reader through the tenth dimension. His flow is consistent and he achieves this by reducing his data into four parts. I: Entering the fifth dimension where he takes the reader on a journey from special relativity to general relativity; II: Unification in ten dimensions where he takes the reader on a journey from general relativity to string theory; III: Wormholes where he deals with black holes and time machines and how time travel is not merely possible but probable and it's different types; IV: Masters of Hyperspace where he deals with the question of our future civilization and how the fate of the universe would be inescapable for even them unless the density of the universe was more than 10 raised to -29 gram per cubic centimeter then perhaps our species may have a chance to use the six dimensions towards the end to escape.He discusses the Kardashev scale (to categorise civilizations) and the difficulties our species may have to face reaching Type-I considering that we have discovered the power of element 92 (U), with the help of Einstein's famous e=mc2 equation, without having reached the social development to ensure that we don't unleash it on ourselves (aka self destruct). I actually enjoyed reading this book despite the fact that it was written ages ago even before Edward Witten proclaimed that the string theory was actually M-theory. This was one of my first books by Michio Kaku and I thoroughly enjoyed it except for when he pontificated (throughout) at how this theory found in the 20th century was made for the 21st, considering how we still are not better off.All in all its a popular science read, simple for a lay reader who is interested in understanding a few bits of the only compatible theory of everything. A good readüëç"
53,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4547369-p-dreadful,5,"An Odyssey, indeed. And an entertaining one at that. The book is divided into four parts. The first part discusses the need for a fourth spatial dimension. The second and the third deal with ten-dimensional universes and wormholes (and wormholes within black holes), while the last part is about the death of our universe. The underlying theme of the book is that all the laws of physics can co-exist only in a higher dimension. I had come across terms such as transversible black holes, Casimir effect, quarks, leptons, false vacuum, etc. but I had no idea how they all fitted together. This book explains that and more. The author, one of the founders of the superstring theory, does a brilliant job in explaining complex concepts in a simple, easily digestible format. He explains why there was a need for a higher dimension and goes on to discuss the greatest scientific achievements since Newton that led to the development of a unified field theory. I found the diagrams particularly helpful, especially the ones depicting Flatlanders (living in two-dimensional worlds). Some of the amazing things I learnt from this book are given below: 1. The number of dimensions can only be ten or twenty-six, but it's probably ten(?). Why ten?Because of the factor (N-10) that appears in some equations. 2.

I do not have a background in physics or mathematics, but Kaku made String Theory accessible to folks like us. The broader picture and the impact the notion of Hyperspace has on our perceived world is effectively conveyed in his pleasant writing style. I have to admit that the chapters on the specifics of the different theories were the challenging part for me. The math went completely over my head. Luckily understanding grad school level equations was not necessary. I found the need to consult secondary sources to better understand the specific theories, some of which may or may not have been written for grade school students. This is no reflection on Kaku's abilities. Given that he admits that some physicists don't completely understand Quantum and String Theory, this is obviously difficult material to explain to laypersons. As a non-scientist, I mostly enjoyed the philosophical and theological discussions of how the String Theory and Hyperspace change and affect our perception of the universe and our place in it. I especially enjoyed the account of how the various theories and discoveries have influenced the arts, particularly literature. Thanks to this book, I now have a long list of science fiction books and short stories to hunt down.The final section includes a detailed prediction of how civilization will advance, both technologically and scientifically as well as socially, and the various obstacles humanity must overcome in order to master Hyperspace in the distant future. Kaku also discusses the possibility of humanity's ultimate fate. This is not so much the predictions of a fortune teller, but rather educated speculation based on current knowledge. He could be wrong, but he doesn't think so. I found this fascinating, and tried to Imagine what it would be like to be a part of a Type III civilization.Lastly, Kaku mentions Star Trek quite often throughout the text, which alone makes this book really cool.

82,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66626170-sairica,4,"I picked up this book randomly because I knew it would be considerably easy to finish as I was familiar with the subject matter of the book.Michio Kaku writes well and included additional data that I was unaware of, which made this book worth my while. He also explained a few concepts, which I had come across before but not fully understood, and made it clear. This book as the tagline explains takes the reader through the tenth dimension. His flow is consistent and he achieves this by reducing his data into four parts. I: Entering the fifth dimension where he takes the reader on a journey from special relativity to general relativity; II: Unification in ten dimensions where he takes the reader on a journey from general relativity to string theory; III: Wormholes where he deals with black holes and time machines and how time travel is not merely possible but probable and it's different types; IV: Masters of Hyperspace where he deals with the question of our future civilization and how the fate of the universe would be inescapable for even them unless the density of the universe was more than 10 raised to -29 gram per cubic centimeter then perhaps our species may have a chance to use the six dimensions towards the end to escape.He discusses the Kardashev scale (to categorise civilizations) and the difficulties our species may have to face reaching Type-I considering that we have discovered the power of element 92 (U), with the help of Einstein's famous e=mc2 equation, without having reached the social development to ensure that we don't unleash it on ourselves (aka self destruct). I actually enjoyed reading this book despite the fact that it was written ages ago even before Edward Witten proclaimed that the string theory was actually M-theory. This was one of my first books by Michio Kaku and I thoroughly enjoyed it except for when he pontificated (throughout) at how this theory found in the 20th century was made for the 21st, considering how we still are not better off.All in all its a popular science read, simple for a lay reader who is interested in understanding a few bits of the only compatible theory of everything. A good readüëç"
83,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4547369-p-dreadful,5,"An Odyssey, indeed. And an entertaining one at that. The book is divided into four parts. The first part discusses the need for a fourth spatial dimension. The second and the third deal with ten-dimensional universes and wormholes (and wormholes within black holes), while the last part is about the death of our universe. The underlying theme of the book is that all the laws of physics can co-exist only in a higher dimension. I had come across terms such as transversible black holes, Casimir effect, quarks, leptons, false vacuum, etc. but I had no idea how they all fitted together. This book explains that and more. The author, one of the founders of the superstring theory, does a brilliant job in explaining complex concepts in a simple, easily digestible format. He explains why there was a need for a higher dimension and goes on to discuss the greatest scientific achievements since Newton that led to the development of a unified field theory. I found the diagrams particularly helpful, especially the ones depicting Flatlanders (living in two-dimensional worlds). Some of the amazing things I learnt from this book are given below: 1. The number of dimensions can only be ten or twenty-six, but it's probably ten(?). Why ten?Because of the factor (N-10) that appears in some equations. 2. Our original ten-dimensional universe was unstable hence it broke up into two four-dimensional (ours) and six-dimensional universes. The latter is tiny (Planck's scale) and folded up. It might be in the shape of a six-dimensional torus (or a doughnut). Have fun trying to visualise that. But this sister universe is not entirely useless.

His flow is consistent and he achieves this by reducing his data into four parts. I: Entering the fifth dimension where he takes the reader on a journey from special relativity to general relativity; II: Unification in ten dimensions where he takes the reader on a journey from general relativity to string theory; III: Wormholes where he deals with black holes and time machines and how time travel is not merely possible but probable and it's different types; IV: Masters of Hyperspace where he deals with the question of our future civilization and how the fate of the universe would be inescapable for even them unless the density of the universe was more than 10 raised to -29 gram per cubic centimeter then perhaps our species may have a chance to use the six dimensions towards the end to escape.He discusses the Kardashev scale (to categorise civilizations) and the difficulties our species may have to face reaching Type-I considering that we have discovered the power of element 92 (U), with the help of Einstein's famous e=mc2 equation, without having reached the social development to ensure that we don't unleash it on ourselves (aka self destruct).

The first part discusses the need for a fourth spatial dimension. The second and the third deal with ten-dimensional universes and wormholes (and wormholes within black holes), while the last part is about the death of our universe. The underlying theme of the book is that all the laws of physics can co-exist only in a higher dimension. I had come across terms such as transversible black holes, Casimir effect, quarks, leptons, false vacuum, etc. but I had no idea how they all fitted together. This book explains that and more. The author, one of the founders of the superstring theory, does a brilliant job in explaining complex concepts in a simple, easily digestible format. He explains why there was a need for a higher dimension and goes on to discuss the greatest scientific achievements since Newton that led to the development of a unified field theory. I found the diagrams particularly helpful, especially the ones depicting Flatlanders (living in two-dimensional worlds). Some of the amazing things I learnt from this book are given below: 1. The number of dimensions can only be ten or twenty-six, but it's probably ten(?). Why ten?Because of the factor (N-10) that appears in some equations. 2. Our original ten-dimensional universe was unstable hence it broke up into two four-dimensional (ours) and six-dimensional universes. The latter is tiny (Planck's scale) and folded up. It might be in the shape of a six-dimensional torus (or a doughnut). Have fun trying to visualise that. But this sister universe is not entirely useless. When our universe starts to undergo the Big Crunch (that is, contract at an alarming rate), we can escape into this six-dimensional universe which will expand. 3. Nature prefers symmetry.4. Black holes may be gateways to alternate, mirror universes.5. The concept of world lines. 6. Our sun may have a sister called Nemesis. We may be a part of a binary star system.Absolutely unputdownable.

114,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5065158-denise,5,"This was an interesting and challenging read for me. I do not have a background in physics or mathematics, but Kaku made String Theory accessible to folks like us. The broader picture and the impact the notion of Hyperspace has on our perceived world is effectively conveyed in his pleasant writing style. I have to admit that the chapters on the specifics of the different theories were the challenging part for me. The math went completely over my head. Luckily understanding grad school level equations was not necessary. I found the need to consult secondary sources to better understand the specific theories, some of which may or may not have been written for grade school students. This is no reflection on Kaku's abilities. Given that he admits that some physicists don't completely understand Quantum and String Theory, this is obviously difficult material to explain to laypersons. As a non-scientist, I mostly enjoyed the philosophical and theological discussions of how the String Theory and Hyperspace change and affect our perception of the universe and our place in it. I especially enjoyed the account of how the various theories and discoveries have influenced the arts, particularly literature. Thanks to this book, I now have a long list of science fiction books and short stories to hunt down.The final section includes a detailed prediction of how civilization will advance, both technologically and scientifically as well as socially, and the various obstacles humanity must overcome in order to master Hyperspace in the distant future. Kaku also discusses the possibility of humanity's ultimate fate. This is not so much the predictions of a fortune teller, but rather educated speculation based on current knowledge. He could be wrong, but he doesn't think so. I found this fascinating, and tried to Imagine what it would be like to be a part of a Type III civilization.Lastly, Kaku mentions Star Trek quite often throughout the text, which alone makes this book really cool.

115,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29920947-andrew,2,"Rife with overly simplistic analogies which serve to muddy rather than illuminate the underlying physical and mathematical principles, this feels like a book written for people that the author believes not only aren‚Äôt educated about said principles (or about the mathematics necessary to truly represent them) but who are also incapable of ever truly understanding them. The former should obviously be held to be true, but the latter makes this book often read like it was written for fools.Kaku also makes many leaps to suppose causation that are laden with fallacy. Every third page seems to present a ‚Äútherefore‚Äù clause that either doesn‚Äôt hold up to simple formal logical scrutiny or which is missing the key causal link that would clarify for the reader. He uses the word multiplet without providing a definition but then dedicates multiple pages of visual diagrams to simply show us matrices of expanding dimensionality, saying ‚Äúthe forces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle‚Äù which belies the basic relation between matrices and dimensions/transformation - something which Kaku never assumes we know nor simply clarifies at any particular point.This felt like reading a bad freshman year Physics For Poets lecture that never ends. It‚Äôs overly dumbed-down science and as a result, unintentionally I‚Äôm sure, much of it constructs a false picture for the reader in the desperate hope of constructing the simplest picture possible."

The author makes complex principles and challenges in physics accessible to the lay reader and argues forcefully that the hyperspace-superstring-10 dimension theory simplifies and synthesizes all known physical observations and the requirements of the conflicting quantum principles of the micro world and the time-space principles of the macro world. Unfortunately, Kaku points out that the energy levels that would be required to provide demonstrable evidence that this theoretical framework are unlikely to be available to humankind in the current millenium, and the limitations of mathematics in its present form doesn't allow a pure math-based ""proof"" of the theory. I found the final chapters outlining the obstacles to continued growth and progression of a late stage 0 civilization like ours and the philosophical and religious implications of the hyperspace theory to be the most intriguing parts of the book. The book is worth a read if you are curious about where the astounding progress in physics might be leading. You will understand much more about the core challenges facing physicists and mathmeticians today and what might lie ahead. "
117,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,3,"Well, to a layman this book may look cool on the shelf :) All that terms strings, time warps, wormholes, hyperspace, tenth dimensions are so fashionable and seemingly technical for general public. :) And here Dr. Kaku likes to dream to tell stories. :) But, I found his thinking patterns wide but not so deep!I don't like the part IV at all. As a literature, it's ok to read but even as a pop science writer, I found him dabble in areas that aren't his expertise.As a writer, he may be great (Though I read only a few books of him ), but I don't appreciate his method of popularizing science; as it may implant a very wrong perspective in the minds of the viewers.Maybe, guys like Dr. Kaku, Bill Nye, Tyson are the bridges between academic and the public.Because the fact is general public don't read the technical literature usually. Besides, popularization is more about stretching imagination and explaining why science did in expensive labs is relevant than about training anyone to do physics. In that light, I think Dr. Kaku was working. But, the effectiveness of his approach to popularizing science could be debated and I prefer Lawrence Krauss more for the same approach."

Unfortunately Kaku's no Feinmann, and the narrative jumps from place to place sometimes taking the reader for a conjectural fool, something the previous generation of popularizer physicists wouldn't do, as to present science-fiction for science.I never finished this one, and I'd really love someone not ""famous"" (i.e. not like Kaku or Neil DeGrasse Tyson) to write a full multitome update of the Feinmann's physics, something that Hawking never did, considering his state it was no surprise, but especially now it is too late; because it has been almost 60 years since Feinmann, physics has expanded and instead of a general, even if ever so huge collection of understandable physics, what we have now is self-promoting science celebrities each working in their own corner, and each having a very cursory understanding of others' work.Skip this book."

He also explained a few concepts, which I had come across before but not fully understood, and made it clear. This book as the tagline explains takes the reader through the tenth dimension. His flow is consistent and he achieves this by reducing his data into four parts. I: Entering the fifth dimension where he takes the reader on a journey from special relativity to general relativity; II: Unification in ten dimensions where he takes the reader on a journey from general relativity to string theory; III: Wormholes where he deals with black holes and time machines and how time travel is not merely possible but probable and it's different types; IV: Masters of Hyperspace where he deals with the question of our future civilization and how the fate of the universe would be inescapable for even them unless the density of the universe was more than 10 raised to -29 gram per cubic centimeter then perhaps our species may have a chance to use the six dimensions towards the end to escape.He discusses the Kardashev scale (to categorise civilizations) and the difficulties our species may have to face reaching Type-I considering that we have discovered the power of element 92 (U), with the help of Einstein's famous e=mc2 equation, without having reached the social development to ensure that we don't unleash it on ourselves (aka self destruct). I actually enjoyed reading this book despite the fact that it was written ages ago even before Edward Witten proclaimed that the string theory was actually M-theory. This was one of my first books by Michio Kaku and I thoroughly enjoyed it except for when he pontificated (throughout) at how this theory found in the 20th century was made for the 21st, considering how we still are not better off.All in all its a popular science read, simple for a lay reader who is interested in understanding a few bits of the only compatible theory of everything. A good readüëç"
173,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4547369-p-dreadful,5,"An Odyssey, indeed. And an entertaining one at that. The book is divided into four parts. The first part discusses the need for a fourth spatial dimension. The second and the third deal with ten-dimensional universes and wormholes (and wormholes within black holes), while the last part is about the death of our universe. The underlying theme of the book is that all the laws of physics can co-exist only in a higher dimension. I had come across terms such as transversible black holes, Casimir effect, quarks, leptons, false vacuum, etc. but I had no idea how they all fitted together. This book explains that and more. The author, one of the founders of the superstring theory, does a brilliant job in explaining complex concepts in a simple, easily digestible format. He explains why there was a need for a higher dimension and goes on to discuss the greatest scientific achievements since Newton that led to the development of a unified field theory. I found the diagrams particularly helpful, especially the ones depicting Flatlanders (living in two-dimensional worlds). Some of the amazing things I learnt from this book are given below: 1. The number of dimensions can only be ten or twenty-six, but it's probably ten(?). Why ten?Because of the factor (N-10) that appears in some equations. 2. Our original ten-dimensional universe was unstable hence it broke up into two four-dimensional (ours) and six-dimensional universes. The latter is tiny (Planck's scale) and folded up. It might be in the shape of a six-dimensional torus (or a doughnut). Have fun trying to visualise that. But this sister universe is not entirely useless. When our universe starts to undergo the Big Crunch (that is, contract at an alarming rate), we can escape into this six-dimensional universe which will expand. 3. Nature prefers symmetry.4. Black holes may be gateways to alternate, mirror universes.5. The concept of world lines. 6. Our sun may have a sister called Nemesis. We may be a part of a binary star system.Absolutely unputdownable. I'd recommend this book to every sci-fi fan out there who has ever wondered if there's something more out there beyond space and time."
174,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5065158-denise,5,"This was an interesting and challenging read for me. I do not have a background in physics or mathematics, but Kaku made String Theory accessible to folks like us. The broader picture and the impact the notion of Hyperspace has on our perceived world is effectively conveyed in his pleasant writing style. I have to admit that the chapters on the specifics of the different theories were the challenging part for me. The math went completely over my head. Luckily understanding grad school level equations was not necessary. I found the need to consult secondary sources to better understand the specific theories, some of which may or may not have been written for grade school students. This is no reflection on Kaku's abilities. Given that he admits that some physicists don't completely understand Quantum and String Theory, this is obviously difficult material to explain to laypersons. As a non-scientist, I mostly enjoyed the philosophical and theological discussions of how the String Theory and Hyperspace change and affect our perception of the universe and our place in it. I especially enjoyed the account of how the various theories and discoveries have influenced the arts, particularly literature. Thanks to this book, I now have a long list of science fiction books and short stories to hunt down.The final section includes a detailed prediction of how civilization will advance, both technologically and scientifically as well as socially, and the various obstacles humanity must overcome in order to master Hyperspace in the distant future. Kaku also discusses the possibility of humanity's ultimate fate. This is not so much the predictions of a fortune teller, but rather educated speculation based on current knowledge. He could be wrong, but he doesn't think so. I found this fascinating, and tried to Imagine what it would be like to be a part of a Type III civilization.Lastly, Kaku mentions Star Trek quite often throughout the text, which alone makes this book really cool.

He also explained a few concepts, which I had come across before but not fully understood, and made it clear. This book as the tagline explains takes the reader through the tenth dimension. His flow is consistent and he achieves this by reducing his data into four parts. I: Entering the fifth dimension where he takes the reader on a journey from special relativity to general relativity; II: Unification in ten dimensions where he takes the reader on a journey from general relativity to string theory; III: Wormholes where he deals with black holes and time machines and how time travel is not merely possible but probable and it's different types; IV: Masters of Hyperspace where he deals with the question of our future civilization and how the fate of the universe would be inescapable for even them unless the density of the universe was more than 10 raised to -29 gram per cubic centimeter then perhaps our species may have a chance to use the six dimensions towards the end to escape.He discusses the Kardashev scale (to categorise civilizations) and the difficulties our species may have to face reaching Type-I considering that we have discovered the power of element 92 (U), with the help of Einstein's famous e=mc2 equation, without having reached the social development to ensure that we don't unleash it on ourselves (aka self destruct). I actually enjoyed reading this book despite the fact that it was written ages ago even before Edward Witten proclaimed that the string theory was actually M-theory. This was one of my first books by Michio Kaku and I thoroughly enjoyed it except for when he pontificated (throughout) at how this theory found in the 20th century was made for the 21st, considering how we still are not better off.All in all its a popular science read, simple for a lay reader who is interested in understanding a few bits of the only compatible theory of everything.

203,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4547369-p-dreadful,5,"An Odyssey, indeed. And an entertaining one at that. The book is divided into four parts. The first part discusses the need for a fourth spatial dimension. The second and the third deal with ten-dimensional universes and wormholes (and wormholes within black holes), while the last part is about the death of our universe. The underlying theme of the book is that all the laws of physics can co-exist only in a higher dimension. I had come across terms such as transversible black holes, Casimir effect, quarks, leptons, false vacuum, etc. but I had no idea how they all fitted together. This book explains that and more. The author, one of the founders of the superstring theory, does a brilliant job in explaining complex concepts in a simple, easily digestible format. He explains why there was a need for a higher dimension and goes on to discuss the greatest scientific achievements since Newton that led to the development of a unified field theory. I found the diagrams particularly helpful, especially the ones depicting Flatlanders (living in two-dimensional worlds). Some of the amazing things I learnt from this book are given below: 1. The number of dimensions can only be ten or twenty-six, but it's probably ten(?). Why ten?Because of the factor (N-10) that appears in some equations. 2. Our original ten-dimensional universe was unstable hence it broke up into two four-dimensional (ours) and six-dimensional universes. The latter is tiny (Planck's scale) and folded up. It might be in the shape of a six-dimensional torus (or a doughnut). Have fun trying to visualise that. But this sister universe is not entirely useless. When our universe starts to undergo the Big Crunch (that is, contract at an alarming rate), we can escape into this six-dimensional universe which will expand. 3. Nature prefers symmetry.4. Black holes may be gateways to alternate, mirror universes.5. The concept of world lines. 6. Our sun may have a sister called Nemesis. We may be a part of a binary star system.Absolutely unputdownable. I'd recommend this book to every sci-fi fan out there who has ever wondered if there's something more out there beyond space and time."
204,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5065158-denise,5,"This was an interesting and challenging read for me. I do not have a background in physics or mathematics, but Kaku made String Theory accessible to folks like us. The broader picture and the impact the notion of Hyperspace has on our perceived world is effectively conveyed in his pleasant writing style. I have to admit that the chapters on the specifics of the different theories were the challenging part for me. The math went completely over my head. Luckily understanding grad school level equations was not necessary. I found the need to consult secondary sources to better understand the specific theories, some of which may or may not have been written for grade school students. This is no reflection on Kaku's abilities. Given that he admits that some physicists don't completely understand Quantum and String Theory, this is obviously difficult material to explain to laypersons. As a non-scientist, I mostly enjoyed the philosophical and theological discussions of how the String Theory and Hyperspace change and affect our perception of the universe and our place in it. I especially enjoyed the account of how the various theories and discoveries have influenced the arts, particularly literature. Thanks to this book, I now have a long list of science fiction books and short stories to hunt down.The final section includes a detailed prediction of how civilization will advance, both technologically and scientifically as well as socially, and the various obstacles humanity must overcome in order to master Hyperspace in the distant future. Kaku also discusses the possibility of humanity's ultimate fate. This is not so much the predictions of a fortune teller, but rather educated speculation based on current knowledge. He could be wrong, but he doesn't think so. I found this fascinating, and tried to Imagine what it would be like to be a part of a Type III civilization.Lastly, Kaku mentions Star Trek quite often throughout the text, which alone makes this book really cool.

207,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,3,"Well, to a layman this book may look cool on the shelf :) All that terms strings, time warps, wormholes, hyperspace, tenth dimensions are so fashionable and seemingly technical for general public. :) And here Dr. Kaku likes to dream to tell stories. :) But, I found his thinking patterns wide but not so deep!I don't like the part IV at all. As a literature, it's ok to read but even as a pop science writer, I found him dabble in areas that aren't his expertise.As a writer, he may be great (Though I read only a few books of him ), but I don't appreciate his method of popularizing science; as it may implant a very wrong perspective in the minds of the viewers.Maybe, guys like Dr. Kaku, Bill Nye, Tyson are the bridges between academic and the public.Because the fact is general public don't read the technical literature usually. Besides, popularization is more about stretching imagination and explaining why science did in expensive labs is relevant than about training anyone to do physics. In that light, I think Dr. Kaku was working. But, the effectiveness of his approach to popularizing science could be debated and I prefer Lawrence Krauss more for the same approach."

Unfortunately Kaku's no Feinmann, and the narrative jumps from place to place sometimes taking the reader for a conjectural fool, something the previous generation of popularizer physicists wouldn't do, as to present science-fiction for science.I never finished this one, and I'd really love someone not ""famous"" (i.e. not like Kaku or Neil DeGrasse Tyson) to write a full multitome update of the Feinmann's physics, something that Hawking never did, considering his state it was no surprise, but especially now it is too late; because it has been almost 60 years since Feinmann, physics has expanded and instead of a general, even if ever so huge collection of understandable physics, what we have now is self-promoting science celebrities each working in their own corner, and each having a very cursory understanding of others' work.Skip this book."

Dr. Michio Kakuthis book explores so many fantastic ideas- worm holes, parallel universes and things you only thought were possible in Sci-Fi TV/films.it will challenge you to think and look at the world in a whole new way.

Although some of the book was way over my head, I read the rest with great interest and learned a busload of new things about Quantum Theory. I enjoyed the read though it took me a long time to get through the book. I did have to skip some of the more technical stuff, but every once in a while a light would go on and I would be elated.I can't comment on the book professionally of course, but if you are interested in Quantum Theory, Dr. Kaku's writing style is extremely easy to read, entertaining in some spots and thoroughly engaging."
212,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2833296-bob,4," Good general history of 20th century physics. I enjoyed the layout of the book -- first half of the book is the history of hyperspace, second half is what can come out of the theory. Loved this part. Wormholes, time travel, black holes and the death of the universe. The author does a good job bringing in sci-fi stories to explain or illustrate the various theories. Some times he would go off on a tangent and try to bring the point back in a rough way."

He also explained a few concepts, which I had come across before but not fully understood, and made it clear. This book as the tagline explains takes the reader through the tenth dimension. His flow is consistent and he achieves this by reducing his data into four parts. I: Entering the fifth dimension where he takes the reader on a journey from special relativity to general relativity; II: Unification in ten dimensions where he takes the reader on a journey from general relativity to string theory; III: Wormholes where he deals with black holes and time machines and how time travel is not merely possible but probable and it's different types; IV: Masters of Hyperspace where he deals with the question of our future civilization and how the fate of the universe would be inescapable for even them unless the density of the universe was more than 10 raised to -29 gram per cubic centimeter then perhaps our species may have a chance to use the six dimensions towards the end to escape.He discusses the Kardashev scale (to categorise civilizations) and the difficulties our species may have to face reaching Type-I considering that we have discovered the power of element 92 (U), with the help of Einstein's famous e=mc2 equation, without having reached the social development to ensure that we don't unleash it on ourselves (aka self destruct). I actually enjoyed reading this book despite the fact that it was written ages ago even before Edward Witten proclaimed that the string theory was actually M-theory. This was one of my first books by Michio Kaku and I thoroughly enjoyed it except for when he pontificated (throughout) at how this theory found in the 20th century was made for the 21st, considering how we still are not better off.All in all its a popular science read, simple for a lay reader who is interested in understanding a few bits of the only compatible theory of everything. A good readüëç"
263,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4547369-p-dreadful,5,"An Odyssey, indeed. And an entertaining one at that. The book is divided into four parts. The first part discusses the need for a fourth spatial dimension. The second and the third deal with ten-dimensional universes and wormholes (and wormholes within black holes), while the last part is about the death of our universe. The underlying theme of the book is that all the laws of physics can co-exist only in a higher dimension. I had come across terms such as transversible black holes, Casimir effect, quarks, leptons, false vacuum, etc. but I had no idea how they all fitted together. This book explains that and more. The author, one of the founders of the superstring theory, does a brilliant job in explaining complex concepts in a simple, easily digestible format. He explains why there was a need for a higher dimension and goes on to discuss the greatest scientific achievements since Newton that led to the development of a unified field theory. I found the diagrams particularly helpful, especially the ones depicting Flatlanders (living in two-dimensional worlds). Some of the amazing things I learnt from this book are given below: 1. The number of dimensions can only be ten or twenty-six, but it's probably ten(?). Why ten?Because of the factor (N-10) that appears in some equations. 2. Our original ten-dimensional universe was unstable hence it broke up into two four-dimensional (ours) and six-dimensional universes. The latter is tiny (Planck's scale) and folded up. It might be in the shape of a six-dimensional torus (or a doughnut). Have fun trying to visualise that. But this sister universe is not entirely useless. When our universe starts to undergo the Big Crunch (that is, contract at an alarming rate), we can escape into this six-dimensional universe which will expand. 3. Nature prefers symmetry.4. Black holes may be gateways to alternate, mirror universes.5. The concept of world lines. 6. Our sun may have a sister called Nemesis. We may be a part of a binary star system.Absolutely unputdownable. I'd recommend this book to every sci-fi fan out there who has ever wondered if there's something more out there beyond space and time."
264,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5065158-denise,5,"This was an interesting and challenging read for me. I do not have a background in physics or mathematics, but Kaku made String Theory accessible to folks like us. The broader picture and the impact the notion of Hyperspace has on our perceived world is effectively conveyed in his pleasant writing style. I have to admit that the chapters on the specifics of the different theories were the challenging part for me. The math went completely over my head. Luckily understanding grad school level equations was not necessary. I found the need to consult secondary sources to better understand the specific theories, some of which may or may not have been written for grade school students. This is no reflection on Kaku's abilities. Given that he admits that some physicists don't completely understand Quantum and String Theory, this is obviously difficult material to explain to laypersons. As a non-scientist, I mostly enjoyed the philosophical and theological discussions of how the String Theory and Hyperspace change and affect our perception of the universe and our place in it. I especially enjoyed the account of how the various theories and discoveries have influenced the arts, particularly literature. Thanks to this book, I now have a long list of science fiction books and short stories to hunt down.The final section includes a detailed prediction of how civilization will advance, both technologically and scientifically as well as socially, and the various obstacles humanity must overcome in order to master Hyperspace in the distant future. Kaku also discusses the possibility of humanity's ultimate fate. This is not so much the predictions of a fortune teller, but rather educated speculation based on current knowledge. He could be wrong, but he doesn't think so. I found this fascinating, and tried to Imagine what it would be like to be a part of a Type III civilization.Lastly, Kaku mentions Star Trek quite often throughout the text, which alone makes this book really cool. All in all, it's an engaging read, and I feel a tiny bit smarter now."
265,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29920947-andrew,2,"Rife with overly simplistic analogies which serve to muddy rather than illuminate the underlying physical and mathematical principles, this feels like a book written for people that the author believes not only aren‚Äôt educated about said principles (or about the mathematics necessary to truly represent them) but who are also incapable of ever truly understanding them. The former should obviously be held to be true, but the latter makes this book often read like it was written for fools.Kaku also makes many leaps to suppose causation that are laden with fallacy. Every third page seems to present a ‚Äútherefore‚Äù clause that either doesn‚Äôt hold up to simple formal logical scrutiny or which is missing the key causal link that would clarify for the reader. He uses the word multiplet without providing a definition but then dedicates multiple pages of visual diagrams to simply show us matrices of expanding dimensionality, saying ‚Äúthe forces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle‚Äù which belies the basic relation between matrices and dimensions/transformation - something which Kaku never assumes we know nor simply clarifies at any particular point.This felt like reading a bad freshman year Physics For Poets lecture that never ends. It‚Äôs overly dumbed-down science and as a result, unintentionally I‚Äôm sure, much of it constructs a false picture for the reader in the desperate hope of constructing the simplest picture possible."

The author makes complex principles and challenges in physics accessible to the lay reader and argues forcefully that the hyperspace-superstring-10 dimension theory simplifies and synthesizes all known physical observations and the requirements of the conflicting quantum principles of the micro world and the time-space principles of the macro world. Unfortunately, Kaku points out that the energy levels that would be required to provide demonstrable evidence that this theoretical framework are unlikely to be available to humankind in the current millenium, and the limitations of mathematics in its present form doesn't allow a pure math-based ""proof"" of the theory. I found the final chapters outlining the obstacles to continued growth and progression of a late stage 0 civilization like ours and the philosophical and religious implications of the hyperspace theory to be the most intriguing parts of the book.

292,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66626170-sairica,4,"I picked up this book randomly because I knew it would be considerably easy to finish as I was familiar with the subject matter of the book.Michio Kaku writes well and included additional data that I was unaware of, which made this book worth my while. He also explained a few concepts, which I had come across before but not fully understood, and made it clear. This book as the tagline explains takes the reader through the tenth dimension. His flow is consistent and he achieves this by reducing his data into four parts. I: Entering the fifth dimension where he takes the reader on a journey from special relativity to general relativity; II: Unification in ten dimensions where he takes the reader on a journey from general relativity to string theory; III: Wormholes where he deals with black holes and time machines and how time travel is not merely possible but probable and it's different types; IV: Masters of Hyperspace where he deals with the question of our future civilization and how the fate of the universe would be inescapable for even them unless the density of the universe was more than 10 raised to -29 gram per cubic centimeter then perhaps our species may have a chance to use the six dimensions towards the end to escape.He discusses the Kardashev scale (to categorise civilizations) and the difficulties our species may have to face reaching Type-I considering that we have discovered the power of element 92 (U), with the help of Einstein's famous e=mc2 equation, without having reached the social development to ensure that we don't unleash it on ourselves (aka self destruct). I actually enjoyed reading this book despite the fact that it was written ages ago even before Edward Witten proclaimed that the string theory was actually M-theory. This was one of my first books by Michio Kaku and I thoroughly enjoyed it except for when he pontificated (throughout) at how this theory found in the 20th century was made for the 21st, considering how we still are not better off.All in all its a popular science read, simple for a lay reader who is interested in understanding a few bits of the only compatible theory of everything. A good readüëç"
293,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4547369-p-dreadful,5,"An Odyssey, indeed. And an entertaining one at that. The book is divided into four parts. The first part discusses the need for a fourth spatial dimension. The second and the third deal with ten-dimensional universes and wormholes (and wormholes within black holes), while the last part is about the death of our universe. The underlying theme of the book is that all the laws of physics can co-exist only in a higher dimension. I had come across terms such as transversible black holes, Casimir effect, quarks, leptons, false vacuum, etc. but I had no idea how they all fitted together. This book explains that and more. The author, one of the founders of the superstring theory, does a brilliant job in explaining complex concepts in a simple, easily digestible format. He explains why there was a need for a higher dimension and goes on to discuss the greatest scientific achievements since Newton that led to the development of a unified field theory. I found the diagrams particularly helpful, especially the ones depicting Flatlanders (living in two-dimensional worlds). Some of the amazing things I learnt from this book are given below: 1. The number of dimensions can only be ten or twenty-six, but it's probably ten(?). Why ten?Because of the factor (N-10) that appears in some equations. 2. Our original ten-dimensional universe was unstable hence it broke up into two four-dimensional (ours) and six-dimensional universes. The latter is tiny (Planck's scale) and folded up. It might be in the shape of a six-dimensional torus (or a doughnut). Have fun trying to visualise that. But this sister universe is not entirely useless. When our universe starts to undergo the Big Crunch (that is, contract at an alarming rate), we can escape into this six-dimensional universe which will expand. 3. Nature prefers symmetry.4. Black holes may be gateways to alternate, mirror universes.5. The concept of world lines. 6. Our sun may have a sister called Nemesis. We may be a part of a binary star system.Absolutely unputdownable. I'd recommend this book to every sci-fi fan out there who has ever wondered if there's something more out there beyond space and time."
294,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5065158-denise,5,"This was an interesting and challenging read for me. I do not have a background in physics or mathematics, but Kaku made String Theory accessible to folks like us. The broader picture and the impact the notion of Hyperspace has on our perceived world is effectively conveyed in his pleasant writing style. I have to admit that the chapters on the specifics of the different theories were the challenging part for me. The math went completely over my head. Luckily understanding grad school level equations was not necessary. I found the need to consult secondary sources to better understand the specific theories, some of which may or may not have been written for grade school students. This is no reflection on Kaku's abilities. Given that he admits that some physicists don't completely understand Quantum and String Theory, this is obviously difficult material to explain to laypersons. As a non-scientist, I mostly enjoyed the philosophical and theological discussions of how the String Theory and Hyperspace change and affect our perception of the universe and our place in it. I especially enjoyed the account of how the various theories and discoveries have influenced the arts, particularly literature. Thanks to this book, I now have a long list of science fiction books and short stories to hunt down.The final section includes a detailed prediction of how civilization will advance, both technologically and scientifically as well as socially, and the various obstacles humanity must overcome in order to master Hyperspace in the distant future. Kaku also discusses the possibility of humanity's ultimate fate. This is not so much the predictions of a fortune teller, but rather educated speculation based on current knowledge. He could be wrong, but he doesn't think so. I found this fascinating, and tried to Imagine what it would be like to be a part of a Type III civilization.Lastly, Kaku mentions Star Trek quite often throughout the text, which alone makes this book really cool. All in all, it's an engaging read, and I feel a tiny bit smarter now."
295,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29920947-andrew,2,"Rife with overly simplistic analogies which serve to muddy rather than illuminate the underlying physical and mathematical principles, this feels like a book written for people that the author believes not only aren‚Äôt educated about said principles (or about the mathematics necessary to truly represent them) but who are also incapable of ever truly understanding them. The former should obviously be held to be true, but the latter makes this book often read like it was written for fools.Kaku also makes many leaps to suppose causation that are laden with fallacy. Every third page seems to present a ‚Äútherefore‚Äù clause that either doesn‚Äôt hold up to simple formal logical scrutiny or which is missing the key causal link that would clarify for the reader. He uses the word multiplet without providing a definition but then dedicates multiple pages of visual diagrams to simply show us matrices of expanding dimensionality, saying ‚Äúthe forces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle‚Äù which belies the basic relation between matrices and dimensions/transformation - something which Kaku never assumes we know nor simply clarifies at any particular point.This felt like reading a bad freshman year Physics For Poets lecture that never ends. It‚Äôs overly dumbed-down science and as a result, unintentionally I‚Äôm sure, much of it constructs a false picture for the reader in the desperate hope of constructing the simplest picture possible."

The author makes complex principles and challenges in physics accessible to the lay reader and argues forcefully that the hyperspace-superstring-10 dimension theory simplifies and synthesizes all known physical observations and the requirements of the conflicting quantum principles of the micro world and the time-space principles of the macro world. Unfortunately, Kaku points out that the energy levels that would be required to provide demonstrable evidence that this theoretical framework are unlikely to be available to humankind in the current millenium, and the limitations of mathematics in its present form doesn't allow a pure math-based ""proof"" of the theory. I found the final chapters outlining the obstacles to continued growth and progression of a late stage 0 civilization like ours and the philosophical and religious implications of the hyperspace theory to be the most intriguing parts of the book. The book is worth a read if you are curious about where the astounding progress in physics might be leading. You will understand much more about the core challenges facing physicists and mathmeticians today and what might lie ahead. "
297,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,3,"Well, to a layman this book may look cool on the shelf :) All that terms strings, time warps, wormholes, hyperspace, tenth dimensions are so fashionable and seemingly technical for general public. :) And here Dr. Kaku likes to dream to tell stories. :) But, I found his thinking patterns wide but not so deep!I don't like the part IV at all. As a literature, it's ok to read but even as a pop science writer, I found him dabble in areas that aren't his expertise.As a writer, he may be great (Though I read only a few books of him ), but I don't appreciate his method of popularizing science; as it may implant a very wrong perspective in the minds of the viewers.Maybe, guys like Dr. Kaku, Bill Nye, Tyson are the bridges between academic and the public.Because the fact is general public don't read the technical literature usually. Besides, popularization is more about stretching imagination and explaining why science did in expensive labs is relevant than about training anyone to do physics. In that light, I think Dr. Kaku was working. But, the effectiveness of his approach to popularizing science could be debated and I prefer Lawrence Krauss more for the same approach."

299,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5928646-ivan,1,"A friend lent me this book in summer 2004, and I was initially very enthusiastic about reading it, coming from a place where ""famous"" scientists weren't exactly a thing, and the two most locally famous of them were probably Feinmann and Yoffe. Unfortunately Kaku's no Feinmann, and the narrative jumps from place to place sometimes taking the reader for a conjectural fool, something the previous generation of popularizer physicists wouldn't do, as to present science-fiction for science.I never finished this one, and I'd really love someone not ""famous"" (i.e. not like Kaku or Neil DeGrasse Tyson) to write a full multitome update of the Feinmann's physics, something that Hawking never did, considering his state it was no surprise, but especially now it is too late; because it has been almost 60 years since Feinmann, physics has expanded and instead of a general, even if ever so huge collection of understandable physics, what we have now is self-promoting science celebrities each working in their own corner, and each having a very cursory understanding of others' work.Skip this book."
