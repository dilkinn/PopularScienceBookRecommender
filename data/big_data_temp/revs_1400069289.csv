0,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1381799-sleeps9hours,2,"I just read Kelly McGonigal's ""The Willpower Instinct"", so I can't help but compare the two.Duhigg is an investigative reporter for the NY Times, while McGonigal is a research psychologist, and the differences come across in the writing. McGonigal has a much better grasp on the research and how to apply it, while Duhigg brings in stories that are entertaining but stretch his powers of interpretation. His most annoying stylistic problem is that he breaks his stories up, stopping one to start another and then coming back to it later. I assume he's trying to add a sense of anticipation and drama to what should otherwise be a straightforward nonfiction book, but I found it frustrating for him to be jumping back and forth for no good reason.I did enjoy many of his stories though. The most interesting was in the section about social habits where he explains why the arrest of Rosa Parks was so influential while other black women at the same time had also refused to give up their seats but didn't spark much interest (Parks had social ties across dozens of groups, black and white, and knew some people of influence). The entire story of how Martin Luther King, Jr. became involved, and all the people who got the bus boycott rolling is so fascinating to hear in detail. "
1,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/373260-k,3,"Read this because of fascinating NYT magazine excerpt on how Target tracks our buying habits. The rest of the book is not as compelling -- anecdotes sometimes don't support particular arguments he's attempting to illustrate (the Hey-Ya examples being the most egregious), and his section on how social movements occur is weak and unconvincing, and not really about habits, per se. Style and structure were often clunky, and the book seems a bit muddled as its ultimate purpose. I dunno, I guess I was expecting slightly more substantial psychology or social science and instead got more of a book solidly for businesses/manager types and people on the beginning of their self-help journeys. But I fall into the latter category, so why am I pooh pooh-ing this book so much? I dunno. Maybe I am just jealous of how $$$ money this dude's gonna make at corporate speaking gigs. Anyway, lessons I'll take away -- *making your bed every morning and committing to regular exercise are two habits that can transform your entire goddamn life*Diagram about mouse brain activity spike post-reward eventually arriving prior to reward (the origin of cravings)*Changing habits requires identifying the cues and rewards that trigger and support the habit behavior, then trying out various substitutes for the behavior that might achieve the same reward*deliberate advance plans for responding to challenging situations can be extremely helpful (ex Scottish knee/hip replacement patients, Michael Phelps, Starbucks)*With more challenging habits like alcoholism or stuff related to football, true belief and submission to some higher purpose is necessary*in general, it's more effective to change others' habits if you make them believe they have some power or authority over their decision than if you coerce them with force *casinos are super evil"
2,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12827408-robert-chapman,5,"This is great book, and you need to read it. How is that for a definitive opening line? The reason it’s such a good book is because it uses research to explain how habits are formed and changed. Everyone knows someone who was out of shape, or was a smoker, and then in what appeared as if almost overnight, changed themselves in a short period of time. How did they do that? They formed new habits and changed old ones, that’s how.Do something enough and it becomes a habit, good or bad. This is explained in the book by research on memory loss. For example, the research found that patients suffering from memory loss could not show someone where the kitchen is when asked, but once they got hungry the would get up and go to the kitchen automatically.This is made possible by the habit loop of cue, routine, and reward. The cue makes the brain find the routine as it anticipates the reward. A classic example is stress and smoking, the cue is stress, the routine is smoking, the reward is the feeling the cigarette brings.I was most interested in how the book described changing a habit. Let’s face it, we all have habits we want to change. To accomplish this we need to keep the cue and reward, but change the routine. I’ll use an example from my own life to illustrate. I love chocolate, and to make it worse I love to eat at it night. Well I love to eat at night because that is how I formed the habit some time ago. I used the guidance from this book to change that habit. I kept the cue and reward, but I changed the routine to use apples instead of chocolate.This logic flows into much larger problem sets such as organizations and communities. Focus on changing one thing, the keystone habit from which a cascade of other habits will form. The author illustrates this example by discussing how the company Alcoa was transformed by the keystone habit of a singular focus on safety.The book flows really well and uses research throughout to substantiate the concepts presented. The audience who can benefit from this book is vast, from individuals to corporates to governments."
3,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,2,"I was looking forward to a substantial, science and evidence based, compelling read, but just found many mixed up ego and self finding trips, business manager motivation yada, and some good points accidentally mixed in. Read Clear James` Atomic habits instead, it´s much better. What is really strange is that the chapters seem to follow a logical approach, if one orients her/himself as always first by the titles of the index, and it looks like they are dealing with the meta or concrete context, but are in reality just anecdotes, except of some technobabble about Target´s use of pattern recognition, AI, and behavioral science; I mean, why? Was it too difficult to pimp the already written material with the help of some experts to combine both nonfiction and autobiographical elements instead of this? It seems as if many people are getting their swift kick out of procrastination by material available in any newspaper column, youtube guru channel, or whatever, but I just don´t get the hype around it. Worst of it, with this social science mixup and freely interpretation of the stories in a highly subjective style he is entering the realm of, don´t be scared or stop reading and forget liking my review, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replica...You see, it´s sweet if some unique people with subjective mindsets and different characters deal with difficult situations in a positive way, but I don´t get the picture of how Duhigg can extrapolate this to universal ideas as if he would have used real scientific evidence of, let´s say, long term studies going over decades with millions of participants, or brain chemistry, neurology, or anything substantial instead of person XY had results YZ. This has absolutely no worth for the reader. There are a handful of useful tips one can take away, most of them available in shorter, better, free, and easier form available in many wikis (see end of the review) if one just searches for motivation, positive psychology, meditation, self reflection, behavior, etc. that don´t just repeat commonplaces. How he is trying to deal with addiction is pop psychology at it´s worst and that the book doesn´t really offer solutions, plans, or at least good sources for more research is the kicker, as it´s what the title and marketing are implying and promising. It´s not totally bad, but very, very overhyped and the sad thing is that people mind find it great to read this motivating stories, but without a concrete plan to self development and improvement, the motivation fades away as quickly as the memory of the redundant, convertible tiny tales. Oh, did I mention that reading the book has the lovely extra element of being belittled by a condescending, narcissistic writing style? A completely failed approach that depreciates the few, good elements in it and insults the reader. Ok, one more, it stigmatizes the victims of gambling, addictions, or shopaholics instead of just moving a centimeter (review written in Europe, sorry) towards asking why such unregulated industries can easily hunt down already weakened human game. Shame on you, gambler! Evil shopaholic! How dare you having an alcohol problem! That´s a wise, mature, and productive way of dealing with serious topics. Without this, I would have given 3 stars, but including own, restricted bias and agenda disguised as facts downed it to 2. Funny, just now that I am thinking about it, how each hard earned everyman bill has to be tracked down and taxed, while letting people lose everything within hours, the reasons for addictions, or brainwashing for consumerism is absolutely no problem and Duhigg is completely ignoring the structures producing the problems because he is so busy with victim blaming and shaming. Other authors stay objective or avoid such topics instead of superficially dealing with it to boost sales. I am pretty sure that some of the concepts and ideas won´t stand the test of time, as real science, medicine, and screening technology improve, and as they appear like very soft humanities stuff. A final subjective list of elements a good nonfiction book should at least have, that are quite missing in this one:A detailed plan how to DIY.Own theories that are defined as subjective opinions in the case of humanities or, and in natural sciences, proofed by many hard facts.New combinations of existing theories and ideas.Entertaining, very well written anecdotes. There is not much new under the sun and most fictional and nonfiction works are remixes and new interpretations of facts and tropes, but that doesn´t mean that it have to be loveless, average, wrong, and presumptuous concoctions. But thanks for extra training to deal with anger through cognitive techniques and quick meditations, at least it´s good for that.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positiv...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavio...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindful..."
4,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242918-rhianna,2," This may be a crappy review since its going up via iPhone. Sorry. First caveat: I work in research. A big part of my job is creating these habit loops and seeing if they can be altered or enhanced via medication. Second caveat: I'm a nerd and love journal articles, scientific writing, and technical reading, even off the job.Third caveat: I only got to chapter eight. I honestly don't know what I was expecting. By far and large, when there's big buzz about a book I inevitably dislike it with very few exceptions. I was hoping for something smart and eye opening; a different, more personal take on habits and addiction (which is really what a habit is if you think about it), and I was let down mostly by the writing and anecdotes. I realize this book isn't intended for scientific review, but when there were so many teasing moments of talking about the research going on, I guess I just expected a little more substance in laymans terms. The biggest problem I had with the book was that I probably could have only read the first few chapters and have a total grasp of the theory. While some stories were interesting, they reminded me of Grandpa Simpson's storytelling. I don't think we needed so many examples that all said the same thing. Think of all the trees that could have been saved if a few were omitted. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad read. People with a non-neuroscience background can enjoy it and will learn something from it. Although how to apply it to your life is pretty much missing from the book (unless it was in the chapters I didn't get to yet). Yeah, find a new reward to break bad habits, but how? It would have been interesting to see those suggestions. Overall, not horrible. Had it not been a book club read I wouldn't have picked it up of my own volition, but I'm not upset that I read most of it. I am upset that I kept reading hoping to get something different in the next chapter, which didn't happen. Just save the time and money and read his NY Times article (at least I think it was there) instead. "
5,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,3,"I need to start with the obvious – this guy is one of those writers. One of those writers that make you want to track him down and hurt him. And not just him, maybe even his pets too. He assumes you are as thick as dog-shit and that you won’t get what it is he is talking about unless he makes it painfully (PAINFULLY) clear. He has missed his calling. He really should have gone into the self-help book market – let’s face it, assuming your readers are dumb in that market is just ‘responding to reality’. You might be wondering why I gave this book three stars, given I wanted to find ways to hurt the author. Well, the problem is that some of the ideas here are not insane, in fact, some are really well worth thinking about. It’s just that someone (someone who also needs hunted down, now that I think about it) has told this guy you need to ‘tell a story’. And while this is often excellent advice – you also need to remember that people are reading your book for a reason and that reason isn’t to cry over the last moments of a drug addict’s life or to find out how the skunk lady got laid. No, it is to find out about the affect of habits and what we can do to change the habits of a life time that are stuffing up our lives.I’ve been reading lots of Bourdieu lately. He talks of Habitus – what he calls the ‘feel for the game’, but basically the habits we have that are so unconscious we don't even know they are habits and so, therefore, have no idea what a huge part they play in shaping the kinds of people we are. So we tend to think that because we wouldn’t do something someone else clearly has done that automatically qualifies us for the golden stamp of merit. Whereas, so much of what we do in life is either non-rational or automatic – having those automatic structures implanted in us from no age is more a matter of luck than of rational deliberation.This guy stuffs up his argument at the end by not having the conviction of what his view on habits was telling him. He tells a long, long, long story of a woman that lost everything through gambling. Terribly sad and all that. But obviously this book is written in America and so nothing can come between the rights of rich people to take money from poor people. So, the fact that casinos do everything to manipulate you so that you end up with nothing is YOUR fault, not theirs – have you no self control? Have you no free will? I think this guy should read Sam Harris’s new book. Either that or he needs to also argue that it should be ok for drug dealers to offer kids drugs at schools and in the streets – if one is wrong it isn’t at all obvious why the other is right. And if not drugs to kids, then drugs to adults – unless I’m missing something the same argument applies.This book is quite chilling in that it explains – in very long and all too often boring detail, in fact endless bloody detail, just how companies like Target are targeting you and manipulating you to buy and buy and buy. Yet again this is presented as if it was nothing to be concerned about – but I struggled to read it as something I should just shrug and get over. When I first learned about data warehousing it sent a cold shiver down my spine – I have never had ‘Fly Buys’ or any other of those ‘loyalty’ programs that give those arseholes all of my details so they can work out how to better market to people like me. I’m manipulated enough in life without needing to provide billionaires with better weapons to trip me up.The information in this book is very worthwhile. But if you ever needed proof that Gladwell has lots to answer for, this book is Item A on the case for the prosecution. And what the hell is it about American Football? I hope to God it isn’t nearly as uninteresting to watch as it is to read about. No wonder Americans invade countries at the drop of a hat – anything to get away from two down on the thirty-first yard line with a wingback on a hiding to nowhere blah, blah AHHHHH!!!! "
6,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,3,"Nothing Succeeds Like Success: A Case StudyHey. Have you heard of Thomas Baker? How about Carol Wright? Chris Cameron? Vineet Shaw? Let us discuss Baker.Thomas Baker was an average joe, but not without ambitions. A few years ago, acting on a tip, Tom, a competitive enough guy, decided to take his life into his own hands. What’s more, he decided to pick up one more Self-help book and this time follow up thoroughly on it. No holds barred. He asked around, looked in that wonderful site and finally decided on what seemed to him like the best out there right now. The ratings seemed to be out of the world too. The author, in the intro, even tries to reassure him against feeling overwhelmed by the excess of research in the book. This is exactly the sort of help that Tom needed. Tom read the book with great diligence. He made notes and he made placards and he even bought magnets for his fridge and special sticky tapes for his mirrors. He knew this could work. He only had to believe.He changed his routines, identified and included habit-forming cues. He created them, he played around with them, he even had some fun. He was very inventive and imaginative. The author would have commended the effort if he knew. Tom decide that he would write to Duhigg about his success once it pays off. A month passed. Tom had made slight improvements but no major pay-off seemed to be in the offing. He chided himself for expecting windfalls. He reminded himself that these things take time. He kept at it.6 months now. Even the minor gains he had made originally have fallen by the wayside now. He had read the book thrice in this time, trying to reaffirm his faith. He was discouraged now but he kept at it.2 years. The book is long forgotten. But Tom had taken the trouble to document his experiences and had sent a detailed case study to the author. He had requested that it be included in the next edition of the book. He wanted the author to include a chapter on failures - on how it might not work for everyone. He wanted a caveat, a mild statement of warning that just because a book worth of case studies of success is presented, there is no reason to expect that any approach (no matter how good) might work for everyone. Humans would be fulfilling Asimovesque dreams if that were the case. He thought this would add depth and realism to an otherwise fine book.He did not even get an auto-generated acknowledgment slip. But that was ok, he had discovered a new Gladwell book on another airport aisle. Apparently, it is not just habits that doesn’t stick, lessons don’t either. "
7,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,4,"I remember reading a story by the famous Malayalam writer Padmarajan called Oru Sameepakala Durantham (""A Tragedy of Recent Times""). It tells of a housing colony in Kerala, bitten by the exercise bug in the early eighties. Someone gets up before sunrise and starts jogging. Soon, he is joined by more and more people until the whole colony is out running, every day. This leaves the houses unattended which comes to the notice of a group of thieves: and they conduct a spate of early morning robberies. The people of the colony, even after a couple of houses are robbed, continue their morning ritual - they can't stop, even after they know that their houses may be invaded any time.Padmarajan ostensibly wrote this seemingly absurd and Kafkaesque story to make fun of the urban animal, blindly following the latest fad. But he may have more true to life than he thought.Such is the power of habit.------------------------------This book by Duhigg, if you can get past the unnecessarily prolix prose, says a very simple but significant thing: habit is what drives you. From picking your nose to gambling away your life's savings, ingrained habits hard-coded into your brain makes you tick. It follows the ""cue-routine-reward"" loop as illustrated below:(Cue = a certain time; routine = eat a cookie; reward = diversion from work)Habits are not endemic to people alone - organisations and societies also have habits, which why they are so resistant to change.The key to getting rid of a destructive habit is to replace it with a constructive one. In the loop illustrated above, the cue and the reward would remain the same, but a different routine can be substituted. See below:(Here the routine of ""have a drink"" is replaced with ""have a chat"")This is easier said than done, however: it requires real effort to identify a habit, and great will power (which can be cultivated, according to Duhigg) to change it. But it can be done. Successful individuals have changed their lives by changing destructive habits: successful executives have turned around companies by changing corporate habits: and leaders have transformed societies. Examples abound in this book.And please note: supermarket chains and gambling dens monitor our habits and feed those which will drain our pockets and maximise their profits.------------------------------This book is well worth a read. I only wish that the author had cut the fluff and trimmed it down to a slimmer volume. But then, the HABIT of writing needlessly long books among American journalists is one that dies hard."
8,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,1,"This long-winded book explains how habits form in individuals, organizations, and social groups. Despite the intriguing premise, the verbose anecdotes left me screaming, “I get the point already!” A better book (or article) would have resulted from taking the appendix (a short, practical guide to changing a habit) and adding some of the psychological research and a few brief examples. (After I wrote this review, I discovered Charles Duhigg's New York Times article, which is basically what I described). The book’s moral is a respectable one: once you’re aware of a bad habit, it’s your responsibility to change it.My favorite case study was the one about Target using predictive analytics and behavioral research to personalize its marketing to each shopper’s habits.• A habit is a cue that triggers a routine that results in a reward.• Habits can’t be eradicated; they can only be replaced.• The Golden Rule of Habit Change: to replace a habit, keep the cue and reward but replace the routine.• “For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”• Studies show that willpower is a finite resource; it's like a muscle that tires with use. Willpower can be increased by exercising self-discipline. Increasing self-discipline in one area of life increases it in other areas.• To introduce new habits, “sandwich” them between existing ones so they feel familiar.• Habits are most susceptible to being altered when your life changes. Having a baby is the event that produces the most habit changes."
9,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/903066-johnny,5,"Judging from the prologue of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business, the first thing necessary in modifying one’s behavior is to note the actual components of that behavior. The author cites a visit with a military officer in charge of normalizing a village (Kufa) in Iraq. The officer started by observing video of how riots began and noticed that the trouble usually broke out after people had milled around for a while and food trucks and spectators arrived. He changed the behavior by asking the mayor not to allow food trucks into the areas where people were demonstrating (p. 13 on Sony eReader, as will be all pagination in the remainder of this review). Something as simple as the presence of food trucks threw off a habit of violence and allowed some normalization. This seemed amazing, but something resonated strongly with this truth.The Power of Habits begins with anecdotal accounts of people who changed destructive habits in their lives and one account of a man who had absolutely no short term memory but was able to function as a result of habits already ingrained within him. The latter case demonstrated that there was something distinctive between one part of our brain and another. So, the author takes the reader on a tour of a lab at M.I.T. where scientists have been researching a golf ball-sized lump in the brain called the basal ganglia since 1990 (p. 25). Apparently, the basal ganglia stores habits while the rest of the brain works less and less because the “chunks” of actions stored in that section of the brain takes over (p. 26). Arriving at this understanding, researchers were able to use different experiments to ascertain a “habit loop.” They noticed that a certain cue triggers a set of automatic reactions such that the being feels rewarded. As a result of being rewarded, there is an even stronger response to the same cue on the next occasion (p. 29) Of course, if reward can reinforce the habit whenever one senses that cue, changing the reward can eventually extinguish that habit (p. 30) as the researchers discovered by moving the chocolate around the maze to mess up the behaviors.So, what kinds of “cues” work? The Power of Habits tells the story of Claude Hopkins, an advertising legend who “created” the demand for toothpaste by creating a “craving.” Hopkins noticed in dental research that there is a film that forms on our teeth. He decided to get people to “feel” the mucin plaques on their teeth by calling them “the film” and suggesting that “beauty” comes from eliminating the film (p. 40). By identifying a “cue” (the film that is almost always there) and suggesting a “reward” (getting rid of that film), he established a multi-million dollar product. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Yet, the book goes on to tell the story of Febreze, the air freshener that started out as a failure. Even though it was extremely effective in getting rid of odors, it wasn’t selling because people in odiferous situations became used to the odors. They weren’t getting the cue. So, there had to be a better way to cue the reward and that came to be with pleasant fragrances and the idea of “finishing” a task with beautiful smelling Febreze (a tactic that is still being used in dozens of new products in this product line to the present day (p. 56). The “habit loop” works even better when a “craving” is attached to it. It turns out that Pepsodent already had the craving element built in with the citric acid or mint taste that rewarded users with a tingling sense of feeling clean. It’s pretty masterful the way this author closes the loop in each chapter.Then, a chapter introduces the “Golden Rule” of habit change. It notes that you can never quite remove a bad habit, but you need to substitute a new routine between the cue and the reward (p. 61). In this chapter, Tony Dungy’s coaching philosophy of substituting a simpler playbook with more repetition for the old routine of over-thinking what one might be trying to do. In this way, the new routine would reside between the cue (hiking the ball?) and the reward (scoring a touchdown? Making a sack of the QB?) and more success would result (p. 62). Naturally, this chapter wraps Dungy’s experiences with turning around the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Indianapolis Colts football teams around the history of Alcoholics Anonymous. Both Dungy as a coach and Bill Wilson who founded A.A. teach people to substitute new routines for the old ones (p. 68), bad football in the former and alcohol abuse in the latter.One of the keys to Dungy’s eventual success and one of the core tenets of A.A. (or any 12-step) program is that one must believe in something. Dungy complained early on that practice was going well and everything was coming together, but the training would disappear during the big games. When he heard the players saying that they went back to what they knew during critical games, Dungy said, “What they were really saying was that they trusted our system most of the time, but when everything was on the line, that belief broken down.” (p. 75) And, as one researching from the University of New Mexico noted, belief is critical in order for change to work in the long run (p. 78). The section on “habits” in business wasn’t as interesting to me, but even there I found some intriguing aspects. It was fascinating to read about how “keystone habits encourage widespread change: by creating cultures where new values become ingrained.” (p. 109) This section told the story of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O’ Neill’s success at Alcoa. O’ Neill’s emphasis was safety. By placing the emphasis on safety, he gave the corporation something around which management (because of reducing lost work days) and unions (because of emphasizing the safety of the workers) could both agree upon. There was also an insight with regard to the gay liberation movement. Duhigg suggests that when the Library of Congress re-categorized books on homosexuality as its own subject matter rather than under mental illness, it provided a paradigm shift that fueled the movement (p. 100). It just shows how little shifts can have seismic effects, not only on individuals, but on society.Another corporate chapter used an experiment on willpower where half of the group was allowed to eat fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies while another group was forced to eat radishes. Sounds like the latter would have a healthy advantage when the group was asked to perform a complex problem which had no real solution! Sounds like they would be more mentally fresh! Wrong! Those who had eaten the radishes were most likely to quit after only a few minutes while the cookie eaters kept on for half an hour or so. Why? Researchers concluded that the first portion of the experiment had used up much of the finite willpower in the radish eaters (p. 119). A later study showed that using kindness to set up the willpower goals as opposed to ordering willpower allowed those who experienced kindness to concentrate longer (p. 130).Building on that idea, Duhigg recounted a Scottish rehabilitation study where the elderly patients who were most successful in learning to walk again in spite of excruciating pain had identified potential obstacles in advance and created their own ways of dealing with them. “Put another way, the patients’ plans were built around inflection points when they knew their pain—and thus the temptation to quit—would be the strongest.” (p. 124) Starbucks put this to work in what they called the LATTE method (Listen to the customer, Acknowledge their complaint, Take action by solving the problem, Thank them, and then, Explain why the problem occurred.) in dealing with irate customers (p. 126).Another chapter deals with destructive institutional habits: “There are no organizations without institutional habits. There are only places where they are deliberately designed, and places where they are created without forethought, so they often grow from rivalries or fear.” (p. 137) “Companies aren’t families. They’re battlefields in a civil war.” (p. 139) I was also fascinated with the chapter on consumer behavior. Did you know that almost everyone turns right after entering a retail establishment and that retailers stock their most profitable items on the right side of the store? (p. 157) Did you know that people’s buying habits change when they go through a major life event (marriage, having a child, divorce, moving)? (p. 162) And, in the facts are stranger than fiction department, Duhigg cites a company named Polyphonic HMI that statistically analyzes the mathematical characters of a song and predicts its popularity. (p. 167) Why is that strange? It’s because Norman Spinrad, a terrific science-fiction author, “predicts” it in his novel in the 1980s--Little Heroes. Sorry, Duhigg doesn’t cite Spinrad; that’s me. I was happy that Duhigg recounted a huge Polyphonic miscalculation. It also explained why I don’t listen to music on the radio very much: “Our brains crave familiarity in music because familiarity is how we manage to hear without becoming distracted by all the sound.” (p. 171) I actually listen to the radio for stimuli.The section on the habits of societies was particularly relevant to me because the first chapter dealt with churches, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Montgomery church and Rick Warren’s Saddleback Community Church. Starting with the idea of a social network of friendships and growing through informal ties (Duhigg calls them “weak ties”) and changing community habits, social habits turn on personal integrity and relationships. Duhigg pointed out how Rosa Park’s ties that transcended the social stratifications of the black community through her volunteer involvement with many groups on many levels enabled her to become the catalyst that she was (p. 184) The important insight that was new to me was: “The habits of peer pressure … often spread through weak ties. And they gain their authority through communal expectations. If you ignore the social obligations of your neighborhood, if you shrug off the expected patterns of your community, you risk losing your social standing.” (p. 189) Sadly, I was disappointed in the section on Rick Warren. The book makes it sound like Warren selected Saddleback Community from a long way away by citing Warren’s seminary education in Texas and work as a volunteer missionary in Japan. Strangely, it doesn’t mention the fact that Saddleback was only a little more 30 minutes drive from where Warren attended college in Riverside or that Warren’s father had been a professional minister in California prior to his retirement. I did like the emphasis on small groups as the key to creating a “sticky” environment that “…drew on already-existing social urges and patterns.” (p. 198) One significant section of the book was dedicated to the idea of whether we are responsible for our habits. By juxtaposing the tale of a gambler (if you listen to This American Life on public radio, you probably heard this story) who went to court with a major casino chain by insisting that the casino operators were responsible for her problem alongside that of a British subject who killed his wife during sleep terrors, Duhigg raises the issue but concludes by stating that he believes it is possible to change habits—any habits. The gambler protested that she just wanted to feel good at something (p. 208) and the killer protested that he honestly thought his wife was a male intruder assaulting his wife (p. 209).This section pointed out that, for example, sleepwalking is a reminder that sleep and wakefulness aren't that separate so that the brain can accomplish complex activities and nothing is guiding the brain except patterns. (pp. 210-211) Even more powerful are the behaviors described as “sleep terrors.” Sleep terrors are primitive neurological patterns (p.212). It even points out that a 2010 MRI study of gamblers discovered that, to pathological gamblers, brain activity was so high that it treated near misses as wins (p.220) when, in fact, they were losses. So, can such ingrained perceptions be changed? Duhigg cites William James’ decision to believe in free will as opposed to surrendering to suicide (p. 226). As James tried his 12 month long experiment, he discovered that habits were based upon exercising them (pp. 226-227) much like a well-folded paper or an old pair of well-creased slacks. And all of these great narratives point the reader toward the most useful part of the book, learning to change behavior by identifying the routine, figuring out the cue that triggers the routine and the craving underlying that cue by experimenting with different rewards (p. 230). If you can figure out what you really want and substitute a better routine to satisfy that craving, you will be well on your way toward changing that habit. That doesn’t mean you won’t fall off the wagon, but it means you will be on your way to shaping your actions by your will as opposed to ingrained behaviors."
10,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,4,Our local book club read this a few years ago. I thought I had a review....perhaps it disappeared? Maybe it's still here? I saw a friend currently reading it. I thought this book explained some useful information: Talked about success through good habits - organizational skills ----addictions- habits hard to break and how to create new ones --lots of repetition. ( some basic common sense - but also good tidbits and even validation in some areas) The personal stories of people's lives were interesting.... and my favorite part about reading this book was the book discussion with the people in my book club group after.

The Habit loop is a neurological pattern that governs any habit. It consists of three elements: a cue, a routine, and a reward. Understanding these components can help in understanding how to change bad habits or form good ones. The habit loop is always started with a cue, a trigger that transfers the brain into a mode that automatically determines which habit to use. The heart of the habit is a mental, emotional, or physical routine. عنوانها: نقش و قدرت عادت‌ها در زندگی؛ نیروی عادت: علت آنچه در زندگی و کارمان انجام می‌دهیم چیست؟ قدرت عادت؛ قدرت عادت : چرا ما در زندگی و کار اینگونه عمل می‌کنیم؟ قدرت عادت: علت کارهای که در کسب‌وکار و زندگی انجام می‌دهیم؛ قدرت عادت: دلیل هر آن چه در زندگی و کسب و کار انجام می‌دهیم؛ قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می‌دهیم و چگونگی تغییر دادن آن‌ها؛ قدرت عادت: قدرت عادتهای اثرگذار در چرخه‌ی زندگی؛ ‬قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می دهیم، در زندگی و کسب و کار؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دهم ماه سپتامبر سال 2014 میلادیعنوان: قدرت عادت؛ نویسنده: چالز دوهینگ ؛ مترجم: پروین بیات؛ تهران: هورمزد، ‏‫1392؛ در 335 ص؛ شابک: 9786006958118؛ چاپ دوم 1393؛ چاپ چهارم تا هشتم 1393؛ 352 ص؛ چاپ دهم 1394؛ در 352 ص؛ چاپ چهاردهم 1396؛ چاپ پانزدهم و شانزدهم 1397؛عنوان: قدرت عادت: چرا کارهایی را در زندگی و کسب و کار انجام می‌دهیم؟ نویسنده: چارلز دوهیگ؛ مترجم: سکینه تقی زاده؛ اصفهان، گاهداد، 1394؛ در 340 ص؛ شابک: 9786009382125؛عنوان: نقش و قدرت عادت‌ها در زندگی؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجمها: ندا نایب‌پور، محمدرضا مینایی؛ اصفهان: آمیس، 1395؛ در 207 ص؛ شابک: 9786005419795؛ موضوع: جنبه های اجتماعی عادت از نویسندگان امریکایی - سده 21 م‬عنوان: نیروی عادت: علت آنچه در زندگی و کارمان انجام می‌دهیم چیست؟ نویسنده: چالرز دیوهیگ؛ مترجم: علی هداوند؛ تهران: پندار‌تابان‏‫، 1395؛ در 328 ص؛ شابک: 9786006895598؛ چاپ دوم 1396؛ چاپ سوم 1397؛ چاپ چهارم 1398؛عنوان: ‬قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می دهیم، در زندگی و کسب و کار؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجمها: مصطفی طرسکی، معصومه ثابت‌قدم؛ ویراستار: طاهره خیرآبادی؛ تهران: نوین توسعه‏‫، ‏‫‏‏‏‏1395؛ ‬327 ص؛ شابک: 9786008738091؛ چاپ دوم و سوم 1396؛ چاپ هفتم 1397؛عنوان: قدرت عادت : چرا ما در زندگی و کار اینگونه عمل می‌کنیم؟ نویسنده: چارلز دوهیگ ؛ مترجم: شهرزاد حکیم‌مختار؛ تهران: معیار اندیشه، ‏‫1398؛ در 288 ص؛ شابک: 9786005462746؛‬عنوان: قدرت عادت: دلیل هر آن چه در زندگی و کسب و کار انجام می‌دهیم؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجم: الهام شریف؛ تهران : نسل نواندیش‏‫‬، 1396؛ در 344 ص؛ شابک: 9789642369119؛ ‬عنوان: قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می‌دهیم و چگونگی تغییر دادن آن‌ها؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجم: اصغر اندرودی؛ کرج: در دانش بهمن‏‫٬ 1395؛ در 342 ص؛ شابک: 9789641741794؛ چاپ دوم 1396؛ چاپ سوم و چهارم 1397؛عنوان: قدرت عادت؛ نویسنده: چارلز دوهیگ؛ مترجم: فروزنده دولتیاری؛ تهران: چابک اندیش، ‏‫‏‏‏‏1397؛ در 352 ص؛ شابک: 9786005861259؛‬‬‬عنوان: قدرت عادت؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجم: طیبه شیخی؛ قم: دارالفنون بوریا، ‏‫1398؛ در 270 ص؛ شابک: 97862295661؛عنوان: قدرت عادت: علت کارهای که در کسب‌وکار و زندگی انجام می‌دهیم؛ نویسنده: چارلز دوهینگ ؛ مترجم: زهرا شاه‌قلعه؛ قم: آوای بیصدا، ‏‫1398؛ در 368 ص؛ شابک: 9786009926459؛عنوان: قدرت عادت: قدرت عادتهای اثرگذار در چرخه‌ی زندگی؛ نویسنده: کارلس (چارلز) دوهیگ ؛ مترجم: مرجان فرجی؛ تهران : رشد، ‏‫1398؛ در 440 ص؛ شابک: 9786003511248؛ کتاب قدرت عادت یکی از کتابهای موفق روانشناسی است که نخستین بار در سال 2013 میلادی توسط چارلز دوهینگ نوشته شد، و به سرعت جزو پرفروش‌ترین کتابهای نیویورک شد. «دوهینگ» در این کتاب بیان می‌کند، که این عادت‌های ما هستند، که زندگی ما را شکل می‌دهند، و قدرت عادت و تأثیر آن در زندگی انسان را توضیح می‌دهد. در ادامه این موضوع را بیان می‌کند، که اگر انسان بتواند عادت‌های خود را تغییر بدهد، می‌تواند رفتار و زندگانی خود را نیز تغییر دهد، و در نهایت نیز الگوهایی برای تغییر عادت‌ها ارائه می‌دهد. ا. شربیانی"
12,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4810137-arda,4,"Enjoyable. The book presents a framework of understanding how habits work, and serves as a guide to show how to change habits.  “Once you choose who you want to be, believe you want to change, and it becomes real.” “Visualize the kind of person you would like to become, focus on one habit you would potentially develop, and transform that into what would become natural; requiring no effort or thinking.” “To modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You must consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habit’s routines and find alternatives. You must know you have control, and be self conscious enough to use it.” And hence, the  power of habit. So far so good. At this point I’m thinking “which one, which one!” I have a big list of those things I’d be more than happy to trash, and a bigger list of habits I’d like to build. According to Duhigg, the habit loop is made up of: cue → routine → reward. 

Let’s assume  I have a habit of reviewing books on goodreads. This habit of reviewing would be a cue, which makes up the routine: logging into my account, adding books and reviewing them. Apparently, habits (cue and routine) often require a reward. What would my reward in this scenario possibly be? A like? A comment? I hardly get any of those. Perhaps the reward comes from the deeper  craving  I have to read more books. Craving apparently is what drives the habit loop. Hence: Cue → Routine → Reward. The driver is the craving. And the extra spices are belief, and will-power. (Self-discipline increases will-power.)The beauty of realizing this power is that “at first, the change comes with difficulty, then it is done more easily, then semi-mechanically or with hardly any consciousness.” Our actions are developed into habits when we stop thinking about them consciously. We just do them. Hence, we rebuild and transform them. Changing a keystone habit, like say, working out, can transform a person’s life, because with the habit of working out, one is going to simultaneously eat in a healthier way, possibly quit smoking, and live a better lifestyle which in turn could turn to a happier life.  EUREKA!  As based on the above, it would be fair to presume that due to my habit of writing reviews on goodreads, I will start to read more books, thanks to my craving, and this will in turn increase my reviews. I would have no idea what to do with those reviews, and so I might have a chance of reaching success and becoming famous by turning into a fraud replica of  Manny  who published a book about his reviews of books. And, to take it a little further, according to the habit loop, I may just as well meet the love of my life as a result of all this success, which would in turn stop me from eating so much ice cream.

On a serious note, Duhigg generously provides diverse examples to explain the habit loop. The examples range from personal experiences, such as depression/addiction (alcohol, gambling, overeating, etc) and memory-loss. And yet, some of the success stories got on my nerves at a certain point. I was a tad annoyed, early in the book, that he draws inspiration from the US Military and the ways through which habits are instilled in soldiers. Moreover, he includes a section on radio/music, concluding that the reason Outkast’s “Hey Ya” turned out to be such a hit despite the public’s initial disdain is because “the unfamiliar was made to seem familiar” through playing it with familiar songs. “If you dress a new something in an old habit,"" he explains, ""it is easier for the public to accept it.” (Which public?)He brings examples from sports games, shopping malls (like target) and coffee chains (like Starbucks) and others markets like Alcoa and Febreeze to display how the habit loop works. He mentions that ""companies predict and manipulate habits” and briefly remarks on how some customers do not like to be spied on for marketing purposes, yet it still seems as though Duhigg uses his examples as success stories. He does not seem to mind the data-mining and tracking of records or ethical standards so much, and focuses instead on how to make success out of this “secret”. [Speaking of which, did you know pregnant women are the biggest shoppers?] I was a little taken-aback by his corporate-success-mindedness and the ways in which he measures success. This would be a little too similar to the mind-set one finds in other self-help books, although I was hoping this one would be different. Unfortunately, most of these types of books seem to promote the sensation of becoming a driven, ambitious, goal-oriented, go-get-‘em tiger. I couldn’t help escape the idea that this man partly measures success by a person’s pay-check and exercise regimen.

That said, the book does have interesting viewpoints, particularly those related to how habits shape up societies. His take on habits within communities was eye-opening: He defines community as a giant collection of habits occurring among thousands of people that, depending on how they’re influenced, could result in violence or peace. He takes the example of Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott in Alabama in 1955, and states that it was not just an act of defiance that sparked the boycott, but that the successful boycott was also due to her varying and influential social circles. In this section, as in other sections, attention is given to the importance of social standing, which comes with obligations. Apparently, it is not just our friends who strengthen our social networks, but the friends of our friends [“weak ties”] too have a role in improving our chances for finding employment and improve our social standing. One of the integral points that will stand out for me from this book is that our actions are developed into habits when we stop thinking about them consciously. We just do them. Hence, we rebuild and transform them. Changing, or building, the most simple habit could have a direct impact on our mortal life. “However,"" Duhigg warns, ""there isn’t one formula. Individuals are different, habits are different, and cravings are different. What this book aspires to do is create a framework of understanding how a habit works, and serve as a guide to show how to change it.”"
13,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"This was an interesting collection of research about habits and routines. The book felt Gladwellian in that it combined a variety of case studies while arguing a central theme, just as Malcolm Gladwell tends to do in his books. I think my favorite sections were the ones on Starbucks' training programs, Procter & Gamble's attempts to market Febreze, the safety record at Alcoa, the applications of Hit Song Science, and the historic Montgomery bus boycott of 1955. The overall theme is about how habits shape our lives, and it is possible to change bad habits for positive routines. The trick is in identifying what is cueing you to the bad habit, to experiment with positive rewards, and then make a plan for how to adjust your routine. This material was also explored in Gretchen Rubin's charming book, Better Than Before, and I enjoyed revisiting the topic. Recommended for those interested in human behavior and popular psychology/sociology."

And, although he was talking more about religious rituals, I think they apply to most other kinds of rituals in our lives too. And, I think that if our everyday rituals include these 4 dimensions in the right proportions, they can allow us pay more attention to what we’re doing and give us the space to be more creative. Note that I'm not suggesting that rituals, in themselves, can make anyone more creative - rather that they enable some of the right conditions for creativity."

I finished a non-fiction book!So, I started this climbing excursion because I have bad habits. We all do most of the time. My bad habits are eating unhealthy food, drinking too much wine, not getting enough exercise or procrastinating at work. My hubby and I thought, let’s figure out WHY since we both have bad habits we want to stop. We started this buddy read in February. February?! And you're just finishing it? Now don’t let that sway you that it took over two months to finish this book. It’s not a bad read, I just took my time with it, it's non-fiction and of course, I read books in between. ;) hahahaSo, did it answer some of my questions? Will I put down the bag of Cheetos next time I drink too much wine?! Yeah, I think it did.The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business helped me understand that stopping a bad habit isn’t the easiest thing to do. Don't beat yourself up about it. They become routine, habitual and ingrained in your life. They are caused by stress, emotions and going back to creature comforts. The book addresses that one of the ways to break a bad habit is to replace it with a substitute. It’s one of the ways to make a lasting change.Technically, this book isn’t bad. The author jumps around a bit with stories, starting one narrative and then going to another. Depending on the subject matter, I was okay with this. When I was really into the subject matter, it annoyed the hell out of me.This book is also a good analysis about why people like what they do, buy from a certain store or buy merchandise. The businesses that are smart, they have tapped into the emotion of advertising and habits. This part of the book was fascinating and was interesting material to read. And it confirmed that a lot of our bad habits are subliminal because of ads, commercials and radio.Why 4 stars? I didn’t really need that much business data and could have used a bit more personal.We are creatures of habit and it’s really on to you and whether you can make the change or not. Belief plays a big role in our daily success. I hope that I can use some of the tips in this book to finally implement some changes."

If we are more aware of why and how habits are formed, then we'll be able to control them. That's exactly what ""The Power of Habit"" tries to accomplish!This well-researched book consults academic studies, interviews with many scientists and executives, and research conducted at various companies. I had heard some lessons from this book by watching a few YouTube videos, but reading it was such a fun experience!One of the most useful takeaways from this book is that habits are powerful but also delicate. They can be formed outside our consciousness or with our intention. They can form without our permission but can be reshaped by us. Old habits never disappear, but we can change them by altering the cues and rewards.The book is split into three parts. The first part focuses on the habits of individuals, second on habits of successful organizations, and third on habits of societies. It was interesting to read about the research and real-life examples of how habits work on three levels.This book isn't a detailed guide on how to form habits but focuses more on the research aspects and the nitty-gritty of habits, right from how to form them and factors that influence them. I highly enjoyed reading about the habits of organization and societies as it was something new to me. I learned some useful information on habits I'll summarize in another post!All in all, it's a book worth reading!INSTAGRAM"
18,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,3,"How do some of us wake up for 6 a.m. jogs every day? What leads people to develop gambling addictions? Why do people brush their teeth every day while never remembering to wear sunscreen? Charles Duhigg answers these questions and more in The Power of Habit, a well-researched book on what motivates us to make the decisions we do in everyday life and in business.Duhigg's background as a reporter shows in this book. He does a good job of stringing together a wide variety of topics to fit his thesis that revolves around habit, and for the most part he writes about the cue-routine-reward cycle. To illustrate how that pattern works and what we can do to change it, Duhigg explores ideas like smoking addiction, sleepwalking, Target tracking down pregnant women, and more. His writing shines when he compares the man who murdered his wife while asleep to the women who lost an enormous sum of money to compulsive gambling: I still find myself thinking about the neurological and moral implications of the distinction he presents.However, the writing in this book faltered at times. In certain sections Duhigg would break up anecdotes and combine them in odd, confusing ways. Sometimes he selected scenarios that did not align too well with his arguments, like his exploration of how ""Hey-Ya"" became popular. The book as a whole veered more toward reporting than research, so bear that in mind if you decide to pick it up.Overall, a decent read I wanted a little more from when I finished. Recommended to those who want to get their feet wet when it comes to habit formation or psychology that deals with motivation. I will end with a quote from The Power of Habit that stood out to me in a good way:That, in some ways, is the point of this book. Perhaps a sleepwalking murderer can plausibly argue that he wasn't aware of his habit, and so he doesn't bear responsibility for his crime. But almost all the other patterns that exist in most people's lives - how we eat and sleep and talk to our kids, how we unthinkingly spend our time, attention, and money - those are habits that we know exist. And once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom - and the responsibility - to remake them. Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work."
19,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,5,"The Power of Habit examines behaviors you may not even know you have and hands you the tools to make lasting change at home, at work and in your community... if you want it.""Each chapter revolves around a central argument: Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work."" prologue xviiFirst, author Charles Duhigg goes into what makes a habit at the biological level.""Habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often."" pgs 17-18Duhigg describes how the brain creates a ""habit loop"" through cues, routines and rewards. These three elements feed on themselves until an ingrained habit is made. And, once it is there, it takes very little to upkeep.That's good news and bad news, because it works the same way for healthy and unhealthy habits.""But the reason the discovery of the habit loop is so important is that it reveals a basic truth: When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making."" pg 20The ""golden rule"" for changing a habit, Duhigg says, is to keep the same cues and rewards, but change the routine that leads to them. It sounds simple, but everyone is different with different motivations. So, it takes a bit of self awareness to discover what those unique cues and rewards are for you. But, once you know your triggers and motivations, that's when the fun begins of crafting a new routine.I found this book to be absolutely fascinating. It's also making me question the habits I've picked up in my own life. Am I certain that they are ones I want to continue? I can think of a few that could use a bit of tweaking. And now I know how.""This is the real power of habit: the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be."" pg 271Let's cultivate the good ones then."
20,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"This book claims to explain how new science can help us stop bad habits. The advice on habit change ultimately comes down to the appendix with the author's personal anecdote about trying to lose weight. The conclusion is obvious and it's not science; it's just some dude's story. People looking for books on using increased awareness of thought loops to change habits would be better served reading something about cognitive therapy or meditation. 

 

Much of what he is talking about with automatic responses to external cues goes back to century-old findings about Pavlov's dogs, and one of the people interviewed even describes what they're doing as ""Pavlovian"" so that's not new. The actual new science is the fashionable brain biology stuff, which is still not very practical. It's like taking apart your GPS after a road trip to see if you had a good vacation. Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless NeuroscienceOne of the most basic concepts in science is to compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges, but the author mixes things up so much that it's like a fruit salad. Sleepwalking is a habit? Murder is a habit? Does ""habit"" mean anything??? Useful scientific advice on behavior change would tell us about controlled experiments of things that helped people. This book instead gives us lots of theories with a ""loop"" diagram that doesn't even make sense. According to the loop, you need an immediate reward to establish a long-term habit. But, for example, in the chapter about the Superbowl coach, nowhere is it explained what the immediate reward is for performing the correct behaviors thousands of times. Winning the game is the reward, but a losing team doesn't get that for years, if ever. "
21,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7236889-scott,4,"Duhigg's Power of Habit offered a staggering statistic about our lives: 40% of what we do is habitual. 40 percent! That means that a huge majority of what we do in our lives is practically unconscious and habitually helping us progress or digress. The major takeaways for me include two main insights. First, identifying your habit's cues and rewards gives one understanding of why we do what we do. For example, when analyzing my habit of running, there are specific cues and rewards that both initiate and reward my exercising. My cues revolve around clearing my head and feeling accomplishment. I run either in the morning (after I wake up) or after work (after a long day at school/work) to clear my head. Also, I desire to accomplish something everyday, and running fulfills that craving. If I run in the morning, then I feel that I've already accomplished something that day. The second takeaway from this book is the principle of small victories. When you have a series of small victories, then your days can't help but to be filled with successful habits. For example, I feel accomplishment with a morning run. After a great start to the day, other small victories come more easily. I'm more positive,I want to eat healthy, I have more patience, and I work more efficiently. It's just a balanced way to live life. Identifying Cues/Rewards and earning Small victories changes habits and subsequently 40% of your life. "

The author analyzes habits on different levels such as in individuals, organizations, businesses and societies. He uses real-life examples and historic events to describe behavioral habits. Since the book was not what I expected I started getting distracted 20% in but pulled through to the end. About half-way of listening to the audiobook I started to do the review of the book I was expecting but did not get. I apologize in advance for the rambling. I read this book looking for tips on improving my personal habits, mainly eat healthier & exercise more. These two are very common goals for a lot of people but even though I understand intellectually what needs to be done, the plan is hard to execute on a daily basis. Mainly, I lack motivation to exercise because...As I was reading the book I was looking for a structured plan about habit modification but it was mostly about understanding habits and willpower. However, I believe that just the fact that there is the intention of improving behavior sets the wheels in motion and makes it easier to start the process and continue it.At least I have a better idea of how to manage cravings and keep in track."
23,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44279821-joe-soltzberg,4,"A very good book about habit formation. My favorite parts were the various stories and anecdotes the author provided for each lesson about habits. The book is fairly cohesive and my only complaint is that the 'how to use this book' section at the end is a bit too simple and doesn't encompass the ideas in every chapter (such as incorporating keystone habits, etc.). Nonetheless, definitely worth a read. I didn't get this book to try and change any of my habits, but still learned a ton. Here's what you need to know:1. Habits are controlled in your brain by the basal ganglia and happen subconsciously.2. The habit loop has 3 components: the cue, the action, the reward.3. To change a habit, you cannot change the cue or the reward, just substitute a different action for that cue that produces a similar reward.4. Things we do out of habit we are better at and do more dutifully than those we must think about.5. To get people to use your product, establish a habit loop."

About once a year I try and reinvent myself, and it'll work for a few days and then fail. Still, I have done quite a bit of research into habits and how to change them, and I've collected a lot of tidbits of information that float around in my brain.This book doesn't really impart any new information. If you're like me, however, it will give you what you know in a different way. This is not a self-help book. It will not give you platitudes or a list of steps on how to change or any promises of any kind. It does deliver a fascinating narrative on how our brains process habits and give context to the million bits of advice that can be picked up anywhere. It helps you understand the mechanics of what's going on, through case studies and vignettes, and brings it all together into a cohesive whole.I loved this book. It is probably the first thing I've picked up that has made me take an honest, detailed look at my life and make a plan on how to change it. I have no idea if I'll succeed or fail, as I have so many times before, but this is the first time I feel like I have more behind me than just some dottering, inexact advice.On a technical level, this is a moderately good book. The author does tend to mix his stories, starting one narrative and then leaving it hanging while he starts another, only to come back and finish the first. I'm annoyed by this style of writing, but the bits were still engaging enough that I kept through it. Then again, I was emotionally invested after the first chapter, so those that are reading for curiosity's sake may be more annoyed by it. Honestly, though? That's the only complaint I have with this book. It's a fast, entertaining, and fascinating read."
28,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,3,"Charles Duhigg has three fascinating half-books here. They’re all joined by the theme of habits. He speaks of habits from a personal perspective. Then he talks about business habits, switching from cognitive psychology to organizational psychology. And finally, he talks about sociology. What unifying pattern do these three have? That same old model I learned back in college in 1991… The idea of cues, actions, and rewards is throughout this book. It’s not very new nor very strong; in fact, Duhigg mentions that Claude Hopkins in his My Life in Advertising book first discussed this old, flimsy dusty model in 1927. So why does this book get 3 stars? Because Duhigg does find several fascinating stories about each section. He uses examples from AA attendees to overeaters to Target figuring out which person is pregnant and sending out the right kind of advertising without offending the person. This is some cool stuff, great fodder for cocktail conversations – scary in sort of a Big Brother way. (“We do not control ourselves!”)Duhigg could’ve made this book better, though. He says there isn’t enough research to say why some habits prevail and others are changeable. Why write a book then? Is this only a compendium of the most recent research? If it is, it misses some significant stuff. There are plenty of other sources he could’ve used as possible models. Malcolm Gladwell talks about how sociological influences because ubiquitous - social habit - in The Tipping Point (2000). Chip and Dan Heath talk about how to change when change is difficult in Switch (2007). I can also think of several other authors who’ve given more succinct processes to take the models and attempt to make them more useable. Duhigg seemed too scared to commit to some possibilities, some clear ways to influence the change of habit. He skirts it, and then he excuses himself, saying that habits are too multifaceted to offer possible models in detail.So his models are vague or old. He also doesn’t credit or discredit Gladwell or the Heaths or others who have had recent bestsellers talking about the same ideas. Then he writes three half-books that are barely bridged to each other. Still, his examples are good, and his style is infinitely readable. I would’ve liked to have him commit to some postulation that is more recent than Hopkins’ 1927 model. I also wish his bridge between the personal, organizational, and social was stronger."

31,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110812-kinga,4,"As far as self-help books go, this was surprisingly helpful and insightful. I read it in January, as you should, so perhaps this is why I’m still sticking to my NY resolutions. It inspired me to observe myself carefully and notice some of the things I do without realising. We learn that 40% of what we do every day follows established habitual patterns, which is a good thing because we can retrain ourselves to follow different patterns and make changes in our lives that don’t feel like they need insane amounts of self-discipline. On the other hand, this revelation made feel a little like I’m just a sophisticated automaton.My praise for this book isn’t unqualified. It does of course simplify things like most pop-psychology books do. While the concept of a habit loop – cue, routine, reward is a very useful way of thinking of our habits, it does gloss over a multitude of nuances that surround everything that we do as individuals, and as a society. I found that to be the case especially when the author gave examples of ‘keystone habits’ that cause domino effect – some of them just seemed far-fetched and could very well be the case of correlation, rather than causation. It was all just a little too neat at places. Of course Duhigg had to boil down an extensive area of study into easily digested soundbytes, which I am now boiling down further for the purposes of this review, so how am I to judge?This book was also full of repetitions, but one could argue that it just practices what it preaches. Only through repetitions we can retrain ourselves. Additionally, I listened to this on audiobook and I often zone out when listening to audiobooks, so the repetitions were most welcome. All in all, the ultimate message of this book is that of optimism. Even if you tried changing many times before and failed, the lasting success is still within your reach. I did cringe at some of the corporate case studies, especially the Starbucks puff piece. Seriously, if I read one more piece about how amazing Starbucks is to its baristas, I will conclude that their employees should actually be paying Starbucks for the privilege of working there. However, I did like the Febreze story because it’s just so ironic. They had a product which was great – it actually eliminated odours but they couldn’t sell it because smelly people with smelly houses generally didn’t realise they were smelly. So ironically, they had to invent a previously non-existent need for non-smelly people to use it. You gotta love capitalism. Also, I found the story behind Hey Ya! by Outkast fascinating. I hated that song and couldn’t understand why I was being hounded by it so relentlessly. I am happy to report that I still don’t like it, so whatever nonsense the record label tried to get me to like it, failed. And now, I decided, no company will ever trick me again! (ha, lol)."
32,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4442364-franz,5,"If you are looking for a how-to book, in the strict sense this isn't it. But if you want to change your habits you can glean how to do so from the main text, and Duhigg provides specific hints in an appendix. Duhigg does tell us how habits form without our awareness (every habit follows the pattern of cue-response-reward loops with cravings--expectations of the reward--thrown into the mix) and why they form (the brain's method of saving effort by turning any routine into an unthought habit) and where in the brain (the basal ganglia) they are stored. Simply put, changing habits begins with recognizing the pattern of a particular loop and then changing the response to the cue.In this well-researched and well-written book Duhigg talks to scientists about how rats memorize a maze. He describes how a man with extensive brain damage but whose basal ganglia is intact can still form new habits without recalling anything he does. He shows how real people with bad habits such as alcoholism can overcome them by changing the cue-response-reward loop; this is essentially how Alcoholics Anonymous works. Therapists train elderly patients to exercise after hip surgeries by manipulating the loop in such a way that the patients persist in exercising despite the pain instead of giving, greatly improving the quality of their lives. Duhigg describes Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps habitual routines that enabled him to win a race at the Chinese Olympics with his goggles filled with water, swimming virtually blind. He also explains how a social movement such as the civil rights movement depends on the same cue-response-reward loop.Corporation such as Target and the gambling industry exploit the loop to bring customers through the door and spend money without realizing that they are being manipulated.Fascinating and fun to read. The only caveat is that in the last chapter when Duhigg discusses the implications of habits on the issue of free will. There he too quickly judges that that we cannot be absolved from bad behavior due to irresistible habits in some cases while we are absolved of responsibility for our behavior in others. He may be right, but I wasn't convinced. "
33,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,3,"ReviewThe “Power of Habit” is a frustrating book to review. At its core, it presents ideas that are both interesting and practical: this book will - or at least might – change the way you think about, form, and conquer habits. At the same time, it’s flooded with same fuzzy and irrelevant “case studies” that pollute your average pop psychology book. The first part of this book nicely summarizes recent findings in the field of psychology concerning habits – how they form, how they function, and how they can – or can’t - be changed. This part of the book is, for the most part, rich in content and worthwhile. Duhigg summarizes legitimate findings, and there's more or less no bullshit.If only that could be said about the second part of the book, where fluff is piled high and irrelevance abounds. “The Power of Habit” is a prime example of an unfortunate recent trend in pop psych literature, where the author brings in “case studies” from business, history, and personal life to try and engage the reader and ostensibly make for more ‘interesting’ reading. Bullshit, I say: don’t waste my time.Duhigg’s “sample size of one” anecdotes are unconvincing and unnecessary. A CEO creates a “habit” of worker safety and increases revenue by X percent. So? How do we know there isn’t a CEO next door who tried to create similar habits, thereby driving his company into the ground? And what evidence is there that the proposed habit played any causal role whatsoever in our company’s eventual success, in light of the multitude of other changes that undoubtedly occurred at the same time? Correlation isn’t causation, Duhigg, and appealing to the evidence provided by a sample size of one, where the sample is obtained after the fact, no less (selection bias, anyone?), is dumb.To summarize: the first part of this book was fascinating – even if not exactly concise – and gets a solid 4 starts. The second part, on the other hand, is irrelevant and entirely unnecessary, and deserves no more than 2 stars. Thus, I’ll grudgingly average out my impression and give “The Power of Habit” a weak 3 stars. Maybe I’ve just read one too many pop psychology books. You might very well enjoy Duhigg’s long, detailed, and humanized case studies, but I came here to learn, and as far as content is concerned, “The Power of Habit” is a light contender indeed. SummaryDuhigg’s thesis is that habits function in a self-reinforcing, circular manner. He calls this cycle “the habit loop”: first, there’s a cue that tells your brain to go into “habit mode”; then, there’s a routine, which can by physical, mental, or emotional; and finally, there’s a reward , which tells your brain this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.The Role of CravingDuhigg explains that craving plays a central role in the habit loop. In essence, the brain responds to a cue by creating a craving for the expected reward, which prompts you to begin the intermediate routine. In one study, researchers sat a monkey in front of a monitor and taught it to pull a lever whenever a certain symbol flashed on a screen. If the monkey pulled the lever at the appropriate time, it was rewarded with a shot of blackberry juice from a nearby tube. The researchers monitored the monkey’s brain patterns throughout the experiment.At first, brain activity spiked in response to the reward: the monkey saw the symbol, pulled the lever, got the juice, and – wham! The brain monitor registered a rush of endorphins. Also, at this stage, if the researchers opened the door to the experimental room, the monkey decided it had had enough and immediately left to play.Soon, the action became a habit, and the researchers started to notice something interesting. While the actions of the monkey didn’t change, its brain activity did: as soon as the monkey saw the symbol – wham! The brain monitor registered a rush of endorphins. Only then would the monkey pull the lever and get the juice. In other words, the flashing shapes became a cue to pull the level, and this cue created a powerful craving for the presumed reward.And when the reward didn’t come –when the researchers withheld the blackberry juice or watered it down – the monkey became increasingly agitated and “frustration erupted inside its skull.” At this point, if the researchers opened the door from the room, the money no longer ran out to play. It stayed, glued to the monitor, waiting for its next hit of blackberry juice. Duhigg explains that this is why habits are so powerful: “they create neurological cravings.”Overcoming Existing HabitsFirst off, Duhigg explains that it’s incredibly difficult to overcome a habit – for all intents and purposes, we’ll call it impossible. Instead of trying to get ‘rid’ of a habit, aim to alter it slightly. Keep the old cue and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. Of course, to do this, you first need to identify the cue and isolate the reward.First, find out what cues the craving. Why do you habitually eat cookies at work? Does it happen when you’re bored? Does it occur at a certain time of day? This process of discovery is sometimes called “awareness training,” and it’s is the first step towards habit change.Once you’ve discovered the cue, isolate the reward. This can be tricky. For instance, in our cookie example, it might seem that the cookie itself is the reward. Duhigg disagrees: the cookie is the routine. The reward is the reason you eat the cookie. Perhaps you’re bored at work, and the cookie gives you something to do, as well as a pleasant energy boost; or maybe the cookie is a routine that allows you to socialize with your coworkers in the cafeteria; or maybe you’re just hungry. In any event, try to figure out why you eat the cookie.Once you’ve exposed the habit loop, insert a new routine. Do you eat the cookie out of boredom? Go on a walk instead. Do you really just want to socialize? Walk over to a co-workers desk instead. Are you just hungry? Grab an apple, then. The point is, cues don’t disappear, and cravings won’t just go away. “Habits are most malleable when the golden rule of habit change is applied: if we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted.” Creating New HabitsFinally, how does one go about creating new, “good” habit? This time, we need to create a habit loop. To form a new habit, you have to first find a simple and obvious cue. Then, make to clearly define a definite reward. Finally, insert the desired routine. Before long, your brain will be ‘trained to crave’. For instance, studies show that people are “more likely to stick to a new workout plan if they choose a specific cue, such as running as soon as they get home from work, and a clear reward, such as a beer, or an evening of guilt-free television.”It also helps to envision and focus on your reward: the ""most successful dieters... envisioned a specific reward for sticking with their diet - a bikini they wanted to wear or the sense of pride they felt when they stepped on the scale - something they chose carefully and really wanted. They focused on the craving for that reward when temptations arose, cultivated the craving into a mild obsession. And their cravings for that reward.. crowded out the temptation.""Finally, examples of using rewards being to foster the formation of habits abound in the world of advertising. For instance, modern toothpaste includes mint oils that induce a cool, tingling sensation in your mouth, which you soon start to crave (try brushing your teeth with Toms ‘natural’ toothpaste, which doesn’t include the oils. It's... unsatisfying). Similarly, shampoo doesn’t have to foam, but the makers explicitly add foaming chemicals as a reward. Says one executive: “once the customer starts expecting the foam, the habit starts growing.”Forming “good” habits is hard, and altering existing “bad” ones is even harder. It's all easier said then done. But now you know – and in the words of the immortal G.I. Joes – knowing is half the battle."

It would be easy to think you’d found a self-help book. Okay, maybe it could help a reader break an unwanted habit. Duhigg does try to analyze those behaviors. There are a few good stories of people who quit smoking or started exercising. But it is more accurately about patterns of behavior in groups as well as individuals: in corporations, the military, and the marketplace. I had never thought of corporations instilling habits, but we hear all the time about corporate culture, and that is an amalgam of habitual behaviors. This book is broadly organized around the concept of habits (with a number of fun stories) and around the endlessly entertaining custom (habit?) of observing human nature.Duhigg told the following story, which he claims hooked him on the subject of habits. An army officer in Iraq observed that violence in the small town where he was stationed occurred in a particular plaza. People gathered, food vendors arrived, then someone would throw a rock or bottle. He asked the town’s mayor one evening to keep the food vendors away. The crowd showed up, got restless and hungry, and eventually left – defused – because the street vendors were absent. Duhigg, then a reporter in Baghdad, asked the officer how he had analyzed this situation. The US military, the officer said, is an experiment in habit formation. “Understanding habits is the most important thing I’ve learned in the army.” This story did not initially meet my usual understanding of what constitutes a habit. But the habit of a kebab dinner supported the assembling of a large and restless crowd. At least for the duration of this book, I broadened my definition of a habit.But in case you really crave the self-help part of this book, here is Duhigg’s description of personal habit formation: A cue triggers a routine, which is the behavior you may want to change. There’s a reward inherent in that routine. Figure out what reward you really want, then change the routine to get it. The cue (an emotion, a time of day) will still be present, but you’ll respond with a different routine.Corporations make appearances in a couple of ways. The story of Paul O’Neill at Alcoa is one in which he sought to transform a poorly performing company by instilling a culture of safety. Employees were led to respond to dangerous situations with ingrained safety procedures. In other words, they learned new habits of response. Altering one important habit of all employees, in a highly disciplined manner, changed the culture of the corporation.But corporations also want to know about customer habits. If you shop at Target, consider yourself warned. The store knows more about you than you can possibly imagine. Uncomfortable territory. Your habits are known!"
35,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol,3,"A new year always seems like a good time to think about the things we'd like to change about ourselves. Just how we're going to do this is not always clear. My goal at the beginning of 2014 was to change some eating habits that were once again getting away from me. After listening to Michael Kindness interview with Charles Duhigg on Books On The Nightstand I decided it might just be the right time to pick this up.In the beginning pages Duhigg explains just what habit is. ""Scientists say they emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left it its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a have, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often.""The author admits right up front that there is no manual for all and that it isn't always easy to change a habit. Duhigg does not at anytime condone breaking a bad habit, he suggests that habits can be reshaped. If you take a simple message from this book it is that a habit is ""a loop that consists of three parts: a cue, a routine and a reward"". Duhigg maintains the reformation of the habit requires you to change the routine. Routines that feel good are hard to change. ""Tomorrow, you'' muster the willpower to resist. Tomorrow will be different. But tomorrow the habit takes hold again."" You need to examine this habit loop and the behavior you want to change. The subtitle of The Power of Habit"" Why we do what we do in Life and Business alludes to this being not only a personal look at habit but how habit can be changed in business. Much of the book deals with this aspect but the principles explained can easily be applied to changing habits in everyday life. If the business model of habit or the habits of societies do not interest you, this may not be the right book but if you can see how the mindset is changed, I think you'll find value here.Did I reform my eating habits? Not quite but I am at least empowered to examine them and have done some tweaking of routine and will seek new rewards. It can't hurt to have more understanding in a look at oneself. "
36,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,2,"Charles Duhigg's premise is that habits are formed when behaviors are rewarded. Because the brain is wired to anticipate a reward it directs behavior towards getting the reward. The author presents some studies that show brain activity in the anticipation and reward cycles. He poses a ""golden Rule"" of habit change which is to identify the cue that anticipates the reward and find an alternative route to that reward. He cites AA, group/team and religious experiences to show that for habits to stick, belief is needed.After describing the thesis the author elaborates on it drawing rather narrow conclusions from research and case studies.Habit is the only explanation given for a study showing the later success of young kids who could wait for two cookies rather than eat one right away. It would seem that perception of time or visions of the future should be factors. Regarding the ""cookie"" and ""radish"" groups in another experiment, can habit really developed in such a short period of time, or was the result about cynicism or a merely an energy rush from sugar? ... and so it goes.While breaking habits is undoubtedly part of change, Duhigg sees his theory everywhere. He writes as though breaking habits is the only cause of complex organizational change at Alcoa. He attributes marketing success (Pepsodent, Target and creating hit records) to catering to habits, sports victories (the Buccaneers) to ignoring plays and building physical habits and the civil rights movement (the Selma bus boycott) to the habits of association. Each of these cases is comprised of many factors and teasing out the influence of habit would be a difficult to impossible task.Other sections cover memory loss, gambling habits, the Saddleback Church. While the descriptive writing easy to read, each has many issues embedded besides ""habit"".The value of the book is in the first part where the thesis is described and in the Appendix where how to use the thesis is clearly written."
37,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,3,"I first heard about this book during a Ted Talk or some other podcast and was immediately interested.The book is split in 3 sections. Personal habits, corporate habits and societal habits.Everything was presented in easy to digest segments, anecdotes and examples but I have to say after the first few times showing the “habit loop” to readers it started grating on my nerves. Yes, I got ittttt the first 10 times no need to bash me over the head with the slightly amateurish graphics.The chapters I found most interesting focused on corporate habits or changes in how they do business. Examples included Target’s algorithms to predict what people want before they even know they want it. The Starbucks turnaround and how song hits are predicted and presented by DJ’s.I also found the chapter on court cases involving compulsive gambling and murders under the influence of sleep walking interesting. And of course the section on Rosa Parks and why her act of defiance was the tipping point in civil rights in 1955.So overall this was a fairly interesting in-between read when you only have a few minutes here and there."
38,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9653496-hanne,3,"This is a well researched, well written book about habits and the psychology behind it. And yet, it was far from a home run. What I want most of all from reading non-fiction popular psychology books is for them to have an impact on me. The very basic requirement is to learn something new, but I also want them to make me think about my actions and behaviours and those from people around me, and preferably also to have a changing impact on me, which can be small or large, but has to be meaningful in some ways.This book achieved the interesting learning part, perhaps a bit of understanding behaviours, but definitely not the third. He does attempt to explain how to change behaviours and some people might find it useful. But I wanted more.The scope of the book is good though, starting from individual habits, how companies can change your habits, to organizational and cultural habits. Maybe because of this larger scope, it became more a show-and-tell about how others have done it, but it doesn’t really give you the ammunition to do it yourself. "

Mungkin hal ini akan berbeda-beda untuk tiap orang tapi buku ini mengajarkan saya untuk lebih banyak menganalisis diri saya sendiri, bahkan diakhir buku penulis menyimpulkan kembali dan memberikan langkah-langkah yang jelas.  “to change a habit you must keep the old cue and deliver the old reward but insert the new reward”Bagian kedua buku akan lebih membahas pengaruh habit dalam lingkungan yang lebih besar, Paul O’Neill melakukannya dalam bidang industri aluminium hanya dengan mengubah habit dari hal yang mendasar yaitu masalah safety, Rhode Island Hospital memelihara habit dimana dokter dan perawat yang tidak akur pada akhirnya membawa dampak mengerikan: Salah bor, ya sang Dokter melubangi kepala pasien disisi yang salah jadi sisi dimana penyakitnya berada harus dilubangi lagi -___-Bagian ketiga buku lebih membahas Habit dalam lingkup sosial, bagaimana Marthen Luther King Jr. memperoleh kebebasan masyarakat kulit hitam, juga bagaimana Rick Warren membangun anggota gerejanya. Hal lain yang juga menarik yaitu kasus seorang ibu (Angie Bachman) yang bangkrut dan terlilit utang karena gila judi dinyatakan bersalah di pengadilan sementara seorang suami (Thomas) yang membunuh istrinya saat sleepwalking dinyatakan tidak bersalah, padahal keduanya memiliki kesamaan yaitu mereka tidak bisa mengendalikan habit buruk mereka.Simple:Kata-kata yang digunakan mudah dimengerti. Penulis meyakinkan kita pada hal yang ia tulis dengan menceritakan kisah tokoh disertai dengan penelitian yang dilakukan yang secara mengejutkan tidak berat. Jika punya uang lebih sebaiknya baca yang versi asli. Berguna:Saya terprovokasi untuk mencoba menerapkan pada proyek Bad Habit saya, beberapa diantaranya:1. Tidak fokus, hal ini sering terjadi pada saya jika ada hal yang lebih menarik buat saya maka saya seakan lupa pelajaran dan kuliah saya. 2. Menghabiskan waktu dengan TV series (Suits, Scream Queen, Bones, Sleepy Hollow, fargo) wah rasanya liburan saya sangat tidak produktif wkwk3. melewatkan Sarapan Pagi, hmm sepertinya sarapan itu penting..Buku ini saya rekomendasikan buat teman teman yang punya kebiasaan-kebiasaan buruk atau ingin menerapkan kebiasaan-kebiasaan yang baik. “Changing Some Habit can be more difficult. Sometimes Change takes a long time. Sometimes it requires repeated experiments and failures. But once you understand how a habit operates- once you diagnose the cue, the routine ant the reward – you gain power over it” – Charles Duhigg. "

Of course there are lot many great books on human psychology of habits but this one states it in simple words through various case studies and proven experiments. I particularly liked Walmart and data scientist, the odor free solution of P&G case study, the case of compulsive gambler and of sentries at Iraq, and Starbucks to name a few. (Did I just cover a half book in them? Lol) But it's wonderful read. Besides it has take away lessons you can apply directly. Ever since I read that a trivial routine change like making your bed can be pivotal I keep things changing and it works every time! Finding the cues and changing the routine to get rewarded - a single topic has been experimented in worldwide renowned labs depicts the importance of issue (if you thinking it's not worthy to read about it.) 5 stars for this one. 5th star for covering the complex topic in simple words so it'd not stuck to few brilliant minds but penetrate to the masses n convey the message.

Charles Duhigg's Power of Habit is a must read for those who have either tried to cultivate good habits or transform organisations or puzzled over inexplicable happenings in the newspaper. I am an inside out person and I was able to apply most of what I was reading to my day to day life and what I see in the organizations that I work with. It even explained to me some of the puzzling outcomes such as the Marina protest for Jallikattu or why Harris Jayaraj songs are more catchy than AR Rahman's. Narrated only in anecdotes and case-lets, the book is a surprisingly easy read. Starting with the basic Habit loop, the books goes onto explore keystone habits, organizational transformation, social movements, the power of crises, gambling and the other side of habits. After all the fun stuff is a handbook on how to use the learning from the book.On introspection, there were so many reflections from your day to day life, that it seized to be a simple book. I personally loved the chapters on P&G Febreze case, the Alcoa transformation, Radio station habit manipulation, Starbucks customer service and the African American movement in America. If you notice a wide variety of things in the book, they are brought together almost seamlessly that your learning happens before you realize it.A definite recommended read in non-fiction, if ever there was one!

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE EVIDENCE BASED FACTS, but I expected MORE facts and science, answers to the why not examples to the what. • ... that being said, I enjoyed most of the examples and they did add a lot to my knowledge • random but I wish more chapters were like chapter 9 (more of neuro and facts) • the appendix is an overly simplified, repeated summary"

I’ve been avoiding self-help books for some time, probably because I’m at a point where I find them annoying and a bit boring. I’d rather escape into some good fiction any day! I thought that this book would be yet another self-help book and so I’d been reluctant to read it for a while. I was wrong. It’s not a self-help book and it doesn’t tell you how to change your habits. In other words, it lacks solid advice. Rather, it presents real stories and anecdotes of how others have changed their habits. The overall approach of this book is one of: “Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work."" If you’re looking for some informative and intelligent non-fiction to read, I recommend this.Some interesting quotes: “How do habits change? There is, unfortunately, no specific set of steps guaranteed to work for every person. We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced.” ""Willpower isn't just a skill. It's a muscle, like the muscle in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there's less power left over for other things."""

So unless you deliberately fight a habit, unless you find new routines the pattern will unfold automatically.While reading this book, I was socked realizing how many times I acted just by habit. Times when I didn’t think at all, just did what habit part of my brain told me to. This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future: THE HABIT LOOPThis book talks about habits and the psychology behind them.It’s well written and well researched; however I didn’t exactly liked full detailed case studies. It’s like the author thinks you don’t really understood what he said in early chapters and wants to explain it again and again in different case studies."

Duhigg discusses the science of habits and provides excellent anecdotes to support his theories. The chapters cover various topics, all seen through the prism of people's habits: exercise and diet, Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, shoppers at Target, the birth of the civil rights movement, and more. I'm a big fan of Malcolm Gladwell and there are parts of this book that read like something from him. Like Gladwell, Duhigg takes the science and applies it to areas that might not be typically associated with such (for example, the civil rights movement). Most importantly, he makes it easy for the layperson to understand. "

Or perhaps it was the cigarette. Or the drink.Habit.Did you know that the genius behind the methods of Tom Dungy–the only coach in the NFL history to reach the play-offs ten years in a row and the one who turned a troubled Colts team around and three years later took them to win the Super Bowl in 2007–was to teach his players to be faster than everyone else. But they wouldn’t be faster because they would focus on increasing their physical speed. They would be faster because they would learn habits that would make their moves instinct. When his strategy worked, Dungy’s players could move with a speed that was impossible to overcome.According to some research, more than 40% of the actions we perform each day are not actual decisions, but habits. And habits that we didn’t always consciously choose to start. We have sleeping habits, shopping habits, exercise habits, eating habits. Habits at work, at home, at school. Habits of the mind.Companies have a huge interest in changing our shopping habits. Coaches have an interest in changing the habits we use when we play. Teachers have an interest in the habits of their classroom. Families and communities have habitual ways of interacting. We all have personal habits we’d like to adopt and others we’d like to give away. But unless you know what you’re doing, habits can be extremely intransigent and slippery things.The good news is that a lot of research has been done in the last few decades, and we now know how habits work. When we arm ourselves with this knowledge, we’ll have a much better chance of changing. Luckily for us, we don’t have to track all that information down. In The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do In Life and Business, Charles Duhigg draws on hundreds of academic studies, interviews with more than three hundred scientists and executives, and research conducted at dozens of companies in his book and distills all this knowledge to its essence.The title might sound boring, but Duhigg follows the style of Malcom Gladwell (Outliers, Blink, The Tipping Point), and the Heath brothers (Made to Stick), and has written a book that I couldn’t put down. For example, I couldn’t stop reading about coach Tom Dungy, or Target as it predicts who is pregnant and how far along they are, or the scientists who couldn’t figure out why Alcoholics Anonymous works, or how bad organizational habits led to thirty-one people being burned alive in London’s King’s Cross subway stop. I couldn’t stop reading about why Rosa Parks, not the first African American to refuse to give up her bus seat, could pivot the civil rights movement. I couldn’t stop reading the stories of individuals losing bad habits, others picking up good ones, and others who lost their minds but not their habits. Duhigg uses these and many other examples and studies to illustrate the key principles underlying how habits work. In the appendix, he gives us a guide for examining and forming our own habits.I personally know the power of changing habits of the mind (which I’ve already written about). And teeth. A few years ago, I flossed once a week. It was such a pain. Now it’s a habit that I almost crave each night. I look back at how I made those changes and see it all laid out in Duhigg’s book. Can I actually change my habit of going to bed late? Stay tuned.If you’re interested in forming the habits of a class, team, company, or family; if you want to change some of your own habits; if you’re interested in knowing why we do what we do and enjoy the style of Malcom Gladwell and Dan and Chip Heath, then I think you’ll love this book.

This is the central theme of this book and this book goes in great detail about what are habits, scientifically, physiologically and how we can make Habit has the central focus of the activities around us, the events that we subject ourself to and the way we respond to every day seemingly insignificant events. This is a great book to understand human factors and mechanisms of our behavior, our friends behavior and behavior of people we see around us. This book is full of interesting anecdotes from different fields ranging from medicine, fields like mental health, hospital's organizational behaviors to the behavior of large organizations like Starbucks and Target. The book goes de-route into some recent advances in data-science as how organizations collect data to predict the ""Habits"" of it's customers and once it understand's the Habits, they know that they are not dealing with the rational self-controlled individual, but with more primitive part of the brain so they can easily have their way with them. There is a whole organization effort put into this and huge lot of science and tools built on top of this theory, namely to make customers purchase the product even when they dont need it, but their habit will make them buy it. Organizations are earning scores of the profit in this way.There is also good analysis of how leaders operate in mobilizing the masses, They give them a habit and people see the reward in following that habit. The reward in these cases are non materialist, but they equally valuable. Great leaders like Martin Luther King, gave his folks a sense of identity and community, encouraged the Habit of refusing to board the bus when there was in-equality. I can say the same for Mahatma Gandhi, who encouraged Indians to spin wheel to make their own clothes to ""obtain freedom"", his idea was this habit will make Indians disciplined and give them a concept of self identify. Both these strategies worked out and this book says that there science behind those plans that is basis of huge organizational change.Author presents with numerous case studies of people and their behaviors to elucidate the concept of habits and try to convince to you look actions and behavior in this angle. And if you want to change a particular habit, which I believe many are interested in, he gives definite direction as how one should approach. Simply stated, it involves identifying the cue or carving that is responsible for the habit and identifying the reward, and experimenting with different rewards when you want to change and the working on the change the habit loop and having plan for the cue. Don't get misled that now you know this idea, you can skip this book. This book will drill down into your head this formula and you will imbibe some ideas suitable for yourself as you read this book. Plus it is extremely entertaining to know how we have been led by some parts of our brain to do many of our actions. It is presented very well as illustrates with an example of himself changing a habit, eating a cookie in the afternoon, following those simple rules. Great read. Why 4 stars out of 5. I felt the sometimes the book deviated a bit too much into business and interesting data-science things and presented them in more detail, which of course holds on to the reader for entertainment than focusing on the topic in every page."

Fortunately, my concerns vanished away with the very first pages.This book guided me to understand thoroughly the meaning of a habit cycle, and instead of asking to break it, Charles Duhigg pointed out how to modify it into my benefit, aided with many studies and historic examples of real people who applied the change. Not only it focuses on habits from a personal view, but also it illustrates how big companies and influencers used the power of habit to their profit, how it affects society, and, last but not least, the neurology behind it. Ending with a reader’s guide to use the ideas by providing a frame work of steps towards habits modification. I immensely enjoyed reading this book for what I gained from it regarding habits and another aspects of our daily lives. "
55,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1280565-rob,3,"It's a fascinating read, combining some very accessible medical science with insights into human behaviour. Duhigg's an entertaining writer as well as an extensively-researched one; he uses suspense to superb effect at several points, and his revelations on the predictive power of Big Data in identifying our habits are startling. The first half and concluding sections are especially compelling, particularly with his recipe for changing old habits into new ones.I'm less convinced by his look at organizations and societies. It's always dangerous to argue from analogy, and by considering such forces as racism and organizational culture as habits, he downplays important factors — for example, the vested interest that some people have in maintaining the status quo, and their active efforts to thwart change. That doesn't mean the insights he offers aren't useful, especially when they target individual behaviour, but there comes a point where you wonder if there's any organizational behaviour pattern that Duhigg wouldn't consider to be a habit. (I started to hear his voice in my head saying that gravity is one of matter's habits.)Maybe the best measure of its immediate impact is how many of my own habits I'm suddenly identifying - which is lots. As for the longer-run impact, lets see how many of them I end up changing."

This book is incredible. It changed my view on how propensities formed my life. It is in not a manual or far reaching study, still it is very well investigated and tastefully composed.""The Power of Habit"" showed me an incredible reality about myself and other individuals. It clarifies why propensities are difficult to change; how to transform them; and why it can be anything but difficult to slip again into negative behavior patterns. It clarifies why it might take numerous actions to change a propensity. This book as helps anybody to figure out how to help others with and comprehend their own propensities. It utilizes anecdotes of individuals to help arrive point over. No big surprise it was a success on Amazon.com  http://amzn.to/2GY61b1  and will enable anybody to distinguish how their propensities are made. Essentially, you search for the prompts/triggers that are opening the normal/propensity that you are not content with and can't appear to stop. Once you figure out what is the reward you are getting you modify your craving for that reward. Is it true that you are eating the treat due to low glucose or claiming you are anxious, and it quiets you, and so on? While pouring through this book I got the chance to know the propensity circle and how to not really stop a propensity but rather to change it and to enable the person to have control, nixing the propensities power over me supplanting it with a new, healthier one. The stories in this book are wonderful and educate not just about propensities but additionaly a wide range of subjects of life. The best part about this book, it never went into some irrational tangent where you couldn’t comprehend what it was stating. Nonetheless, finding the triggers and rewards requires some serious energy and thoughtfulness - all dependent upon you. The book can't help you there. If you are looking for more “active” material, reads that give actual how-to steps here are some other reads that are in the same genre and which might be more beneficial to the reader depending upon your objectives:•	 “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life”  http://amzn.to/2Bgn9IU This book is a consistent bestseller on Amazon.com which makes it acceptable to change the “habit” of giving into other’s complaints, to treat demands for what they are. . . other peoples’ problems. •	 “The 2 Week Diet”  https://tinyurl.com/y8tva8xy A great program designed to re-design your eating habits for better health•	 “Old School New Body”  https://tinyurl.com/y8rcefrg This is a way to change the habits of poor health to those that lead to a better physique. •	 “The Big Diabetes Lie”  https://tinyurl.com/y794lh3q Have your habits lead you to be a diabetic, or pre-diabetic? Mine had, that is why I benefitted from this book and now no longer am a diabetic. I highly recommend this habit changing program. In any case, per the book, once you do identify triggers, you change the normal/propensity by power of will each time you experience the signal/trigger, ensuring that the reward is the same. Along these lines, rather than eating sweets, you simply run talk with companions intentionally, or whatever. I got this book supposing it was a self-improvement write for those needing to get out from under negative behavior patterns however that was not the situation; This book really clarifies the mechanics of how propensities are made and why they are so imbued into our frameworks. For instance, a man who lost all working memory in a mischance still held his propensity for taking strolls in his neighborhood. It expressly demonstrates how propensities are framed at a more fundamental and primal zone of our cerebrum which makes it so hard to change. Troublesome, yet not feasible.  “The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business”  http://amzn.to/2GY61b1  isn't a program that is laid out or unmistakable advances that one must take, however it gives you enough learning that you could work out your own framework for changing a propensity you never again need to have. When you have a craving for taking part in the ""terrible"" propensity supplant that propensity with another one you want to do that gives you a similar sort of reward/result/feeling. Do this again and again until the point when it progresses toward becoming . . . a propensity. The book causes us to see how propensities function and its effect in our lives. Seeing how propensities function could really make it simpler to grow great propensities and quit terrible ones. I truly delighted in the primary portion of the book more as it was centered around people and associations. The later 50% of the book was about propensities for social orders and it could have had a superior consummation by bringing it through and through. It was extremely intriguing to know how organizations focus on our propensities to advertise their items. In the wake of reading ""The Power of Habit,"" I felt incredibly enabled. I suddenly comprehended why it appears that I have no self-discipline. I could stop thrashing myself for my past disappointments and begin rolling out positive improvements. Regardless of whether you're hoping to change your life or not, it's an extremely intriguing read that will give you incredible understanding into how intense little propensities are in deciding how we carry on. General it was a decent book and I profoundly prescribe it to individuals hoping to make great propensities and surrender unfortunate propensities. "

58,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,4,"A full executive-style summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/03/18...It is often said that we are creatures of habit, in that many of our daily activities end up being a matter of routine rather than direct deliberation (just think of your morning run-through). While this is no doubt true, author Charles Duhigg insists that this is but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the impact that habits have on our daily lives. Indeed, in his new book `The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business' Duhigg argues that habits not only pervade our personal lives, but that they have an integral role to play in the businesses and other organizations of which we are a part, and that they are also at the heart of social movements and societies at large.The first part of the book focuses on the role that habits play in our personal lives. Here we learn about the habit loop consisting of cue, routine, and reward, and how the elements in this loop can be manipulated to help modify our habits (say from crashing on the couch with a bag of chips, to heading out for a run). We also learn about the power of particular habits called keystone habits (which include exercise, as well as eating together as a family) that help initiate a domino effect that touches all of the other aspects of our lives. Also, we learn about the power of belief--and the importance of social groups in helping create this belief--that stands behind successful habit transformation programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous.The second part of the book concentrates on how habits help shape businesses and organizations. Here we learn that the formation of habits and routines within organizations is unavoidable; what's more, that it is always best for the leadership of a group to make a deliberate effort to shape the habits of their organizations, and in a way that ensures a high degree of equality and fairness for its various members, while nonetheless making it clear who is ultimately in charge of each particular aspect of the operation. Second, we learn that keystone habits--which are at the center of our personal lives--are also pivotal when it comes to larger organizations (and how a particular keystone habit was applied to resurrect the once great but flailing American aluminum company Alcoa). We also learn about the greatest keystone habit of all: willpower, and how this habit can best be cultivated (and how companies such as Starbucks are employing these lessons to help train employees successfully). Finally, we learn about how companies such as Proctor & Gamble and Target instill habits in their customers.The third and final part of the book examines the importance of habits in social movements, such as the civil rights movement of the 1960's. Here we learn that movements tend to follow a three-part process. To start with, a movement tends to begin with a group of close acquaintances and friends. The movement tends to grow when these people spread it to the broader communities of which they are a part. Finally, in order to really take hold and spread, the movement must be guided forward by an effective leader who lays down new habits for the movement's adherents in a way that allows them to gain a sense of identity.On the negative side, the organization of the book is somewhat muddled, as there is significant overlap in the parts on individuals and organizations. Also, the section on social movements rests on a precious few examples, and therefore, the theory seems less convincing than it might otherwise be. Still, though, there are many things to be learned here and the book is well worth the read. A full executive summary of the book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/03/18...A podcast discussion of the book is also available."

Hopkins.I found this type of casual enlightenment awesome:""For most people who overhaul their lives, there are no seminal moments or life-altering disasters. There are simply communities— sometimes of just one other person— who make change believable. One woman told researchers her life transformed after a day spent cleaning toilets— and after weeks of discussing with the rest of the cleaning crew whether she should leave her husband.""This is very powerful knowledge: “When people are asked to do something that takes self-control, if they think they are doing it for personal reasons – if they feel like it’s a choice or something they enjoy because it helps someone else – it’s much less taxing. If they feel like they have no autonomy, if they are just following orders, their willpower muscles get tired much faster… But when the students were treated like cogs, rather than people, it took a lot more willpower.”Students who had been treated kindly did well on the computer test. Whenever a “6” flashed and a “4” followed, they pounced on the space bar. They were able to maintain their focus for the entire twelve minutes. Despite ignoring the cookies, they had willpower to spare. [The contention being that willpower is a finite resource].Students who had been treated rudely, on the other hand, did terribly. They kept forgetting to hit the space bar. They said they were tired and couldn’t focus. Their willpower muscle, researchers determined, had been fatigued by the brusque instructions."""
60,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65764-lana,4,"I read this book after reading its overall message in article form. Duhigg makes the claim that habits are everything, and then offers ways to change them in order to improve your life. This is not schlocky self-help- the tone is a little more subdued and a little more academic than most books of that nature. He can make habit-changing seem facile at times, which is eyebrow-raising when he's talking about addiction and addictive behavior, but he does come back at the end to point out that while understanding how to change habits is easy, changing them does require hard work, dedication, and time. Less easy. This is shown when the author attempts to change a simple habit- eating a cookie every day- and has to go through over a week of experimentation to identify the cue and reward, and then switch the habit. One point that I did not expect to see is about the power of belief- new habits only stick through times of stress and pressure if the person believes- in the reason for change or in the fact that that change is possible. Old habits *do* die hard- in fact, they never die at all. The patterns your brain learns are always going to be in there. Another useful piece of information was about cues- it may sound easy, but identifying the cues that your brain uses to decide when to go into autopilot can be very challenging. It is really interesting to pay attention to your own habits and see what cues you can identify, though. As a side note, the last non-fiction book I read also made a case of the Saddleback Church. (That book was Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.)"
61,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5031502-dani-shuping,4,"“The Power of Habit” is one of those rare books that I started recommending before I even finished it. Charles Duhigg writes a practical book that pulls from multiple sources to explain how habits work, how they’re developed, how they’re formed in the brain, and how we might go about transforming them. Written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell’s books, Charles translates scientific language into clear, concise, and easy to understand for the average reader. He breaks the book down into three main sections--”The Habits of Individuals,” “The Habits of Successful Organizations,” and “The Habits of Societies”--and provides clear examples to back up what he’s written and his examples cover a wide range. For example, he writes about how Tony Dungy changed habits of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to mold them into a winning football team. And he talks about how the former CEO of ALECO championed safety in order to increase company profits. This is a book that anyone, anywhere can get something out of. While Duhigg doesn’t provide specifics of how to change habits in my ARC, (there will be an appendix in the final addition that may do so) there is still ample evidence in the examples of things that you can do and think about as ways to change/modify the habits you’ve built over a lifetime. Overall this is a fascinating book that made me think more about why I do what I do and how I might be able to change it."
62,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217216-allan-elder,3,"The basics of this book are fascinating. The Habit Loop consists of a cue, which calls a routine, which seeks a reward. That is whole book. There is little reason to read the rest of it unless you like a lot examples of this loop. Unfortunately, the book does not really explore the science of habits and absolutely, completely, ignores the research on behaviorism which explains the entire premise of the book. The science of behaviorism, while not popular, covers this material in a way that is actionable. Look at the ""amazing"" discovery of cue, routine, and reward and compare it the decades old behavioral idea of Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence (the ABCs). Duhigg, identifies the habits as ""That psychology was grounded in two basic rules: First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards."" He then spends the next dozen pages with examples from commercials. If you understand the ""ABCs"" then the book holds little value (unless you like stories). Jump to the Appendix ""A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas"" and read it only. It covers everything discussed in the book but at least gives a hint about using the habit concept for change. The advice? Identify the routine, experiment with satisfying rewards, isolate the cue, and have a plan. That's it. If it matters, my review is based on the Kindle edition."
63,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118210-sarah,4,"Very interesting. Duhigg’s breakdown of the habit cycle ( Cue —> Routine —> Reward) is simple but it doesn’t follow that it’s easy just to change the routine. Sadly (for me) there is no magical formula to stop wasting time/exercise more/take vitamins/eat better, but it did confirm that breaking bad habits and forming better ones is really hard to do, so hooray for validation. Personally I found the section on the habits of successful organizations the most interesting. Duhigg cites research showing that an organization's routines function as habits, and these can either create success or result in thoughtless risk, waste and danger (depending on the industry). Similar to French pop culture child-raising notions (where parents must enforce a non-negotiable cadre within which a child has vast freedom), successful employees have considerable choice within their daily work lives (choice about shifts, uniforms, etc. lead to far greater productivity), but only so long as there is a clear ultimate decision maker. A “keystone” organizational habit (e.g., Alcoa’s prioritizing workplace safety above all else) can lead to higher quality and output by fostering subsequent habits of ownership and accountability. "
64,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63015728-ian-d,2,"Though the central idea is not uninteresting (quite the contrary), the writing leaves a lot to be desired: too many anecdotal facts, presented in a non-linear, incohesive way. All in all, the book could have easily been 200 pages shorter and that would have made it a more enjoyable read.Still, a lot of things to consider about building and reprogramming our daily routine. Unfortunately, being concise was not one of the writer's main habits. Neither was the editor's.If I could summarise it in one phrase, that would be it:""Water is the most apt analogy for how a habit works. Water hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, the path traced by itself before.You now know how to redirect that path. You now have the power to swim."""

70,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38970458-willian-molinari,5,"Read this book for the first time in 2016 and re-read it now (2019). The first time I read it, I did not take notes, so I decided to ""properly read/listen"" now.I like the number of studies this book shows and how much we understand about our habits by looking at its results. Some of these studies are already debunked by science (like the marshmallow study), but it's still a great book.At the end of the book, the author provides some examples of how you can use the content of the book to apply to your habits. The goal of this book is not to give you a step-by-step guide on how to change your habits, but to show you how they work. Your cues and rewards are unique, and you have to understand yourself to deal with them.I will keep this piece of the review here. I wrote it in 2016 right after adopting my dog:I'm training a little dog now, and it's really impressive to see how we made some habits for him. It became natural for the dog pee on a specific place, for example. The important part is to keep the same cue, routine, and reward. :)My dog is three years old now. :)Here are my notes for this book:More than 40% of actions people perform every day are not actual decisions but habits according to paper by Duke University in 2006Removing food from the plaza where a group unites was a good way of not keeping them there. When people start to get hungry, they go somewhere elseThe research was done with Eugene, known as EP in the medical literatureThe basal ganglia stores habits in the brainThe brain is continually looking for ways to reduce effort -- it seems to be the same idea exposed by thinking fast and slow :)Patients with basal ganglia damage can't get basic feelings because they don't understand simple face recognitions (they don't know where to focus)Whin cues come out of order or in a different shape, they are not recognized, and the habit is not started. The cue starts the need for a reward and the craving for the routine to achieve it. That's one of the reasons why cellphone notifications are so difficult to resistSome people say they like to workout because of the feeling of endorphins, others because of the sense of accomplishment when tracking their results -- I'm at the gym now, and I'm not sure what motivates me. Maybe keeping my routine? (PS. I'm not too fond of the gym environment, but it's ok now)... oooh... Got it, it's the audiobooks! :)The breeze by P&G was created as a great product to remove odor. In the end, they found out that no one wants to admit that their house stinks, so there's no cue. They transformed the product into something else that smells good and created another cue at the end of cleaning. Tne product got millions of revenue. -- yeah... In the end, it's all about money.The cravings drive the habit loop. You need to feel the need for something to power the habitA football trainer (buccaneers) applied a habit-changing routine to his players for years. This training made players not think in certain situations, but apply habits instead, which is faster. -- it reminds me about playing drums. Sometimes I don't know how I'm playing, I just start, and the rhythm takes care of itselfBelief is important. It doesn't have to be God, but you have to believe that you will get through stressful moments when your routine is not working""Some football teams are not teams; they are just guys who work together"" -- saw that more than once but with developersChanging one habit may chain many other reactions and enhancements. Like changing safety may increase profits and communication. One habit change sometimes requires a whole infrastructure changeMichael Phelps routine has nothing to do with swimming, but it's related to his success""It may be hard to fire someone who's been working for the company for so long, but not for me. Our values dictated how to act."" He fired himself.The director changed named parking spots in the parking lot. Whoever gets to work earlier will get the best spot.

It's a finite resource. If you want to do something that requires willpower you better do it in the morning or conserve your willpower for the nightIt's important so sign children to piano (or anything else) lessons because it teaches them the willpower to study, not just piano itself""We're not in the coffee business serving people. We're in the people business serving coffee"", Starbucks former presidentWhen people are doing things that require willpower, and they feel doing it for themselves or helping someone else, it is less taxing on their willpower. If they feel they are just following orders, it will require a lot more willpower to get the job doneIf a company doesn't cultivate habits to build a good culture, it will still emerge but in a disorganized way.You usually turn right when you enter the supermarketOur brain likes to listen to songs that seem familiar, and this is what makes a big hit.If you dress a new something into an old habit, it's easier for people to accept it (hey ya example)Martin Luther King Jr movement was also based on social habits, strong and weak connections, and peer pressure. It was created in a way where many people agreed, and others will feel bad or ""against it"" if they did not participate (after all, they support it, but some were just not committed enough and could drop it without peer pressure)To political movements to succeed, people have to change their habits. Their identities have to change.Near misses in a slot machine (and possibly other places) are very addictive for the brain, especially for those sensitive to gamblingOnce you know a bad habit exists, you have the freedom and responsibility to change it. You will be held accountable for it.This book provides a framework to understand how habits work and a guide on how they can be changedTo change a habit, find the cue reward, and routine, and then change the routine. Try some alternate routines keeping the same cue and reward. Take notes of your feelings right after the routine and reward. After 15 minutes, are you still craving for this habit? Example: buy a cookie every day. Try to buy different things or buy in different places to find the exact reward you want to have, and then keep the new routineTake notes of your cravings and what's the situation that triggered it: time, action, where, mood, etc. It will help you to identify the pattern"
71,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13036247-diana,4,"The Power of Habit is an absolutely fascinating book that explores how habits have the ability to affect virtually everything in our lives. To say humans are creatures of habit is an understatement. Think of all the things you do on a daily basis without even thinking about them! Charles Duhigg has compiled so much information in this book. We've all heard the phrase: Old habits are hard to break, well there is a reason for that as we learn in this book, but also, there are ways to change your habits with a bit of insight into what makes them habits in the first place. It was a little shocking to learn about how corporations have used this information to help drive sales. A lot of interesting information throughout. "
72,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645496-wai-yip-tung,1,"The Power of Habit is a plainly bad book. So bad that in half of the book, the author just don't know what he is talking about.By now I have identified this genre of non-fiction book I would call Malcolm Gladwell-esque, journalists packaged popular science or popular psychology books. They would write about a topic with some scientific basis, but often spiced up to look very much like they have discovered some secret formula of success. Unfortunately their literary skill gets far ahead of their analytic skill. The result is an illusion that dazzle people at the beginning. But ultimately turn out to have little substance.The thesis and the secret formula to success in this book is habit. Had Duhigg concentrate on the finding in science and neurological underpinning of personal habits, it would have been a mildly interesting book. Once he takes this thesis and apply it to organization and social level, it falls apart quickly.He write at length about how new habit introduced to corporation like Aloca is a huge success story that turned the company around. Mind you what he call organization's habit we usually refer as ""corporate culture"". If you have never suspected ""corporate culture"" could have effect on its performance then Duhigg's book would be a revelation for you. But to most people who have some business sense, Duhigg has add nothing to add to the familiar topic of corporate culture other than his spiced up anecdotes.The book reach its low point when he try to explain Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott incident. To drive the habit theme he use the term liberally in the passages, results in curious phrases like the habit of friendship? the habit of peer pressure? and the social habit of weak ties? 'Habit' has become an entirely meaningless buzzword. Had he dropped the term from the sentences, they would at least be understandable vocabularies like ""friendship"", ""peer pressure"" and ""weak ties"". ""Weak ties"", being a well known concept of social and network science, further expose Duhigg's weakness as he wrote about it at length and it shows he has a lot of misconception about the idea.Ultimately he story about the power of habit really have little predictive and discriminatory power. If the social structure of the black community (I can't bring myself to say social habit) of the Montgomery explains the Rosa Parks incident, then why is it such one-off event? Since the social structure is well established why isn't it deliver forceful activism all the time? And what about all other communities that have similar social structure to Montgomery? What evidence can you find that demonstrate the power of so call ""xxx"" habit in these other communities?(Review is base on reading of selected chapters)."
73,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,3,"In this book, Charles Duhigg takes a look at habits from a number of different perspectives - individual habits, like exercising or drinking, organizational habits, like how departments within corporations communicate with one another, and societal habits, such as those that can motivate individuals to undertake certain actions as a group. His thesis is that habits control a large part of behavior on all these levels. Habits can't be eliminated, he says, but by becoming conscious of them and taking certain steps, we can replace undesirable habits with more productive ones.It's an interesting theory, and he fleshes it out with a number of intriguing anecdotes. While the stories he tells are all quite fascinating in their own light, however, I don't feel they illustrated his points quite as successfully as he thinks they do. Take, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous. He highlights the group as an example of a system that creates habit change. And while it certainly has been successful for some members, its high failure rates undermine Duhigg's thesis even as he presents it. Duhigg amends his thesis to account for this failure with the idea that those engaging in habit change need to believe in what they are doing in order for it to work long term. Yet I don't think it would be too hard to find people who have fallen off the wagon despite their belief in the program.Throughout numerous other examples, Duhigg continually assumes correlation equals causation and gives credit in places I don't believe is necessarily due. For this reason, the book isn't as solid as it could be. That said, however, the stories he tells about how change was facilitated by individuals and organizations are very thought-provoking and I definitely learned some things by reading them; the story of how a new CEO transformed the giant corporation Alcoa by focusing on worker safety was particularly interesting. In the appendix, Duhigg does acknowledge that there really isn't one specific way to create habit change, and doing it effectively is going to depend on the habit and the person or system involved. If one can accept that changing habits isn't as simple as he tries to make it sound earlier in the book, there may be useful information here."

It was a pretty long book, definitely a re-read.Notes:- If you remove certain arts of the brain it can effect memory, and tasks, habits don't rely on memory parts of the brain which is interesting - the brains basal ganglia basically is the habit forming/storing area- habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort - it's like a computer cache system, if it loads a page it remembers the page so it doesn't have to load it from scratch again - we can devote mental energy to new ideas and concepts etc- Habits are formed by cravings, there's a cue, a routine, and a reward- People crave the tingly feeling of minty toothpaste because it makes them think the product has done something, that it has had an effect. Fabreeze has the fresh smell at the end of your cleaning which creates a craving for that scent and that feeling of accomplishment - “It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re halfway to changing it”- “We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted. But that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”- Willpower is a muscle, you can use it all up for the day and it will become exhausted- Starbucks allowed autonomy among their employee's and this increased morale"

Why and how we do things by force of habit was interesting enough, but being tracked by retailers to determine buying habits so they can target your needs and cravings was a real eye-opener! Target is the retailer exampled in this book, which makes you wonder why they chose that name. And apparently even gambling casinos can keep track of habitual gamblers and use their addiction to keep them coming back for more. The author takes a complicated subject with a lot of scientific study available, and makes it simple and entertaining enough for any reader. The 4 star rating is for the things I learned through reading this book that I never knew before. The social habits that fed the Montgomery bus boycotts after Rosa Parks arrest in 1955 were mind blowing. This is quite a read."

I got tired of that so I picked up a used copy at Powell's Books in Portland last month when I was there. That being said, I really liked this book. I wanted to read it because I thought it might help me change some of my bad habits into good ones. However, I found the part about businesses, especially retail, and how they look at consumer buying habits to be quite interesting. I also thought the part about music and how music companies determine what will be a hit and what won't to be of even more interest. I will be wondering about it the next time my favorite song comes on the radio!There is a section on social movements.

I felt this strongly with the power of habit. The anecdotes were good but they did not flesh out the premise of book nor did it appear that the author made enough ""statements"" to provide any substance here. The thing that this book has going for it is that most of us don't really think about our habits and how they affect business or ourselves. This book gave an excuse for the reader to mentally explore their own habits and those that govern larger organizations to which they might belong, but reading the book may not have been necessary to get there. Probably could have done it after a 3-4page convincing article. Just saying. "

What could have been a very dry topic on our scientific responses and why we implement good/bad habits in our life, ended up being an absolutely fascinating piece. The book tackles everything from how DJ's get us to listen to certain music, to how businesses use surveys to control our habits (again, both good and bad), and even how brands target consumers to make their products a part of our routines when they had never existed before. The end of the book offers valuable advice on how to break bad habits by identifying your habit loop and how to get the good stuff back in your life.

If you want to change a habit, lose weight, quit smoking, change drinking habits, read this book. It describes patterns and habits that shape our lives, and, if we can learn to recognize the cues, it's the first step toward shaping those patterns into the habits of a life we want to live.In addition to personal habits, the book delves into social group habits--what shapes the habits of people who act as a group.

90,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65764-lana,4,"I read this book after reading its overall message in article form. Duhigg makes the claim that habits are everything, and then offers ways to change them in order to improve your life. This is not schlocky self-help- the tone is a little more subdued and a little more academic than most books of that nature. He can make habit-changing seem facile at times, which is eyebrow-raising when he's talking about addiction and addictive behavior, but he does come back at the end to point out that while understanding how to change habits is easy, changing them does require hard work, dedication, and time. Less easy. This is shown when the author attempts to change a simple habit- eating a cookie every day- and has to go through over a week of experimentation to identify the cue and reward, and then switch the habit. One point that I did not expect to see is about the power of belief- new habits only stick through times of stress and pressure if the person believes- in the reason for change or in the fact that that change is possible. Old habits *do* die hard- in fact, they never die at all. The patterns your brain learns are always going to be in there. Another useful piece of information was about cues- it may sound easy, but identifying the cues that your brain uses to decide when to go into autopilot can be very challenging. It is really interesting to pay attention to your own habits and see what cues you can identify, though. As a side note, the last non-fiction book I read also made a case of the Saddleback Church. (That book was Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.)"
91,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5031502-dani-shuping,4,"“The Power of Habit” is one of those rare books that I started recommending before I even finished it. Charles Duhigg writes a practical book that pulls from multiple sources to explain how habits work, how they’re developed, how they’re formed in the brain, and how we might go about transforming them. Written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell’s books, Charles translates scientific language into clear, concise, and easy to understand for the average reader. He breaks the book down into three main sections--”The Habits of Individuals,” “The Habits of Successful Organizations,” and “The Habits of Societies”--and provides clear examples to back up what he’s written and his examples cover a wide range. For example, he writes about how Tony Dungy changed habits of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to mold them into a winning football team. And he talks about how the former CEO of ALECO championed safety in order to increase company profits. This is a book that anyone, anywhere can get something out of. While Duhigg doesn’t provide specifics of how to change habits in my ARC, (there will be an appendix in the final addition that may do so) there is still ample evidence in the examples of things that you can do and think about as ways to change/modify the habits you’ve built over a lifetime. Overall this is a fascinating book that made me think more about why I do what I do and how I might be able to change it."
92,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217216-allan-elder,3,"The basics of this book are fascinating. The Habit Loop consists of a cue, which calls a routine, which seeks a reward. That is whole book. There is little reason to read the rest of it unless you like a lot examples of this loop. Unfortunately, the book does not really explore the science of habits and absolutely, completely, ignores the research on behaviorism which explains the entire premise of the book. The science of behaviorism, while not popular, covers this material in a way that is actionable. Look at the ""amazing"" discovery of cue, routine, and reward and compare it the decades old behavioral idea of Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence (the ABCs). Duhigg, identifies the habits as ""That psychology was grounded in two basic rules: First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards."" He then spends the next dozen pages with examples from commercials. If you understand the ""ABCs"" then the book holds little value (unless you like stories). Jump to the Appendix ""A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas"" and read it only. It covers everything discussed in the book but at least gives a hint about using the habit concept for change. The advice? Identify the routine, experiment with satisfying rewards, isolate the cue, and have a plan. That's it. If it matters, my review is based on the Kindle edition."
93,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118210-sarah,4,"Very interesting. Duhigg’s breakdown of the habit cycle ( Cue —> Routine —> Reward) is simple but it doesn’t follow that it’s easy just to change the routine. Sadly (for me) there is no magical formula to stop wasting time/exercise more/take vitamins/eat better, but it did confirm that breaking bad habits and forming better ones is really hard to do, so hooray for validation. Personally I found the section on the habits of successful organizations the most interesting. Duhigg cites research showing that an organization's routines function as habits, and these can either create success or result in thoughtless risk, waste and danger (depending on the industry). Similar to French pop culture child-raising notions (where parents must enforce a non-negotiable cadre within which a child has vast freedom), successful employees have considerable choice within their daily work lives (choice about shifts, uniforms, etc. lead to far greater productivity), but only so long as there is a clear ultimate decision maker. A “keystone” organizational habit (e.g., Alcoa’s prioritizing workplace safety above all else) can lead to higher quality and output by fostering subsequent habits of ownership and accountability. "
94,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63015728-ian-d,2,"Though the central idea is not uninteresting (quite the contrary), the writing leaves a lot to be desired: too many anecdotal facts, presented in a non-linear, incohesive way. All in all, the book could have easily been 200 pages shorter and that would have made it a more enjoyable read.Still, a lot of things to consider about building and reprogramming our daily routine. Unfortunately, being concise was not one of the writer's main habits. Neither was the editor's.If I could summarise it in one phrase, that would be it:""Water is the most apt analogy for how a habit works. Water hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, the path traced by itself before.You now know how to redirect that path. You now have the power to swim."""

100,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38970458-willian-molinari,5,"Read this book for the first time in 2016 and re-read it now (2019). The first time I read it, I did not take notes, so I decided to ""properly read/listen"" now.I like the number of studies this book shows and how much we understand about our habits by looking at its results. Some of these studies are already debunked by science (like the marshmallow study), but it's still a great book.At the end of the book, the author provides some examples of how you can use the content of the book to apply to your habits. The goal of this book is not to give you a step-by-step guide on how to change your habits, but to show you how they work. Your cues and rewards are unique, and you have to understand yourself to deal with them.I will keep this piece of the review here. I wrote it in 2016 right after adopting my dog:I'm training a little dog now, and it's really impressive to see how we made some habits for him. It became natural for the dog pee on a specific place, for example. The important part is to keep the same cue, routine, and reward. :)My dog is three years old now. :)Here are my notes for this book:More than 40% of actions people perform every day are not actual decisions but habits according to paper by Duke University in 2006Removing food from the plaza where a group unites was a good way of not keeping them there. When people start to get hungry, they go somewhere elseThe research was done with Eugene, known as EP in the medical literatureThe basal ganglia stores habits in the brainThe brain is continually looking for ways to reduce effort -- it seems to be the same idea exposed by thinking fast and slow :)Patients with basal ganglia damage can't get basic feelings because they don't understand simple face recognitions (they don't know where to focus)Whin cues come out of order or in a different shape, they are not recognized, and the habit is not started. The cue starts the need for a reward and the craving for the routine to achieve it. That's one of the reasons why cellphone notifications are so difficult to resistSome people say they like to workout because of the feeling of endorphins, others because of the sense of accomplishment when tracking their results -- I'm at the gym now, and I'm not sure what motivates me. Maybe keeping my routine? (PS. I'm not too fond of the gym environment, but it's ok now)... oooh... Got it, it's the audiobooks! :)The breeze by P&G was created as a great product to remove odor. In the end, they found out that no one wants to admit that their house stinks, so there's no cue. They transformed the product into something else that smells good and created another cue at the end of cleaning. Tne product got millions of revenue. -- yeah... In the end, it's all about money.The cravings drive the habit loop. You need to feel the need for something to power the habitA football trainer (buccaneers) applied a habit-changing routine to his players for years. This training made players not think in certain situations, but apply habits instead, which is faster. -- it reminds me about playing drums. Sometimes I don't know how I'm playing, I just start, and the rhythm takes care of itselfBelief is important. It doesn't have to be God, but you have to believe that you will get through stressful moments when your routine is not working""Some football teams are not teams; they are just guys who work together"" -- saw that more than once but with developersChanging one habit may chain many other reactions and enhancements. Like changing safety may increase profits and communication. One habit change sometimes requires a whole infrastructure changeMichael Phelps routine has nothing to do with swimming, but it's related to his success""It may be hard to fire someone who's been working for the company for so long, but not for me. Our values dictated how to act."" He fired himself.The director changed named parking spots in the parking lot. Whoever gets to work earlier will get the best spot. Every person matter. -- whatever getting to work earlier, but every person matter makes total senseStudies show that willpower is the single most important habit that contributes to people's successStarbucks had to invest in creating an environment where it would be ok to pay $5 for a coffeeYet another book mentioning the marshmallow studyWillpower is like a muscle, and you have to exercise it. It's a finite resource. If you want to do something that requires willpower you better do it in the morning or conserve your willpower for the nightIt's important so sign children to piano (or anything else) lessons because it teaches them the willpower to study, not just piano itself""We're not in the coffee business serving people. We're in the people business serving coffee"", Starbucks former presidentWhen people are doing things that require willpower, and they feel doing it for themselves or helping someone else, it is less taxing on their willpower. If they feel they are just following orders, it will require a lot more willpower to get the job doneIf a company doesn't cultivate habits to build a good culture, it will still emerge but in a disorganized way.You usually turn right when you enter the supermarketOur brain likes to listen to songs that seem familiar, and this is what makes a big hit.If you dress a new something into an old habit, it's easier for people to accept it (hey ya example)Martin Luther King Jr movement was also based on social habits, strong and weak connections, and peer pressure. It was created in a way where many people agreed, and others will feel bad or ""against it"" if they did not participate (after all, they support it, but some were just not committed enough and could drop it without peer pressure)To political movements to succeed, people have to change their habits. Their identities have to change.Near misses in a slot machine (and possibly other places) are very addictive for the brain, especially for those sensitive to gamblingOnce you know a bad habit exists, you have the freedom and responsibility to change it. You will be held accountable for it.This book provides a framework to understand how habits work and a guide on how they can be changedTo change a habit, find the cue reward, and routine, and then change the routine. Try some alternate routines keeping the same cue and reward. Take notes of your feelings right after the routine and reward. After 15 minutes, are you still craving for this habit? Example: buy a cookie every day. Try to buy different things or buy in different places to find the exact reward you want to have, and then keep the new routineTake notes of your cravings and what's the situation that triggered it: time, action, where, mood, etc. It will help you to identify the pattern"
101,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13036247-diana,4,"The Power of Habit is an absolutely fascinating book that explores how habits have the ability to affect virtually everything in our lives. To say humans are creatures of habit is an understatement. Think of all the things you do on a daily basis without even thinking about them! Charles Duhigg has compiled so much information in this book. We've all heard the phrase: Old habits are hard to break, well there is a reason for that as we learn in this book, but also, there are ways to change your habits with a bit of insight into what makes them habits in the first place. It was a little shocking to learn about how corporations have used this information to help drive sales. A lot of interesting information throughout. "
102,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645496-wai-yip-tung,1,"The Power of Habit is a plainly bad book. So bad that in half of the book, the author just don't know what he is talking about.By now I have identified this genre of non-fiction book I would call Malcolm Gladwell-esque, journalists packaged popular science or popular psychology books. They would write about a topic with some scientific basis, but often spiced up to look very much like they have discovered some secret formula of success. Unfortunately their literary skill gets far ahead of their analytic skill. The result is an illusion that dazzle people at the beginning. But ultimately turn out to have little substance.The thesis and the secret formula to success in this book is habit. Had Duhigg concentrate on the finding in science and neurological underpinning of personal habits, it would have been a mildly interesting book. Once he takes this thesis and apply it to organization and social level, it falls apart quickly.He write at length about how new habit introduced to corporation like Aloca is a huge success story that turned the company around. Mind you what he call organization's habit we usually refer as ""corporate culture"". If you have never suspected ""corporate culture"" could have effect on its performance then Duhigg's book would be a revelation for you. But to most people who have some business sense, Duhigg has add nothing to add to the familiar topic of corporate culture other than his spiced up anecdotes.The book reach its low point when he try to explain Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott incident. To drive the habit theme he use the term liberally in the passages, results in curious phrases like the habit of friendship? the habit of peer pressure? and the social habit of weak ties? 'Habit' has become an entirely meaningless buzzword. Had he dropped the term from the sentences, they would at least be understandable vocabularies like ""friendship"", ""peer pressure"" and ""weak ties"". ""Weak ties"", being a well known concept of social and network science, further expose Duhigg's weakness as he wrote about it at length and it shows he has a lot of misconception about the idea.Ultimately he story about the power of habit really have little predictive and discriminatory power. If the social structure of the black community (I can't bring myself to say social habit) of the Montgomery explains the Rosa Parks incident, then why is it such one-off event? Since the social structure is well established why isn't it deliver forceful activism all the time? And what about all other communities that have similar social structure to Montgomery? What evidence can you find that demonstrate the power of so call ""xxx"" habit in these other communities?(Review is base on reading of selected chapters)."
103,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,3,"In this book, Charles Duhigg takes a look at habits from a number of different perspectives - individual habits, like exercising or drinking, organizational habits, like how departments within corporations communicate with one another, and societal habits, such as those that can motivate individuals to undertake certain actions as a group. His thesis is that habits control a large part of behavior on all these levels. Habits can't be eliminated, he says, but by becoming conscious of them and taking certain steps, we can replace undesirable habits with more productive ones.It's an interesting theory, and he fleshes it out with a number of intriguing anecdotes. While the stories he tells are all quite fascinating in their own light, however, I don't feel they illustrated his points quite as successfully as he thinks they do. Take, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous. He highlights the group as an example of a system that creates habit change. And while it certainly has been successful for some members, its high failure rates undermine Duhigg's thesis even as he presents it. Duhigg amends his thesis to account for this failure with the idea that those engaging in habit change need to believe in what they are doing in order for it to work long term. Yet I don't think it would be too hard to find people who have fallen off the wagon despite their belief in the program.Throughout numerous other examples, Duhigg continually assumes correlation equals causation and gives credit in places I don't believe is necessarily due. For this reason, the book isn't as solid as it could be. That said, however, the stories he tells about how change was facilitated by individuals and organizations are very thought-provoking and I definitely learned some things by reading them; the story of how a new CEO transformed the giant corporation Alcoa by focusing on worker safety was particularly interesting. In the appendix, Duhigg does acknowledge that there really isn't one specific way to create habit change, and doing it effectively is going to depend on the habit and the person or system involved. If one can accept that changing habits isn't as simple as he tries to make it sound earlier in the book, there may be useful information here."

It was a pretty long book, definitely a re-read.Notes:- If you remove certain arts of the brain it can effect memory, and tasks, habits don't rely on memory parts of the brain which is interesting - the brains basal ganglia basically is the habit forming/storing area- habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort - it's like a computer cache system, if it loads a page it remembers the page so it doesn't have to load it from scratch again - we can devote mental energy to new ideas and concepts etc- Habits are formed by cravings, there's a cue, a routine, and a reward- People crave the tingly feeling of minty toothpaste because it makes them think the product has done something, that it has had an effect. Fabreeze has the fresh smell at the end of your cleaning which creates a craving for that scent and that feeling of accomplishment - “It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re halfway to changing it”- “We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted. But that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”- Willpower is a muscle, you can use it all up for the day and it will become exhausted- Starbucks allowed autonomy among their employee's and this increased morale"

Why and how we do things by force of habit was interesting enough, but being tracked by retailers to determine buying habits so they can target your needs and cravings was a real eye-opener! Target is the retailer exampled in this book, which makes you wonder why they chose that name. And apparently even gambling casinos can keep track of habitual gamblers and use their addiction to keep them coming back for more. The author takes a complicated subject with a lot of scientific study available, and makes it simple and entertaining enough for any reader. The 4 star rating is for the things I learned through reading this book that I never knew before. The social habits that fed the Montgomery bus boycotts after Rosa Parks arrest in 1955 were mind blowing. This is quite a read."

I got tired of that so I picked up a used copy at Powell's Books in Portland last month when I was there. That being said, I really liked this book. I wanted to read it because I thought it might help me change some of my bad habits into good ones. However, I found the part about businesses, especially retail, and how they look at consumer buying habits to be quite interesting. I also thought the part about music and how music companies determine what will be a hit and what won't to be of even more interest. I will be wondering about it the next time my favorite song comes on the radio!There is a section on social movements.

I felt this strongly with the power of habit. The anecdotes were good but they did not flesh out the premise of book nor did it appear that the author made enough ""statements"" to provide any substance here. The thing that this book has going for it is that most of us don't really think about our habits and how they affect business or ourselves. This book gave an excuse for the reader to mentally explore their own habits and those that govern larger organizations to which they might belong, but reading the book may not have been necessary to get there. Probably could have done it after a 3-4page convincing article. Just saying. "

What could have been a very dry topic on our scientific responses and why we implement good/bad habits in our life, ended up being an absolutely fascinating piece. The book tackles everything from how DJ's get us to listen to certain music, to how businesses use surveys to control our habits (again, both good and bad), and even how brands target consumers to make their products a part of our routines when they had never existed before. The end of the book offers valuable advice on how to break bad habits by identifying your habit loop and how to get the good stuff back in your life.

If you want to change a habit, lose weight, quit smoking, change drinking habits, read this book. It describes patterns and habits that shape our lives, and, if we can learn to recognize the cues, it's the first step toward shaping those patterns into the habits of a life we want to live.In addition to personal habits, the book delves into social group habits--what shapes the habits of people who act as a group.

120,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65764-lana,4,"I read this book after reading its overall message in article form. Duhigg makes the claim that habits are everything, and then offers ways to change them in order to improve your life. This is not schlocky self-help- the tone is a little more subdued and a little more academic than most books of that nature. He can make habit-changing seem facile at times, which is eyebrow-raising when he's talking about addiction and addictive behavior, but he does come back at the end to point out that while understanding how to change habits is easy, changing them does require hard work, dedication, and time. Less easy. This is shown when the author attempts to change a simple habit- eating a cookie every day- and has to go through over a week of experimentation to identify the cue and reward, and then switch the habit. One point that I did not expect to see is about the power of belief- new habits only stick through times of stress and pressure if the person believes- in the reason for change or in the fact that that change is possible. Old habits *do* die hard- in fact, they never die at all. The patterns your brain learns are always going to be in there. Another useful piece of information was about cues- it may sound easy, but identifying the cues that your brain uses to decide when to go into autopilot can be very challenging. It is really interesting to pay attention to your own habits and see what cues you can identify, though. As a side note, the last non-fiction book I read also made a case of the Saddleback Church. (That book was Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.)"
121,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5031502-dani-shuping,4,"“The Power of Habit” is one of those rare books that I started recommending before I even finished it. Charles Duhigg writes a practical book that pulls from multiple sources to explain how habits work, how they’re developed, how they’re formed in the brain, and how we might go about transforming them. Written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell’s books, Charles translates scientific language into clear, concise, and easy to understand for the average reader. He breaks the book down into three main sections--”The Habits of Individuals,” “The Habits of Successful Organizations,” and “The Habits of Societies”--and provides clear examples to back up what he’s written and his examples cover a wide range. For example, he writes about how Tony Dungy changed habits of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to mold them into a winning football team. And he talks about how the former CEO of ALECO championed safety in order to increase company profits. This is a book that anyone, anywhere can get something out of. While Duhigg doesn’t provide specifics of how to change habits in my ARC, (there will be an appendix in the final addition that may do so) there is still ample evidence in the examples of things that you can do and think about as ways to change/modify the habits you’ve built over a lifetime. Overall this is a fascinating book that made me think more about why I do what I do and how I might be able to change it."
122,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217216-allan-elder,3,"The basics of this book are fascinating. The Habit Loop consists of a cue, which calls a routine, which seeks a reward. That is whole book. There is little reason to read the rest of it unless you like a lot examples of this loop. Unfortunately, the book does not really explore the science of habits and absolutely, completely, ignores the research on behaviorism which explains the entire premise of the book. The science of behaviorism, while not popular, covers this material in a way that is actionable. Look at the ""amazing"" discovery of cue, routine, and reward and compare it the decades old behavioral idea of Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence (the ABCs). Duhigg, identifies the habits as ""That psychology was grounded in two basic rules: First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards."" He then spends the next dozen pages with examples from commercials. If you understand the ""ABCs"" then the book holds little value (unless you like stories). Jump to the Appendix ""A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas"" and read it only. It covers everything discussed in the book but at least gives a hint about using the habit concept for change. The advice? Identify the routine, experiment with satisfying rewards, isolate the cue, and have a plan. That's it. If it matters, my review is based on the Kindle edition."
123,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118210-sarah,4,"Very interesting. Duhigg’s breakdown of the habit cycle ( Cue —> Routine —> Reward) is simple but it doesn’t follow that it’s easy just to change the routine. Sadly (for me) there is no magical formula to stop wasting time/exercise more/take vitamins/eat better, but it did confirm that breaking bad habits and forming better ones is really hard to do, so hooray for validation. Personally I found the section on the habits of successful organizations the most interesting. Duhigg cites research showing that an organization's routines function as habits, and these can either create success or result in thoughtless risk, waste and danger (depending on the industry). Similar to French pop culture child-raising notions (where parents must enforce a non-negotiable cadre within which a child has vast freedom), successful employees have considerable choice within their daily work lives (choice about shifts, uniforms, etc. lead to far greater productivity), but only so long as there is a clear ultimate decision maker. A “keystone” organizational habit (e.g., Alcoa’s prioritizing workplace safety above all else) can lead to higher quality and output by fostering subsequent habits of ownership and accountability. "
124,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63015728-ian-d,2,"Though the central idea is not uninteresting (quite the contrary), the writing leaves a lot to be desired: too many anecdotal facts, presented in a non-linear, incohesive way. All in all, the book could have easily been 200 pages shorter and that would have made it a more enjoyable read.Still, a lot of things to consider about building and reprogramming our daily routine. Unfortunately, being concise was not one of the writer's main habits. Neither was the editor's.If I could summarise it in one phrase, that would be it:""Water is the most apt analogy for how a habit works. Water hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, the path traced by itself before.You now know how to redirect that path. You now have the power to swim."""

130,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38970458-willian-molinari,5,"Read this book for the first time in 2016 and re-read it now (2019). The first time I read it, I did not take notes, so I decided to ""properly read/listen"" now.I like the number of studies this book shows and how much we understand about our habits by looking at its results. Some of these studies are already debunked by science (like the marshmallow study), but it's still a great book.At the end of the book, the author provides some examples of how you can use the content of the book to apply to your habits. The goal of this book is not to give you a step-by-step guide on how to change your habits, but to show you how they work. Your cues and rewards are unique, and you have to understand yourself to deal with them.I will keep this piece of the review here. I wrote it in 2016 right after adopting my dog:I'm training a little dog now, and it's really impressive to see how we made some habits for him. It became natural for the dog pee on a specific place, for example. The important part is to keep the same cue, routine, and reward. :)My dog is three years old now. :)Here are my notes for this book:More than 40% of actions people perform every day are not actual decisions but habits according to paper by Duke University in 2006Removing food from the plaza where a group unites was a good way of not keeping them there. When people start to get hungry, they go somewhere elseThe research was done with Eugene, known as EP in the medical literatureThe basal ganglia stores habits in the brainThe brain is continually looking for ways to reduce effort -- it seems to be the same idea exposed by thinking fast and slow :)Patients with basal ganglia damage can't get basic feelings because they don't understand simple face recognitions (they don't know where to focus)Whin cues come out of order or in a different shape, they are not recognized, and the habit is not started. The cue starts the need for a reward and the craving for the routine to achieve it. That's one of the reasons why cellphone notifications are so difficult to resistSome people say they like to workout because of the feeling of endorphins, others because of the sense of accomplishment when tracking their results -- I'm at the gym now, and I'm not sure what motivates me. Maybe keeping my routine? (PS. I'm not too fond of the gym environment, but it's ok now)... oooh... Got it, it's the audiobooks! :)The breeze by P&G was created as a great product to remove odor. In the end, they found out that no one wants to admit that their house stinks, so there's no cue. They transformed the product into something else that smells good and created another cue at the end of cleaning. Tne product got millions of revenue. -- yeah... In the end, it's all about money.The cravings drive the habit loop. You need to feel the need for something to power the habitA football trainer (buccaneers) applied a habit-changing routine to his players for years. This training made players not think in certain situations, but apply habits instead, which is faster. -- it reminds me about playing drums. Sometimes I don't know how I'm playing, I just start, and the rhythm takes care of itselfBelief is important. It doesn't have to be God, but you have to believe that you will get through stressful moments when your routine is not working""Some football teams are not teams; they are just guys who work together"" -- saw that more than once but with developersChanging one habit may chain many other reactions and enhancements. Like changing safety may increase profits and communication. One habit change sometimes requires a whole infrastructure changeMichael Phelps routine has nothing to do with swimming, but it's related to his success""It may be hard to fire someone who's been working for the company for so long, but not for me. Our values dictated how to act."" He fired himself.The director changed named parking spots in the parking lot. Whoever gets to work earlier will get the best spot. Every person matter. -- whatever getting to work earlier, but every person matter makes total senseStudies show that willpower is the single most important habit that contributes to people's successStarbucks had to invest in creating an environment where it would be ok to pay $5 for a coffeeYet another book mentioning the marshmallow studyWillpower is like a muscle, and you have to exercise it. It's a finite resource. If you want to do something that requires willpower you better do it in the morning or conserve your willpower for the nightIt's important so sign children to piano (or anything else) lessons because it teaches them the willpower to study, not just piano itself""We're not in the coffee business serving people. We're in the people business serving coffee"", Starbucks former presidentWhen people are doing things that require willpower, and they feel doing it for themselves or helping someone else, it is less taxing on their willpower. If they feel they are just following orders, it will require a lot more willpower to get the job doneIf a company doesn't cultivate habits to build a good culture, it will still emerge but in a disorganized way.You usually turn right when you enter the supermarketOur brain likes to listen to songs that seem familiar, and this is what makes a big hit.If you dress a new something into an old habit, it's easier for people to accept it (hey ya example)Martin Luther King Jr movement was also based on social habits, strong and weak connections, and peer pressure. It was created in a way where many people agreed, and others will feel bad or ""against it"" if they did not participate (after all, they support it, but some were just not committed enough and could drop it without peer pressure)To political movements to succeed, people have to change their habits. Their identities have to change.Near misses in a slot machine (and possibly other places) are very addictive for the brain, especially for those sensitive to gamblingOnce you know a bad habit exists, you have the freedom and responsibility to change it. You will be held accountable for it.This book provides a framework to understand how habits work and a guide on how they can be changedTo change a habit, find the cue reward, and routine, and then change the routine. Try some alternate routines keeping the same cue and reward. Take notes of your feelings right after the routine and reward. After 15 minutes, are you still craving for this habit? Example: buy a cookie every day. Try to buy different things or buy in different places to find the exact reward you want to have, and then keep the new routineTake notes of your cravings and what's the situation that triggered it: time, action, where, mood, etc. It will help you to identify the pattern"
131,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13036247-diana,4,"The Power of Habit is an absolutely fascinating book that explores how habits have the ability to affect virtually everything in our lives. To say humans are creatures of habit is an understatement. Think of all the things you do on a daily basis without even thinking about them! Charles Duhigg has compiled so much information in this book. We've all heard the phrase: Old habits are hard to break, well there is a reason for that as we learn in this book, but also, there are ways to change your habits with a bit of insight into what makes them habits in the first place. It was a little shocking to learn about how corporations have used this information to help drive sales. A lot of interesting information throughout. "
132,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645496-wai-yip-tung,1,"The Power of Habit is a plainly bad book. So bad that in half of the book, the author just don't know what he is talking about.By now I have identified this genre of non-fiction book I would call Malcolm Gladwell-esque, journalists packaged popular science or popular psychology books. They would write about a topic with some scientific basis, but often spiced up to look very much like they have discovered some secret formula of success. Unfortunately their literary skill gets far ahead of their analytic skill. The result is an illusion that dazzle people at the beginning. But ultimately turn out to have little substance.The thesis and the secret formula to success in this book is habit. Had Duhigg concentrate on the finding in science and neurological underpinning of personal habits, it would have been a mildly interesting book. Once he takes this thesis and apply it to organization and social level, it falls apart quickly.He write at length about how new habit introduced to corporation like Aloca is a huge success story that turned the company around. Mind you what he call organization's habit we usually refer as ""corporate culture"". If you have never suspected ""corporate culture"" could have effect on its performance then Duhigg's book would be a revelation for you. But to most people who have some business sense, Duhigg has add nothing to add to the familiar topic of corporate culture other than his spiced up anecdotes.The book reach its low point when he try to explain Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott incident. To drive the habit theme he use the term liberally in the passages, results in curious phrases like the habit of friendship? the habit of peer pressure? and the social habit of weak ties? 'Habit' has become an entirely meaningless buzzword. Had he dropped the term from the sentences, they would at least be understandable vocabularies like ""friendship"", ""peer pressure"" and ""weak ties"". ""Weak ties"", being a well known concept of social and network science, further expose Duhigg's weakness as he wrote about it at length and it shows he has a lot of misconception about the idea.Ultimately he story about the power of habit really have little predictive and discriminatory power. If the social structure of the black community (I can't bring myself to say social habit) of the Montgomery explains the Rosa Parks incident, then why is it such one-off event? Since the social structure is well established why isn't it deliver forceful activism all the time? And what about all other communities that have similar social structure to Montgomery? What evidence can you find that demonstrate the power of so call ""xxx"" habit in these other communities?(Review is base on reading of selected chapters)."
133,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,3,"In this book, Charles Duhigg takes a look at habits from a number of different perspectives - individual habits, like exercising or drinking, organizational habits, like how departments within corporations communicate with one another, and societal habits, such as those that can motivate individuals to undertake certain actions as a group. His thesis is that habits control a large part of behavior on all these levels. Habits can't be eliminated, he says, but by becoming conscious of them and taking certain steps, we can replace undesirable habits with more productive ones.It's an interesting theory, and he fleshes it out with a number of intriguing anecdotes. While the stories he tells are all quite fascinating in their own light, however, I don't feel they illustrated his points quite as successfully as he thinks they do. Take, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous. He highlights the group as an example of a system that creates habit change. And while it certainly has been successful for some members, its high failure rates undermine Duhigg's thesis even as he presents it. Duhigg amends his thesis to account for this failure with the idea that those engaging in habit change need to believe in what they are doing in order for it to work long term. Yet I don't think it would be too hard to find people who have fallen off the wagon despite their belief in the program.Throughout numerous other examples, Duhigg continually assumes correlation equals causation and gives credit in places I don't believe is necessarily due. For this reason, the book isn't as solid as it could be. That said, however, the stories he tells about how change was facilitated by individuals and organizations are very thought-provoking and I definitely learned some things by reading them; the story of how a new CEO transformed the giant corporation Alcoa by focusing on worker safety was particularly interesting. In the appendix, Duhigg does acknowledge that there really isn't one specific way to create habit change, and doing it effectively is going to depend on the habit and the person or system involved. If one can accept that changing habits isn't as simple as he tries to make it sound earlier in the book, there may be useful information here."

It was a pretty long book, definitely a re-read.Notes:- If you remove certain arts of the brain it can effect memory, and tasks, habits don't rely on memory parts of the brain which is interesting - the brains basal ganglia basically is the habit forming/storing area- habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort - it's like a computer cache system, if it loads a page it remembers the page so it doesn't have to load it from scratch again - we can devote mental energy to new ideas and concepts etc- Habits are formed by cravings, there's a cue, a routine, and a reward- People crave the tingly feeling of minty toothpaste because it makes them think the product has done something, that it has had an effect. Fabreeze has the fresh smell at the end of your cleaning which creates a craving for that scent and that feeling of accomplishment - “It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re halfway to changing it”- “We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted. But that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”- Willpower is a muscle, you can use it all up for the day and it will become exhausted- Starbucks allowed autonomy among their employee's and this increased morale"

Why and how we do things by force of habit was interesting enough, but being tracked by retailers to determine buying habits so they can target your needs and cravings was a real eye-opener! Target is the retailer exampled in this book, which makes you wonder why they chose that name. And apparently even gambling casinos can keep track of habitual gamblers and use their addiction to keep them coming back for more. The author takes a complicated subject with a lot of scientific study available, and makes it simple and entertaining enough for any reader. The 4 star rating is for the things I learned through reading this book that I never knew before. The social habits that fed the Montgomery bus boycotts after Rosa Parks arrest in 1955 were mind blowing. This is quite a read."

I got tired of that so I picked up a used copy at Powell's Books in Portland last month when I was there. That being said, I really liked this book. I wanted to read it because I thought it might help me change some of my bad habits into good ones. However, I found the part about businesses, especially retail, and how they look at consumer buying habits to be quite interesting. I also thought the part about music and how music companies determine what will be a hit and what won't to be of even more interest. I will be wondering about it the next time my favorite song comes on the radio!There is a section on social movements.

I felt this strongly with the power of habit. The anecdotes were good but they did not flesh out the premise of book nor did it appear that the author made enough ""statements"" to provide any substance here. The thing that this book has going for it is that most of us don't really think about our habits and how they affect business or ourselves. This book gave an excuse for the reader to mentally explore their own habits and those that govern larger organizations to which they might belong, but reading the book may not have been necessary to get there. Probably could have done it after a 3-4page convincing article. Just saying. "

What could have been a very dry topic on our scientific responses and why we implement good/bad habits in our life, ended up being an absolutely fascinating piece. The book tackles everything from how DJ's get us to listen to certain music, to how businesses use surveys to control our habits (again, both good and bad), and even how brands target consumers to make their products a part of our routines when they had never existed before. The end of the book offers valuable advice on how to break bad habits by identifying your habit loop and how to get the good stuff back in your life.

If you want to change a habit, lose weight, quit smoking, change drinking habits, read this book. It describes patterns and habits that shape our lives, and, if we can learn to recognize the cues, it's the first step toward shaping those patterns into the habits of a life we want to live.In addition to personal habits, the book delves into social group habits--what shapes the habits of people who act as a group.

150,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65764-lana,4,"I read this book after reading its overall message in article form. Duhigg makes the claim that habits are everything, and then offers ways to change them in order to improve your life. This is not schlocky self-help- the tone is a little more subdued and a little more academic than most books of that nature. He can make habit-changing seem facile at times, which is eyebrow-raising when he's talking about addiction and addictive behavior, but he does come back at the end to point out that while understanding how to change habits is easy, changing them does require hard work, dedication, and time. Less easy. This is shown when the author attempts to change a simple habit- eating a cookie every day- and has to go through over a week of experimentation to identify the cue and reward, and then switch the habit. One point that I did not expect to see is about the power of belief- new habits only stick through times of stress and pressure if the person believes- in the reason for change or in the fact that that change is possible. Old habits *do* die hard- in fact, they never die at all. The patterns your brain learns are always going to be in there. Another useful piece of information was about cues- it may sound easy, but identifying the cues that your brain uses to decide when to go into autopilot can be very challenging. It is really interesting to pay attention to your own habits and see what cues you can identify, though. As a side note, the last non-fiction book I read also made a case of the Saddleback Church. (That book was Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.)"
151,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5031502-dani-shuping,4,"“The Power of Habit” is one of those rare books that I started recommending before I even finished it. Charles Duhigg writes a practical book that pulls from multiple sources to explain how habits work, how they’re developed, how they’re formed in the brain, and how we might go about transforming them. Written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell’s books, Charles translates scientific language into clear, concise, and easy to understand for the average reader. He breaks the book down into three main sections--”The Habits of Individuals,” “The Habits of Successful Organizations,” and “The Habits of Societies”--and provides clear examples to back up what he’s written and his examples cover a wide range. For example, he writes about how Tony Dungy changed habits of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to mold them into a winning football team. And he talks about how the former CEO of ALECO championed safety in order to increase company profits. This is a book that anyone, anywhere can get something out of. While Duhigg doesn’t provide specifics of how to change habits in my ARC, (there will be an appendix in the final addition that may do so) there is still ample evidence in the examples of things that you can do and think about as ways to change/modify the habits you’ve built over a lifetime. Overall this is a fascinating book that made me think more about why I do what I do and how I might be able to change it."
152,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217216-allan-elder,3,"The basics of this book are fascinating. The Habit Loop consists of a cue, which calls a routine, which seeks a reward. That is whole book. There is little reason to read the rest of it unless you like a lot examples of this loop. Unfortunately, the book does not really explore the science of habits and absolutely, completely, ignores the research on behaviorism which explains the entire premise of the book. The science of behaviorism, while not popular, covers this material in a way that is actionable. Look at the ""amazing"" discovery of cue, routine, and reward and compare it the decades old behavioral idea of Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence (the ABCs). Duhigg, identifies the habits as ""That psychology was grounded in two basic rules: First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards."" He then spends the next dozen pages with examples from commercials. If you understand the ""ABCs"" then the book holds little value (unless you like stories). Jump to the Appendix ""A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas"" and read it only. It covers everything discussed in the book but at least gives a hint about using the habit concept for change. The advice? Identify the routine, experiment with satisfying rewards, isolate the cue, and have a plan. That's it. If it matters, my review is based on the Kindle edition."
153,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118210-sarah,4,"Very interesting. Duhigg’s breakdown of the habit cycle ( Cue —> Routine —> Reward) is simple but it doesn’t follow that it’s easy just to change the routine. Sadly (for me) there is no magical formula to stop wasting time/exercise more/take vitamins/eat better, but it did confirm that breaking bad habits and forming better ones is really hard to do, so hooray for validation. Personally I found the section on the habits of successful organizations the most interesting. Duhigg cites research showing that an organization's routines function as habits, and these can either create success or result in thoughtless risk, waste and danger (depending on the industry). Similar to French pop culture child-raising notions (where parents must enforce a non-negotiable cadre within which a child has vast freedom), successful employees have considerable choice within their daily work lives (choice about shifts, uniforms, etc. lead to far greater productivity), but only so long as there is a clear ultimate decision maker. A “keystone” organizational habit (e.g., Alcoa’s prioritizing workplace safety above all else) can lead to higher quality and output by fostering subsequent habits of ownership and accountability. "
154,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63015728-ian-d,2,"Though the central idea is not uninteresting (quite the contrary), the writing leaves a lot to be desired: too many anecdotal facts, presented in a non-linear, incohesive way. All in all, the book could have easily been 200 pages shorter and that would have made it a more enjoyable read.Still, a lot of things to consider about building and reprogramming our daily routine. Unfortunately, being concise was not one of the writer's main habits. Neither was the editor's.If I could summarise it in one phrase, that would be it:""Water is the most apt analogy for how a habit works. Water hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, the path traced by itself before.You now know how to redirect that path. You now have the power to swim."""

160,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38970458-willian-molinari,5,"Read this book for the first time in 2016 and re-read it now (2019). The first time I read it, I did not take notes, so I decided to ""properly read/listen"" now.I like the number of studies this book shows and how much we understand about our habits by looking at its results. Some of these studies are already debunked by science (like the marshmallow study), but it's still a great book.At the end of the book, the author provides some examples of how you can use the content of the book to apply to your habits. The goal of this book is not to give you a step-by-step guide on how to change your habits, but to show you how they work. Your cues and rewards are unique, and you have to understand yourself to deal with them.I will keep this piece of the review here. I wrote it in 2016 right after adopting my dog:I'm training a little dog now, and it's really impressive to see how we made some habits for him. It became natural for the dog pee on a specific place, for example. The important part is to keep the same cue, routine, and reward. :)My dog is three years old now. :)Here are my notes for this book:More than 40% of actions people perform every day are not actual decisions but habits according to paper by Duke University in 2006Removing food from the plaza where a group unites was a good way of not keeping them there. When people start to get hungry, they go somewhere elseThe research was done with Eugene, known as EP in the medical literatureThe basal ganglia stores habits in the brainThe brain is continually looking for ways to reduce effort -- it seems to be the same idea exposed by thinking fast and slow :)Patients with basal ganglia damage can't get basic feelings because they don't understand simple face recognitions (they don't know where to focus)Whin cues come out of order or in a different shape, they are not recognized, and the habit is not started. The cue starts the need for a reward and the craving for the routine to achieve it. That's one of the reasons why cellphone notifications are so difficult to resistSome people say they like to workout because of the feeling of endorphins, others because of the sense of accomplishment when tracking their results -- I'm at the gym now, and I'm not sure what motivates me. Maybe keeping my routine? (PS. I'm not too fond of the gym environment, but it's ok now)... oooh... Got it, it's the audiobooks! :)The breeze by P&G was created as a great product to remove odor. In the end, they found out that no one wants to admit that their house stinks, so there's no cue. They transformed the product into something else that smells good and created another cue at the end of cleaning. Tne product got millions of revenue. -- yeah... In the end, it's all about money.The cravings drive the habit loop. You need to feel the need for something to power the habitA football trainer (buccaneers) applied a habit-changing routine to his players for years. This training made players not think in certain situations, but apply habits instead, which is faster. -- it reminds me about playing drums. Sometimes I don't know how I'm playing, I just start, and the rhythm takes care of itselfBelief is important. It doesn't have to be God, but you have to believe that you will get through stressful moments when your routine is not working""Some football teams are not teams; they are just guys who work together"" -- saw that more than once but with developersChanging one habit may chain many other reactions and enhancements. Like changing safety may increase profits and communication. One habit change sometimes requires a whole infrastructure changeMichael Phelps routine has nothing to do with swimming, but it's related to his success""It may be hard to fire someone who's been working for the company for so long, but not for me. Our values dictated how to act."" He fired himself.The director changed named parking spots in the parking lot. Whoever gets to work earlier will get the best spot. Every person matter. -- whatever getting to work earlier, but every person matter makes total senseStudies show that willpower is the single most important habit that contributes to people's successStarbucks had to invest in creating an environment where it would be ok to pay $5 for a coffeeYet another book mentioning the marshmallow studyWillpower is like a muscle, and you have to exercise it. It's a finite resource. If you want to do something that requires willpower you better do it in the morning or conserve your willpower for the nightIt's important so sign children to piano (or anything else) lessons because it teaches them the willpower to study, not just piano itself""We're not in the coffee business serving people. We're in the people business serving coffee"", Starbucks former presidentWhen people are doing things that require willpower, and they feel doing it for themselves or helping someone else, it is less taxing on their willpower. If they feel they are just following orders, it will require a lot more willpower to get the job doneIf a company doesn't cultivate habits to build a good culture, it will still emerge but in a disorganized way.You usually turn right when you enter the supermarketOur brain likes to listen to songs that seem familiar, and this is what makes a big hit.If you dress a new something into an old habit, it's easier for people to accept it (hey ya example)Martin Luther King Jr movement was also based on social habits, strong and weak connections, and peer pressure. It was created in a way where many people agreed, and others will feel bad or ""against it"" if they did not participate (after all, they support it, but some were just not committed enough and could drop it without peer pressure)To political movements to succeed, people have to change their habits. Their identities have to change.Near misses in a slot machine (and possibly other places) are very addictive for the brain, especially for those sensitive to gamblingOnce you know a bad habit exists, you have the freedom and responsibility to change it. You will be held accountable for it.This book provides a framework to understand how habits work and a guide on how they can be changedTo change a habit, find the cue reward, and routine, and then change the routine. Try some alternate routines keeping the same cue and reward. Take notes of your feelings right after the routine and reward. After 15 minutes, are you still craving for this habit? Example: buy a cookie every day. Try to buy different things or buy in different places to find the exact reward you want to have, and then keep the new routineTake notes of your cravings and what's the situation that triggered it: time, action, where, mood, etc. It will help you to identify the pattern"
161,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13036247-diana,4,"The Power of Habit is an absolutely fascinating book that explores how habits have the ability to affect virtually everything in our lives. To say humans are creatures of habit is an understatement. Think of all the things you do on a daily basis without even thinking about them! Charles Duhigg has compiled so much information in this book. We've all heard the phrase: Old habits are hard to break, well there is a reason for that as we learn in this book, but also, there are ways to change your habits with a bit of insight into what makes them habits in the first place. It was a little shocking to learn about how corporations have used this information to help drive sales. A lot of interesting information throughout. "
162,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645496-wai-yip-tung,1,"The Power of Habit is a plainly bad book. So bad that in half of the book, the author just don't know what he is talking about.By now I have identified this genre of non-fiction book I would call Malcolm Gladwell-esque, journalists packaged popular science or popular psychology books. They would write about a topic with some scientific basis, but often spiced up to look very much like they have discovered some secret formula of success. Unfortunately their literary skill gets far ahead of their analytic skill. The result is an illusion that dazzle people at the beginning. But ultimately turn out to have little substance.The thesis and the secret formula to success in this book is habit. Had Duhigg concentrate on the finding in science and neurological underpinning of personal habits, it would have been a mildly interesting book. Once he takes this thesis and apply it to organization and social level, it falls apart quickly.He write at length about how new habit introduced to corporation like Aloca is a huge success story that turned the company around. Mind you what he call organization's habit we usually refer as ""corporate culture"". If you have never suspected ""corporate culture"" could have effect on its performance then Duhigg's book would be a revelation for you. But to most people who have some business sense, Duhigg has add nothing to add to the familiar topic of corporate culture other than his spiced up anecdotes.The book reach its low point when he try to explain Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott incident. To drive the habit theme he use the term liberally in the passages, results in curious phrases like the habit of friendship? the habit of peer pressure? and the social habit of weak ties? 'Habit' has become an entirely meaningless buzzword. Had he dropped the term from the sentences, they would at least be understandable vocabularies like ""friendship"", ""peer pressure"" and ""weak ties"". ""Weak ties"", being a well known concept of social and network science, further expose Duhigg's weakness as he wrote about it at length and it shows he has a lot of misconception about the idea.Ultimately he story about the power of habit really have little predictive and discriminatory power. If the social structure of the black community (I can't bring myself to say social habit) of the Montgomery explains the Rosa Parks incident, then why is it such one-off event? Since the social structure is well established why isn't it deliver forceful activism all the time? And what about all other communities that have similar social structure to Montgomery? What evidence can you find that demonstrate the power of so call ""xxx"" habit in these other communities?(Review is base on reading of selected chapters)."
163,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,3,"In this book, Charles Duhigg takes a look at habits from a number of different perspectives - individual habits, like exercising or drinking, organizational habits, like how departments within corporations communicate with one another, and societal habits, such as those that can motivate individuals to undertake certain actions as a group. His thesis is that habits control a large part of behavior on all these levels. Habits can't be eliminated, he says, but by becoming conscious of them and taking certain steps, we can replace undesirable habits with more productive ones.It's an interesting theory, and he fleshes it out with a number of intriguing anecdotes. While the stories he tells are all quite fascinating in their own light, however, I don't feel they illustrated his points quite as successfully as he thinks they do. Take, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous. He highlights the group as an example of a system that creates habit change. And while it certainly has been successful for some members, its high failure rates undermine Duhigg's thesis even as he presents it. Duhigg amends his thesis to account for this failure with the idea that those engaging in habit change need to believe in what they are doing in order for it to work long term. Yet I don't think it would be too hard to find people who have fallen off the wagon despite their belief in the program.Throughout numerous other examples, Duhigg continually assumes correlation equals causation and gives credit in places I don't believe is necessarily due. For this reason, the book isn't as solid as it could be. That said, however, the stories he tells about how change was facilitated by individuals and organizations are very thought-provoking and I definitely learned some things by reading them; the story of how a new CEO transformed the giant corporation Alcoa by focusing on worker safety was particularly interesting. In the appendix, Duhigg does acknowledge that there really isn't one specific way to create habit change, and doing it effectively is going to depend on the habit and the person or system involved. If one can accept that changing habits isn't as simple as he tries to make it sound earlier in the book, there may be useful information here."

It was a pretty long book, definitely a re-read.Notes:- If you remove certain arts of the brain it can effect memory, and tasks, habits don't rely on memory parts of the brain which is interesting - the brains basal ganglia basically is the habit forming/storing area- habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort - it's like a computer cache system, if it loads a page it remembers the page so it doesn't have to load it from scratch again - we can devote mental energy to new ideas and concepts etc- Habits are formed by cravings, there's a cue, a routine, and a reward- People crave the tingly feeling of minty toothpaste because it makes them think the product has done something, that it has had an effect. Fabreeze has the fresh smell at the end of your cleaning which creates a craving for that scent and that feeling of accomplishment - “It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re halfway to changing it”- “We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted. But that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”- Willpower is a muscle, you can use it all up for the day and it will become exhausted- Starbucks allowed autonomy among their employee's and this increased morale"

Why and how we do things by force of habit was interesting enough, but being tracked by retailers to determine buying habits so they can target your needs and cravings was a real eye-opener! Target is the retailer exampled in this book, which makes you wonder why they chose that name. And apparently even gambling casinos can keep track of habitual gamblers and use their addiction to keep them coming back for more. The author takes a complicated subject with a lot of scientific study available, and makes it simple and entertaining enough for any reader. The 4 star rating is for the things I learned through reading this book that I never knew before. The social habits that fed the Montgomery bus boycotts after Rosa Parks arrest in 1955 were mind blowing. This is quite a read."

I got tired of that so I picked up a used copy at Powell's Books in Portland last month when I was there. That being said, I really liked this book. I wanted to read it because I thought it might help me change some of my bad habits into good ones. However, I found the part about businesses, especially retail, and how they look at consumer buying habits to be quite interesting. I also thought the part about music and how music companies determine what will be a hit and what won't to be of even more interest. I will be wondering about it the next time my favorite song comes on the radio!There is a section on social movements.

I felt this strongly with the power of habit. The anecdotes were good but they did not flesh out the premise of book nor did it appear that the author made enough ""statements"" to provide any substance here. The thing that this book has going for it is that most of us don't really think about our habits and how they affect business or ourselves. This book gave an excuse for the reader to mentally explore their own habits and those that govern larger organizations to which they might belong, but reading the book may not have been necessary to get there. Probably could have done it after a 3-4page convincing article. Just saying. "

What could have been a very dry topic on our scientific responses and why we implement good/bad habits in our life, ended up being an absolutely fascinating piece. The book tackles everything from how DJ's get us to listen to certain music, to how businesses use surveys to control our habits (again, both good and bad), and even how brands target consumers to make their products a part of our routines when they had never existed before. The end of the book offers valuable advice on how to break bad habits by identifying your habit loop and how to get the good stuff back in your life.

If you want to change a habit, lose weight, quit smoking, change drinking habits, read this book. It describes patterns and habits that shape our lives, and, if we can learn to recognize the cues, it's the first step toward shaping those patterns into the habits of a life we want to live.In addition to personal habits, the book delves into social group habits--what shapes the habits of people who act as a group.

180,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65764-lana,4,"I read this book after reading its overall message in article form. Duhigg makes the claim that habits are everything, and then offers ways to change them in order to improve your life. This is not schlocky self-help- the tone is a little more subdued and a little more academic than most books of that nature. He can make habit-changing seem facile at times, which is eyebrow-raising when he's talking about addiction and addictive behavior, but he does come back at the end to point out that while understanding how to change habits is easy, changing them does require hard work, dedication, and time. Less easy. This is shown when the author attempts to change a simple habit- eating a cookie every day- and has to go through over a week of experimentation to identify the cue and reward, and then switch the habit. One point that I did not expect to see is about the power of belief- new habits only stick through times of stress and pressure if the person believes- in the reason for change or in the fact that that change is possible. Old habits *do* die hard- in fact, they never die at all. The patterns your brain learns are always going to be in there. Another useful piece of information was about cues- it may sound easy, but identifying the cues that your brain uses to decide when to go into autopilot can be very challenging. It is really interesting to pay attention to your own habits and see what cues you can identify, though. As a side note, the last non-fiction book I read also made a case of the Saddleback Church. (That book was Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.)"
181,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5031502-dani-shuping,4,"“The Power of Habit” is one of those rare books that I started recommending before I even finished it. Charles Duhigg writes a practical book that pulls from multiple sources to explain how habits work, how they’re developed, how they’re formed in the brain, and how we might go about transforming them. Written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell’s books, Charles translates scientific language into clear, concise, and easy to understand for the average reader. He breaks the book down into three main sections--”The Habits of Individuals,” “The Habits of Successful Organizations,” and “The Habits of Societies”--and provides clear examples to back up what he’s written and his examples cover a wide range. For example, he writes about how Tony Dungy changed habits of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to mold them into a winning football team. And he talks about how the former CEO of ALECO championed safety in order to increase company profits. This is a book that anyone, anywhere can get something out of. While Duhigg doesn’t provide specifics of how to change habits in my ARC, (there will be an appendix in the final addition that may do so) there is still ample evidence in the examples of things that you can do and think about as ways to change/modify the habits you’ve built over a lifetime. Overall this is a fascinating book that made me think more about why I do what I do and how I might be able to change it."
182,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217216-allan-elder,3,"The basics of this book are fascinating. The Habit Loop consists of a cue, which calls a routine, which seeks a reward. That is whole book. There is little reason to read the rest of it unless you like a lot examples of this loop. Unfortunately, the book does not really explore the science of habits and absolutely, completely, ignores the research on behaviorism which explains the entire premise of the book. The science of behaviorism, while not popular, covers this material in a way that is actionable. Look at the ""amazing"" discovery of cue, routine, and reward and compare it the decades old behavioral idea of Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence (the ABCs). Duhigg, identifies the habits as ""That psychology was grounded in two basic rules: First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards."" He then spends the next dozen pages with examples from commercials. If you understand the ""ABCs"" then the book holds little value (unless you like stories). Jump to the Appendix ""A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas"" and read it only. It covers everything discussed in the book but at least gives a hint about using the habit concept for change. The advice? Identify the routine, experiment with satisfying rewards, isolate the cue, and have a plan. That's it. If it matters, my review is based on the Kindle edition."
183,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118210-sarah,4,"Very interesting. Duhigg’s breakdown of the habit cycle ( Cue —> Routine —> Reward) is simple but it doesn’t follow that it’s easy just to change the routine. Sadly (for me) there is no magical formula to stop wasting time/exercise more/take vitamins/eat better, but it did confirm that breaking bad habits and forming better ones is really hard to do, so hooray for validation. Personally I found the section on the habits of successful organizations the most interesting. Duhigg cites research showing that an organization's routines function as habits, and these can either create success or result in thoughtless risk, waste and danger (depending on the industry). Similar to French pop culture child-raising notions (where parents must enforce a non-negotiable cadre within which a child has vast freedom), successful employees have considerable choice within their daily work lives (choice about shifts, uniforms, etc. lead to far greater productivity), but only so long as there is a clear ultimate decision maker. A “keystone” organizational habit (e.g., Alcoa’s prioritizing workplace safety above all else) can lead to higher quality and output by fostering subsequent habits of ownership and accountability. "
184,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63015728-ian-d,2,"Though the central idea is not uninteresting (quite the contrary), the writing leaves a lot to be desired: too many anecdotal facts, presented in a non-linear, incohesive way. All in all, the book could have easily been 200 pages shorter and that would have made it a more enjoyable read.Still, a lot of things to consider about building and reprogramming our daily routine. Unfortunately, being concise was not one of the writer's main habits. Neither was the editor's.If I could summarise it in one phrase, that would be it:""Water is the most apt analogy for how a habit works. Water hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, the path traced by itself before.You now know how to redirect that path. You now have the power to swim."""

190,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38970458-willian-molinari,5,"Read this book for the first time in 2016 and re-read it now (2019). The first time I read it, I did not take notes, so I decided to ""properly read/listen"" now.I like the number of studies this book shows and how much we understand about our habits by looking at its results. Some of these studies are already debunked by science (like the marshmallow study), but it's still a great book.At the end of the book, the author provides some examples of how you can use the content of the book to apply to your habits. The goal of this book is not to give you a step-by-step guide on how to change your habits, but to show you how they work. Your cues and rewards are unique, and you have to understand yourself to deal with them.I will keep this piece of the review here. I wrote it in 2016 right after adopting my dog:I'm training a little dog now, and it's really impressive to see how we made some habits for him. It became natural for the dog pee on a specific place, for example. The important part is to keep the same cue, routine, and reward. :)My dog is three years old now. :)Here are my notes for this book:More than 40% of actions people perform every day are not actual decisions but habits according to paper by Duke University in 2006Removing food from the plaza where a group unites was a good way of not keeping them there. When people start to get hungry, they go somewhere elseThe research was done with Eugene, known as EP in the medical literatureThe basal ganglia stores habits in the brainThe brain is continually looking for ways to reduce effort -- it seems to be the same idea exposed by thinking fast and slow :)Patients with basal ganglia damage can't get basic feelings because they don't understand simple face recognitions (they don't know where to focus)Whin cues come out of order or in a different shape, they are not recognized, and the habit is not started. The cue starts the need for a reward and the craving for the routine to achieve it. That's one of the reasons why cellphone notifications are so difficult to resistSome people say they like to workout because of the feeling of endorphins, others because of the sense of accomplishment when tracking their results -- I'm at the gym now, and I'm not sure what motivates me. Maybe keeping my routine? (PS. I'm not too fond of the gym environment, but it's ok now)... oooh... Got it, it's the audiobooks! :)The breeze by P&G was created as a great product to remove odor. In the end, they found out that no one wants to admit that their house stinks, so there's no cue. They transformed the product into something else that smells good and created another cue at the end of cleaning. Tne product got millions of revenue. -- yeah... In the end, it's all about money.The cravings drive the habit loop. You need to feel the need for something to power the habitA football trainer (buccaneers) applied a habit-changing routine to his players for years. This training made players not think in certain situations, but apply habits instead, which is faster. -- it reminds me about playing drums. Sometimes I don't know how I'm playing, I just start, and the rhythm takes care of itselfBelief is important. It doesn't have to be God, but you have to believe that you will get through stressful moments when your routine is not working""Some football teams are not teams; they are just guys who work together"" -- saw that more than once but with developersChanging one habit may chain many other reactions and enhancements. Like changing safety may increase profits and communication. One habit change sometimes requires a whole infrastructure changeMichael Phelps routine has nothing to do with swimming, but it's related to his success""It may be hard to fire someone who's been working for the company for so long, but not for me. Our values dictated how to act."" He fired himself.The director changed named parking spots in the parking lot. Whoever gets to work earlier will get the best spot. Every person matter. -- whatever getting to work earlier, but every person matter makes total senseStudies show that willpower is the single most important habit that contributes to people's successStarbucks had to invest in creating an environment where it would be ok to pay $5 for a coffeeYet another book mentioning the marshmallow studyWillpower is like a muscle, and you have to exercise it. It's a finite resource. If you want to do something that requires willpower you better do it in the morning or conserve your willpower for the nightIt's important so sign children to piano (or anything else) lessons because it teaches them the willpower to study, not just piano itself""We're not in the coffee business serving people. We're in the people business serving coffee"", Starbucks former presidentWhen people are doing things that require willpower, and they feel doing it for themselves or helping someone else, it is less taxing on their willpower. If they feel they are just following orders, it will require a lot more willpower to get the job doneIf a company doesn't cultivate habits to build a good culture, it will still emerge but in a disorganized way.You usually turn right when you enter the supermarketOur brain likes to listen to songs that seem familiar, and this is what makes a big hit.If you dress a new something into an old habit, it's easier for people to accept it (hey ya example)Martin Luther King Jr movement was also based on social habits, strong and weak connections, and peer pressure. It was created in a way where many people agreed, and others will feel bad or ""against it"" if they did not participate (after all, they support it, but some were just not committed enough and could drop it without peer pressure)To political movements to succeed, people have to change their habits. Their identities have to change.Near misses in a slot machine (and possibly other places) are very addictive for the brain, especially for those sensitive to gamblingOnce you know a bad habit exists, you have the freedom and responsibility to change it. You will be held accountable for it.This book provides a framework to understand how habits work and a guide on how they can be changedTo change a habit, find the cue reward, and routine, and then change the routine. Try some alternate routines keeping the same cue and reward. Take notes of your feelings right after the routine and reward. After 15 minutes, are you still craving for this habit? Example: buy a cookie every day. Try to buy different things or buy in different places to find the exact reward you want to have, and then keep the new routineTake notes of your cravings and what's the situation that triggered it: time, action, where, mood, etc. It will help you to identify the pattern"
191,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13036247-diana,4,"The Power of Habit is an absolutely fascinating book that explores how habits have the ability to affect virtually everything in our lives. To say humans are creatures of habit is an understatement. Think of all the things you do on a daily basis without even thinking about them! Charles Duhigg has compiled so much information in this book. We've all heard the phrase: Old habits are hard to break, well there is a reason for that as we learn in this book, but also, there are ways to change your habits with a bit of insight into what makes them habits in the first place. It was a little shocking to learn about how corporations have used this information to help drive sales. A lot of interesting information throughout. "
192,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645496-wai-yip-tung,1,"The Power of Habit is a plainly bad book. So bad that in half of the book, the author just don't know what he is talking about.By now I have identified this genre of non-fiction book I would call Malcolm Gladwell-esque, journalists packaged popular science or popular psychology books. They would write about a topic with some scientific basis, but often spiced up to look very much like they have discovered some secret formula of success. Unfortunately their literary skill gets far ahead of their analytic skill. The result is an illusion that dazzle people at the beginning. But ultimately turn out to have little substance.The thesis and the secret formula to success in this book is habit. Had Duhigg concentrate on the finding in science and neurological underpinning of personal habits, it would have been a mildly interesting book. Once he takes this thesis and apply it to organization and social level, it falls apart quickly.He write at length about how new habit introduced to corporation like Aloca is a huge success story that turned the company around. Mind you what he call organization's habit we usually refer as ""corporate culture"". If you have never suspected ""corporate culture"" could have effect on its performance then Duhigg's book would be a revelation for you. But to most people who have some business sense, Duhigg has add nothing to add to the familiar topic of corporate culture other than his spiced up anecdotes.The book reach its low point when he try to explain Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott incident. To drive the habit theme he use the term liberally in the passages, results in curious phrases like the habit of friendship? the habit of peer pressure? and the social habit of weak ties? 'Habit' has become an entirely meaningless buzzword. Had he dropped the term from the sentences, they would at least be understandable vocabularies like ""friendship"", ""peer pressure"" and ""weak ties"". ""Weak ties"", being a well known concept of social and network science, further expose Duhigg's weakness as he wrote about it at length and it shows he has a lot of misconception about the idea.Ultimately he story about the power of habit really have little predictive and discriminatory power. If the social structure of the black community (I can't bring myself to say social habit) of the Montgomery explains the Rosa Parks incident, then why is it such one-off event? Since the social structure is well established why isn't it deliver forceful activism all the time? And what about all other communities that have similar social structure to Montgomery? What evidence can you find that demonstrate the power of so call ""xxx"" habit in these other communities?(Review is base on reading of selected chapters)."
193,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,3,"In this book, Charles Duhigg takes a look at habits from a number of different perspectives - individual habits, like exercising or drinking, organizational habits, like how departments within corporations communicate with one another, and societal habits, such as those that can motivate individuals to undertake certain actions as a group. His thesis is that habits control a large part of behavior on all these levels. Habits can't be eliminated, he says, but by becoming conscious of them and taking certain steps, we can replace undesirable habits with more productive ones.It's an interesting theory, and he fleshes it out with a number of intriguing anecdotes. While the stories he tells are all quite fascinating in their own light, however, I don't feel they illustrated his points quite as successfully as he thinks they do. Take, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous. He highlights the group as an example of a system that creates habit change. And while it certainly has been successful for some members, its high failure rates undermine Duhigg's thesis even as he presents it. Duhigg amends his thesis to account for this failure with the idea that those engaging in habit change need to believe in what they are doing in order for it to work long term. Yet I don't think it would be too hard to find people who have fallen off the wagon despite their belief in the program.Throughout numerous other examples, Duhigg continually assumes correlation equals causation and gives credit in places I don't believe is necessarily due. For this reason, the book isn't as solid as it could be. That said, however, the stories he tells about how change was facilitated by individuals and organizations are very thought-provoking and I definitely learned some things by reading them; the story of how a new CEO transformed the giant corporation Alcoa by focusing on worker safety was particularly interesting. In the appendix, Duhigg does acknowledge that there really isn't one specific way to create habit change, and doing it effectively is going to depend on the habit and the person or system involved. If one can accept that changing habits isn't as simple as he tries to make it sound earlier in the book, there may be useful information here."

It was a pretty long book, definitely a re-read.Notes:- If you remove certain arts of the brain it can effect memory, and tasks, habits don't rely on memory parts of the brain which is interesting - the brains basal ganglia basically is the habit forming/storing area- habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort - it's like a computer cache system, if it loads a page it remembers the page so it doesn't have to load it from scratch again - we can devote mental energy to new ideas and concepts etc- Habits are formed by cravings, there's a cue, a routine, and a reward- People crave the tingly feeling of minty toothpaste because it makes them think the product has done something, that it has had an effect. Fabreeze has the fresh smell at the end of your cleaning which creates a craving for that scent and that feeling of accomplishment - “It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re halfway to changing it”- “We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted. But that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”- Willpower is a muscle, you can use it all up for the day and it will become exhausted- Starbucks allowed autonomy among their employee's and this increased morale"

Why and how we do things by force of habit was interesting enough, but being tracked by retailers to determine buying habits so they can target your needs and cravings was a real eye-opener! Target is the retailer exampled in this book, which makes you wonder why they chose that name. And apparently even gambling casinos can keep track of habitual gamblers and use their addiction to keep them coming back for more. The author takes a complicated subject with a lot of scientific study available, and makes it simple and entertaining enough for any reader. The 4 star rating is for the things I learned through reading this book that I never knew before. The social habits that fed the Montgomery bus boycotts after Rosa Parks arrest in 1955 were mind blowing. This is quite a read."

I got tired of that so I picked up a used copy at Powell's Books in Portland last month when I was there. That being said, I really liked this book. I wanted to read it because I thought it might help me change some of my bad habits into good ones. However, I found the part about businesses, especially retail, and how they look at consumer buying habits to be quite interesting. I also thought the part about music and how music companies determine what will be a hit and what won't to be of even more interest. I will be wondering about it the next time my favorite song comes on the radio!There is a section on social movements.

I felt this strongly with the power of habit. The anecdotes were good but they did not flesh out the premise of book nor did it appear that the author made enough ""statements"" to provide any substance here. The thing that this book has going for it is that most of us don't really think about our habits and how they affect business or ourselves. This book gave an excuse for the reader to mentally explore their own habits and those that govern larger organizations to which they might belong, but reading the book may not have been necessary to get there. Probably could have done it after a 3-4page convincing article. Just saying. "

What could have been a very dry topic on our scientific responses and why we implement good/bad habits in our life, ended up being an absolutely fascinating piece. The book tackles everything from how DJ's get us to listen to certain music, to how businesses use surveys to control our habits (again, both good and bad), and even how brands target consumers to make their products a part of our routines when they had never existed before. The end of the book offers valuable advice on how to break bad habits by identifying your habit loop and how to get the good stuff back in your life.

If you want to change a habit, lose weight, quit smoking, change drinking habits, read this book. It describes patterns and habits that shape our lives, and, if we can learn to recognize the cues, it's the first step toward shaping those patterns into the habits of a life we want to live.In addition to personal habits, the book delves into social group habits--what shapes the habits of people who act as a group.

210,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65764-lana,4,"I read this book after reading its overall message in article form. Duhigg makes the claim that habits are everything, and then offers ways to change them in order to improve your life. This is not schlocky self-help- the tone is a little more subdued and a little more academic than most books of that nature. He can make habit-changing seem facile at times, which is eyebrow-raising when he's talking about addiction and addictive behavior, but he does come back at the end to point out that while understanding how to change habits is easy, changing them does require hard work, dedication, and time. Less easy. This is shown when the author attempts to change a simple habit- eating a cookie every day- and has to go through over a week of experimentation to identify the cue and reward, and then switch the habit. One point that I did not expect to see is about the power of belief- new habits only stick through times of stress and pressure if the person believes- in the reason for change or in the fact that that change is possible. Old habits *do* die hard- in fact, they never die at all. The patterns your brain learns are always going to be in there. Another useful piece of information was about cues- it may sound easy, but identifying the cues that your brain uses to decide when to go into autopilot can be very challenging. It is really interesting to pay attention to your own habits and see what cues you can identify, though. As a side note, the last non-fiction book I read also made a case of the Saddleback Church. (That book was Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.)"
211,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5031502-dani-shuping,4,"“The Power of Habit” is one of those rare books that I started recommending before I even finished it. Charles Duhigg writes a practical book that pulls from multiple sources to explain how habits work, how they’re developed, how they’re formed in the brain, and how we might go about transforming them. Written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell’s books, Charles translates scientific language into clear, concise, and easy to understand for the average reader. He breaks the book down into three main sections--”The Habits of Individuals,” “The Habits of Successful Organizations,” and “The Habits of Societies”--and provides clear examples to back up what he’s written and his examples cover a wide range. For example, he writes about how Tony Dungy changed habits of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to mold them into a winning football team. And he talks about how the former CEO of ALECO championed safety in order to increase company profits. This is a book that anyone, anywhere can get something out of. While Duhigg doesn’t provide specifics of how to change habits in my ARC, (there will be an appendix in the final addition that may do so) there is still ample evidence in the examples of things that you can do and think about as ways to change/modify the habits you’ve built over a lifetime. Overall this is a fascinating book that made me think more about why I do what I do and how I might be able to change it."
212,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217216-allan-elder,3,"The basics of this book are fascinating. The Habit Loop consists of a cue, which calls a routine, which seeks a reward. That is whole book. There is little reason to read the rest of it unless you like a lot examples of this loop. Unfortunately, the book does not really explore the science of habits and absolutely, completely, ignores the research on behaviorism which explains the entire premise of the book. The science of behaviorism, while not popular, covers this material in a way that is actionable. Look at the ""amazing"" discovery of cue, routine, and reward and compare it the decades old behavioral idea of Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence (the ABCs). Duhigg, identifies the habits as ""That psychology was grounded in two basic rules: First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards."" He then spends the next dozen pages with examples from commercials. If you understand the ""ABCs"" then the book holds little value (unless you like stories). Jump to the Appendix ""A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas"" and read it only. It covers everything discussed in the book but at least gives a hint about using the habit concept for change. The advice? Identify the routine, experiment with satisfying rewards, isolate the cue, and have a plan. That's it. If it matters, my review is based on the Kindle edition."
213,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118210-sarah,4,"Very interesting. Duhigg’s breakdown of the habit cycle ( Cue —> Routine —> Reward) is simple but it doesn’t follow that it’s easy just to change the routine. Sadly (for me) there is no magical formula to stop wasting time/exercise more/take vitamins/eat better, but it did confirm that breaking bad habits and forming better ones is really hard to do, so hooray for validation. Personally I found the section on the habits of successful organizations the most interesting. Duhigg cites research showing that an organization's routines function as habits, and these can either create success or result in thoughtless risk, waste and danger (depending on the industry). Similar to French pop culture child-raising notions (where parents must enforce a non-negotiable cadre within which a child has vast freedom), successful employees have considerable choice within their daily work lives (choice about shifts, uniforms, etc. lead to far greater productivity), but only so long as there is a clear ultimate decision maker. A “keystone” organizational habit (e.g., Alcoa’s prioritizing workplace safety above all else) can lead to higher quality and output by fostering subsequent habits of ownership and accountability. "
214,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63015728-ian-d,2,"Though the central idea is not uninteresting (quite the contrary), the writing leaves a lot to be desired: too many anecdotal facts, presented in a non-linear, incohesive way. All in all, the book could have easily been 200 pages shorter and that would have made it a more enjoyable read.Still, a lot of things to consider about building and reprogramming our daily routine. Unfortunately, being concise was not one of the writer's main habits. Neither was the editor's.If I could summarise it in one phrase, that would be it:""Water is the most apt analogy for how a habit works. Water hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, the path traced by itself before.You now know how to redirect that path. You now have the power to swim."""

220,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38970458-willian-molinari,5,"Read this book for the first time in 2016 and re-read it now (2019). The first time I read it, I did not take notes, so I decided to ""properly read/listen"" now.I like the number of studies this book shows and how much we understand about our habits by looking at its results. Some of these studies are already debunked by science (like the marshmallow study), but it's still a great book.At the end of the book, the author provides some examples of how you can use the content of the book to apply to your habits. The goal of this book is not to give you a step-by-step guide on how to change your habits, but to show you how they work. Your cues and rewards are unique, and you have to understand yourself to deal with them.I will keep this piece of the review here. I wrote it in 2016 right after adopting my dog:I'm training a little dog now, and it's really impressive to see how we made some habits for him. It became natural for the dog pee on a specific place, for example. The important part is to keep the same cue, routine, and reward. :)My dog is three years old now. :)Here are my notes for this book:More than 40% of actions people perform every day are not actual decisions but habits according to paper by Duke University in 2006Removing food from the plaza where a group unites was a good way of not keeping them there. When people start to get hungry, they go somewhere elseThe research was done with Eugene, known as EP in the medical literatureThe basal ganglia stores habits in the brainThe brain is continually looking for ways to reduce effort -- it seems to be the same idea exposed by thinking fast and slow :)Patients with basal ganglia damage can't get basic feelings because they don't understand simple face recognitions (they don't know where to focus)Whin cues come out of order or in a different shape, they are not recognized, and the habit is not started. The cue starts the need for a reward and the craving for the routine to achieve it. That's one of the reasons why cellphone notifications are so difficult to resistSome people say they like to workout because of the feeling of endorphins, others because of the sense of accomplishment when tracking their results -- I'm at the gym now, and I'm not sure what motivates me. Maybe keeping my routine? (PS. I'm not too fond of the gym environment, but it's ok now)... oooh... Got it, it's the audiobooks! :)The breeze by P&G was created as a great product to remove odor. In the end, they found out that no one wants to admit that their house stinks, so there's no cue. They transformed the product into something else that smells good and created another cue at the end of cleaning. Tne product got millions of revenue. -- yeah... In the end, it's all about money.The cravings drive the habit loop. You need to feel the need for something to power the habitA football trainer (buccaneers) applied a habit-changing routine to his players for years. This training made players not think in certain situations, but apply habits instead, which is faster. -- it reminds me about playing drums. Sometimes I don't know how I'm playing, I just start, and the rhythm takes care of itselfBelief is important. It doesn't have to be God, but you have to believe that you will get through stressful moments when your routine is not working""Some football teams are not teams; they are just guys who work together"" -- saw that more than once but with developersChanging one habit may chain many other reactions and enhancements. Like changing safety may increase profits and communication. One habit change sometimes requires a whole infrastructure changeMichael Phelps routine has nothing to do with swimming, but it's related to his success""It may be hard to fire someone who's been working for the company for so long, but not for me. Our values dictated how to act."" He fired himself.The director changed named parking spots in the parking lot. Whoever gets to work earlier will get the best spot. Every person matter. -- whatever getting to work earlier, but every person matter makes total senseStudies show that willpower is the single most important habit that contributes to people's successStarbucks had to invest in creating an environment where it would be ok to pay $5 for a coffeeYet another book mentioning the marshmallow studyWillpower is like a muscle, and you have to exercise it. It's a finite resource. If you want to do something that requires willpower you better do it in the morning or conserve your willpower for the nightIt's important so sign children to piano (or anything else) lessons because it teaches them the willpower to study, not just piano itself""We're not in the coffee business serving people. We're in the people business serving coffee"", Starbucks former presidentWhen people are doing things that require willpower, and they feel doing it for themselves or helping someone else, it is less taxing on their willpower. If they feel they are just following orders, it will require a lot more willpower to get the job doneIf a company doesn't cultivate habits to build a good culture, it will still emerge but in a disorganized way.You usually turn right when you enter the supermarketOur brain likes to listen to songs that seem familiar, and this is what makes a big hit.If you dress a new something into an old habit, it's easier for people to accept it (hey ya example)Martin Luther King Jr movement was also based on social habits, strong and weak connections, and peer pressure. It was created in a way where many people agreed, and others will feel bad or ""against it"" if they did not participate (after all, they support it, but some were just not committed enough and could drop it without peer pressure)To political movements to succeed, people have to change their habits. Their identities have to change.Near misses in a slot machine (and possibly other places) are very addictive for the brain, especially for those sensitive to gamblingOnce you know a bad habit exists, you have the freedom and responsibility to change it. You will be held accountable for it.This book provides a framework to understand how habits work and a guide on how they can be changedTo change a habit, find the cue reward, and routine, and then change the routine. Try some alternate routines keeping the same cue and reward. Take notes of your feelings right after the routine and reward. After 15 minutes, are you still craving for this habit? Example: buy a cookie every day. Try to buy different things or buy in different places to find the exact reward you want to have, and then keep the new routineTake notes of your cravings and what's the situation that triggered it: time, action, where, mood, etc. It will help you to identify the pattern"
221,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13036247-diana,4,"The Power of Habit is an absolutely fascinating book that explores how habits have the ability to affect virtually everything in our lives. To say humans are creatures of habit is an understatement. Think of all the things you do on a daily basis without even thinking about them! Charles Duhigg has compiled so much information in this book. We've all heard the phrase: Old habits are hard to break, well there is a reason for that as we learn in this book, but also, there are ways to change your habits with a bit of insight into what makes them habits in the first place. It was a little shocking to learn about how corporations have used this information to help drive sales. A lot of interesting information throughout. "
222,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645496-wai-yip-tung,1,"The Power of Habit is a plainly bad book. So bad that in half of the book, the author just don't know what he is talking about.By now I have identified this genre of non-fiction book I would call Malcolm Gladwell-esque, journalists packaged popular science or popular psychology books. They would write about a topic with some scientific basis, but often spiced up to look very much like they have discovered some secret formula of success. Unfortunately their literary skill gets far ahead of their analytic skill. The result is an illusion that dazzle people at the beginning. But ultimately turn out to have little substance.The thesis and the secret formula to success in this book is habit. Had Duhigg concentrate on the finding in science and neurological underpinning of personal habits, it would have been a mildly interesting book. Once he takes this thesis and apply it to organization and social level, it falls apart quickly.He write at length about how new habit introduced to corporation like Aloca is a huge success story that turned the company around. Mind you what he call organization's habit we usually refer as ""corporate culture"". If you have never suspected ""corporate culture"" could have effect on its performance then Duhigg's book would be a revelation for you. But to most people who have some business sense, Duhigg has add nothing to add to the familiar topic of corporate culture other than his spiced up anecdotes.The book reach its low point when he try to explain Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott incident. To drive the habit theme he use the term liberally in the passages, results in curious phrases like the habit of friendship? the habit of peer pressure? and the social habit of weak ties? 'Habit' has become an entirely meaningless buzzword. Had he dropped the term from the sentences, they would at least be understandable vocabularies like ""friendship"", ""peer pressure"" and ""weak ties"". ""Weak ties"", being a well known concept of social and network science, further expose Duhigg's weakness as he wrote about it at length and it shows he has a lot of misconception about the idea.Ultimately he story about the power of habit really have little predictive and discriminatory power. If the social structure of the black community (I can't bring myself to say social habit) of the Montgomery explains the Rosa Parks incident, then why is it such one-off event? Since the social structure is well established why isn't it deliver forceful activism all the time? And what about all other communities that have similar social structure to Montgomery? What evidence can you find that demonstrate the power of so call ""xxx"" habit in these other communities?(Review is base on reading of selected chapters)."
223,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,3,"In this book, Charles Duhigg takes a look at habits from a number of different perspectives - individual habits, like exercising or drinking, organizational habits, like how departments within corporations communicate with one another, and societal habits, such as those that can motivate individuals to undertake certain actions as a group. His thesis is that habits control a large part of behavior on all these levels. Habits can't be eliminated, he says, but by becoming conscious of them and taking certain steps, we can replace undesirable habits with more productive ones.It's an interesting theory, and he fleshes it out with a number of intriguing anecdotes. While the stories he tells are all quite fascinating in their own light, however, I don't feel they illustrated his points quite as successfully as he thinks they do. Take, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous. He highlights the group as an example of a system that creates habit change. And while it certainly has been successful for some members, its high failure rates undermine Duhigg's thesis even as he presents it. Duhigg amends his thesis to account for this failure with the idea that those engaging in habit change need to believe in what they are doing in order for it to work long term. Yet I don't think it would be too hard to find people who have fallen off the wagon despite their belief in the program.Throughout numerous other examples, Duhigg continually assumes correlation equals causation and gives credit in places I don't believe is necessarily due. For this reason, the book isn't as solid as it could be. That said, however, the stories he tells about how change was facilitated by individuals and organizations are very thought-provoking and I definitely learned some things by reading them; the story of how a new CEO transformed the giant corporation Alcoa by focusing on worker safety was particularly interesting. In the appendix, Duhigg does acknowledge that there really isn't one specific way to create habit change, and doing it effectively is going to depend on the habit and the person or system involved. If one can accept that changing habits isn't as simple as he tries to make it sound earlier in the book, there may be useful information here."

It was a pretty long book, definitely a re-read.Notes:- If you remove certain arts of the brain it can effect memory, and tasks, habits don't rely on memory parts of the brain which is interesting - the brains basal ganglia basically is the habit forming/storing area- habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort - it's like a computer cache system, if it loads a page it remembers the page so it doesn't have to load it from scratch again - we can devote mental energy to new ideas and concepts etc- Habits are formed by cravings, there's a cue, a routine, and a reward- People crave the tingly feeling of minty toothpaste because it makes them think the product has done something, that it has had an effect. Fabreeze has the fresh smell at the end of your cleaning which creates a craving for that scent and that feeling of accomplishment - “It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re halfway to changing it”- “We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted. But that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”- Willpower is a muscle, you can use it all up for the day and it will become exhausted- Starbucks allowed autonomy among their employee's and this increased morale"

Why and how we do things by force of habit was interesting enough, but being tracked by retailers to determine buying habits so they can target your needs and cravings was a real eye-opener! Target is the retailer exampled in this book, which makes you wonder why they chose that name. And apparently even gambling casinos can keep track of habitual gamblers and use their addiction to keep them coming back for more. The author takes a complicated subject with a lot of scientific study available, and makes it simple and entertaining enough for any reader. The 4 star rating is for the things I learned through reading this book that I never knew before. The social habits that fed the Montgomery bus boycotts after Rosa Parks arrest in 1955 were mind blowing. This is quite a read."

I got tired of that so I picked up a used copy at Powell's Books in Portland last month when I was there. That being said, I really liked this book. I wanted to read it because I thought it might help me change some of my bad habits into good ones. However, I found the part about businesses, especially retail, and how they look at consumer buying habits to be quite interesting. I also thought the part about music and how music companies determine what will be a hit and what won't to be of even more interest. I will be wondering about it the next time my favorite song comes on the radio!There is a section on social movements.

I felt this strongly with the power of habit. The anecdotes were good but they did not flesh out the premise of book nor did it appear that the author made enough ""statements"" to provide any substance here. The thing that this book has going for it is that most of us don't really think about our habits and how they affect business or ourselves. This book gave an excuse for the reader to mentally explore their own habits and those that govern larger organizations to which they might belong, but reading the book may not have been necessary to get there. Probably could have done it after a 3-4page convincing article. Just saying. "

What could have been a very dry topic on our scientific responses and why we implement good/bad habits in our life, ended up being an absolutely fascinating piece. The book tackles everything from how DJ's get us to listen to certain music, to how businesses use surveys to control our habits (again, both good and bad), and even how brands target consumers to make their products a part of our routines when they had never existed before. The end of the book offers valuable advice on how to break bad habits by identifying your habit loop and how to get the good stuff back in your life.

If you want to change a habit, lose weight, quit smoking, change drinking habits, read this book. It describes patterns and habits that shape our lives, and, if we can learn to recognize the cues, it's the first step toward shaping those patterns into the habits of a life we want to live.In addition to personal habits, the book delves into social group habits--what shapes the habits of people who act as a group.

240,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65764-lana,4,"I read this book after reading its overall message in article form. Duhigg makes the claim that habits are everything, and then offers ways to change them in order to improve your life. This is not schlocky self-help- the tone is a little more subdued and a little more academic than most books of that nature. He can make habit-changing seem facile at times, which is eyebrow-raising when he's talking about addiction and addictive behavior, but he does come back at the end to point out that while understanding how to change habits is easy, changing them does require hard work, dedication, and time. Less easy. This is shown when the author attempts to change a simple habit- eating a cookie every day- and has to go through over a week of experimentation to identify the cue and reward, and then switch the habit. One point that I did not expect to see is about the power of belief- new habits only stick through times of stress and pressure if the person believes- in the reason for change or in the fact that that change is possible. Old habits *do* die hard- in fact, they never die at all. The patterns your brain learns are always going to be in there. Another useful piece of information was about cues- it may sound easy, but identifying the cues that your brain uses to decide when to go into autopilot can be very challenging. It is really interesting to pay attention to your own habits and see what cues you can identify, though. As a side note, the last non-fiction book I read also made a case of the Saddleback Church. (That book was Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.)"
241,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5031502-dani-shuping,4,"“The Power of Habit” is one of those rare books that I started recommending before I even finished it. Charles Duhigg writes a practical book that pulls from multiple sources to explain how habits work, how they’re developed, how they’re formed in the brain, and how we might go about transforming them. Written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell’s books, Charles translates scientific language into clear, concise, and easy to understand for the average reader. He breaks the book down into three main sections--”The Habits of Individuals,” “The Habits of Successful Organizations,” and “The Habits of Societies”--and provides clear examples to back up what he’s written and his examples cover a wide range. For example, he writes about how Tony Dungy changed habits of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to mold them into a winning football team. And he talks about how the former CEO of ALECO championed safety in order to increase company profits. This is a book that anyone, anywhere can get something out of. While Duhigg doesn’t provide specifics of how to change habits in my ARC, (there will be an appendix in the final addition that may do so) there is still ample evidence in the examples of things that you can do and think about as ways to change/modify the habits you’ve built over a lifetime. Overall this is a fascinating book that made me think more about why I do what I do and how I might be able to change it."
242,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217216-allan-elder,3,"The basics of this book are fascinating. The Habit Loop consists of a cue, which calls a routine, which seeks a reward. That is whole book. There is little reason to read the rest of it unless you like a lot examples of this loop. Unfortunately, the book does not really explore the science of habits and absolutely, completely, ignores the research on behaviorism which explains the entire premise of the book. The science of behaviorism, while not popular, covers this material in a way that is actionable. Look at the ""amazing"" discovery of cue, routine, and reward and compare it the decades old behavioral idea of Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence (the ABCs). Duhigg, identifies the habits as ""That psychology was grounded in two basic rules: First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards."" He then spends the next dozen pages with examples from commercials. If you understand the ""ABCs"" then the book holds little value (unless you like stories). Jump to the Appendix ""A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas"" and read it only. It covers everything discussed in the book but at least gives a hint about using the habit concept for change. The advice? Identify the routine, experiment with satisfying rewards, isolate the cue, and have a plan. That's it. If it matters, my review is based on the Kindle edition."
243,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118210-sarah,4,"Very interesting. Duhigg’s breakdown of the habit cycle ( Cue —> Routine —> Reward) is simple but it doesn’t follow that it’s easy just to change the routine. Sadly (for me) there is no magical formula to stop wasting time/exercise more/take vitamins/eat better, but it did confirm that breaking bad habits and forming better ones is really hard to do, so hooray for validation. Personally I found the section on the habits of successful organizations the most interesting. Duhigg cites research showing that an organization's routines function as habits, and these can either create success or result in thoughtless risk, waste and danger (depending on the industry). Similar to French pop culture child-raising notions (where parents must enforce a non-negotiable cadre within which a child has vast freedom), successful employees have considerable choice within their daily work lives (choice about shifts, uniforms, etc. lead to far greater productivity), but only so long as there is a clear ultimate decision maker. A “keystone” organizational habit (e.g., Alcoa’s prioritizing workplace safety above all else) can lead to higher quality and output by fostering subsequent habits of ownership and accountability. "
244,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63015728-ian-d,2,"Though the central idea is not uninteresting (quite the contrary), the writing leaves a lot to be desired: too many anecdotal facts, presented in a non-linear, incohesive way. All in all, the book could have easily been 200 pages shorter and that would have made it a more enjoyable read.Still, a lot of things to consider about building and reprogramming our daily routine. Unfortunately, being concise was not one of the writer's main habits. Neither was the editor's.If I could summarise it in one phrase, that would be it:""Water is the most apt analogy for how a habit works. Water hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, the path traced by itself before.You now know how to redirect that path. You now have the power to swim."""

250,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38970458-willian-molinari,5,"Read this book for the first time in 2016 and re-read it now (2019). The first time I read it, I did not take notes, so I decided to ""properly read/listen"" now.I like the number of studies this book shows and how much we understand about our habits by looking at its results. Some of these studies are already debunked by science (like the marshmallow study), but it's still a great book.At the end of the book, the author provides some examples of how you can use the content of the book to apply to your habits. The goal of this book is not to give you a step-by-step guide on how to change your habits, but to show you how they work. Your cues and rewards are unique, and you have to understand yourself to deal with them.I will keep this piece of the review here. I wrote it in 2016 right after adopting my dog:I'm training a little dog now, and it's really impressive to see how we made some habits for him. It became natural for the dog pee on a specific place, for example. The important part is to keep the same cue, routine, and reward. :)My dog is three years old now. :)Here are my notes for this book:More than 40% of actions people perform every day are not actual decisions but habits according to paper by Duke University in 2006Removing food from the plaza where a group unites was a good way of not keeping them there. When people start to get hungry, they go somewhere elseThe research was done with Eugene, known as EP in the medical literatureThe basal ganglia stores habits in the brainThe brain is continually looking for ways to reduce effort -- it seems to be the same idea exposed by thinking fast and slow :)Patients with basal ganglia damage can't get basic feelings because they don't understand simple face recognitions (they don't know where to focus)Whin cues come out of order or in a different shape, they are not recognized, and the habit is not started. The cue starts the need for a reward and the craving for the routine to achieve it. That's one of the reasons why cellphone notifications are so difficult to resistSome people say they like to workout because of the feeling of endorphins, others because of the sense of accomplishment when tracking their results -- I'm at the gym now, and I'm not sure what motivates me. Maybe keeping my routine? (PS. I'm not too fond of the gym environment, but it's ok now)... oooh... Got it, it's the audiobooks! :)The breeze by P&G was created as a great product to remove odor. In the end, they found out that no one wants to admit that their house stinks, so there's no cue. They transformed the product into something else that smells good and created another cue at the end of cleaning. Tne product got millions of revenue. -- yeah... In the end, it's all about money.The cravings drive the habit loop. You need to feel the need for something to power the habitA football trainer (buccaneers) applied a habit-changing routine to his players for years. This training made players not think in certain situations, but apply habits instead, which is faster. -- it reminds me about playing drums. Sometimes I don't know how I'm playing, I just start, and the rhythm takes care of itselfBelief is important. It doesn't have to be God, but you have to believe that you will get through stressful moments when your routine is not working""Some football teams are not teams; they are just guys who work together"" -- saw that more than once but with developersChanging one habit may chain many other reactions and enhancements. Like changing safety may increase profits and communication. One habit change sometimes requires a whole infrastructure changeMichael Phelps routine has nothing to do with swimming, but it's related to his success""It may be hard to fire someone who's been working for the company for so long, but not for me. Our values dictated how to act."" He fired himself.The director changed named parking spots in the parking lot. Whoever gets to work earlier will get the best spot. Every person matter. -- whatever getting to work earlier, but every person matter makes total senseStudies show that willpower is the single most important habit that contributes to people's successStarbucks had to invest in creating an environment where it would be ok to pay $5 for a coffeeYet another book mentioning the marshmallow studyWillpower is like a muscle, and you have to exercise it. It's a finite resource. If you want to do something that requires willpower you better do it in the morning or conserve your willpower for the nightIt's important so sign children to piano (or anything else) lessons because it teaches them the willpower to study, not just piano itself""We're not in the coffee business serving people. We're in the people business serving coffee"", Starbucks former presidentWhen people are doing things that require willpower, and they feel doing it for themselves or helping someone else, it is less taxing on their willpower. If they feel they are just following orders, it will require a lot more willpower to get the job doneIf a company doesn't cultivate habits to build a good culture, it will still emerge but in a disorganized way.You usually turn right when you enter the supermarketOur brain likes to listen to songs that seem familiar, and this is what makes a big hit.If you dress a new something into an old habit, it's easier for people to accept it (hey ya example)Martin Luther King Jr movement was also based on social habits, strong and weak connections, and peer pressure. It was created in a way where many people agreed, and others will feel bad or ""against it"" if they did not participate (after all, they support it, but some were just not committed enough and could drop it without peer pressure)To political movements to succeed, people have to change their habits. Their identities have to change.Near misses in a slot machine (and possibly other places) are very addictive for the brain, especially for those sensitive to gamblingOnce you know a bad habit exists, you have the freedom and responsibility to change it. You will be held accountable for it.This book provides a framework to understand how habits work and a guide on how they can be changedTo change a habit, find the cue reward, and routine, and then change the routine. Try some alternate routines keeping the same cue and reward. Take notes of your feelings right after the routine and reward. After 15 minutes, are you still craving for this habit? Example: buy a cookie every day. Try to buy different things or buy in different places to find the exact reward you want to have, and then keep the new routineTake notes of your cravings and what's the situation that triggered it: time, action, where, mood, etc. It will help you to identify the pattern"
251,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13036247-diana,4,"The Power of Habit is an absolutely fascinating book that explores how habits have the ability to affect virtually everything in our lives. To say humans are creatures of habit is an understatement. Think of all the things you do on a daily basis without even thinking about them! Charles Duhigg has compiled so much information in this book. We've all heard the phrase: Old habits are hard to break, well there is a reason for that as we learn in this book, but also, there are ways to change your habits with a bit of insight into what makes them habits in the first place. It was a little shocking to learn about how corporations have used this information to help drive sales. A lot of interesting information throughout. "
252,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645496-wai-yip-tung,1,"The Power of Habit is a plainly bad book. So bad that in half of the book, the author just don't know what he is talking about.By now I have identified this genre of non-fiction book I would call Malcolm Gladwell-esque, journalists packaged popular science or popular psychology books. They would write about a topic with some scientific basis, but often spiced up to look very much like they have discovered some secret formula of success. Unfortunately their literary skill gets far ahead of their analytic skill. The result is an illusion that dazzle people at the beginning. But ultimately turn out to have little substance.The thesis and the secret formula to success in this book is habit. Had Duhigg concentrate on the finding in science and neurological underpinning of personal habits, it would have been a mildly interesting book. Once he takes this thesis and apply it to organization and social level, it falls apart quickly.He write at length about how new habit introduced to corporation like Aloca is a huge success story that turned the company around. Mind you what he call organization's habit we usually refer as ""corporate culture"". If you have never suspected ""corporate culture"" could have effect on its performance then Duhigg's book would be a revelation for you. But to most people who have some business sense, Duhigg has add nothing to add to the familiar topic of corporate culture other than his spiced up anecdotes.The book reach its low point when he try to explain Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott incident. To drive the habit theme he use the term liberally in the passages, results in curious phrases like the habit of friendship? the habit of peer pressure? and the social habit of weak ties? 'Habit' has become an entirely meaningless buzzword. Had he dropped the term from the sentences, they would at least be understandable vocabularies like ""friendship"", ""peer pressure"" and ""weak ties"". ""Weak ties"", being a well known concept of social and network science, further expose Duhigg's weakness as he wrote about it at length and it shows he has a lot of misconception about the idea.Ultimately he story about the power of habit really have little predictive and discriminatory power. If the social structure of the black community (I can't bring myself to say social habit) of the Montgomery explains the Rosa Parks incident, then why is it such one-off event? Since the social structure is well established why isn't it deliver forceful activism all the time? And what about all other communities that have similar social structure to Montgomery? What evidence can you find that demonstrate the power of so call ""xxx"" habit in these other communities?(Review is base on reading of selected chapters)."
253,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,3,"In this book, Charles Duhigg takes a look at habits from a number of different perspectives - individual habits, like exercising or drinking, organizational habits, like how departments within corporations communicate with one another, and societal habits, such as those that can motivate individuals to undertake certain actions as a group. His thesis is that habits control a large part of behavior on all these levels. Habits can't be eliminated, he says, but by becoming conscious of them and taking certain steps, we can replace undesirable habits with more productive ones.It's an interesting theory, and he fleshes it out with a number of intriguing anecdotes. While the stories he tells are all quite fascinating in their own light, however, I don't feel they illustrated his points quite as successfully as he thinks they do. Take, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous. He highlights the group as an example of a system that creates habit change. And while it certainly has been successful for some members, its high failure rates undermine Duhigg's thesis even as he presents it. Duhigg amends his thesis to account for this failure with the idea that those engaging in habit change need to believe in what they are doing in order for it to work long term. Yet I don't think it would be too hard to find people who have fallen off the wagon despite their belief in the program.Throughout numerous other examples, Duhigg continually assumes correlation equals causation and gives credit in places I don't believe is necessarily due. For this reason, the book isn't as solid as it could be. That said, however, the stories he tells about how change was facilitated by individuals and organizations are very thought-provoking and I definitely learned some things by reading them; the story of how a new CEO transformed the giant corporation Alcoa by focusing on worker safety was particularly interesting. In the appendix, Duhigg does acknowledge that there really isn't one specific way to create habit change, and doing it effectively is going to depend on the habit and the person or system involved. If one can accept that changing habits isn't as simple as he tries to make it sound earlier in the book, there may be useful information here."

It was a pretty long book, definitely a re-read.Notes:- If you remove certain arts of the brain it can effect memory, and tasks, habits don't rely on memory parts of the brain which is interesting - the brains basal ganglia basically is the habit forming/storing area- habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort - it's like a computer cache system, if it loads a page it remembers the page so it doesn't have to load it from scratch again - we can devote mental energy to new ideas and concepts etc- Habits are formed by cravings, there's a cue, a routine, and a reward- People crave the tingly feeling of minty toothpaste because it makes them think the product has done something, that it has had an effect. Fabreeze has the fresh smell at the end of your cleaning which creates a craving for that scent and that feeling of accomplishment - “It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re halfway to changing it”- “We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted. But that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”- Willpower is a muscle, you can use it all up for the day and it will become exhausted- Starbucks allowed autonomy among their employee's and this increased morale"

Why and how we do things by force of habit was interesting enough, but being tracked by retailers to determine buying habits so they can target your needs and cravings was a real eye-opener! Target is the retailer exampled in this book, which makes you wonder why they chose that name. And apparently even gambling casinos can keep track of habitual gamblers and use their addiction to keep them coming back for more. The author takes a complicated subject with a lot of scientific study available, and makes it simple and entertaining enough for any reader. The 4 star rating is for the things I learned through reading this book that I never knew before. The social habits that fed the Montgomery bus boycotts after Rosa Parks arrest in 1955 were mind blowing. This is quite a read."

I got tired of that so I picked up a used copy at Powell's Books in Portland last month when I was there. That being said, I really liked this book. I wanted to read it because I thought it might help me change some of my bad habits into good ones. However, I found the part about businesses, especially retail, and how they look at consumer buying habits to be quite interesting. I also thought the part about music and how music companies determine what will be a hit and what won't to be of even more interest. I will be wondering about it the next time my favorite song comes on the radio!There is a section on social movements.

I felt this strongly with the power of habit. The anecdotes were good but they did not flesh out the premise of book nor did it appear that the author made enough ""statements"" to provide any substance here. The thing that this book has going for it is that most of us don't really think about our habits and how they affect business or ourselves. This book gave an excuse for the reader to mentally explore their own habits and those that govern larger organizations to which they might belong, but reading the book may not have been necessary to get there. Probably could have done it after a 3-4page convincing article. Just saying. "

What could have been a very dry topic on our scientific responses and why we implement good/bad habits in our life, ended up being an absolutely fascinating piece. The book tackles everything from how DJ's get us to listen to certain music, to how businesses use surveys to control our habits (again, both good and bad), and even how brands target consumers to make their products a part of our routines when they had never existed before. The end of the book offers valuable advice on how to break bad habits by identifying your habit loop and how to get the good stuff back in your life.

If you want to change a habit, lose weight, quit smoking, change drinking habits, read this book. It describes patterns and habits that shape our lives, and, if we can learn to recognize the cues, it's the first step toward shaping those patterns into the habits of a life we want to live.In addition to personal habits, the book delves into social group habits--what shapes the habits of people who act as a group.

270,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65764-lana,4,"I read this book after reading its overall message in article form. Duhigg makes the claim that habits are everything, and then offers ways to change them in order to improve your life. This is not schlocky self-help- the tone is a little more subdued and a little more academic than most books of that nature. He can make habit-changing seem facile at times, which is eyebrow-raising when he's talking about addiction and addictive behavior, but he does come back at the end to point out that while understanding how to change habits is easy, changing them does require hard work, dedication, and time. Less easy. This is shown when the author attempts to change a simple habit- eating a cookie every day- and has to go through over a week of experimentation to identify the cue and reward, and then switch the habit. One point that I did not expect to see is about the power of belief- new habits only stick through times of stress and pressure if the person believes- in the reason for change or in the fact that that change is possible. Old habits *do* die hard- in fact, they never die at all. The patterns your brain learns are always going to be in there. Another useful piece of information was about cues- it may sound easy, but identifying the cues that your brain uses to decide when to go into autopilot can be very challenging. It is really interesting to pay attention to your own habits and see what cues you can identify, though. As a side note, the last non-fiction book I read also made a case of the Saddleback Church. (That book was Quiet, The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking.)"
271,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5031502-dani-shuping,4,"“The Power of Habit” is one of those rare books that I started recommending before I even finished it. Charles Duhigg writes a practical book that pulls from multiple sources to explain how habits work, how they’re developed, how they’re formed in the brain, and how we might go about transforming them. Written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell’s books, Charles translates scientific language into clear, concise, and easy to understand for the average reader. He breaks the book down into three main sections--”The Habits of Individuals,” “The Habits of Successful Organizations,” and “The Habits of Societies”--and provides clear examples to back up what he’s written and his examples cover a wide range. For example, he writes about how Tony Dungy changed habits of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to mold them into a winning football team. And he talks about how the former CEO of ALECO championed safety in order to increase company profits. This is a book that anyone, anywhere can get something out of. While Duhigg doesn’t provide specifics of how to change habits in my ARC, (there will be an appendix in the final addition that may do so) there is still ample evidence in the examples of things that you can do and think about as ways to change/modify the habits you’ve built over a lifetime. Overall this is a fascinating book that made me think more about why I do what I do and how I might be able to change it."
272,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6217216-allan-elder,3,"The basics of this book are fascinating. The Habit Loop consists of a cue, which calls a routine, which seeks a reward. That is whole book. There is little reason to read the rest of it unless you like a lot examples of this loop. Unfortunately, the book does not really explore the science of habits and absolutely, completely, ignores the research on behaviorism which explains the entire premise of the book. The science of behaviorism, while not popular, covers this material in a way that is actionable. Look at the ""amazing"" discovery of cue, routine, and reward and compare it the decades old behavioral idea of Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence (the ABCs). Duhigg, identifies the habits as ""That psychology was grounded in two basic rules: First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards."" He then spends the next dozen pages with examples from commercials. If you understand the ""ABCs"" then the book holds little value (unless you like stories). Jump to the Appendix ""A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas"" and read it only. It covers everything discussed in the book but at least gives a hint about using the habit concept for change. The advice? Identify the routine, experiment with satisfying rewards, isolate the cue, and have a plan. That's it. If it matters, my review is based on the Kindle edition."
273,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/118210-sarah,4,"Very interesting. Duhigg’s breakdown of the habit cycle ( Cue —> Routine —> Reward) is simple but it doesn’t follow that it’s easy just to change the routine. Sadly (for me) there is no magical formula to stop wasting time/exercise more/take vitamins/eat better, but it did confirm that breaking bad habits and forming better ones is really hard to do, so hooray for validation. Personally I found the section on the habits of successful organizations the most interesting. Duhigg cites research showing that an organization's routines function as habits, and these can either create success or result in thoughtless risk, waste and danger (depending on the industry). Similar to French pop culture child-raising notions (where parents must enforce a non-negotiable cadre within which a child has vast freedom), successful employees have considerable choice within their daily work lives (choice about shifts, uniforms, etc. lead to far greater productivity), but only so long as there is a clear ultimate decision maker. A “keystone” organizational habit (e.g., Alcoa’s prioritizing workplace safety above all else) can lead to higher quality and output by fostering subsequent habits of ownership and accountability. "
274,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63015728-ian-d,2,"Though the central idea is not uninteresting (quite the contrary), the writing leaves a lot to be desired: too many anecdotal facts, presented in a non-linear, incohesive way. All in all, the book could have easily been 200 pages shorter and that would have made it a more enjoyable read.Still, a lot of things to consider about building and reprogramming our daily routine. Unfortunately, being concise was not one of the writer's main habits. Neither was the editor's.If I could summarise it in one phrase, that would be it:""Water is the most apt analogy for how a habit works. Water hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, the path traced by itself before.You now know how to redirect that path. You now have the power to swim."""

280,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38970458-willian-molinari,5,"Read this book for the first time in 2016 and re-read it now (2019). The first time I read it, I did not take notes, so I decided to ""properly read/listen"" now.I like the number of studies this book shows and how much we understand about our habits by looking at its results. Some of these studies are already debunked by science (like the marshmallow study), but it's still a great book.At the end of the book, the author provides some examples of how you can use the content of the book to apply to your habits. The goal of this book is not to give you a step-by-step guide on how to change your habits, but to show you how they work. Your cues and rewards are unique, and you have to understand yourself to deal with them.I will keep this piece of the review here. I wrote it in 2016 right after adopting my dog:I'm training a little dog now, and it's really impressive to see how we made some habits for him. It became natural for the dog pee on a specific place, for example. The important part is to keep the same cue, routine, and reward. :)My dog is three years old now. :)Here are my notes for this book:More than 40% of actions people perform every day are not actual decisions but habits according to paper by Duke University in 2006Removing food from the plaza where a group unites was a good way of not keeping them there. When people start to get hungry, they go somewhere elseThe research was done with Eugene, known as EP in the medical literatureThe basal ganglia stores habits in the brainThe brain is continually looking for ways to reduce effort -- it seems to be the same idea exposed by thinking fast and slow :)Patients with basal ganglia damage can't get basic feelings because they don't understand simple face recognitions (they don't know where to focus)Whin cues come out of order or in a different shape, they are not recognized, and the habit is not started. The cue starts the need for a reward and the craving for the routine to achieve it. That's one of the reasons why cellphone notifications are so difficult to resistSome people say they like to workout because of the feeling of endorphins, others because of the sense of accomplishment when tracking their results -- I'm at the gym now, and I'm not sure what motivates me. Maybe keeping my routine? (PS. I'm not too fond of the gym environment, but it's ok now)... oooh... Got it, it's the audiobooks! :)The breeze by P&G was created as a great product to remove odor. In the end, they found out that no one wants to admit that their house stinks, so there's no cue. They transformed the product into something else that smells good and created another cue at the end of cleaning. Tne product got millions of revenue. -- yeah... In the end, it's all about money.The cravings drive the habit loop. You need to feel the need for something to power the habitA football trainer (buccaneers) applied a habit-changing routine to his players for years. This training made players not think in certain situations, but apply habits instead, which is faster. -- it reminds me about playing drums. Sometimes I don't know how I'm playing, I just start, and the rhythm takes care of itselfBelief is important. It doesn't have to be God, but you have to believe that you will get through stressful moments when your routine is not working""Some football teams are not teams; they are just guys who work together"" -- saw that more than once but with developersChanging one habit may chain many other reactions and enhancements. Like changing safety may increase profits and communication. One habit change sometimes requires a whole infrastructure changeMichael Phelps routine has nothing to do with swimming, but it's related to his success""It may be hard to fire someone who's been working for the company for so long, but not for me. Our values dictated how to act."" He fired himself.The director changed named parking spots in the parking lot. Whoever gets to work earlier will get the best spot. Every person matter. -- whatever getting to work earlier, but every person matter makes total senseStudies show that willpower is the single most important habit that contributes to people's successStarbucks had to invest in creating an environment where it would be ok to pay $5 for a coffeeYet another book mentioning the marshmallow studyWillpower is like a muscle, and you have to exercise it. It's a finite resource. If you want to do something that requires willpower you better do it in the morning or conserve your willpower for the nightIt's important so sign children to piano (or anything else) lessons because it teaches them the willpower to study, not just piano itself""We're not in the coffee business serving people. We're in the people business serving coffee"", Starbucks former presidentWhen people are doing things that require willpower, and they feel doing it for themselves or helping someone else, it is less taxing on their willpower. If they feel they are just following orders, it will require a lot more willpower to get the job doneIf a company doesn't cultivate habits to build a good culture, it will still emerge but in a disorganized way.You usually turn right when you enter the supermarketOur brain likes to listen to songs that seem familiar, and this is what makes a big hit.If you dress a new something into an old habit, it's easier for people to accept it (hey ya example)Martin Luther King Jr movement was also based on social habits, strong and weak connections, and peer pressure. It was created in a way where many people agreed, and others will feel bad or ""against it"" if they did not participate (after all, they support it, but some were just not committed enough and could drop it without peer pressure)To political movements to succeed, people have to change their habits. Their identities have to change.Near misses in a slot machine (and possibly other places) are very addictive for the brain, especially for those sensitive to gamblingOnce you know a bad habit exists, you have the freedom and responsibility to change it. You will be held accountable for it.This book provides a framework to understand how habits work and a guide on how they can be changedTo change a habit, find the cue reward, and routine, and then change the routine. Try some alternate routines keeping the same cue and reward. Take notes of your feelings right after the routine and reward. After 15 minutes, are you still craving for this habit? Example: buy a cookie every day. Try to buy different things or buy in different places to find the exact reward you want to have, and then keep the new routineTake notes of your cravings and what's the situation that triggered it: time, action, where, mood, etc. It will help you to identify the pattern"
281,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13036247-diana,4,"The Power of Habit is an absolutely fascinating book that explores how habits have the ability to affect virtually everything in our lives. To say humans are creatures of habit is an understatement. Think of all the things you do on a daily basis without even thinking about them! Charles Duhigg has compiled so much information in this book. We've all heard the phrase: Old habits are hard to break, well there is a reason for that as we learn in this book, but also, there are ways to change your habits with a bit of insight into what makes them habits in the first place. It was a little shocking to learn about how corporations have used this information to help drive sales. A lot of interesting information throughout. "
282,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7645496-wai-yip-tung,1,"The Power of Habit is a plainly bad book. So bad that in half of the book, the author just don't know what he is talking about.By now I have identified this genre of non-fiction book I would call Malcolm Gladwell-esque, journalists packaged popular science or popular psychology books. They would write about a topic with some scientific basis, but often spiced up to look very much like they have discovered some secret formula of success. Unfortunately their literary skill gets far ahead of their analytic skill. The result is an illusion that dazzle people at the beginning. But ultimately turn out to have little substance.The thesis and the secret formula to success in this book is habit. Had Duhigg concentrate on the finding in science and neurological underpinning of personal habits, it would have been a mildly interesting book. Once he takes this thesis and apply it to organization and social level, it falls apart quickly.He write at length about how new habit introduced to corporation like Aloca is a huge success story that turned the company around. Mind you what he call organization's habit we usually refer as ""corporate culture"". If you have never suspected ""corporate culture"" could have effect on its performance then Duhigg's book would be a revelation for you. But to most people who have some business sense, Duhigg has add nothing to add to the familiar topic of corporate culture other than his spiced up anecdotes.The book reach its low point when he try to explain Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott incident. To drive the habit theme he use the term liberally in the passages, results in curious phrases like the habit of friendship? the habit of peer pressure? and the social habit of weak ties? 'Habit' has become an entirely meaningless buzzword. Had he dropped the term from the sentences, they would at least be understandable vocabularies like ""friendship"", ""peer pressure"" and ""weak ties"". ""Weak ties"", being a well known concept of social and network science, further expose Duhigg's weakness as he wrote about it at length and it shows he has a lot of misconception about the idea.Ultimately he story about the power of habit really have little predictive and discriminatory power. If the social structure of the black community (I can't bring myself to say social habit) of the Montgomery explains the Rosa Parks incident, then why is it such one-off event? Since the social structure is well established why isn't it deliver forceful activism all the time? And what about all other communities that have similar social structure to Montgomery? What evidence can you find that demonstrate the power of so call ""xxx"" habit in these other communities?(Review is base on reading of selected chapters)."
283,1400069289,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,3,"In this book, Charles Duhigg takes a look at habits from a number of different perspectives - individual habits, like exercising or drinking, organizational habits, like how departments within corporations communicate with one another, and societal habits, such as those that can motivate individuals to undertake certain actions as a group. His thesis is that habits control a large part of behavior on all these levels. Habits can't be eliminated, he says, but by becoming conscious of them and taking certain steps, we can replace undesirable habits with more productive ones.It's an interesting theory, and he fleshes it out with a number of intriguing anecdotes. While the stories he tells are all quite fascinating in their own light, however, I don't feel they illustrated his points quite as successfully as he thinks they do. Take, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous. He highlights the group as an example of a system that creates habit change. And while it certainly has been successful for some members, its high failure rates undermine Duhigg's thesis even as he presents it. Duhigg amends his thesis to account for this failure with the idea that those engaging in habit change need to believe in what they are doing in order for it to work long term. Yet I don't think it would be too hard to find people who have fallen off the wagon despite their belief in the program.Throughout numerous other examples, Duhigg continually assumes correlation equals causation and gives credit in places I don't believe is necessarily due. For this reason, the book isn't as solid as it could be. That said, however, the stories he tells about how change was facilitated by individuals and organizations are very thought-provoking and I definitely learned some things by reading them; the story of how a new CEO transformed the giant corporation Alcoa by focusing on worker safety was particularly interesting. In the appendix, Duhigg does acknowledge that there really isn't one specific way to create habit change, and doing it effectively is going to depend on the habit and the person or system involved. If one can accept that changing habits isn't as simple as he tries to make it sound earlier in the book, there may be useful information here."

It was a pretty long book, definitely a re-read.Notes:- If you remove certain arts of the brain it can effect memory, and tasks, habits don't rely on memory parts of the brain which is interesting - the brains basal ganglia basically is the habit forming/storing area- habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort - it's like a computer cache system, if it loads a page it remembers the page so it doesn't have to load it from scratch again - we can devote mental energy to new ideas and concepts etc- Habits are formed by cravings, there's a cue, a routine, and a reward- People crave the tingly feeling of minty toothpaste because it makes them think the product has done something, that it has had an effect. Fabreeze has the fresh smell at the end of your cleaning which creates a craving for that scent and that feeling of accomplishment - “It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re halfway to changing it”- “We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted. But that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”- Willpower is a muscle, you can use it all up for the day and it will become exhausted- Starbucks allowed autonomy among their employee's and this increased morale"

Why and how we do things by force of habit was interesting enough, but being tracked by retailers to determine buying habits so they can target your needs and cravings was a real eye-opener! Target is the retailer exampled in this book, which makes you wonder why they chose that name. And apparently even gambling casinos can keep track of habitual gamblers and use their addiction to keep them coming back for more. The author takes a complicated subject with a lot of scientific study available, and makes it simple and entertaining enough for any reader. The 4 star rating is for the things I learned through reading this book that I never knew before. The social habits that fed the Montgomery bus boycotts after Rosa Parks arrest in 1955 were mind blowing. This is quite a read."

I got tired of that so I picked up a used copy at Powell's Books in Portland last month when I was there. That being said, I really liked this book. I wanted to read it because I thought it might help me change some of my bad habits into good ones. However, I found the part about businesses, especially retail, and how they look at consumer buying habits to be quite interesting. I also thought the part about music and how music companies determine what will be a hit and what won't to be of even more interest. I will be wondering about it the next time my favorite song comes on the radio!There is a section on social movements. Not sure if I agree with the author's point of view but it does make the reader think."

I felt this strongly with the power of habit. The anecdotes were good but they did not flesh out the premise of book nor did it appear that the author made enough ""statements"" to provide any substance here. The thing that this book has going for it is that most of us don't really think about our habits and how they affect business or ourselves. This book gave an excuse for the reader to mentally explore their own habits and those that govern larger organizations to which they might belong, but reading the book may not have been necessary to get there. Probably could have done it after a 3-4page convincing article. Just saying. "

What could have been a very dry topic on our scientific responses and why we implement good/bad habits in our life, ended up being an absolutely fascinating piece. The book tackles everything from how DJ's get us to listen to certain music, to how businesses use surveys to control our habits (again, both good and bad), and even how brands target consumers to make their products a part of our routines when they had never existed before. The end of the book offers valuable advice on how to break bad habits by identifying your habit loop and how to get the good stuff back in your life.

If you want to change a habit, lose weight, quit smoking, change drinking habits, read this book. It describes patterns and habits that shape our lives, and, if we can learn to recognize the cues, it's the first step toward shaping those patterns into the habits of a life we want to live.In addition to personal habits, the book delves into social group habits--what shapes the habits of people who act as a group.
