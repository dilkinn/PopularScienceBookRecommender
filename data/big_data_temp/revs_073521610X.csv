The good news is that The Order of Time does what A Brief History of Time seemed to promise but didn't cover: it attempts to explore what time itself is. The bad news is that Carlo Rovelli does this in such a flowery and hand-waving fashion that, though the reader may get a brief feeling that they understand what he's writing about, any understanding rapidly disappears like the scent of a passing flower (the style is catching).It doesn't help either that the book is in translation so some scientific terms are mangled, or that Rovelli has a habit of self-contradiction. Time and again (pun intended) he tells us time doesn't exist, then makes use of it. For example, at one point within a page of telling us of time's absence Rovelli writes of events that have duration and a 'when' - both meaningless terms without time. At one point he speaks of a world without time, elsewhere he says 'Time and space are real phenomena.' The difficulty I think Rovelli faces is that he uses the common physicist's approach of talking of a model as if it were reality. The wofflyness often gets in the way of understanding. For example, when talking about the second law of thermodynamics and entropy, he claims (I think - it's difficult to tell exactly what he is claiming) that the only reason we perceive the arrow of time from the increase of entropy is the way we label things. The implication is that, for example, the atoms in your body are no more ordered than the atoms in a scrambled mess - it's just that it's easier to see the order in your body because on the scale of atoms everything is blurred, but if we could see every atom exactly, whatever configuration they would be in would itself be unique. It sounds impressive, but skips over the way that fundamental quantum particles are indistinguishable. The arrangement of the cloud of atoms is only unique if you can tell one hydrogen atom (say) from another.This is rather a shame, as Rovelli covers a considerable amount in what is a distinctly short book (though, thankfully, you get more for your money than in Seven Brief Lessons). Amongst other things, Rovelli passingly covers the special and general theories of relativity, thermodynamics and, of course, loop quantum gravity. And it's particularly frustrating because his attempt to put across the idea that it’s better to model reality in terms of events rather than things is a very powerful one which isn't often seen in popular science - but the message could easily be lost in the confusion. You come away with very little information - far more that rapidly disappearing odour.I've no doubt this book should do well for those who are impressed that a physicist can refer to Proust. But I like a popular science book with significantly more meat in it, rather than vague impressions."

My first one anyway.I wish I could take back the time, do it over, but entropy hit GR (or at least my internet connection) and something less than the total heat-death of the universe made me realign my perceptions of reality and time.Oh, wait. That was this book!Half historical science, some equations, the theoretical underpinnings of quantum loop theory, the role of entropy and heat in the determination of what makes TIME, and half philosophy and what makes our consciousness drag together all the underpinnings of the blur we call reality.Together, this is physics and metaphysics. The Greeks got it pretty damn close, but then, so did St. Augustine and Heidegger and Kant. Is it all relative? Yep. Thank you, Einstein. Every point on the curve of our universe has its own particular Time. Now is meaningless since the relationship between every point can never intersect with the others. It's all past or future and THAT is all perception. Time is change, too, and not to put too fine a point on it, all we can really do is put a rate on it, never carve it up into its smallest particle. So what about consciousness? It's all interpretation of what we see, baby. The stratifications of what we work by are just an approximation and it says nothing about how a child sees a day versus how an old person sees it.Carlo Rovelli combines the two and does an admirable job of trying to reconcile it all.Impossible, you say? Possibly, but he also gets 9 out of 10 points for style. :) Beautifully written."

There does seem to be an appetite for knowledge out there, although the problem (so it seems to me at least) with physics for a wide audience is that ultimately there is only so much that you can do without resorting to maths."
3,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70395042-fergus,4,"One of the self-appointed gurus of the seventies (who at one point was the leader of a cult headquartered on a Pacific island - you may remember him) used to bash ‘scientism’ as if there was no tomorrow. Many of us addled hippies agreed back then. Although I had a nagging feeling he was just in it for the glitz, glam and dineros. And I was right.Yes, his was a driven life. He probably never found a worthwhile moment of pure peace in his short life. I think Rovelli shares that blind spot, as do so many of us harried moderns.Love seems foreign to him. Rovelli, in fact, puts the very human phenomenon of Particularity - the essence of falling for a Special Someone - down to simple physical entropy. Slowing down!Now, how can we love someone if not for their particularity? ‘I love her as I love no other’ is the Essence of a man’s love. Isn’t calling it entropy downright reductionist? I guess maybe science and emotional dryness go well together!Nevertheless, for all his glaring lack of simple humanity, he cuts a swashbuckling figure as a physicist. You just don’t see that too often! Or someone who explains complex theories so clearly.Hearing Rovelli talk, you can grasp Einstein’s thoughts about time as if for the first time (try my Kindle notes). His language is clear, concise, readable, and filled with colourful analogy. He must be as revered by his students as the legendary American physicist Richard Feynman was idolized by his.It’s a wonderful book. It puts a simple act like maybe walking to the store into a universal framework. I think, reading it, you’ll have little problem seeing how vastly the Theory of Relativity has altered our lives, in easy-to-understand language.And one famous scientist can teach us more about life than any hippie guru ever could!Though not about love...But he’ll learn all about THAT over time - For the Bigger they are the HARDER they fall."

What even is time?Carlo Rovelli sets out to explain just that question in his latest book, ""The Order of Time"". Rovelli's explanation of time isn't always clear - there were many moments where I lost the thread - but it is beautiful. For a theoretical physicist, Rovelli is wonderfully poetic. It certainly helps that the audiobook is narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch, whose deeply rich voice lends Rovelli's words added impact. As a result, this is one of the few books that's actually better listened to. Just imagine Cumberbatch reading the following:""Things in themselves are only events that, for a while, are monotonous. But only before returning to dust... the absence of time does not mean, therefore, that everything is frozen and unmoving, it means that the incessant happening that wearies the world is not ordered along a timeline, is not measured by a gigantic tic-tocking... it is a boundless and disorderly network of quantum events. The world is more like Naples than Singapore. If by ""time"" we mean nothing more than happening, then everything is time. There is only that which exists in time.""That's beautiful, even if I don't quite fully understand it.Rovelli also quotes a beautiful passage by Hugo von Hofmannsthal from the famous aria in Richard Strauss' opera, ""Der Rosenkavelier"". It's an ode to the passing of time, and it's one of the most somber passages I've ever heard. It's titled ""Die Zeit, die ist ein sonderbar ding"", in English, ""Time Is Weird"".""I remember a little girl, but how can that be? Once I was that little girl, and then I became an old woman. If God wills it so, why allow me to see it? Why doesn't he hide it from me? Everything is a mystery. Such a deep mystery. I feel the fragility of things in time. From the bottom of my heart, I feel we should cling to nothing. Everything slips through our fingers. All that we seek to hold onto dissolves. Everything vanishes like mist and dreams. Time is a strange thing. When we don't need it, it is nothing. Then suddenly, there is nothing else. It is everywhere around us, also within us. It seeps into our faces. It seeps into the mirror. Runs through my temples. Between you and I, it runs silently like an hourglass. Sometimes I feel it flowing inexorably, sometimes I get up in the middle of the night and stop all the clocks.""Like time itself, I often felt the words of Rovelli's ""The Order of Time"" vanishing from my mind nearly as soon as I read them. Such beautiful words, even if they left me far too quickly."
6,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,4,"Time has always been an enigma – with philosophers and even scientists calling it an illusion. And, Carlo Rovelli tells us that it is increasingly appearing to be so. A topic which without doubt captures your attention & is very intellectually stimulating. It would have been an exceptional book, but in parts struggles between being a book for everybody vs being a book of serious science. I have observed many science books do run into this issue – and it is quite obviously a difficult balance to achieve.The start gets you immediately hooked with the description of how time moves slower at lower altitudes than higher altitudes. When you fall, you are actually tending to go towards the place where time moves slower. The advances in our understanding of time makes for very interesting reading with the big breakthrough coming with Einstein’s theory of relativity. Einstein’s concept of the spacetime fabric affected by mass as well as speed completely changed how time was viewed. This also brings into question what we really mean by present – which really holds only here and is highly localized. The present somewhere else – on a different planet for instance is known to us much later and may mean nothing. It makes sense for the universe to be seen as a series of events, rather than as objects interacting with each other. Objects are a logical outcome of events and quite possibly so is time - a result of a change of entropy rather than something which passes by objects. There has been progress in creating theories & models of the universe without time. The Loop Quantum theory is discussed – which Carlo is personally involved with as well. The later part of the book discusses the practical uses of time – emerging out of a universe which does not really need time to explain it. This is a book which will kindle your curiosity to think and read more about time theories. There are vague & incomplete references to Vedanta & Lord Shiva from Hindu philosophy. Despite the inconsistent treatment – oscillating between simple language and more detail, this is a book to read, for the fascinating topic it explores.It is not a big book and will not take you too much time to read. Oh well, it will not be that easy to banish time from my mind yet though 😊My rating: 3.75 / 5."

I do like Dr. Rovelli. I don't even mind if a lot of what he's saying is theoretical (part 2) and speculative (parts 3). It is poetry and even if he isn't right, or physics or science shows a different path, his exploration is beautiful and revelatory. I wish I had a more complicated understanding of Quantum Gravity so Section 2 made more sense. I seemed to grab some of it, but I know I'm grabbing a tail of something I've only seen at the edge of my perception."
8,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,3,"I suspect that these Carlo Rovelli books are popular because they are short and imaginative! The first half of The Order of Time was clear and thought-provoking. But the second half went a little off the rails and I'm not sure it all even made sense. (His science is sound, I assume, but what about his metaphysical speculations ?) My mind kept wandering as I was lulled by Benedict Cumberbatch's voice (which reminded me of Neil Gaiman's hypnotic audiobook narrations). I amused myself by imagining Cumberbatch not comprehending a single word of it, while still pulling off a marvelous performance. "
9,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,4,"Time is an Illusion, says physicist Carlo Rovelli Physicists calling time an illusion is not a new idea. Julian Barbour, in his 1999 book argued for the same hypothesis. Contrary to this idea, physicist Lee Smolin proposed that time is real. He suggested that laws of physics are not fixed in the universe but evolve over time. The principle argument in support of his theory is that mathematical models provide an abstraction of reality and ignore time dimension. Carlo Rovelli observes that since theory of general relativity assumes spacetime is smooth and continuous, and quantum theory describes matter and energy in discrete quantities which implies that spacetime is also quantized. i.e. they exist in discrete quanta. These two realities are unconnected because quantum physics cannot deal with the continuous spacetime, and general relativity cannot reconcile with quantization of space and time. In fact, space, time and gravity are suggested as emergent properties of a system. Emergent properties are not identical with, reducible to, or deducible from the other physical properties. Examples include, temperature, pressure, viscosity, spacetime and gravity. Therefore, the author concludes that Isaac Newton’s picture of a universally ticking clock, and Albert Einstein’s relativistic space-time that bends so that local times differ depending on one’s relative speed or proximity to a mass is an over simplification. According to Rovelli, the time; the sequences of past, present and future is an emergent phenomenon of thermodynamics. One of the principal arguments Rovelli advances is the Wheeler-De Witt equation which describes quantum gravity, but it has no time variable associated with it. Quantum mechanics and general relativity, taken together, imply the possibility of quantum superposition of different spacetimes. But the Wheeler-de Witt equation, which is based on a wave function Ψ[q] over geometries offers new perspectives. In this book, Rovelli often muses about metaphysics, poetry and spirituality but fails to convince the reader that his idea is on the right track. It reminds me of Einstein’s famous saying that “God does not play dice,” Which makes me believe that if time is an illusion, then space would also be an illusion. There is a beauty and symmetry in the universe, and time alone could not be an illusion without space. Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and Mars explorer suggest that this universe is a computer simulation on someone’s computer. And black hole physics suggests that the information in 3D world could be described in 2D dimension, in fact reality is a hologram. In quantum reality, the wave functions of a reality must be collapsed by physical observation (conscious observers), until then the reality is smeared out in spacetime. In fact, reality is in the eyes of beholder. Taken together, reality of matter and energy in spacetime could be an illusion (Maya), as interpreted by the Vedanta School of Hindu philosophy."
10,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,4,"My first read of #scienceseptember (2019) was a bit of a mind blowing experience, with physics meeting philosophy for a discussion of time. I barely grasped the concepts that were already dumbed down for a layperson - the absence of a ""present,"" how time and entropy relate, equations without time, etc. But I did meet my goal of reading more than just nature stuff for the theme!""In order to exit from a black hole, you would need to move toward the present rather than toward the future!...This is impossible.""""More than a hundred years have passed since we learned that the 'present of the universe' does not exist.""""The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.""""We understand the world in its becoming, not in its being.""""[The world] is a boundless and disorderly network of quantum events.""""What causes events to happen in the world, what writes its history, is the irresistible mixing of all things going from the few ordered configurations to the countless disordered ones.""""Music can occur only in time, but if we are always in the present moment, how is it possible to hear it?""""We are stories, ... lines drawn by traces left of the (re)mingling together of things in the world, ... in a rather particular corner of this immense, chaotic universe.""""Time is suffering.""A few thoughts I had - this whole ""blurring"" idea feels like an explanation you throw at something when you just don't understand it yet. I'd send those physicists back to think more about this. Rovelli also talks about how the only way we identify past vs. future is we can see traces of the past. But what if it's just that our brains don't understand what we see from the future without that particular framing? "
11,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7693283-terry-pearce,5,"This is without a doubt the best science book I've ever read. Possibly the best book I've ever read. It takes something (Time) that is ultra-important to us all and really tough to think about, and, in graceful language and thoughtful structure, explains first how everything we think we know about it on a day to day basis is wrong, and then how we can think about it in a way that is profound and useful. Along the way, he ties it in with the deepest core of what it is to be a human being, alive, in time. This succeeds in spades as prose, as philosophy, as patient and structured explanation... just wonderful.And Benedict Cumberbatch narrates it perfectly."
12,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27482054-huyen-chip,5,Mind-blowing. So beautifully written. Entropy makes the world go round. Time exists within us. I can't see the world the same way again.
13,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82365956-veronica,4,"One star lost. Either I am simply in a bitter mood tonight, or the last thirty-seven minutes of this audiobook were depressing and existentially soul-crushing. Everything vanishes. Time is suffering. We suffer because we can't hold onto things. This is not physics?! Physics isn't supposed to be depressing; that's philosophy. I do wish he had perhaps confined himself to loop quantum gravity. I might as well next read Buddha's teachings tonight. Desire is suffering. Then Schopenhauer. Will is suffering. In seriousness, I think Rovelli is a marvelous writer. But I scarcely need another daily reminder that my desire to not suffer the common foibles of human consciousness is a distant dream. The best way to achieve happiness is to surrender the desire to control the entire cosmos, which I surely will never do."
14,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"This is probably the hardest book I've listened. The concise yet poetic language and Benedict Cumberbatch's deeply affective voice keep me going. It is 4 hours 20 minutes long. I listened twice, doing my best to ""get"" as much as I can. The first part of the book describes well-established aspects of time in physics that have been repetitively proved by carefully conducted experiments--gravitational time dilation and relative velocity time dilation, i.e. time passes slower nearer to a mass, faster farer away from a mass, faster at lower speed and slower at higher speed. Then it goes deeper, much deeper. It dismantles what we, non physicists, think we know about time: something flows uniformly, equally throughout the universe in the course of which all things happen, and reality flows from the past, to the present and towards the future.  According the book, the present that is common throughout the whole universe does not exist...There is ""present"" that is near to us, but nothing is present in a far away galaxy...The present is localized rather universal...The difference between past and future does not exist in the elementary equations that govern the world. A large part of the book talks about Thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics states total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time, where ""time"" is the asymmetrical, one-directional process and what we ""perceive"" as time. The concepts of Thermal Time and Quanta Time have lost on me. I do not even attempt to understand Loop Theory and Spin Networks (which are the author's fields.)The universe starts at a lower entropy (a particular configuration, ordered), and gradually moves towards higher entropy (less ordered), but what is considered ordered, what is not? To explain, the author uses the analogy of cards shuffling. There are actually infinite possibilities of the order of cards, similar to the universe. However, we can not ""see"" (does the author mean we, the conscious being, the classical entity, to see with our eyes?) the infinite details of things, of the infinite happenings in the world, can not grasp the infinite possibilities and combinations, instead, we can only ""see"" what we are able to ""see"". The universe starts at a lower entropy because in our blurred ""vision"", that's the particular configuration we are associated with. No, I don't think I truly understand, but I am fascinated by the theory. Also this: In a system where time does not exist, change is ubiquitous. And this: The universe is a collection of events, not things, and not ordered by time. The last two chapters are quite philosophical. Indeed, new development in modern philosophy comes from theoretical physics and neuroscience. The impermanence of the universe described in the book complies with Buddhism's world view. The author discusses what makes ""I"", the conscious being. He sees memory is one of the three elements that makes one the one.“Because everything that begins must end. What causes us to suffer is not in the past or the future: it is here, now, in our memory, in our expectations. We long for timelessness, we endure the passing of time: we suffer time. Time is suffering.” “I am my mother’s caresses, and the serene kindness with which my father calmly guided me; I am my adolescent travels; I am what my reading has deposited in layers in my mind; I am my loves, my moments of despair, my friendships, what I’ve written, what I’ve heard; the faces engraved on my memory. I am, above all, the one who a minute ago made a cup of tea for himself. The one who a moment ago typed the word “memory” into his computer. The one who just composed the sentence that I am now completing. If all this disappeared, would I still exist? I am this long, ongoing novel. My life consists of it.” "

The Public Library only allowed me 7 days to read this book with no renewals. So Time was a problem from the beginning. Nevertheless, I plowed through and finishing tonight, I ended up buying the Kindle Version. There is much to contemplate and digest in this book. A reread at some point in Time is in order. Reading this work, you will encounter explanations of time that read like science fiction because they are so outside our human experience.All I know is that nothing has been discovered or invented that will let me step back in time to see my parents, hug my dog, or enjoy law school again."

20,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13716226-murtaza,3,"I was looking for a book about the philosophy of time, but found this one instead which is more of a physics book about the contemporary state of science on the subject. Despite not being exactly what I was looking for, Rovelli does a great job of laying out the present state of knowledge about what ""time"" really is in the universe and how it functions. Contrary to our limited perception, time is a far more relative and ephemeral phenomenon than we like to imagine. It is also better described as a part of the physical world, than as something flowing ceaselessly outside of it. Time flows faster in the mountains than it does in the plains, because gravity and mass slows it down. Our whole lives on this planet could be considered one giant ""moment,"" created by the weight of the earth's gravitational force, rather than the free flowing time that exists in space. As well, the only genuine marks of the ""past"" that we ever see are those created by the release of heat and the growing entropy (disorder) of the universe. The heat created by your brains marks out memories, the heat of an asteroid impact on the moon leaves a crater etc. The flowing of time, or what we perceive as that, is in many ways the cause of our suffering as human beings. As a result, the great religious and philosophical traditions have always spoken of ""eternity"" as time's paradisical antithesis. Rovelli mentions this in passing, and I actually found it to be one of the most profound parts of the book. All in all he is a gifted explainer of physics and this is a genuinely accessible look at the science of time, as it stands at the moment.""And on that wave we will all have to navigate, all who are nourished by the fruits of the Earth."" - The Odes of Horace (11,14)"
21,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,4,"The nature of time is one of the greatest open mysteries of the universe. How time actually works? Do humans exist in time or time exists in humans? How time passes? There are many questions related to a complex subject as time to ask, and answers are few. Carlo Rovelli, an Italian theoretical physicist, who spent a lifetime studying this subject, tries to reveal mysteries of time and he brings the reader closer to possible answers regarding time.Among other very interesting things, there’s an important chapter in this book where the author puts across the idea that reality is made of events rather that things. This is very powerful. This idea and writings about it is a gem in the book. As the author elegantly puts it—‘The world is made up of network of kisses, not of stones’. Further on, by understanding time, we can better understand what we humans are in metaphysical terms. If the reality is modelled as events, what are we humans? Since we can’t be entities by following this idea what then are we? The author provides a lot of good food for thought about this idea.The chapters in the end of the book, unfortunately, contains a little bit of confusion and contradictions (therefore on star off), but overall, it’s a wonderful little book about time. So if you got some time to explore time, it’s a good place to start."
22,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak,4,"Just read the quotes, I will do this no justice. Simple concepts like, there's no present in space and you're head is actually moving faster in time than your feet. And what actually is time, it seems circumstantial and always dependent on something. Oh, and time exists because we can't adequately track the minutiae of things.Also, it's not ineloquently told.To the quotes:“If I ask whether two events—one on Earth and the other on Proxima b—are happening “at the same moment,” the correct answer would be: “It’s a question that doesn’t make sense, because there is no such thing as ‘the same moment’ definable in the universe.” The “present of the universe” is meaningless.”“We are stories, contained within the twenty complicated centimeters behind our eyes...”“This is the disconcerting conclusion that emerges from Boltzmann’s work: the difference between the past and the future refers only to our own blurred vision of the world. It’s a conclusion that leaves us flabbergasted: is it really possible that a perception so vivid, basic, existential—my perception of the passage of time—depends on the fact that I cannot apprehend the world in all of its minute detail? On a kind of distortion that’s produced by myopia? Is it true that, if I could see exactly and take into consideration the actual dance of millions of molecules, then the future would be “just like” the past?”These ideas will be floating around my head for some time and my wife's probably sick of me talking about this book.4 out of 5 Stars (highly recommended)"

I think I can listen to this audiobook a few times more without getting bored.it is a tiny little book, but it has blown my mind, not because of Mr. Revelli’s Lamborghini style writing but for his deep inside on this subject. time has a special feature known as the arrow of time. there is only one known physical phenomenon that also has such sense of direction, we call it ""heat"". as the time flows only from past to future, so does the heat flows only from hot to cold. for some time now, it has been speculated that time has something to do with the heat. since Boltzmann's time, this relation is known to be the entropy (though the term entropy was not coined by him). entropy refers to the subatomic arrangement of a system, Mr. Rovelli argued that ignoring each and every subatomic change of a system, which he dubbed as “blurring” the entropy, give rise to time. in other words, if we could calculate and compare all entropic states of the universe then there would be no time. the comparison of one entropic state (let's say, hot) to another (let's say, cold) is known as thermal time.of course, the human brain cannot cope up with such incredulous task of tracking each and every subatomic entity of the environment, rather evolution had found a shortcut, we call it perspective time. our brain ignores the microscopic details of any system, but keep track of macroscopic states in a sequential order, this order is the human-perceived time. this is the reason, you are still the one who you think you were twenty years ago, although all of your molecules has been replaced during this period. brian is an ingenious evolutionary machine that keeps track of events without any knowledge of entropy. at the same time, it is the victim of its own ingenuity: the illusion of time.what surprising is that blurring of entropy which was postulated by Boltzmann is the same as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. i.e. the uncertainty of momentum and position of a subatomic particle prevent us from pinpointing the precise entropic state of any system, hence the blurring of entropy is also a quantum phenomenon. which means, time is not just the direction of heat transfer, it is also the manifestation of the uncertainty in the quantum world.I think I should stop here, rather you should read this tiny little amazing book."
25,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit,2,"This book did a number on my brain. And I’ve read and thoroughly enjoyed Rovelli’s previous Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, so I should have been ready, but no. Then again this was a different beast. Physics are in general not entirely my bag, it’s a sort of thing to force feed to the mind to maintain a well balanced active diet, but usually I do ok. This one managed to repeatedly get away from me, sentences were read and reared, ideas pondered and contemplated. And yet…for all that reading, what’s left is that time in an illusion, time doesn’t exist on fundamental level, time is directly related to entropy, it is through entropy and just about only through entropy that one can know and understand the concept of time such as it is. And, of yeah, all’s relative, thanks Einstein. That doesn’t seem enough of a reward for reading the book. Definitely not enough information. Rovelli, actually, is a lovely writer and he tends to wax poetic on his subjects at length, but here it seemed to be at cost to learning. Too many examples saying the same thing. And in the end too much of the same thing. In fact, you can probably just read the last chapter, which is a summary of sorts, and walk away accomplished. And I admit, this review may say more about a specific reader’s aptitude and intellectual vigor than the book itself, after all so many here on GR seem to have loved the book, but that’s what reviews are, aren’t they…specific reader’s thoughts on their reading experiences. And my reading experiences of this book was frustrating, exhausting and not overly rewarding. Definitely didn’t get that good workout, brain, thing nonfiction usually provides. Rovelli is quite possibly a genius, certainly exceptionally smart and knowledgeable in his field, he has plenty to say on the subject, but when he gets too technical, it’s too difficult to follow without specific knowledge of physics and when he waxes poetic, it’s too ephemeral to learn from. Overall, this seemed much more of a meditation on the nature of time than a scientific perspective on time. And as much as I wanted to love the book that uses smurfs for diagrams, I was unable to. In fact it managed to induce a peculiar mental stupor, which ended up wasting some of the precious, precious time. Good thing it was short at least. Obviously, user mileage may vary."
26,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"Occasionally, it's nice to sit back and ponder time and space. This book was mystical and scientific and illuminating. Some parts veered toward overly technical and some parts were overly flowery, but how could it not when it's trying to explain time itself? "
27,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5593045-loring-wirbel,3,"Carlo Rovelli is staring right down the center of avenues I find fascinating, attempting a detailed description of what Ted Chiang explored in his short story that became the film Arrival starring Amy Adams. If we are beings living in four dimensions, why do we perceive the fourth as a sequential arrow moving in only one direction? And, as Amy's character learns as the fate of her daughter becomes clear, is a wider perception of time a sort of forbidden fruit from Eden's apple tree? Rovelli certainly wants to provide his thoughts in an interesting, meandering, Buddhist-like structure. The result is certainly preferable to Hawkings' A Brief History of Time, though only insofar as it attempts to analyze human perceptions of time. Still, his book isn't quite as fully satisfying as one might hope, in the same way that Roger Penrose can't fully explain consciousness by calling upon some magical quantum element. If Rovelli or Penrose were to work in collaboration with a leading cognitive-neuroscience philosopher like Daniel Dennett or Sam Harris, the result might be more satisfying. Maybe a physicist can take us only part of the way there.Here's where Rovelli does a good job: He explains early on why there is no universal notion of ""present time,"" and how each concept of the present must be tied to a local consciousness perceiving events. In this regard, and in the way he dismisses Descartes for suggesting the mind's major task is analyzing its own existence, Rovelli follows Lakoff and Johnson's Philosophy in the Flesh, when the two authors suggest that there are no abstract ideas or forms outside of the emergent intelligence arising from sentient bodies. Similarly, Rovelli says there is no flow of time outside the body experiencing it.Rovelli is big on the concept of ""blurring,"" and I totally follow him here. Humans blur the notion of probability wave fronts from the microscopic quantum world in order to perceive solid objects like rocks and other people. The macroscopic objects are not so much real, as a blurred approximation. In the same way, we blur the infinite possibilities of thermal time and entropy to collapse all possibilities into the temporal flow we perceive. The structure of our short-term and long-term distributed memories determine that we will find ""traces"" of past events that steer us into perceiving a one-way flow of time, because the future probabilities have not collapsed to form similar memory traces. There might be a way to grasp each moment from birth to death simultaneously with our limited minds, but we'd be drinking from a firehose that would offer few clues as to how to collapse wave fronts. Hence the nature of the ""Amy Adams problem"" of Arrival - it may be feasible to know the lifelong ""light cone"" traces of our loved ones, but that could also be a path to madness.If Rovelli had expanded this element with a little bit more hints from the field of cognitive neuroscience, this whimsical book might have won an instant four or five stars. It's certainly intriguing, and a step in the right direction. Rovelli's final chapter, 'The Sister of Sleep,' urges the reader to accept death and finite perceptual limits in the same way one accepts the heat death of the universe. Short-term ""local minima"" of low entropy are special cases in a universe inevitably moving to greater entropy. He quotes Ecclesiastes to say ""Then the song fades and ceases. 'The silver thread is broken, the golden bowl is shattered, the amphora at the fountain breaks, the bucket falls into the well, the earth returns to dust.' And it is fine like this. We can all close our eyes, rest. This all seems fair and beautiful to me. This is time.""It is a touching ego-dissolving final message in a heavy book with a light touch. Now that Rovelli has opened the door further, I hope new collaborations of physicists and neuroscientists will offer broader descriptions to dispel the mystery of human perception of time."
28,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37277866-ellison,4,"I’ve been looking for a that book tries to explain what time is. This book does that. I found the attempt entertaining but not very convincing, or even clearly stated.	Roveli is not trying to sum up the various scientific theories but to present his own ideas, first as a physicist and then as a philosopher. 	Lots of metaphors and musings:“The difference between things and events is that things persist in time; events have a limited duration. A stone is a prototypical ‘thing’: we can ask ourselves where it will be tomorrow. Conversely, a kiss is an ‘event.’ It makes no sense to ask where the kiss will be tomorrow. The world is made up a network of kisses, not stones.”“If by ‘time’ we mean nothing more then happening, then everything is time. There is only that which exists in times”“…birth is suffering, decline is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering, union with that which we hate is suffering, separation from that which we love is suffering, failure to obtain what we desire is suffering. It’s suffering because we must lose what we have and are attached to. Because everything that begins must end. What causes us to suffer is not in the past or the future: it is here, now, in our memory, in our expectations. We long for timelessness…” And he gives us that by asserting that on the most fundamental level time does not exist -that there is no present- but I couldn’t follow him there - what is a kiss without lips."

33,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9517361-blaine,1,"Don't be fooled - this is not an attempt to explain time but to assert the singular reality of reversible and relativistic time as viewed by physicists. Rovelli's attempt to explain away thermodynamic-entropic time and the whole of complex systems by telling us ""it's all a blur"" - that our experience of past and future and the direction of time, of evolution, growth, decay, and the whole of biology is basically nothing but subjective phenomenology or the ignorance of human perception is simply laughable. What universe is he living in?To ignore the work of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world who've established the sciences of chaos, complexity, nonlinear systems, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics and assert that their view of time is somehow not real, some illusion or whatever, is arrogant and irresponsible, not to mention narrow-minded. This is scientific fundamentalism and works against the goal of science to produce a coherent system of thought across many domains. The Order of Time appears to be a last ditch attempt to revive the old Platonic-Newtonian deterministic worldview in the face of the contemporary view of emergence, probability, instability, nonlinearity, complexity, chaos, and irreversibility - a kind of marketing ploy to convince the public that the old view of physics still reigns supreme over all else. In this book, Rovelli appears to represent an old guard of physicists, extreme reductionists, who are unable to embrace the scientific revolution that has engulfed their science, the revolution that is complex, nonequilibrium, and nonlinear systems theory.

34,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56337479-h-a-leuschel,5,"Like all previous books I've read written by the same author, this one was equally a delight to read, thought-provoking and well written. "
35,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Like a lot of young nerds, I had a period of fascination with advanced physics. Never enough to actually become all that good at it, mind you. I just about wrapped my brain around the wave-particle duality, in order to get my degree in Electrical Engineering. I took one course on Relativity. I found it all to be fascinating, and also really, really hard. There were other people, for whom it was equally fascinating, but more like ""fun"" than ""hard"". I was not one of those people.The primary benefit to me of having taken those courses as a youngster, was not that it did me the slightest bit of good whatsoever in my professional life in the semiconductor industry. It turns out that, truth be told, you don't have to be all that good at physics to make semiconductors, or even to test circuits made of them, or even to improve processes for making them. Perhaps you have to be really good at physics to invent them in the first place, but that was not a task I ever had to accomplish.No, the primary benefit was that, when someone invoked quantum physics or relativity to bolster their hand-wavy philosophy, I could recognize that they didn't know what they were talking about. There is, it turns out, nothing in quantum physics or relativity that proves or disproves anybody's idea about God, the meaning of life, whether there is an objective reality, or where consciousness comes from. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying, or just projecting their hopes onto the deeply unintuitive world of the very small or very fast.Still, Rovelli is himself a professional, one of those people who does actually know a lot more about physics than I do, and his book had two other things going for it. One, it was short, and a nice compact size. Two, it had a goodly amount of pictures. When I read something like advanced physics, the reality is I'm not ready to go through 800 pages' worth, and I need some diagrams, or sketches, or graphs, or something besides a wall of text with the occasional equation.It turns out that Rovelli is also apparently quite good at explaining things. It may have helped some that I had learned some of the early parts of the book before, but it had been decades, and I found myself wishing that he had been the guy writing my college physics textbooks, or perhaps teaching the classes. But then, it may also be that reading about physics for fun, is a lot more enjoyable than taking a test on it, which is going to be curved to guarantee that around 25% of the class gets a failing grade.Rovelli's thesis seems to be, that time is not a fundamental part of reality in the way that, say, mass or electromagnetism is. Rather, it is more like perspective. He claims that this is actually the pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian way of thinking about time. Time is nothing other than the order in which we experience things. Rovelli's claim (which I am unable to really evaluate the truth of), is that the modern idea of time as a dimension is Newton's, and while it may have been a reasonable operating assumption for him at that, uh, time, it isn't the literal truth. Just as quantum physics and relativity have upended other parts of Newton's worldview, Rovelli says that they have returned us to a pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian idea of time.One is reminded of the saying, ""time is what keeps everything from happening at once"". Rovelli seems to be saying something more like, time is the order in which we perceive things as happening. If we are all, relative to one another, moving at very low speeds (compared to the speed of light in a vacuum), then we never notice that my time is different than yours. Once you think about the very fast, very big, or very small, our intuitions don't work.There was also some stuff about entropy in there.To be honest, if I really wanted to understand what Rovelli was saying here, in depth, well enough to pass a test on it, I would need to read it again. And you know, I just might do that. But not yet, because I am once again in the blessed position of being able to read about physics for exactly as much as I feel like, and neither more nor less. I believe that it is true for me, anyway, that a little more time should pass before I reread this one.It was pretty good, though, so perhaps not too much time."
36,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison,4,"Originally reviewed at The Book Wheel.Consider the following: time passes faster in the mountains than it does at sea level. If this sentence confounds you but piques your interest, then I can already tell you that you want to read The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli, which answers questions such as what is time? Is there a universal time? What does it mean to live in the present? Does the present exist? Turns out, these are simple questions with no easy answers because time is complicated. I don’t mean that timezones are confusing or that time passing faster in the mountains is perplexing, but that at an elemental level, time doesn’t even exist the way we think it does.Luckily, The Order of Time takes an approachable, scientific look at these questions and explores ideas rooted in quantum physics, thermodynamics, and the human condition. It will expand your mind, confuse the heck out of you, and, if you’re like me, leave you pondering some pretty heavy philosophical conundrums.One thing I learned that does make sense is that there is no now because now is just the perception of time. By the time we perceive something happening, nanoseconds have already passed. This means that everything we do, think, say, or hear exists both in the past and the present depending on if you’re saying it or hearing it. In other words, time is so fleeting we’re more or less living in the future as much as we are the present. For example, I can ask what you’re doing right now (reading this sentence) but by the time you process the words I have written, the act of reading it is in the past. WHAT?!Taking this one step further, this also means two people are never actually in the same place at the same time. I can speak to you, but by the time you perceive my actions, I am already living in the past. Throw in timezones and it’s easy to see why there’s no true, universal time. Time exists in relativity. Perhaps the author says it best when he said, “Physics does not describe how things evolve “in time” but how things evolve in their own times, and how “times” evolve relative to each other.”This relativity also applies to what it means to exist. One example The Order of Time gives is the emergence of teams. A group of children can line up and pick teams, one by one, for a soccer game. This new team doesn’t already exist, but it emerges and then does exist because different entities combine to make it so. So if you can create something out of nothing, what does that mean for the whole of existence? And is existence all relative? Some might say that a literary character doesn’t exist, as in they are not “real”, but yet they do exist, if even in our collective minds. Existence, Rovelli argues, is grammatical: “Words such as “here,” “now,” “I,” “this,” “tonight” all assume a different meaning depending on who utters them and the circumstances in which they are uttered.”Philosophical pondering aside, Rovelli explains all of this by rooting it in science. He tackles major scientific theories of time, from Aristotle’s belief that time measures change to Newton’s idea that time is independent of us. He discusses entropy and how it evolves over time, linking it to the laws of thermodynamics and quantum physics.Yet despite this heavy reading, there’s a romantic quality to The Order of Time. Because in the end, it’s all about how we, as humans, perceive time. It is our own “blurred vision” that shapes how we see the world. We are made up of our experiences, traces, and narratives, and each is unique to us. And although the following quote isn’t about time, per se, it does speak to the larger question of whether the absence of something exists: “But it isn’t absence that causes sorrow. It is affection and love. Without affection, without love, such absences would cause us no pain. For this reason, even the pain caused by absence is, in the end, something good and even beautiful, because it feeds on that which gives meaning to life.”"

For me, it has been emotional to go back to what I have learned when studying general relativity and quantum mechanics, so many years ago. And so exciting to learn the new steps that have been made during the past 50 years. I now have an idea of what originates the arrow of time, and this itself is fantastic! Go read it! And stick to it until the end!"

39,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"I have read a lot of popular physics books and many of them just go over the same ground, but this one was a bit new and different. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of relativity is comfortable with the idea that time passes at different rates depending on the relative velocities of two observers, but Rovelli takes us a step further -- it is not just the rate at which time passes that depends on point of view, it is time itself. Rovelli starts by showing how time and entropy are intimately related as the only physical concepts which have an irreversible forward arrow pointing to the future. He then explains how the level of entropy of a system is a function of point of view -- whether a given system is disordered depends on how order is defined (I remember telling my stepmother when I was a teenager that my room was neat because I could find everything I needed in the mess.) If time is a function of entropy and entropy depends on point of view, then perhaps time does too. Time, like entropy, becomes a function of blurring, of uncertainty about things that we do not or cannot measure. Hmmmm. At the very least it is an intriguing idea; maybe it is even true. Perhaps it only appears to us that the universe must have started with the Big Bang and may end with entropic heat death because of what time and entropy look like to us from our localized point of view. So there is no universal physical truth, or at least not one that depends on space and time, which turn out to be localized concepts. But perhaps there are universal concepts for how things relate to one another that are not built into a fixed unchanging view of space and time and that can therefore give us a broad picture of the universe. Rovelli teases us with the assertion that his field, loop quantum gravity, manages to take time out of the most basic equations of the universe, but he doesn't try to explain how, probably because it is too complex for a popular book.I enjoyed this book as an audiobook with a dazzlingly good narration by Benedict Cumberbatch. Sometimes science books are better enjoyed in print editions, but this one worked quite well in audio. The quality of the writing is excellent and clear. The explanations of scientific ideas are not simple but they are comprenhensible even for a person with a limited background in physics and no math. And the rich, expressive voice of Mr. Cumberbatch makes the experience complete."
40,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,3,"This introduction to the modern physicist's understanding of time is difficult to rate for a few reasons. First of all, I already knew about most of these concepts so there wasn't really anything revelatory here. Had I not brought this foreknowledge to this book, I think I may have found it more interesting. Also, acknowledging the linguistic difficulty of discussing time as frequently people mean very different things when using the word, Rovelli falls victim to this very problem throughout the book. Occasionally he gets the point across very well only to confuse the issue he just clarified in the next paragraph. Lastly, I don't think we need all of the literary and spiritual meanderings he gets into. I know that it is trendy for physicists to bring in literature and use overly flowery language to describe the most complicated of scientific discussions but the degree to which this is used here is quite extreme, and in a work of such brevity, seems like a replacement for genuine profundity as opposed to being additive. I admire Rovelli's interest in bringing these important concepts to a mass audience, even if there is some depth and rigor lost in the effort. However, if your notion of time is that which comes from grade school then perhaps this will be an effective précis for future study, if you want a more interesting discussion about how these notions relate to your functioning as a human then I would recommend, ""Your Brain is a Time Machine,"" by Dean Buonomano.

42,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,4,"The book is split into three parts. 1) The Crumbling of Time2)The World without Time3)The Sources of TimeRovelli attempts to show how our illusions have arisen, from aspects of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics. He argues that our perception of time’s flow depends entirely on our inability to see the world in all its detail. Quantum uncertainty means we cannot know the positions and speeds of all the particles in the Universe. If we could, there would be no entropy and no unraveling of time. Rovelli originated this ‘thermal time hypothesis’ with French mathematician Alain Connes.Maybe, this book alone is not enough to pass judgment as a lay reader but the book has an extraordinary poetic essence to transmute into the Rovelie's reality. :)"

48,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874093-janna,2,"Never thought I’d see the day where I complained that a book leaned too far into the poetic, but here we are. I liked Part One, which lays out the physics behind why time is not as it seems, but Part Two goes too much into philosophising without much of a sound basis and without adequately laying out the supporting physics. Where Reality Is Not What It Seems took readers through a series of logical steps, provided the appropriate rigour, and created a sound place from which to begin amping up the complexity, The Order of Time begins in science and then swerves the argument into flowery interpretations of thinkers from St Augustine to Kant to Buddha. His ultimate conclusion seems to be that our experience of time is something that depends on our human lens: something that philosophers have said for centuries (and he quotes those philosophers). In support of this in the physics side of things, he briefly explains the irreversibility of ever-increasing entropy and how the relations between particles are blurred such that we are unable to perceive them. ""Therefore, our vision of the world is blurred because the physical interactions between the part of the world to which we belong and the rest are blind to many variables. ... This does not mean that blurring is a mental construct; it depends on actual, existing physical interactions."" He then switches to philosophy and quotes Hans Reichenbach, writing that time causes anxiety; as a result, we have imagined the existence of eternity and heaven and higher realms. And from there he suggests: ""Perhaps, ultimately, the emotional dimension of time is not the film of mist that prevents us from apprehending the nature of time objectively. Perhaps the emotion of time is precisely what time is for us."" His foray into the emotions is rooted more in literature and music, which (knowing how poets think) can be hit or miss. My main issue, however, is this. There is a difference between (1) humans being constructed such that we are unable to perceive the reality of time and (2) the emotions that arise from our particular experience of time. Those emotions might well cause us to be attached to time or have an awareness of it that doesn't match reality. But that's not the same as saying that, as humans, the structure of our minds and the physical interactions of slice of the universe we occupy are such that we are unable to perceive temporal reality, which is what I took his argument to be. Emotions are far more like a mental construct than the blurring of thermodynamic interactions occurring in the physical world. And what he says about emotions seems to suggest that we refuse to see reality, not that we are unable to (one could imagine a person who wasn't caught up with anxiety about time and didn't experience those obscuring emotions). Maybe he wasn't trying to put forward a serious argument for the place of emotions or maybe I'm reading ungenerously. Perhaps he was simply swept up with the poetry of it all, but that leads to confusion and makes the entire text less credible.I’m not a physicist and I know this is a pop science book — emphasis on the pop — but by the end it was a pop philosophy book sprinkled over with poetry and references to the likes of the Mahabharata, Bach, and the book of Job. The final chapter consists of his musings on what really drives us as human beings — and I do think it's all connected and that the final chapter drives at the point that really matters, but he didn't earn that ending. He didn't lay out the path correctly and, consequently, his broader conclusions on life feel flimsy. While physics and philosophy certainly have implications for one another, and there is truth also in art and poetry, The Order of Time does not result in a successful mix."
49,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,4,"In The Order of Time, Carlo Rovelli sticks to the theme that reality is not what it seems, in this case focusing entirely on the concept of time. In a sense, the history of science can be described as an uncompromising assault on intuition and common sense. The Earth appears flat and stationary, but in reality spins and soars through space at 67,000 miles per hour. Humans appear to be a species of their own special creation, but in reality are simply naturally evolved primates.These ideas are familiar by now, but they were revolutionary at the time of their discovery. What Rovelli is pointing out is that science may not be done with us yet—the next assault on our common sense might be the revelation of a world without time. Rovelli points out that what we label as “common sense” is often the intellectual work of past thinkers—who may or may not have gotten things right. How we think about time—our common sense notions of it—have in fact been shaped by past thinkers, the two most prominent being Aristotle and Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton thought that time was universal and absolute, that the variable “t” applied to everyone everywhere and continued to tick on even if everything in the universe stood still. Aristotle, in contrast, thought of time simply as the measure of change, and that without change it made no sense to talk about time in any absolute or universal sense. Because Aristotle got so much wrong in so many fields, you might think you ought to favor Newton in this debate, but according to Rovelli you’d be wrong to do so. Aristotle’s picture of time is closer to reality, as confirmed by the work of Albert Einstein. Einstein demonstrated that time is relative, not absolute. We now know that time moves slower at lower altitudes and at higher speeds. Someone living in the plains will age less than someone living in the mountains and someone traveling at high speeds will age less than someone stationary. This counterintuitive notion does not sit well with common sense, but that’s the point: reality is not, and has never been, what it seems. What all of this adds up to is that there is no such thing as universal time; there is only time for you, from your perspective, in relation to other objects. Reality is a world of events and changing quantities, not of shapes and universal space and time. And this is precisely what quantum physics demonstrates, where the equations that work have no time variable at all. So the flow of time is simply a psychological construct, an illusion, and one we may need to discard if we are to penetrate further into the depths of reality. But, if time is not embedded in the fabric of reality, it does beg the question: where does our concept of time come from? In a word: entropy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that entropy can never decrease, and increasing entropy is the way our minds mark the passing of time. Since entropy cannot be reversed, time flows in one direction from past to future. And so, entropy is part of the basic fabric of reality and time is simply our way of measuring it. That is, unless we’re talking quantum mechanics, which needs no time variable at all.----------------------------------------What should we make of this claim? Unless you are working in the field of quantum physics, it would be difficult to refute what Rovelli is saying. If the quantum equations do not require time, then either time is an illusion or else we don’t really understand the quantum world. You’ll have to read the book to get a handle on the more technical aspects that I won’t hesitate to admit flew right over my head. One point of contention I can offer, however, is regarding Rovelli’s claim that the concept of a “universal present” is nonsensical. Here’s how he describes it:Hypothetically, if you had a friend on another planet four light-years away, would both of you be experiencing the same present moment? According to Rovelli, there is no such present moment that applies to both of you.If you were to look at your friend through a telescope, you would be seeing him four years ago, because that’s how long the light would take to travel back to you. So your “now” and his “now” cannot be said to be occuring at the same present moment.But wait, is this right? I’m not so sure. Yes, it’s true that, looking through the telescope, you would be seeing your friend four years earlier, due to the limitation of the speed of light. But, if you were to continue to look through the telescope for four more years, you would see your friend’s “now” moment precisely four years later, and that would only be true if there was an initial present moment that was the same for both of you. So in a sense there is a universal present, it’s just not accessible to us perceptually due to the constraints of the speed of light. Maybe this is a small point, but I think it shows that a universal present has to exist, even if, due to the nature of the universe, time can only be perceived locally. In any case, it’s interesting to contemplate that time is simply the psychological measure of change, and that the underlying changes can speed up or slow down depending on your position and speed relative to other objects. This is the world of relativity and reality, which banishes Newton’s universal clock and redeems Aristotle’s notion of change. A final point to consider is that, if time is only a psychological construct, and is not in any objective sense part of the universe, then this could be the final nail in religion’s casket: without time, without a beginning, there is no need for “creation.” -------------------------------------------This is all, of course, a major oversimplification of the book. Rovelli provides an infinitely more detailed account and his excursions into the quantum realm are fascinating for those who have the interest and patience. He is a skilled and clear writer, and his Feynman-esque ability to explain complex topics in simple terms with ample metaphor and analogy is something you’ll appreciate when the topic turns to quantum loop gravity. Overall, it’s a fascinating book that will help you think more clearly about the concept of time, including what a world without time looks like. "
50,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2599582-aviva,3,"Carlo Rovelli does an amazing job of putting scientific concepts that are incredibly difficult to grasp into beautiful words. That said, I found this one harder going than his earlier Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. Maybe because it went deeper into one topic and thus delved into more difficult territory, or maybe just because the truth about time is so counterintuitive. Either way, it made my brain hurt in a good way (most of the time). But I would still recommend his earlier book first to those who want to get their toes wet in some of modern physics' more incomprehensible topics."
51,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4023528-vheissu,3,"I recommend this book to readers of popular science and philosophy. Physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers will be familiar with the themes already and probably have nothing much to learn here.Rovelli makes clear if not explicit that our difficulty in understanding ""time"" isn't limited to our intellectual shortcomings or even the precision of our measuring instruments, but also a limitation in our language. We simply don't have the vocabulary to understand or express the nature of ""time"" in any other than what the author calls ""naïve"" terms (p. 199), which is to say, our everyday, common-sense meaning of the word (past, present, and future, cause and effect). Even the common sense meaning of ""time"" is deeply flawed (see below), much less relevant to quantum and relativistic ""time."" We need to find terms other than ""time"" to express and understand events that occur beyond our perceptible senses.Rovelli offers a few alternative names for quantum and relativistic events, but the best he can do is apply adjective modifiers to the base noun (""thermal time,"" p. 134, or ""quantum time,"" p. 137). What he--we--needs to do is drop the adjective-noun combination altogether and come up with new terms to describe the relationship of events at micro- and macroscopic levels. As long as we include the noun, ""time,"" in trying to explain these things, confusion can only result, since our common-sense understanding of ""time"" is flawed and inhibits understanding of superficially similar but actually qualitatively different phenomena.Naïve Time. The flaws in our everyday, common sense understanding of ""time"" are well-known and documented. There is no single ""now."" ""Time"" does not pass at the same rate for all or even any two observers. ""Time"" is different for observers at different distances from a mass. A person's head experiences a different ""time"" than does her feet! The difference is imperceptible to human senses but it is not unmeasurable; we now have sufficiently precise instruments to measure those differences.This is not to say that our naïve understanding of ""time"" is so flawed as to be unuseful. The establishment of standard time zones in the late 19th century was arguably one of the most consequential public policy decisions in the last 150 years. Communication and transportation technologies require such standardization and would be difficult without it. It was Einstein's efforts to find a way to standardize timepieces for railroads, after all, that led to his Special Theory of Relativity. So, as far as naïve ""time"" is concerned, the term has practical applications and need not be abandoned. We just need to stop using that word for quantum and relativistic investigation.Thermal Time. At relativistic levels, which is to say macroscopic, Rovelli defines ""time"" in terms of entropy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics establishes the ""arrow"" of time--past, present, future. Heat dissipates. The amount of heat in the universe is the same today as it was at the Big Bang, but it has diffused and continues to do so. Our measurement of ""time,"" therefore, is a measurement of entropy: low entropy is the past, high entropy is the future.In a few trillion years from now, the Universe may reach a state of maximum entropy, a cold, motionless condition in which ""time,"" as such, becomes a meaningless idea. ""Time"" will ""stop,"" or become irrelevant to the state of affairs. That is death.Quantum Time. At the microscopic level, which is to say subatomic, our naïve understanding of ""time"" is of no help at all. Subatomic events occur at such small scales and incredibly quick intervals that it becomes pointless to think in terms of order and duration. The smallest increment of time is called Planck Time, which is something like 10-43 seconds (the value 10 with 43 zeroes behind it, or a hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, p. 83); the corresponding Planck length is 10 -33. We have no means by which to observe such imperceptible events. Yet. The numbers are the result of mathematic equations, not the result of empirical measurement. So it is pointless to apply a clumsy term like ""time"" to quantum mechanics.Rovelli reminds us that it was Aristotle who first explored the philosophy and physics of ""time."" For Aristotle, ""time"" was a measurement of change; if nothing ever changed, there would be no ""time."" Newton offered a contradictory opinion. For the great physicist, ""time"" passed even in the absence of change. Both were a little right and a little wrong. Today, we understand that a state of changelessness has never existed in our Universe. We live in a soup of quantum particles that never stop changing. There is no such thing as an absolute vacuum. Quantum particles pop into and out of existence even in the ""vacuum"" of empty space. You can create an airless volume in a bottle, but you can't stop electromagnetic waves from passing through it. The closest the Universe will ever get to changelessness is when it reaches maximum entropy. And that is a long way off."
52,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,5,"Carlo Rovelli has the brilliance of Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein and the communicative skills of Carl Sagan. Otherwise he is an Italian theoretical physicist that specializes in quantum gravity and is a proponent, if not quite an advocate, of loop theory. Beyond that he is a philosopher with a heart for ancient poetry and love.And he brings all of it to bear in this delightful book about time, which, in the end, is life, and everything, including the context in which it unfolds. It would be in error to suggest that time doesn’t exist, but it would be equally in error to suggest that time is as simple as the continuum we record with our clocks.What I like most about the book is the fact that Rovelli recognizes that philosophy and science, if not two sides of the same coin, are cousins. He refers to Proust, which few scientists do, and suggests that while reason is among the best tools available for interpreting our “collective delirium,” it is “only an instrument, a pincer.”The science and the prose are very accessible. You will, however, have to be willing to think abstractly, a skill that in our wired, binary world seems to be greatly dissipating. And he is the first scientist I have read in a while who takes time to explain why the problem is sometimes not the science itself, but the limitations of language. Language is a human construction and has not kept up with our scientific revelation. Which is why theoretical physicists sometimes seem to be speaking another language. If only there was another language that was constructed in the world as we know it today, our communication would be so much easier and our knowledge would expand more rapidly. It would be impossible to summarize the knowledge contained in this book. You really have to read it. Here is a start, however: “The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.” If you can comprehend that the rest is largely additional perspective.And if the idea that universal time doesn’t exist in any absolute since seems a stretch, consider Rovelli’s simple explanation (I’m paraphrasing): People never used to worry about clocks. They worried about the cycle of sunshine and darkness. But that cycle is different in every single village, town, and city on the planet. The cycle varies both east to west and north to south. And back when we used to spend our lives in our little village we didn’t care. But then the scientists and engineers invented trains to take us from one village to the next. And people needed to know when the train left their village. But how can you develop a timetable when every village has its own time? You can’t. But, at the same time, it’s not quite practical to say that the whole world has just one time. Farmers don’t care what the sun is doing in London. They care what it’s doing on their farm. (China actually has no time zones by edict. The entire country is on Beijing time and there are significant practical implications.) The solution was the time zone, and it’s a compromise. Time zones are a construct and practical in the local sense, but highly inaccurate when talking about the universe. In the language of theoretical physics, they don’t exist.Eastern philosophers believe that reality is not knowable. It is real, but is made up of an infinite number of variables. We can only comprehend or think about a handful at a time. A tree is real. I can touch it and smell it. But it is not entirely knowable because there are too many variables (e.g. altitude, climate, soil, etc.) that define each tree for me to know them all. Time is the same way. Time is real but it is not knowable. Throw in the limitations of language and it begins to look like an illusion.To his great credit, Rovelli admits that there is much we don’t know. Think of a Seurat painting that has been blacked out. We have exposed a few, perhaps 10% (my number), of the original dots of pigment. It’s a lot, but we’re still guessing as to what the underlying picture is.And that’s pretty exciting. The key to our understanding to date, however, is the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy can never decrease. It’s critical to our understanding of time, as Rovelli explains. Personally I’m not convinced it’s inviolate. Perhaps we just haven’t uncovered enough dots of pigment yet. If entropy could work both ways it would explain a lot, but attraction does not equal fact. (Entropy obviously has a big part in causality, of course. Bidirectional entropy would be a huge boost for inductive reason.)It’s a short book and even if you get through a small amount of it you will learn a lot. Beyond writing in an accessible way, Rovelli comes off as very personable. The perfect person to sit down and share a cup of coffee with. If only he had the time. (Sorry)A marvelous book that I highly recommend."
53,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7999890-ken-gronnbeck,2,The book starts good but I get confused at the end. This book is not even close to the two other books I've read by him.

It's a marvel to me that such a relatively short book could completely overturn my conceptions of reality, Newtonian physics, and my sense of self. What I love most about The Order of Time is how it bridges the gap of hard maths into the realm of the human experience. So many of the ""wicked problems"" we talk about today in politics or sociology are down simply to the fact that the solution is imperminent. I realize that this book is an introduction to this field, and a very flowery one at that. I'm sure that people who are steeped in the field have thier issues with some of the poetic liberties Rovelli took in explaining some of the the concepts. The book also has one or two contradictions, and places where the author departs from his stated goal of relaying established theory in digestible terms to trying to convince the audience of his particular ""loop theory"" of time. I know from reading the reviews that many have the same problem with this book that I do with the likes of Sapiens by Yuval Harari. But this book is a fantastic and accessible gateway for those who want to be won over by the wonders of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics while always being afraid of ""the mathy bits."" On a personal note, this book has potentially one of my favorite quotes from any book I've read this year: ""The world... Is a boundless and disorderly network of quantum events... It is much more Naples than Singapore."" As one of the few who has been to Naples Italy and loved it, I now have a justification as to why! Thank you, Dr. Rovelli, for this and so much more.I will definitely be reading this book again, as I don't believe I was able to gleen all it has to offer."
57,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,4,"4.5 stars What is time? What does it really mean to say that time ‘passes’? Do we exist in time, or does time exist in us? What is the meaning of now?These are the questions that Carlo Rovelli tries to answer in The Order of Time. He takes us on a journey on how our understanding of the concept of time has changed from antiquity to the present and into the field of quantum gravity, his area of expertise. It is a magma of beautiful and exciting ideas, from physics to philosophy, “sometimes illuminating, sometimes confusing.”We perceive time as one dimensional thing, it has a direction, the past is completely different from the future. The past seems to be one of the most obvious things, it is fixed, we have traces of it, we have memories, there are books to read and learn about the past. Time is a great conceptual idea and works very well in our daily lives but is has a different meaning in quantum mechanics and general relativity. The elementary equations that govern the physical world fail to show any distinction between the past and the future.Time is not a single thing, says Rovelli, but a multi-layered concept, a combination of properties that we can dismount, one by one. What it remains when you take away all these properties, is nothing at all. This is perhaps best exemplified by the physicists John Wheeler and Bryce DeWitt back in the 1970s, when they attempted to unify relativity and quantum mechanics resulted in time essentially disappearing completely from their equation (known as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation), suggesting that time does not exist at all. Rovelli looks in detail at the nature of entropy, arguing that “what makes the world go round are not sources of energy but sources of low entropy. Without low entropy, energy would dilute into uniform heat and the world would go to sleep in a state of thermal equilibrium – there would no longer be any distinction between past and future, and nothing would happen.” Boltzmann understood that entropy is not just a fundamental quantity but a measure of how things are disordered - when you mix thing (disorder) entropy goes up. The fact that entropy has been low in the past leads to an important fact that is ubiquitous and crucial for the difference between past and future: the past leaves traces of itself in the present. The only cause of the difference between past and future, argues Rovelli, is the low energy of the past. This is an astounding idea that is hard to comprehend and perhaps even harder to accept. But it is also revealing, and told in Rovelli’s clear and concise style, makes perfect sense. Rovelli has a deep technical knowledge of his subject; at the same time, he writes beautifully and although I got lost several times when he discussed the strange world of loop quantum gravity, it was exciting to penetrate some layers of the mystery of time. This is an exquisite and intellectually challenging book. It takes time to read, although, reflecting on the various physical variables of time, you might think otherwise.  link:  my review "
58,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,3,"This is really a 2.5. I was following along fine until mid-way through the second part, and I'm not sure whether it was the translation or the physics that lost me. Through the fuzz, I just kept thinking, ""There has to be an easier way to say this."" And it turns out, there was: the final chapter (The Sources of Time) summarized all his points in a clear and understandable way. So, if he can say it so clearly there, what was up with the rest of the book? He tells readers that the notes are for those who really understand the physics of it, but I'd hesitate to say the rest of the book is for us 'normal folks.' More like us 'normal folks who do LSD/mushrooms', which he hinted at a few times. The other thing that I felt was a problem in the book is a problem I have in general with reductionist metaphysical conversations-- once Rovelli had laid it all out, he did a poor job of explaining the possible significance of the knowledge. He commented a couple of times that our 'naive image of time was suitable [necessary] for our daily life', and that 'at an elementary level there are no cats either, but we do not for this reason cease to bother with cats.' Knowing how time works does not change how we experience it (and he doesn't seem to imply that it should), or how humans find meaning in it. Rovelli worked hard to reinforce the sheer number of possible outcomes and, in the process, essentially undermined the importance of understanding that it was all a series of probabilistic events-- i.e, why cats? and if they once existed, why do cats continue to exist? <-- the point here is that he missed the chance to make a larger tie-in to the meaning of it all (or lack thereof). If this order of time shows us that there is no order, that everything is random, reduced to the physical interactions between all the pieces of the universe, and that this knowledge shouldn't change anything about how we live our lives, to say nothing of the fact that we are so myopic we may never understand it, then knowing how it all works would be meaningless, right? Maybe not. But if not, Rovelli did a poor job explaining why. One final note: After I finished reading The Order of Time, I went looking for reviews to see what I had missed (due to the translation or the physics). This review did a pretty good job of summing up a lot of my feelings:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
59,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315851-roozbeh-daneshvar,3,"Before I started reading this book, I asked myself what is it about time that he is going to say? Time seemed obvious and didn't need any more elaboration (I admit that I knew nothing about time). This book opened my eyes and exposed me to aspects of time that I had never imagined.There were many places throughout reading that I was astonished by the new perspectives. For example, how there is a symmetry between past and future in classical mechanics (you just reverse the time direction and bam, everything works well, even though backwards). As another example, I was amazed that how the author connected time to memory (or how do you perceive time if you do not remember anything). He also connected music to memory. You would not enjoy music if you do not have memory: for every note, you have a recollection of the previous note/notes and also an anticipation of the upcoming notes. Without that memory, every moment of a music is just a single note, which would be meaningless.One part that resonated with me was about death and the fear of death. It was exactly the same case for me, as I have mixed feelings of fear of death and an openness for embracing it, both at the same time. This book put the same concept in the framework of time for me. It talked about how time has been troubling to human beings in the history.The text switched between solid physics concepts and some philosophical or even anecdotal themes. To me, it seemed not as a balanced combination, but an incoherent concoction. A large part might be because of my lack of understanding of the topic. Yet, I am skeptical that a poor translation might have contributed, too. In general, I did not find it a well-written text (although this is a personal opinion).If you want to know about time (with which you are probably in touch with, or you'd better be), do consider reading this book. It might open new doors for you."

Rovelli's attempt to explain away thermodynamic-entropic time and the whole of complex systems by telling us ""it's all a blur"" - that our experience of past and future and the direction of time, of evolution, growth, decay, and the whole of biology is basically nothing but subjective phenomenology or the ignorance of human perception is simply laughable. What universe is he living in?To ignore the work of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world who've established the sciences of chaos, complexity, nonlinear systems, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics and assert that their view of time is somehow not real, some illusion or whatever, is arrogant and irresponsible, not to mention narrow-minded. This is scientific fundamentalism and works against the goal of science to produce a coherent system of thought across many domains. The Order of Time appears to be a last ditch attempt to revive the old Platonic-Newtonian deterministic worldview in the face of the contemporary view of emergence, probability, instability, nonlinearity, complexity, chaos, and irreversibility - a kind of marketing ploy to convince the public that the old view of physics still reigns supreme over all else. In this book, Rovelli appears to represent an old guard of physicists, extreme reductionists, who are unable to embrace the scientific revolution that has engulfed their science, the revolution that is complex, nonequilibrium, and nonlinear systems theory.

65,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Like a lot of young nerds, I had a period of fascination with advanced physics. Never enough to actually become all that good at it, mind you. I just about wrapped my brain around the wave-particle duality, in order to get my degree in Electrical Engineering. I took one course on Relativity. I found it all to be fascinating, and also really, really hard. There were other people, for whom it was equally fascinating, but more like ""fun"" than ""hard"". I was not one of those people.The primary benefit to me of having taken those courses as a youngster, was not that it did me the slightest bit of good whatsoever in my professional life in the semiconductor industry. It turns out that, truth be told, you don't have to be all that good at physics to make semiconductors, or even to test circuits made of them, or even to improve processes for making them. Perhaps you have to be really good at physics to invent them in the first place, but that was not a task I ever had to accomplish.No, the primary benefit was that, when someone invoked quantum physics or relativity to bolster their hand-wavy philosophy, I could recognize that they didn't know what they were talking about. There is, it turns out, nothing in quantum physics or relativity that proves or disproves anybody's idea about God, the meaning of life, whether there is an objective reality, or where consciousness comes from. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying, or just projecting their hopes onto the deeply unintuitive world of the very small or very fast.Still, Rovelli is himself a professional, one of those people who does actually know a lot more about physics than I do, and his book had two other things going for it. One, it was short, and a nice compact size. Two, it had a goodly amount of pictures. When I read something like advanced physics, the reality is I'm not ready to go through 800 pages' worth, and I need some diagrams, or sketches, or graphs, or something besides a wall of text with the occasional equation.It turns out that Rovelli is also apparently quite good at explaining things. It may have helped some that I had learned some of the early parts of the book before, but it had been decades, and I found myself wishing that he had been the guy writing my college physics textbooks, or perhaps teaching the classes. But then, it may also be that reading about physics for fun, is a lot more enjoyable than taking a test on it, which is going to be curved to guarantee that around 25% of the class gets a failing grade.Rovelli's thesis seems to be, that time is not a fundamental part of reality in the way that, say, mass or electromagnetism is. Rather, it is more like perspective. He claims that this is actually the pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian way of thinking about time. Time is nothing other than the order in which we experience things. Rovelli's claim (which I am unable to really evaluate the truth of), is that the modern idea of time as a dimension is Newton's, and while it may have been a reasonable operating assumption for him at that, uh, time, it isn't the literal truth. Just as quantum physics and relativity have upended other parts of Newton's worldview, Rovelli says that they have returned us to a pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian idea of time.One is reminded of the saying, ""time is what keeps everything from happening at once"". Rovelli seems to be saying something more like, time is the order in which we perceive things as happening. If we are all, relative to one another, moving at very low speeds (compared to the speed of light in a vacuum), then we never notice that my time is different than yours. Once you think about the very fast, very big, or very small, our intuitions don't work.There was also some stuff about entropy in there.To be honest, if I really wanted to understand what Rovelli was saying here, in depth, well enough to pass a test on it, I would need to read it again. And you know, I just might do that. But not yet, because I am once again in the blessed position of being able to read about physics for exactly as much as I feel like, and neither more nor less. I believe that it is true for me, anyway, that a little more time should pass before I reread this one.It was pretty good, though, so perhaps not too much time."
66,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison,4,"Originally reviewed at The Book Wheel.Consider the following: time passes faster in the mountains than it does at sea level. If this sentence confounds you but piques your interest, then I can already tell you that you want to read The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli, which answers questions such as what is time? Is there a universal time? What does it mean to live in the present? Does the present exist? Turns out, these are simple questions with no easy answers because time is complicated. I don’t mean that timezones are confusing or that time passing faster in the mountains is perplexing, but that at an elemental level, time doesn’t even exist the way we think it does.Luckily, The Order of Time takes an approachable, scientific look at these questions and explores ideas rooted in quantum physics, thermodynamics, and the human condition. It will expand your mind, confuse the heck out of you, and, if you’re like me, leave you pondering some pretty heavy philosophical conundrums.One thing I learned that does make sense is that there is no now because now is just the perception of time. By the time we perceive something happening, nanoseconds have already passed. This means that everything we do, think, say, or hear exists both in the past and the present depending on if you’re saying it or hearing it. In other words, time is so fleeting we’re more or less living in the future as much as we are the present. For example, I can ask what you’re doing right now (reading this sentence) but by the time you process the words I have written, the act of reading it is in the past. WHAT?!Taking this one step further, this also means two people are never actually in the same place at the same time. I can speak to you, but by the time you perceive my actions, I am already living in the past. Throw in timezones and it’s easy to see why there’s no true, universal time. Time exists in relativity. Perhaps the author says it best when he said, “Physics does not describe how things evolve “in time” but how things evolve in their own times, and how “times” evolve relative to each other.”This relativity also applies to what it means to exist. One example The Order of Time gives is the emergence of teams. A group of children can line up and pick teams, one by one, for a soccer game. This new team doesn’t already exist, but it emerges and then does exist because different entities combine to make it so. So if you can create something out of nothing, what does that mean for the whole of existence? And is existence all relative? Some might say that a literary character doesn’t exist, as in they are not “real”, but yet they do exist, if even in our collective minds. Existence, Rovelli argues, is grammatical: “Words such as “here,” “now,” “I,” “this,” “tonight” all assume a different meaning depending on who utters them and the circumstances in which they are uttered.”Philosophical pondering aside, Rovelli explains all of this by rooting it in science. He tackles major scientific theories of time, from Aristotle’s belief that time measures change to Newton’s idea that time is independent of us. He discusses entropy and how it evolves over time, linking it to the laws of thermodynamics and quantum physics.Yet despite this heavy reading, there’s a romantic quality to The Order of Time. Because in the end, it’s all about how we, as humans, perceive time. It is our own “blurred vision” that shapes how we see the world. We are made up of our experiences, traces, and narratives, and each is unique to us. And although the following quote isn’t about time, per se, it does speak to the larger question of whether the absence of something exists: “But it isn’t absence that causes sorrow. It is affection and love. Without affection, without love, such absences would cause us no pain. For this reason, even the pain caused by absence is, in the end, something good and even beautiful, because it feeds on that which gives meaning to life.”"

For me, it has been emotional to go back to what I have learned when studying general relativity and quantum mechanics, so many years ago. And so exciting to learn the new steps that have been made during the past 50 years. I now have an idea of what originates the arrow of time, and this itself is fantastic! Go read it! And stick to it until the end!"

69,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"I have read a lot of popular physics books and many of them just go over the same ground, but this one was a bit new and different. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of relativity is comfortable with the idea that time passes at different rates depending on the relative velocities of two observers, but Rovelli takes us a step further -- it is not just the rate at which time passes that depends on point of view, it is time itself. Rovelli starts by showing how time and entropy are intimately related as the only physical concepts which have an irreversible forward arrow pointing to the future. He then explains how the level of entropy of a system is a function of point of view -- whether a given system is disordered depends on how order is defined (I remember telling my stepmother when I was a teenager that my room was neat because I could find everything I needed in the mess.) If time is a function of entropy and entropy depends on point of view, then perhaps time does too. Time, like entropy, becomes a function of blurring, of uncertainty about things that we do not or cannot measure. Hmmmm. At the very least it is an intriguing idea; maybe it is even true. Perhaps it only appears to us that the universe must have started with the Big Bang and may end with entropic heat death because of what time and entropy look like to us from our localized point of view. So there is no universal physical truth, or at least not one that depends on space and time, which turn out to be localized concepts. But perhaps there are universal concepts for how things relate to one another that are not built into a fixed unchanging view of space and time and that can therefore give us a broad picture of the universe. Rovelli teases us with the assertion that his field, loop quantum gravity, manages to take time out of the most basic equations of the universe, but he doesn't try to explain how, probably because it is too complex for a popular book.I enjoyed this book as an audiobook with a dazzlingly good narration by Benedict Cumberbatch. Sometimes science books are better enjoyed in print editions, but this one worked quite well in audio. The quality of the writing is excellent and clear. The explanations of scientific ideas are not simple but they are comprenhensible even for a person with a limited background in physics and no math. And the rich, expressive voice of Mr. Cumberbatch makes the experience complete."
70,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,3,"This introduction to the modern physicist's understanding of time is difficult to rate for a few reasons. First of all, I already knew about most of these concepts so there wasn't really anything revelatory here. Had I not brought this foreknowledge to this book, I think I may have found it more interesting. Also, acknowledging the linguistic difficulty of discussing time as frequently people mean very different things when using the word, Rovelli falls victim to this very problem throughout the book. Occasionally he gets the point across very well only to confuse the issue he just clarified in the next paragraph. Lastly, I don't think we need all of the literary and spiritual meanderings he gets into. I know that it is trendy for physicists to bring in literature and use overly flowery language to describe the most complicated of scientific discussions but the degree to which this is used here is quite extreme, and in a work of such brevity, seems like a replacement for genuine profundity as opposed to being additive. I admire Rovelli's interest in bringing these important concepts to a mass audience, even if there is some depth and rigor lost in the effort. However, if your notion of time is that which comes from grade school then perhaps this will be an effective précis for future study, if you want a more interesting discussion about how these notions relate to your functioning as a human then I would recommend, ""Your Brain is a Time Machine,"" by Dean Buonomano.

He argues that our perception of time’s flow depends entirely on our inability to see the world in all its detail. Quantum uncertainty means we cannot know the positions and speeds of all the particles in the Universe. If we could, there would be no entropy and no unraveling of time. Rovelli originated this ‘thermal time hypothesis’ with French mathematician Alain Connes.Maybe, this book alone is not enough to pass judgment as a lay reader but the book has an extraordinary poetic essence to transmute into the Rovelie's reality. :)"

78,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874093-janna,2,"Never thought I’d see the day where I complained that a book leaned too far into the poetic, but here we are. I liked Part One, which lays out the physics behind why time is not as it seems, but Part Two goes too much into philosophising without much of a sound basis and without adequately laying out the supporting physics. Where Reality Is Not What It Seems took readers through a series of logical steps, provided the appropriate rigour, and created a sound place from which to begin amping up the complexity, The Order of Time begins in science and then swerves the argument into flowery interpretations of thinkers from St Augustine to Kant to Buddha. His ultimate conclusion seems to be that our experience of time is something that depends on our human lens: something that philosophers have said for centuries (and he quotes those philosophers). In support of this in the physics side of things, he briefly explains the irreversibility of ever-increasing entropy and how the relations between particles are blurred such that we are unable to perceive them. ""Therefore, our vision of the world is blurred because the physical interactions between the part of the world to which we belong and the rest are blind to many variables. ... This does not mean that blurring is a mental construct; it depends on actual, existing physical interactions."" He then switches to philosophy and quotes Hans Reichenbach, writing that time causes anxiety; as a result, we have imagined the existence of eternity and heaven and higher realms. And from there he suggests: ""Perhaps, ultimately, the emotional dimension of time is not the film of mist that prevents us from apprehending the nature of time objectively. Perhaps the emotion of time is precisely what time is for us."" His foray into the emotions is rooted more in literature and music, which (knowing how poets think) can be hit or miss. My main issue, however, is this. There is a difference between (1) humans being constructed such that we are unable to perceive the reality of time and (2) the emotions that arise from our particular experience of time. Those emotions might well cause us to be attached to time or have an awareness of it that doesn't match reality. But that's not the same as saying that, as humans, the structure of our minds and the physical interactions of slice of the universe we occupy are such that we are unable to perceive temporal reality, which is what I took his argument to be. Emotions are far more like a mental construct than the blurring of thermodynamic interactions occurring in the physical world. And what he says about emotions seems to suggest that we refuse to see reality, not that we are unable to (one could imagine a person who wasn't caught up with anxiety about time and didn't experience those obscuring emotions). Maybe he wasn't trying to put forward a serious argument for the place of emotions or maybe I'm reading ungenerously. Perhaps he was simply swept up with the poetry of it all, but that leads to confusion and makes the entire text less credible.I’m not a physicist and I know this is a pop science book — emphasis on the pop — but by the end it was a pop philosophy book sprinkled over with poetry and references to the likes of the Mahabharata, Bach, and the book of Job. The final chapter consists of his musings on what really drives us as human beings — and I do think it's all connected and that the final chapter drives at the point that really matters, but he didn't earn that ending. He didn't lay out the path correctly and, consequently, his broader conclusions on life feel flimsy. While physics and philosophy certainly have implications for one another, and there is truth also in art and poetry, The Order of Time does not result in a successful mix."
79,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,4,"In The Order of Time, Carlo Rovelli sticks to the theme that reality is not what it seems, in this case focusing entirely on the concept of time. In a sense, the history of science can be described as an uncompromising assault on intuition and common sense. The Earth appears flat and stationary, but in reality spins and soars through space at 67,000 miles per hour. Humans appear to be a species of their own special creation, but in reality are simply naturally evolved primates.These ideas are familiar by now, but they were revolutionary at the time of their discovery. What Rovelli is pointing out is that science may not be done with us yet—the next assault on our common sense might be the revelation of a world without time. Rovelli points out that what we label as “common sense” is often the intellectual work of past thinkers—who may or may not have gotten things right. How we think about time—our common sense notions of it—have in fact been shaped by past thinkers, the two most prominent being Aristotle and Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton thought that time was universal and absolute, that the variable “t” applied to everyone everywhere and continued to tick on even if everything in the universe stood still. Aristotle, in contrast, thought of time simply as the measure of change, and that without change it made no sense to talk about time in any absolute or universal sense. Because Aristotle got so much wrong in so many fields, you might think you ought to favor Newton in this debate, but according to Rovelli you’d be wrong to do so. Aristotle’s picture of time is closer to reality, as confirmed by the work of Albert Einstein. Einstein demonstrated that time is relative, not absolute. We now know that time moves slower at lower altitudes and at higher speeds. Someone living in the plains will age less than someone living in the mountains and someone traveling at high speeds will age less than someone stationary. This counterintuitive notion does not sit well with common sense, but that’s the point: reality is not, and has never been, what it seems. What all of this adds up to is that there is no such thing as universal time; there is only time for you, from your perspective, in relation to other objects. Reality is a world of events and changing quantities, not of shapes and universal space and time. And this is precisely what quantum physics demonstrates, where the equations that work have no time variable at all. So the flow of time is simply a psychological construct, an illusion, and one we may need to discard if we are to penetrate further into the depths of reality. But, if time is not embedded in the fabric of reality, it does beg the question: where does our concept of time come from? In a word: entropy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that entropy can never decrease, and increasing entropy is the way our minds mark the passing of time. Since entropy cannot be reversed, time flows in one direction from past to future. And so, entropy is part of the basic fabric of reality and time is simply our way of measuring it. That is, unless we’re talking quantum mechanics, which needs no time variable at all.----------------------------------------What should we make of this claim? Unless you are working in the field of quantum physics, it would be difficult to refute what Rovelli is saying. If the quantum equations do not require time, then either time is an illusion or else we don’t really understand the quantum world. You’ll have to read the book to get a handle on the more technical aspects that I won’t hesitate to admit flew right over my head. One point of contention I can offer, however, is regarding Rovelli’s claim that the concept of a “universal present” is nonsensical. Here’s how he describes it:Hypothetically, if you had a friend on another planet four light-years away, would both of you be experiencing the same present moment? According to Rovelli, there is no such present moment that applies to both of you.If you were to look at your friend through a telescope, you would be seeing him four years ago, because that’s how long the light would take to travel back to you. So your “now” and his “now” cannot be said to be occuring at the same present moment.But wait, is this right? I’m not so sure. Yes, it’s true that, looking through the telescope, you would be seeing your friend four years earlier, due to the limitation of the speed of light. But, if you were to continue to look through the telescope for four more years, you would see your friend’s “now” moment precisely four years later, and that would only be true if there was an initial present moment that was the same for both of you. So in a sense there is a universal present, it’s just not accessible to us perceptually due to the constraints of the speed of light. Maybe this is a small point, but I think it shows that a universal present has to exist, even if, due to the nature of the universe, time can only be perceived locally. In any case, it’s interesting to contemplate that time is simply the psychological measure of change, and that the underlying changes can speed up or slow down depending on your position and speed relative to other objects. This is the world of relativity and reality, which banishes Newton’s universal clock and redeems Aristotle’s notion of change. A final point to consider is that, if time is only a psychological construct, and is not in any objective sense part of the universe, then this could be the final nail in religion’s casket: without time, without a beginning, there is no need for “creation.” -------------------------------------------This is all, of course, a major oversimplification of the book. Rovelli provides an infinitely more detailed account and his excursions into the quantum realm are fascinating for those who have the interest and patience. He is a skilled and clear writer, and his Feynman-esque ability to explain complex topics in simple terms with ample metaphor and analogy is something you’ll appreciate when the topic turns to quantum loop gravity. Overall, it’s a fascinating book that will help you think more clearly about the concept of time, including what a world without time looks like. "
80,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2599582-aviva,3,"Carlo Rovelli does an amazing job of putting scientific concepts that are incredibly difficult to grasp into beautiful words. That said, I found this one harder going than his earlier Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. Maybe because it went deeper into one topic and thus delved into more difficult territory, or maybe just because the truth about time is so counterintuitive. Either way, it made my brain hurt in a good way (most of the time). But I would still recommend his earlier book first to those who want to get their toes wet in some of modern physics' more incomprehensible topics."
81,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4023528-vheissu,3,"I recommend this book to readers of popular science and philosophy. Physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers will be familiar with the themes already and probably have nothing much to learn here.Rovelli makes clear if not explicit that our difficulty in understanding ""time"" isn't limited to our intellectual shortcomings or even the precision of our measuring instruments, but also a limitation in our language. We simply don't have the vocabulary to understand or express the nature of ""time"" in any other than what the author calls ""naïve"" terms (p. 199), which is to say, our everyday, common-sense meaning of the word (past, present, and future, cause and effect). Even the common sense meaning of ""time"" is deeply flawed (see below), much less relevant to quantum and relativistic ""time."" We need to find terms other than ""time"" to express and understand events that occur beyond our perceptible senses.Rovelli offers a few alternative names for quantum and relativistic events, but the best he can do is apply adjective modifiers to the base noun (""thermal time,"" p. 134, or ""quantum time,"" p. 137). What he--we--needs to do is drop the adjective-noun combination altogether and come up with new terms to describe the relationship of events at micro- and macroscopic levels. As long as we include the noun, ""time,"" in trying to explain these things, confusion can only result, since our common-sense understanding of ""time"" is flawed and inhibits understanding of superficially similar but actually qualitatively different phenomena.Naïve Time. The flaws in our everyday, common sense understanding of ""time"" are well-known and documented. There is no single ""now."" ""Time"" does not pass at the same rate for all or even any two observers. ""Time"" is different for observers at different distances from a mass. A person's head experiences a different ""time"" than does her feet! The difference is imperceptible to human senses but it is not unmeasurable; we now have sufficiently precise instruments to measure those differences.This is not to say that our naïve understanding of ""time"" is so flawed as to be unuseful. The establishment of standard time zones in the late 19th century was arguably one of the most consequential public policy decisions in the last 150 years. Communication and transportation technologies require such standardization and would be difficult without it. It was Einstein's efforts to find a way to standardize timepieces for railroads, after all, that led to his Special Theory of Relativity. So, as far as naïve ""time"" is concerned, the term has practical applications and need not be abandoned. We just need to stop using that word for quantum and relativistic investigation.Thermal Time. At relativistic levels, which is to say macroscopic, Rovelli defines ""time"" in terms of entropy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics establishes the ""arrow"" of time--past, present, future. Heat dissipates. The amount of heat in the universe is the same today as it was at the Big Bang, but it has diffused and continues to do so. Our measurement of ""time,"" therefore, is a measurement of entropy: low entropy is the past, high entropy is the future.In a few trillion years from now, the Universe may reach a state of maximum entropy, a cold, motionless condition in which ""time,"" as such, becomes a meaningless idea. ""Time"" will ""stop,"" or become irrelevant to the state of affairs. That is death.Quantum Time. At the microscopic level, which is to say subatomic, our naïve understanding of ""time"" is of no help at all. Subatomic events occur at such small scales and incredibly quick intervals that it becomes pointless to think in terms of order and duration. The smallest increment of time is called Planck Time, which is something like 10-43 seconds (the value 10 with 43 zeroes behind it, or a hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, p. 83); the corresponding Planck length is 10 -33. We have no means by which to observe such imperceptible events. Yet. The numbers are the result of mathematic equations, not the result of empirical measurement. So it is pointless to apply a clumsy term like ""time"" to quantum mechanics.Rovelli reminds us that it was Aristotle who first explored the philosophy and physics of ""time."" For Aristotle, ""time"" was a measurement of change; if nothing ever changed, there would be no ""time."" Newton offered a contradictory opinion. For the great physicist, ""time"" passed even in the absence of change. Both were a little right and a little wrong. Today, we understand that a state of changelessness has never existed in our Universe. We live in a soup of quantum particles that never stop changing. There is no such thing as an absolute vacuum. Quantum particles pop into and out of existence even in the ""vacuum"" of empty space. You can create an airless volume in a bottle, but you can't stop electromagnetic waves from passing through it. The closest the Universe will ever get to changelessness is when it reaches maximum entropy. And that is a long way off."
82,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,5,"Carlo Rovelli has the brilliance of Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein and the communicative skills of Carl Sagan. Otherwise he is an Italian theoretical physicist that specializes in quantum gravity and is a proponent, if not quite an advocate, of loop theory. Beyond that he is a philosopher with a heart for ancient poetry and love.And he brings all of it to bear in this delightful book about time, which, in the end, is life, and everything, including the context in which it unfolds. It would be in error to suggest that time doesn’t exist, but it would be equally in error to suggest that time is as simple as the continuum we record with our clocks.What I like most about the book is the fact that Rovelli recognizes that philosophy and science, if not two sides of the same coin, are cousins. He refers to Proust, which few scientists do, and suggests that while reason is among the best tools available for interpreting our “collective delirium,” it is “only an instrument, a pincer.”The science and the prose are very accessible. You will, however, have to be willing to think abstractly, a skill that in our wired, binary world seems to be greatly dissipating. And he is the first scientist I have read in a while who takes time to explain why the problem is sometimes not the science itself, but the limitations of language. Language is a human construction and has not kept up with our scientific revelation. Which is why theoretical physicists sometimes seem to be speaking another language. If only there was another language that was constructed in the world as we know it today, our communication would be so much easier and our knowledge would expand more rapidly. It would be impossible to summarize the knowledge contained in this book. You really have to read it. Here is a start, however: “The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.” If you can comprehend that the rest is largely additional perspective.And if the idea that universal time doesn’t exist in any absolute since seems a stretch, consider Rovelli’s simple explanation (I’m paraphrasing): People never used to worry about clocks. They worried about the cycle of sunshine and darkness. But that cycle is different in every single village, town, and city on the planet. The cycle varies both east to west and north to south. And back when we used to spend our lives in our little village we didn’t care. But then the scientists and engineers invented trains to take us from one village to the next. And people needed to know when the train left their village. But how can you develop a timetable when every village has its own time? You can’t. But, at the same time, it’s not quite practical to say that the whole world has just one time. Farmers don’t care what the sun is doing in London. They care what it’s doing on their farm. (China actually has no time zones by edict. The entire country is on Beijing time and there are significant practical implications.) The solution was the time zone, and it’s a compromise. Time zones are a construct and practical in the local sense, but highly inaccurate when talking about the universe. In the language of theoretical physics, they don’t exist.Eastern philosophers believe that reality is not knowable. It is real, but is made up of an infinite number of variables. We can only comprehend or think about a handful at a time. A tree is real. I can touch it and smell it. But it is not entirely knowable because there are too many variables (e.g. altitude, climate, soil, etc.) that define each tree for me to know them all. Time is the same way. Time is real but it is not knowable. Throw in the limitations of language and it begins to look like an illusion.To his great credit, Rovelli admits that there is much we don’t know. Think of a Seurat painting that has been blacked out. We have exposed a few, perhaps 10% (my number), of the original dots of pigment. It’s a lot, but we’re still guessing as to what the underlying picture is.And that’s pretty exciting. The key to our understanding to date, however, is the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy can never decrease. It’s critical to our understanding of time, as Rovelli explains. Personally I’m not convinced it’s inviolate. Perhaps we just haven’t uncovered enough dots of pigment yet. If entropy could work both ways it would explain a lot, but attraction does not equal fact. (Entropy obviously has a big part in causality, of course. Bidirectional entropy would be a huge boost for inductive reason.)It’s a short book and even if you get through a small amount of it you will learn a lot. Beyond writing in an accessible way, Rovelli comes off as very personable. The perfect person to sit down and share a cup of coffee with. If only he had the time. (Sorry)A marvelous book that I highly recommend."

It's a marvel to me that such a relatively short book could completely overturn my conceptions of reality, Newtonian physics, and my sense of self. What I love most about The Order of Time is how it bridges the gap of hard maths into the realm of the human experience. So many of the ""wicked problems"" we talk about today in politics or sociology are down simply to the fact that the solution is imperminent. I realize that this book is an introduction to this field, and a very flowery one at that. I'm sure that people who are steeped in the field have thier issues with some of the poetic liberties Rovelli took in explaining some of the the concepts. The book also has one or two contradictions, and places where the author departs from his stated goal of relaying established theory in digestible terms to trying to convince the audience of his particular ""loop theory"" of time. I know from reading the reviews that many have the same problem with this book that I do with the likes of Sapiens by Yuval Harari. But this book is a fantastic and accessible gateway for those who want to be won over by the wonders of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics while always being afraid of ""the mathy bits."" On a personal note, this book has potentially one of my favorite quotes from any book I've read this year: ""The world... Is a boundless and disorderly network of quantum events... It is much more Naples than Singapore."" As one of the few who has been to Naples Italy and loved it, I now have a justification as to why! Thank you, Dr. Rovelli, for this and so much more.I will definitely be reading this book again, as I don't believe I was able to gleen all it has to offer."
87,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,4,"4.5 stars What is time? What does it really mean to say that time ‘passes’? Do we exist in time, or does time exist in us? What is the meaning of now?These are the questions that Carlo Rovelli tries to answer in The Order of Time. He takes us on a journey on how our understanding of the concept of time has changed from antiquity to the present and into the field of quantum gravity, his area of expertise. It is a magma of beautiful and exciting ideas, from physics to philosophy, “sometimes illuminating, sometimes confusing.”We perceive time as one dimensional thing, it has a direction, the past is completely different from the future. The past seems to be one of the most obvious things, it is fixed, we have traces of it, we have memories, there are books to read and learn about the past. Time is a great conceptual idea and works very well in our daily lives but is has a different meaning in quantum mechanics and general relativity. The elementary equations that govern the physical world fail to show any distinction between the past and the future.Time is not a single thing, says Rovelli, but a multi-layered concept, a combination of properties that we can dismount, one by one. What it remains when you take away all these properties, is nothing at all. This is perhaps best exemplified by the physicists John Wheeler and Bryce DeWitt back in the 1970s, when they attempted to unify relativity and quantum mechanics resulted in time essentially disappearing completely from their equation (known as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation), suggesting that time does not exist at all. Rovelli looks in detail at the nature of entropy, arguing that “what makes the world go round are not sources of energy but sources of low entropy. Without low entropy, energy would dilute into uniform heat and the world would go to sleep in a state of thermal equilibrium – there would no longer be any distinction between past and future, and nothing would happen.” Boltzmann understood that entropy is not just a fundamental quantity but a measure of how things are disordered - when you mix thing (disorder) entropy goes up. The fact that entropy has been low in the past leads to an important fact that is ubiquitous and crucial for the difference between past and future: the past leaves traces of itself in the present. The only cause of the difference between past and future, argues Rovelli, is the low energy of the past. This is an astounding idea that is hard to comprehend and perhaps even harder to accept. But it is also revealing, and told in Rovelli’s clear and concise style, makes perfect sense. Rovelli has a deep technical knowledge of his subject; at the same time, he writes beautifully and although I got lost several times when he discussed the strange world of loop quantum gravity, it was exciting to penetrate some layers of the mystery of time. This is an exquisite and intellectually challenging book. It takes time to read, although, reflecting on the various physical variables of time, you might think otherwise.  link:  my review "
88,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,3,"This is really a 2.5. I was following along fine until mid-way through the second part, and I'm not sure whether it was the translation or the physics that lost me. Through the fuzz, I just kept thinking, ""There has to be an easier way to say this."" And it turns out, there was: the final chapter (The Sources of Time) summarized all his points in a clear and understandable way. So, if he can say it so clearly there, what was up with the rest of the book? He tells readers that the notes are for those who really understand the physics of it, but I'd hesitate to say the rest of the book is for us 'normal folks.' More like us 'normal folks who do LSD/mushrooms', which he hinted at a few times. The other thing that I felt was a problem in the book is a problem I have in general with reductionist metaphysical conversations-- once Rovelli had laid it all out, he did a poor job of explaining the possible significance of the knowledge. He commented a couple of times that our 'naive image of time was suitable [necessary] for our daily life', and that 'at an elementary level there are no cats either, but we do not for this reason cease to bother with cats.' Knowing how time works does not change how we experience it (and he doesn't seem to imply that it should), or how humans find meaning in it. Rovelli worked hard to reinforce the sheer number of possible outcomes and, in the process, essentially undermined the importance of understanding that it was all a series of probabilistic events-- i.e, why cats? and if they once existed, why do cats continue to exist? <-- the point here is that he missed the chance to make a larger tie-in to the meaning of it all (or lack thereof). If this order of time shows us that there is no order, that everything is random, reduced to the physical interactions between all the pieces of the universe, and that this knowledge shouldn't change anything about how we live our lives, to say nothing of the fact that we are so myopic we may never understand it, then knowing how it all works would be meaningless, right? Maybe not. But if not, Rovelli did a poor job explaining why. One final note: After I finished reading The Order of Time, I went looking for reviews to see what I had missed (due to the translation or the physics). This review did a pretty good job of summing up a lot of my feelings:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
89,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315851-roozbeh-daneshvar,3,"Before I started reading this book, I asked myself what is it about time that he is going to say? Time seemed obvious and didn't need any more elaboration (I admit that I knew nothing about time). This book opened my eyes and exposed me to aspects of time that I had never imagined.There were many places throughout reading that I was astonished by the new perspectives. For example, how there is a symmetry between past and future in classical mechanics (you just reverse the time direction and bam, everything works well, even though backwards). As another example, I was amazed that how the author connected time to memory (or how do you perceive time if you do not remember anything). He also connected music to memory. You would not enjoy music if you do not have memory: for every note, you have a recollection of the previous note/notes and also an anticipation of the upcoming notes. Without that memory, every moment of a music is just a single note, which would be meaningless.One part that resonated with me was about death and the fear of death. It was exactly the same case for me, as I have mixed feelings of fear of death and an openness for embracing it, both at the same time. This book put the same concept in the framework of time for me. It talked about how time has been troubling to human beings in the history.The text switched between solid physics concepts and some philosophical or even anecdotal themes. To me, it seemed not as a balanced combination, but an incoherent concoction. A large part might be because of my lack of understanding of the topic. Yet, I am skeptical that a poor translation might have contributed, too. In general, I did not find it a well-written text (although this is a personal opinion).If you want to know about time (with which you are probably in touch with, or you'd better be), do consider reading this book. It might open new doors for you."

Rovelli's attempt to explain away thermodynamic-entropic time and the whole of complex systems by telling us ""it's all a blur"" - that our experience of past and future and the direction of time, of evolution, growth, decay, and the whole of biology is basically nothing but subjective phenomenology or the ignorance of human perception is simply laughable. What universe is he living in?To ignore the work of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world who've established the sciences of chaos, complexity, nonlinear systems, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics and assert that their view of time is somehow not real, some illusion or whatever, is arrogant and irresponsible, not to mention narrow-minded. This is scientific fundamentalism and works against the goal of science to produce a coherent system of thought across many domains. The Order of Time appears to be a last ditch attempt to revive the old Platonic-Newtonian deterministic worldview in the face of the contemporary view of emergence, probability, instability, nonlinearity, complexity, chaos, and irreversibility - a kind of marketing ploy to convince the public that the old view of physics still reigns supreme over all else. In this book, Rovelli appears to represent an old guard of physicists, extreme reductionists, who are unable to embrace the scientific revolution that has engulfed their science, the revolution that is complex, nonequilibrium, and nonlinear systems theory.

95,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Like a lot of young nerds, I had a period of fascination with advanced physics. Never enough to actually become all that good at it, mind you. I just about wrapped my brain around the wave-particle duality, in order to get my degree in Electrical Engineering. I took one course on Relativity. I found it all to be fascinating, and also really, really hard. There were other people, for whom it was equally fascinating, but more like ""fun"" than ""hard"". I was not one of those people.The primary benefit to me of having taken those courses as a youngster, was not that it did me the slightest bit of good whatsoever in my professional life in the semiconductor industry. It turns out that, truth be told, you don't have to be all that good at physics to make semiconductors, or even to test circuits made of them, or even to improve processes for making them. Perhaps you have to be really good at physics to invent them in the first place, but that was not a task I ever had to accomplish.No, the primary benefit was that, when someone invoked quantum physics or relativity to bolster their hand-wavy philosophy, I could recognize that they didn't know what they were talking about. There is, it turns out, nothing in quantum physics or relativity that proves or disproves anybody's idea about God, the meaning of life, whether there is an objective reality, or where consciousness comes from. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying, or just projecting their hopes onto the deeply unintuitive world of the very small or very fast.Still, Rovelli is himself a professional, one of those people who does actually know a lot more about physics than I do, and his book had two other things going for it. One, it was short, and a nice compact size. Two, it had a goodly amount of pictures. When I read something like advanced physics, the reality is I'm not ready to go through 800 pages' worth, and I need some diagrams, or sketches, or graphs, or something besides a wall of text with the occasional equation.It turns out that Rovelli is also apparently quite good at explaining things. It may have helped some that I had learned some of the early parts of the book before, but it had been decades, and I found myself wishing that he had been the guy writing my college physics textbooks, or perhaps teaching the classes. But then, it may also be that reading about physics for fun, is a lot more enjoyable than taking a test on it, which is going to be curved to guarantee that around 25% of the class gets a failing grade.Rovelli's thesis seems to be, that time is not a fundamental part of reality in the way that, say, mass or electromagnetism is. Rather, it is more like perspective. He claims that this is actually the pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian way of thinking about time. Time is nothing other than the order in which we experience things. Rovelli's claim (which I am unable to really evaluate the truth of), is that the modern idea of time as a dimension is Newton's, and while it may have been a reasonable operating assumption for him at that, uh, time, it isn't the literal truth. Just as quantum physics and relativity have upended other parts of Newton's worldview, Rovelli says that they have returned us to a pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian idea of time.One is reminded of the saying, ""time is what keeps everything from happening at once"". Rovelli seems to be saying something more like, time is the order in which we perceive things as happening. If we are all, relative to one another, moving at very low speeds (compared to the speed of light in a vacuum), then we never notice that my time is different than yours. Once you think about the very fast, very big, or very small, our intuitions don't work.There was also some stuff about entropy in there.To be honest, if I really wanted to understand what Rovelli was saying here, in depth, well enough to pass a test on it, I would need to read it again. And you know, I just might do that. But not yet, because I am once again in the blessed position of being able to read about physics for exactly as much as I feel like, and neither more nor less. I believe that it is true for me, anyway, that a little more time should pass before I reread this one.It was pretty good, though, so perhaps not too much time."
96,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison,4,"Originally reviewed at The Book Wheel.Consider the following: time passes faster in the mountains than it does at sea level. If this sentence confounds you but piques your interest, then I can already tell you that you want to read The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli, which answers questions such as what is time? Is there a universal time? What does it mean to live in the present? Does the present exist? Turns out, these are simple questions with no easy answers because time is complicated. I don’t mean that timezones are confusing or that time passing faster in the mountains is perplexing, but that at an elemental level, time doesn’t even exist the way we think it does.Luckily, The Order of Time takes an approachable, scientific look at these questions and explores ideas rooted in quantum physics, thermodynamics, and the human condition. It will expand your mind, confuse the heck out of you, and, if you’re like me, leave you pondering some pretty heavy philosophical conundrums.One thing I learned that does make sense is that there is no now because now is just the perception of time. By the time we perceive something happening, nanoseconds have already passed. This means that everything we do, think, say, or hear exists both in the past and the present depending on if you’re saying it or hearing it. In other words, time is so fleeting we’re more or less living in the future as much as we are the present. For example, I can ask what you’re doing right now (reading this sentence) but by the time you process the words I have written, the act of reading it is in the past. WHAT?!Taking this one step further, this also means two people are never actually in the same place at the same time. I can speak to you, but by the time you perceive my actions, I am already living in the past. Throw in timezones and it’s easy to see why there’s no true, universal time. Time exists in relativity. Perhaps the author says it best when he said, “Physics does not describe how things evolve “in time” but how things evolve in their own times, and how “times” evolve relative to each other.”This relativity also applies to what it means to exist. One example The Order of Time gives is the emergence of teams. A group of children can line up and pick teams, one by one, for a soccer game. This new team doesn’t already exist, but it emerges and then does exist because different entities combine to make it so. So if you can create something out of nothing, what does that mean for the whole of existence? And is existence all relative? Some might say that a literary character doesn’t exist, as in they are not “real”, but yet they do exist, if even in our collective minds. Existence, Rovelli argues, is grammatical: “Words such as “here,” “now,” “I,” “this,” “tonight” all assume a different meaning depending on who utters them and the circumstances in which they are uttered.”Philosophical pondering aside, Rovelli explains all of this by rooting it in science. He tackles major scientific theories of time, from Aristotle’s belief that time measures change to Newton’s idea that time is independent of us. He discusses entropy and how it evolves over time, linking it to the laws of thermodynamics and quantum physics.Yet despite this heavy reading, there’s a romantic quality to The Order of Time. Because in the end, it’s all about how we, as humans, perceive time. It is our own “blurred vision” that shapes how we see the world. We are made up of our experiences, traces, and narratives, and each is unique to us. And although the following quote isn’t about time, per se, it does speak to the larger question of whether the absence of something exists: “But it isn’t absence that causes sorrow. It is affection and love. Without affection, without love, such absences would cause us no pain. For this reason, even the pain caused by absence is, in the end, something good and even beautiful, because it feeds on that which gives meaning to life.”"

For me, it has been emotional to go back to what I have learned when studying general relativity and quantum mechanics, so many years ago.

99,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"I have read a lot of popular physics books and many of them just go over the same ground, but this one was a bit new and different. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of relativity is comfortable with the idea that time passes at different rates depending on the relative velocities of two observers, but Rovelli takes us a step further -- it is not just the rate at which time passes that depends on point of view, it is time itself. Rovelli starts by showing how time and entropy are intimately related as the only physical concepts which have an irreversible forward arrow pointing to the future. He then explains how the level of entropy of a system is a function of point of view -- whether a given system is disordered depends on how order is defined (I remember telling my stepmother when I was a teenager that my room was neat because I could find everything I needed in the mess.) If time is a function of entropy and entropy depends on point of view, then perhaps time does too. Time, like entropy, becomes a function of blurring, of uncertainty about things that we do not or cannot measure. Hmmmm. At the very least it is an intriguing idea; maybe it is even true. Perhaps it only appears to us that the universe must have started with the Big Bang and may end with entropic heat death because of what time and entropy look like to us from our localized point of view. So there is no universal physical truth, or at least not one that depends on space and time, which turn out to be localized concepts. But perhaps there are universal concepts for how things relate to one another that are not built into a fixed unchanging view of space and time and that can therefore give us a broad picture of the universe. Rovelli teases us with the assertion that his field, loop quantum gravity, manages to take time out of the most basic equations of the universe, but he doesn't try to explain how, probably because it is too complex for a popular book.I enjoyed this book as an audiobook with a dazzlingly good narration by Benedict Cumberbatch. Sometimes science books are better enjoyed in print editions, but this one worked quite well in audio. The quality of the writing is excellent and clear. The explanations of scientific ideas are not simple but they are comprenhensible even for a person with a limited background in physics and no math. And the rich, expressive voice of Mr. Cumberbatch makes the experience complete."
100,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,3,"This introduction to the modern physicist's understanding of time is difficult to rate for a few reasons. First of all, I already knew about most of these concepts so there wasn't really anything revelatory here. Had I not brought this foreknowledge to this book, I think I may have found it more interesting. Also, acknowledging the linguistic difficulty of discussing time as frequently people mean very different things when using the word, Rovelli falls victim to this very problem throughout the book. Occasionally he gets the point across very well only to confuse the issue he just clarified in the next paragraph. Lastly, I don't think we need all of the literary and spiritual meanderings he gets into. I know that it is trendy for physicists to bring in literature and use overly flowery language to describe the most complicated of scientific discussions but the degree to which this is used here is quite extreme, and in a work of such brevity, seems like a replacement for genuine profundity as opposed to being additive. I admire Rovelli's interest in bringing these important concepts to a mass audience, even if there is some depth and rigor lost in the effort. However, if your notion of time is that which comes from grade school then perhaps this will be an effective précis for future study, if you want a more interesting discussion about how these notions relate to your functioning as a human then I would recommend, ""Your Brain is a Time Machine,"" by Dean Buonomano.

He argues that our perception of time’s flow depends entirely on our inability to see the world in all its detail. Quantum uncertainty means we cannot know the positions and speeds of all the particles in the Universe. If we could, there would be no entropy and no unraveling of time. Rovelli originated this ‘thermal time hypothesis’ with French mathematician Alain Connes.Maybe, this book alone is not enough to pass judgment as a lay reader but the book has an extraordinary poetic essence to transmute into the Rovelie's reality. :)"

108,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874093-janna,2,"Never thought I’d see the day where I complained that a book leaned too far into the poetic, but here we are. I liked Part One, which lays out the physics behind why time is not as it seems, but Part Two goes too much into philosophising without much of a sound basis and without adequately laying out the supporting physics. Where Reality Is Not What It Seems took readers through a series of logical steps, provided the appropriate rigour, and created a sound place from which to begin amping up the complexity, The Order of Time begins in science and then swerves the argument into flowery interpretations of thinkers from St Augustine to Kant to Buddha. His ultimate conclusion seems to be that our experience of time is something that depends on our human lens: something that philosophers have said for centuries (and he quotes those philosophers). In support of this in the physics side of things, he briefly explains the irreversibility of ever-increasing entropy and how the relations between particles are blurred such that we are unable to perceive them. ""Therefore, our vision of the world is blurred because the physical interactions between the part of the world to which we belong and the rest are blind to many variables. ... This does not mean that blurring is a mental construct; it depends on actual, existing physical interactions."" He then switches to philosophy and quotes Hans Reichenbach, writing that time causes anxiety; as a result, we have imagined the existence of eternity and heaven and higher realms. And from there he suggests: ""Perhaps, ultimately, the emotional dimension of time is not the film of mist that prevents us from apprehending the nature of time objectively. Perhaps the emotion of time is precisely what time is for us."" His foray into the emotions is rooted more in literature and music, which (knowing how poets think) can be hit or miss. My main issue, however, is this. There is a difference between (1) humans being constructed such that we are unable to perceive the reality of time and (2) the emotions that arise from our particular experience of time. Those emotions might well cause us to be attached to time or have an awareness of it that doesn't match reality. But that's not the same as saying that, as humans, the structure of our minds and the physical interactions of slice of the universe we occupy are such that we are unable to perceive temporal reality, which is what I took his argument to be. Emotions are far more like a mental construct than the blurring of thermodynamic interactions occurring in the physical world. And what he says about emotions seems to suggest that we refuse to see reality, not that we are unable to (one could imagine a person who wasn't caught up with anxiety about time and didn't experience those obscuring emotions). Maybe he wasn't trying to put forward a serious argument for the place of emotions or maybe I'm reading ungenerously. Perhaps he was simply swept up with the poetry of it all, but that leads to confusion and makes the entire text less credible.I’m not a physicist and I know this is a pop science book — emphasis on the pop — but by the end it was a pop philosophy book sprinkled over with poetry and references to the likes of the Mahabharata, Bach, and the book of Job. The final chapter consists of his musings on what really drives us as human beings — and I do think it's all connected and that the final chapter drives at the point that really matters, but he didn't earn that ending. He didn't lay out the path correctly and, consequently, his broader conclusions on life feel flimsy. While physics and philosophy certainly have implications for one another, and there is truth also in art and poetry, The Order of Time does not result in a successful mix."
109,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,4,"In The Order of Time, Carlo Rovelli sticks to the theme that reality is not what it seems, in this case focusing entirely on the concept of time. In a sense, the history of science can be described as an uncompromising assault on intuition and common sense. The Earth appears flat and stationary, but in reality spins and soars through space at 67,000 miles per hour. Humans appear to be a species of their own special creation, but in reality are simply naturally evolved primates.These ideas are familiar by now, but they were revolutionary at the time of their discovery. What Rovelli is pointing out is that science may not be done with us yet—the next assault on our common sense might be the revelation of a world without time. Rovelli points out that what we label as “common sense” is often the intellectual work of past thinkers—who may or may not have gotten things right. How we think about time—our common sense notions of it—have in fact been shaped by past thinkers, the two most prominent being Aristotle and Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton thought that time was universal and absolute, that the variable “t” applied to everyone everywhere and continued to tick on even if everything in the universe stood still. Aristotle, in contrast, thought of time simply as the measure of change, and that without change it made no sense to talk about time in any absolute or universal sense. Because Aristotle got so much wrong in so many fields, you might think you ought to favor Newton in this debate, but according to Rovelli you’d be wrong to do so. Aristotle’s picture of time is closer to reality, as confirmed by the work of Albert Einstein. Einstein demonstrated that time is relative, not absolute. We now know that time moves slower at lower altitudes and at higher speeds. Someone living in the plains will age less than someone living in the mountains and someone traveling at high speeds will age less than someone stationary. This counterintuitive notion does not sit well with common sense, but that’s the point: reality is not, and has never been, what it seems. What all of this adds up to is that there is no such thing as universal time; there is only time for you, from your perspective, in relation to other objects. Reality is a world of events and changing quantities, not of shapes and universal space and time. And this is precisely what quantum physics demonstrates, where the equations that work have no time variable at all. So the flow of time is simply a psychological construct, an illusion, and one we may need to discard if we are to penetrate further into the depths of reality. But, if time is not embedded in the fabric of reality, it does beg the question: where does our concept of time come from? In a word: entropy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that entropy can never decrease, and increasing entropy is the way our minds mark the passing of time. Since entropy cannot be reversed, time flows in one direction from past to future. And so, entropy is part of the basic fabric of reality and time is simply our way of measuring it. That is, unless we’re talking quantum mechanics, which needs no time variable at all.----------------------------------------What should we make of this claim? Unless you are working in the field of quantum physics, it would be difficult to refute what Rovelli is saying. If the quantum equations do not require time, then either time is an illusion or else we don’t really understand the quantum world. You’ll have to read the book to get a handle on the more technical aspects that I won’t hesitate to admit flew right over my head. One point of contention I can offer, however, is regarding Rovelli’s claim that the concept of a “universal present” is nonsensical. Here’s how he describes it:Hypothetically, if you had a friend on another planet four light-years away, would both of you be experiencing the same present moment? According to Rovelli, there is no such present moment that applies to both of you.If you were to look at your friend through a telescope, you would be seeing him four years ago, because that’s how long the light would take to travel back to you. So your “now” and his “now” cannot be said to be occuring at the same present moment.But wait, is this right? I’m not so sure. Yes, it’s true that, looking through the telescope, you would be seeing your friend four years earlier, due to the limitation of the speed of light. But, if you were to continue to look through the telescope for four more years, you would see your friend’s “now” moment precisely four years later, and that would only be true if there was an initial present moment that was the same for both of you. So in a sense there is a universal present, it’s just not accessible to us perceptually due to the constraints of the speed of light. Maybe this is a small point, but I think it shows that a universal present has to exist, even if, due to the nature of the universe, time can only be perceived locally. In any case, it’s interesting to contemplate that time is simply the psychological measure of change, and that the underlying changes can speed up or slow down depending on your position and speed relative to other objects. This is the world of relativity and reality, which banishes Newton’s universal clock and redeems Aristotle’s notion of change. A final point to consider is that, if time is only a psychological construct, and is not in any objective sense part of the universe, then this could be the final nail in religion’s casket: without time, without a beginning, there is no need for “creation.” -------------------------------------------This is all, of course, a major oversimplification of the book. Rovelli provides an infinitely more detailed account and his excursions into the quantum realm are fascinating for those who have the interest and patience. He is a skilled and clear writer, and his Feynman-esque ability to explain complex topics in simple terms with ample metaphor and analogy is something you’ll appreciate when the topic turns to quantum loop gravity. Overall, it’s a fascinating book that will help you think more clearly about the concept of time, including what a world without time looks like. "
110,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2599582-aviva,3,"Carlo Rovelli does an amazing job of putting scientific concepts that are incredibly difficult to grasp into beautiful words. That said, I found this one harder going than his earlier Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. Maybe because it went deeper into one topic and thus delved into more difficult territory, or maybe just because the truth about time is so counterintuitive. Either way, it made my brain hurt in a good way (most of the time). But I would still recommend his earlier book first to those who want to get their toes wet in some of modern physics' more incomprehensible topics."
111,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4023528-vheissu,3,"I recommend this book to readers of popular science and philosophy. Physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers will be familiar with the themes already and probably have nothing much to learn here.Rovelli makes clear if not explicit that our difficulty in understanding ""time"" isn't limited to our intellectual shortcomings or even the precision of our measuring instruments, but also a limitation in our language. We simply don't have the vocabulary to understand or express the nature of ""time"" in any other than what the author calls ""naïve"" terms (p. 199), which is to say, our everyday, common-sense meaning of the word (past, present, and future, cause and effect). Even the common sense meaning of ""time"" is deeply flawed (see below), much less relevant to quantum and relativistic ""time."" We need to find terms other than ""time"" to express and understand events that occur beyond our perceptible senses.Rovelli offers a few alternative names for quantum and relativistic events, but the best he can do is apply adjective modifiers to the base noun (""thermal time,"" p. 134, or ""quantum time,"" p. 137). What he--we--needs to do is drop the adjective-noun combination altogether and come up with new terms to describe the relationship of events at micro- and macroscopic levels. As long as we include the noun, ""time,"" in trying to explain these things, confusion can only result, since our common-sense understanding of ""time"" is flawed and inhibits understanding of superficially similar but actually qualitatively different phenomena.Naïve Time. The flaws in our everyday, common sense understanding of ""time"" are well-known and documented. There is no single ""now."" ""Time"" does not pass at the same rate for all or even any two observers. ""Time"" is different for observers at different distances from a mass. A person's head experiences a different ""time"" than does her feet! The difference is imperceptible to human senses but it is not unmeasurable; we now have sufficiently precise instruments to measure those differences.This is not to say that our naïve understanding of ""time"" is so flawed as to be unuseful. The establishment of standard time zones in the late 19th century was arguably one of the most consequential public policy decisions in the last 150 years. Communication and transportation technologies require such standardization and would be difficult without it. It was Einstein's efforts to find a way to standardize timepieces for railroads, after all, that led to his Special Theory of Relativity. So, as far as naïve ""time"" is concerned, the term has practical applications and need not be abandoned. We just need to stop using that word for quantum and relativistic investigation.Thermal Time. At relativistic levels, which is to say macroscopic, Rovelli defines ""time"" in terms of entropy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics establishes the ""arrow"" of time--past, present, future. Heat dissipates. The amount of heat in the universe is the same today as it was at the Big Bang, but it has diffused and continues to do so. Our measurement of ""time,"" therefore, is a measurement of entropy: low entropy is the past, high entropy is the future.In a few trillion years from now, the Universe may reach a state of maximum entropy, a cold, motionless condition in which ""time,"" as such, becomes a meaningless idea. ""Time"" will ""stop,"" or become irrelevant to the state of affairs. That is death.Quantum Time. At the microscopic level, which is to say subatomic, our naïve understanding of ""time"" is of no help at all. Subatomic events occur at such small scales and incredibly quick intervals that it becomes pointless to think in terms of order and duration. The smallest increment of time is called Planck Time, which is something like 10-43 seconds (the value 10 with 43 zeroes behind it, or a hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, p. 83); the corresponding Planck length is 10 -33. We have no means by which to observe such imperceptible events. Yet. The numbers are the result of mathematic equations, not the result of empirical measurement. So it is pointless to apply a clumsy term like ""time"" to quantum mechanics.Rovelli reminds us that it was Aristotle who first explored the philosophy and physics of ""time."" For Aristotle, ""time"" was a measurement of change; if nothing ever changed, there would be no ""time."" Newton offered a contradictory opinion. For the great physicist, ""time"" passed even in the absence of change. Both were a little right and a little wrong. Today, we understand that a state of changelessness has never existed in our Universe. We live in a soup of quantum particles that never stop changing. There is no such thing as an absolute vacuum. Quantum particles pop into and out of existence even in the ""vacuum"" of empty space. You can create an airless volume in a bottle, but you can't stop electromagnetic waves from passing through it. The closest the Universe will ever get to changelessness is when it reaches maximum entropy. And that is a long way off."
112,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,5,"Carlo Rovelli has the brilliance of Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein and the communicative skills of Carl Sagan. Otherwise he is an Italian theoretical physicist that specializes in quantum gravity and is a proponent, if not quite an advocate, of loop theory. Beyond that he is a philosopher with a heart for ancient poetry and love.And he brings all of it to bear in this delightful book about time, which, in the end, is life, and everything, including the context in which it unfolds. It would be in error to suggest that time doesn’t exist, but it would be equally in error to suggest that time is as simple as the continuum we record with our clocks.What I like most about the book is the fact that Rovelli recognizes that philosophy and science, if not two sides of the same coin, are cousins. He refers to Proust, which few scientists do, and suggests that while reason is among the best tools available for interpreting our “collective delirium,” it is “only an instrument, a pincer.”The science and the prose are very accessible. You will, however, have to be willing to think abstractly, a skill that in our wired, binary world seems to be greatly dissipating. And he is the first scientist I have read in a while who takes time to explain why the problem is sometimes not the science itself, but the limitations of language. Language is a human construction and has not kept up with our scientific revelation. Which is why theoretical physicists sometimes seem to be speaking another language. If only there was another language that was constructed in the world as we know it today, our communication would be so much easier and our knowledge would expand more rapidly. It would be impossible to summarize the knowledge contained in this book. You really have to read it. Here is a start, however: “The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.” If you can comprehend that the rest is largely additional perspective.And if the idea that universal time doesn’t exist in any absolute since seems a stretch, consider Rovelli’s simple explanation (I’m paraphrasing): People never used to worry about clocks. They worried about the cycle of sunshine and darkness. But that cycle is different in every single village, town, and city on the planet. The cycle varies both east to west and north to south. And back when we used to spend our lives in our little village we didn’t care. But then the scientists and engineers invented trains to take us from one village to the next. And people needed to know when the train left their village. But how can you develop a timetable when every village has its own time? You can’t. But, at the same time, it’s not quite practical to say that the whole world has just one time. Farmers don’t care what the sun is doing in London. They care what it’s doing on their farm. (China actually has no time zones by edict. The entire country is on Beijing time and there are significant practical implications.) The solution was the time zone, and it’s a compromise. Time zones are a construct and practical in the local sense, but highly inaccurate when talking about the universe. In the language of theoretical physics, they don’t exist.Eastern philosophers believe that reality is not knowable. It is real, but is made up of an infinite number of variables. We can only comprehend or think about a handful at a time. A tree is real. I can touch it and smell it. But it is not entirely knowable because there are too many variables (e.g. altitude, climate, soil, etc.) that define each tree for me to know them all. Time is the same way. Time is real but it is not knowable. Throw in the limitations of language and it begins to look like an illusion.To his great credit, Rovelli admits that there is much we don’t know. Think of a Seurat painting that has been blacked out. We have exposed a few, perhaps 10% (my number), of the original dots of pigment. It’s a lot, but we’re still guessing as to what the underlying picture is.And that’s pretty exciting. The key to our understanding to date, however, is the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy can never decrease. It’s critical to our understanding of time, as Rovelli explains. Personally I’m not convinced it’s inviolate. Perhaps we just haven’t uncovered enough dots of pigment yet. If entropy could work both ways it would explain a lot, but attraction does not equal fact. (Entropy obviously has a big part in causality, of course. Bidirectional entropy would be a huge boost for inductive reason.)It’s a short book and even if you get through a small amount of it you will learn a lot. Beyond writing in an accessible way, Rovelli comes off as very personable. The perfect person to sit down and share a cup of coffee with. If only he had the time. (Sorry)A marvelous book that I highly recommend."
113,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7999890-ken-gronnbeck,2,The book starts good but I get confused at the end. This book is not even close to the two other books I've read by him.

It's a marvel to me that such a relatively short book could completely overturn my conceptions of reality, Newtonian physics, and my sense of self. What I love most about The Order of Time is how it bridges the gap of hard maths into the realm of the human experience. So many of the ""wicked problems"" we talk about today in politics or sociology are down simply to the fact that the solution is imperminent. I realize that this book is an introduction to this field, and a very flowery one at that. I'm sure that people who are steeped in the field have thier issues with some of the poetic liberties Rovelli took in explaining some of the the concepts. The book also has one or two contradictions, and places where the author departs from his stated goal of relaying established theory in digestible terms to trying to convince the audience of his particular ""loop theory"" of time. I know from reading the reviews that many have the same problem with this book that I do with the likes of Sapiens by Yuval Harari. But this book is a fantastic and accessible gateway for those who want to be won over by the wonders of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics while always being afraid of ""the mathy bits."" On a personal note, this book has potentially one of my favorite quotes from any book I've read this year: ""The world... Is a boundless and disorderly network of quantum events... It is much more Naples than Singapore."" As one of the few who has been to Naples Italy and loved it, I now have a justification as to why! Thank you, Dr. Rovelli, for this and so much more.I will definitely be reading this book again, as I don't believe I was able to gleen all it has to offer."
117,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,4,"4.5 stars What is time? What does it really mean to say that time ‘passes’? Do we exist in time, or does time exist in us? What is the meaning of now?These are the questions that Carlo Rovelli tries to answer in The Order of Time. He takes us on a journey on how our understanding of the concept of time has changed from antiquity to the present and into the field of quantum gravity, his area of expertise. It is a magma of beautiful and exciting ideas, from physics to philosophy, “sometimes illuminating, sometimes confusing.”We perceive time as one dimensional thing, it has a direction, the past is completely different from the future. The past seems to be one of the most obvious things, it is fixed, we have traces of it, we have memories, there are books to read and learn about the past. Time is a great conceptual idea and works very well in our daily lives but is has a different meaning in quantum mechanics and general relativity. The elementary equations that govern the physical world fail to show any distinction between the past and the future.Time is not a single thing, says Rovelli, but a multi-layered concept, a combination of properties that we can dismount, one by one. What it remains when you take away all these properties, is nothing at all. This is perhaps best exemplified by the physicists John Wheeler and Bryce DeWitt back in the 1970s, when they attempted to unify relativity and quantum mechanics resulted in time essentially disappearing completely from their equation (known as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation), suggesting that time does not exist at all. Rovelli looks in detail at the nature of entropy, arguing that “what makes the world go round are not sources of energy but sources of low entropy. Without low entropy, energy would dilute into uniform heat and the world would go to sleep in a state of thermal equilibrium – there would no longer be any distinction between past and future, and nothing would happen.” Boltzmann understood that entropy is not just a fundamental quantity but a measure of how things are disordered - when you mix thing (disorder) entropy goes up. The fact that entropy has been low in the past leads to an important fact that is ubiquitous and crucial for the difference between past and future: the past leaves traces of itself in the present. The only cause of the difference between past and future, argues Rovelli, is the low energy of the past. This is an astounding idea that is hard to comprehend and perhaps even harder to accept. But it is also revealing, and told in Rovelli’s clear and concise style, makes perfect sense. Rovelli has a deep technical knowledge of his subject; at the same time, he writes beautifully and although I got lost several times when he discussed the strange world of loop quantum gravity, it was exciting to penetrate some layers of the mystery of time. This is an exquisite and intellectually challenging book. It takes time to read, although, reflecting on the various physical variables of time, you might think otherwise.  link:  my review "
118,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,3,"This is really a 2.5. I was following along fine until mid-way through the second part, and I'm not sure whether it was the translation or the physics that lost me. Through the fuzz, I just kept thinking, ""There has to be an easier way to say this."" And it turns out, there was: the final chapter (The Sources of Time) summarized all his points in a clear and understandable way. So, if he can say it so clearly there, what was up with the rest of the book? He tells readers that the notes are for those who really understand the physics of it, but I'd hesitate to say the rest of the book is for us 'normal folks.' More like us 'normal folks who do LSD/mushrooms', which he hinted at a few times. The other thing that I felt was a problem in the book is a problem I have in general with reductionist metaphysical conversations-- once Rovelli had laid it all out, he did a poor job of explaining the possible significance of the knowledge. He commented a couple of times that our 'naive image of time was suitable [necessary] for our daily life', and that 'at an elementary level there are no cats either, but we do not for this reason cease to bother with cats.' Knowing how time works does not change how we experience it (and he doesn't seem to imply that it should), or how humans find meaning in it. Rovelli worked hard to reinforce the sheer number of possible outcomes and, in the process, essentially undermined the importance of understanding that it was all a series of probabilistic events-- i.e, why cats? and if they once existed, why do cats continue to exist? <-- the point here is that he missed the chance to make a larger tie-in to the meaning of it all (or lack thereof). If this order of time shows us that there is no order, that everything is random, reduced to the physical interactions between all the pieces of the universe, and that this knowledge shouldn't change anything about how we live our lives, to say nothing of the fact that we are so myopic we may never understand it, then knowing how it all works would be meaningless, right? Maybe not. But if not, Rovelli did a poor job explaining why. One final note: After I finished reading The Order of Time, I went looking for reviews to see what I had missed (due to the translation or the physics). This review did a pretty good job of summing up a lot of my feelings:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
119,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315851-roozbeh-daneshvar,3,"Before I started reading this book, I asked myself what is it about time that he is going to say? Time seemed obvious and didn't need any more elaboration (I admit that I knew nothing about time). This book opened my eyes and exposed me to aspects of time that I had never imagined.There were many places throughout reading that I was astonished by the new perspectives. For example, how there is a symmetry between past and future in classical mechanics (you just reverse the time direction and bam, everything works well, even though backwards). As another example, I was amazed that how the author connected time to memory (or how do you perceive time if you do not remember anything). He also connected music to memory. You would not enjoy music if you do not have memory: for every note, you have a recollection of the previous note/notes and also an anticipation of the upcoming notes. Without that memory, every moment of a music is just a single note, which would be meaningless.One part that resonated with me was about death and the fear of death. It was exactly the same case for me, as I have mixed feelings of fear of death and an openness for embracing it, both at the same time. This book put the same concept in the framework of time for me. It talked about how time has been troubling to human beings in the history.The text switched between solid physics concepts and some philosophical or even anecdotal themes. To me, it seemed not as a balanced combination, but an incoherent concoction. A large part might be because of my lack of understanding of the topic. Yet, I am skeptical that a poor translation might have contributed, too. In general, I did not find it a well-written text (although this is a personal opinion).If you want to know about time (with which you are probably in touch with, or you'd better be), do consider reading this book. It might open new doors for you."

Rovelli's attempt to explain away thermodynamic-entropic time and the whole of complex systems by telling us ""it's all a blur"" - that our experience of past and future and the direction of time, of evolution, growth, decay, and the whole of biology is basically nothing but subjective phenomenology or the ignorance of human perception is simply laughable. What universe is he living in?To ignore the work of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world who've established the sciences of chaos, complexity, nonlinear systems, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics and assert that their view of time is somehow not real, some illusion or whatever, is arrogant and irresponsible, not to mention narrow-minded. This is scientific fundamentalism and works against the goal of science to produce a coherent system of thought across many domains. The Order of Time appears to be a last ditch attempt to revive the old Platonic-Newtonian deterministic worldview in the face of the contemporary view of emergence, probability, instability, nonlinearity, complexity, chaos, and irreversibility - a kind of marketing ploy to convince the public that the old view of physics still reigns supreme over all else. In this book, Rovelli appears to represent an old guard of physicists, extreme reductionists, who are unable to embrace the scientific revolution that has engulfed their science, the revolution that is complex, nonequilibrium, and nonlinear systems theory.

125,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Like a lot of young nerds, I had a period of fascination with advanced physics. Never enough to actually become all that good at it, mind you. I just about wrapped my brain around the wave-particle duality, in order to get my degree in Electrical Engineering. I took one course on Relativity. I found it all to be fascinating, and also really, really hard. There were other people, for whom it was equally fascinating, but more like ""fun"" than ""hard"". I was not one of those people.The primary benefit to me of having taken those courses as a youngster, was not that it did me the slightest bit of good whatsoever in my professional life in the semiconductor industry. It turns out that, truth be told, you don't have to be all that good at physics to make semiconductors, or even to test circuits made of them, or even to improve processes for making them. Perhaps you have to be really good at physics to invent them in the first place, but that was not a task I ever had to accomplish.No, the primary benefit was that, when someone invoked quantum physics or relativity to bolster their hand-wavy philosophy, I could recognize that they didn't know what they were talking about. There is, it turns out, nothing in quantum physics or relativity that proves or disproves anybody's idea about God, the meaning of life, whether there is an objective reality, or where consciousness comes from. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying, or just projecting their hopes onto the deeply unintuitive world of the very small or very fast.Still, Rovelli is himself a professional, one of those people who does actually know a lot more about physics than I do, and his book had two other things going for it. One, it was short, and a nice compact size. Two, it had a goodly amount of pictures. When I read something like advanced physics, the reality is I'm not ready to go through 800 pages' worth, and I need some diagrams, or sketches, or graphs, or something besides a wall of text with the occasional equation.It turns out that Rovelli is also apparently quite good at explaining things. It may have helped some that I had learned some of the early parts of the book before, but it had been decades, and I found myself wishing that he had been the guy writing my college physics textbooks, or perhaps teaching the classes. But then, it may also be that reading about physics for fun, is a lot more enjoyable than taking a test on it, which is going to be curved to guarantee that around 25% of the class gets a failing grade.Rovelli's thesis seems to be, that time is not a fundamental part of reality in the way that, say, mass or electromagnetism is. Rather, it is more like perspective. He claims that this is actually the pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian way of thinking about time. Time is nothing other than the order in which we experience things. Rovelli's claim (which I am unable to really evaluate the truth of), is that the modern idea of time as a dimension is Newton's, and while it may have been a reasonable operating assumption for him at that, uh, time, it isn't the literal truth. Just as quantum physics and relativity have upended other parts of Newton's worldview, Rovelli says that they have returned us to a pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian idea of time.One is reminded of the saying, ""time is what keeps everything from happening at once"". Rovelli seems to be saying something more like, time is the order in which we perceive things as happening. If we are all, relative to one another, moving at very low speeds (compared to the speed of light in a vacuum), then we never notice that my time is different than yours. Once you think about the very fast, very big, or very small, our intuitions don't work.There was also some stuff about entropy in there.To be honest, if I really wanted to understand what Rovelli was saying here, in depth, well enough to pass a test on it, I would need to read it again. And you know, I just might do that. But not yet, because I am once again in the blessed position of being able to read about physics for exactly as much as I feel like, and neither more nor less. I believe that it is true for me, anyway, that a little more time should pass before I reread this one.It was pretty good, though, so perhaps not too much time."
126,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison,4,"Originally reviewed at The Book Wheel.Consider the following: time passes faster in the mountains than it does at sea level. If this sentence confounds you but piques your interest, then I can already tell you that you want to read The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli, which answers questions such as what is time? Is there a universal time? What does it mean to live in the present? Does the present exist? Turns out, these are simple questions with no easy answers because time is complicated. I don’t mean that timezones are confusing or that time passing faster in the mountains is perplexing, but that at an elemental level, time doesn’t even exist the way we think it does.Luckily, The Order of Time takes an approachable, scientific look at these questions and explores ideas rooted in quantum physics, thermodynamics, and the human condition. It will expand your mind, confuse the heck out of you, and, if you’re like me, leave you pondering some pretty heavy philosophical conundrums.One thing I learned that does make sense is that there is no now because now is just the perception of time. By the time we perceive something happening, nanoseconds have already passed. This means that everything we do, think, say, or hear exists both in the past and the present depending on if you’re saying it or hearing it. In other words, time is so fleeting we’re more or less living in the future as much as we are the present. For example, I can ask what you’re doing right now (reading this sentence) but by the time you process the words I have written, the act of reading it is in the past. WHAT?!Taking this one step further, this also means two people are never actually in the same place at the same time. I can speak to you, but by the time you perceive my actions, I am already living in the past. Throw in timezones and it’s easy to see why there’s no true, universal time. Time exists in relativity. Perhaps the author says it best when he said, “Physics does not describe how things evolve “in time” but how things evolve in their own times, and how “times” evolve relative to each other.”This relativity also applies to what it means to exist. One example The Order of Time gives is the emergence of teams. A group of children can line up and pick teams, one by one, for a soccer game. This new team doesn’t already exist, but it emerges and then does exist because different entities combine to make it so. So if you can create something out of nothing, what does that mean for the whole of existence? And is existence all relative? Some might say that a literary character doesn’t exist, as in they are not “real”, but yet they do exist, if even in our collective minds. Existence, Rovelli argues, is grammatical: “Words such as “here,” “now,” “I,” “this,” “tonight” all assume a different meaning depending on who utters them and the circumstances in which they are uttered.”Philosophical pondering aside, Rovelli explains all of this by rooting it in science. He tackles major scientific theories of time, from Aristotle’s belief that time measures change to Newton’s idea that time is independent of us. He discusses entropy and how it evolves over time, linking it to the laws of thermodynamics and quantum physics.Yet despite this heavy reading, there’s a romantic quality to The Order of Time. Because in the end, it’s all about how we, as humans, perceive time. It is our own “blurred vision” that shapes how we see the world. We are made up of our experiences, traces, and narratives, and each is unique to us. And although the following quote isn’t about time, per se, it does speak to the larger question of whether the absence of something exists: “But it isn’t absence that causes sorrow. It is affection and love. Without affection, without love, such absences would cause us no pain. For this reason, even the pain caused by absence is, in the end, something good and even beautiful, because it feeds on that which gives meaning to life.”"

For me, it has been emotional to go back to what I have learned when studying general relativity and quantum mechanics, so many years ago. And so exciting to learn the new steps that have been made during the past 50 years. I now have an idea of what originates the arrow of time, and this itself is fantastic! Go read it! And stick to it until the end!"

129,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"I have read a lot of popular physics books and many of them just go over the same ground, but this one was a bit new and different. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of relativity is comfortable with the idea that time passes at different rates depending on the relative velocities of two observers, but Rovelli takes us a step further -- it is not just the rate at which time passes that depends on point of view, it is time itself. Rovelli starts by showing how time and entropy are intimately related as the only physical concepts which have an irreversible forward arrow pointing to the future. He then explains how the level of entropy of a system is a function of point of view -- whether a given system is disordered depends on how order is defined (I remember telling my stepmother when I was a teenager that my room was neat because I could find everything I needed in the mess.) If time is a function of entropy and entropy depends on point of view, then perhaps time does too. Time, like entropy, becomes a function of blurring, of uncertainty about things that we do not or cannot measure. Hmmmm. At the very least it is an intriguing idea; maybe it is even true. Perhaps it only appears to us that the universe must have started with the Big Bang and may end with entropic heat death because of what time and entropy look like to us from our localized point of view. So there is no universal physical truth, or at least not one that depends on space and time, which turn out to be localized concepts. But perhaps there are universal concepts for how things relate to one another that are not built into a fixed unchanging view of space and time and that can therefore give us a broad picture of the universe. Rovelli teases us with the assertion that his field, loop quantum gravity, manages to take time out of the most basic equations of the universe, but he doesn't try to explain how, probably because it is too complex for a popular book.I enjoyed this book as an audiobook with a dazzlingly good narration by Benedict Cumberbatch. Sometimes science books are better enjoyed in print editions, but this one worked quite well in audio. The quality of the writing is excellent and clear. The explanations of scientific ideas are not simple but they are comprenhensible even for a person with a limited background in physics and no math. And the rich, expressive voice of Mr. Cumberbatch makes the experience complete."
130,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,3,"This introduction to the modern physicist's understanding of time is difficult to rate for a few reasons. First of all, I already knew about most of these concepts so there wasn't really anything revelatory here. Had I not brought this foreknowledge to this book, I think I may have found it more interesting. Also, acknowledging the linguistic difficulty of discussing time as frequently people mean very different things when using the word, Rovelli falls victim to this very problem throughout the book. Occasionally he gets the point across very well only to confuse the issue he just clarified in the next paragraph. Lastly, I don't think we need all of the literary and spiritual meanderings he gets into. I know that it is trendy for physicists to bring in literature and use overly flowery language to describe the most complicated of scientific discussions but the degree to which this is used here is quite extreme, and in a work of such brevity, seems like a replacement for genuine profundity as opposed to being additive. I admire Rovelli's interest in bringing these important concepts to a mass audience, even if there is some depth and rigor lost in the effort. However, if your notion of time is that which comes from grade school then perhaps this will be an effective précis for future study, if you want a more interesting discussion about how these notions relate to your functioning as a human then I would recommend, ""Your Brain is a Time Machine,"" by Dean Buonomano.

He argues that our perception of time’s flow depends entirely on our inability to see the world in all its detail. Quantum uncertainty means we cannot know the positions and speeds of all the particles in the Universe. If we could, there would be no entropy and no unraveling of time. Rovelli originated this ‘thermal time hypothesis’ with French mathematician Alain Connes.Maybe, this book alone is not enough to pass judgment as a lay reader but the book has an extraordinary poetic essence to transmute into the Rovelie's reality. :)"

138,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874093-janna,2,"Never thought I’d see the day where I complained that a book leaned too far into the poetic, but here we are. I liked Part One, which lays out the physics behind why time is not as it seems, but Part Two goes too much into philosophising without much of a sound basis and without adequately laying out the supporting physics. Where Reality Is Not What It Seems took readers through a series of logical steps, provided the appropriate rigour, and created a sound place from which to begin amping up the complexity, The Order of Time begins in science and then swerves the argument into flowery interpretations of thinkers from St Augustine to Kant to Buddha. His ultimate conclusion seems to be that our experience of time is something that depends on our human lens: something that philosophers have said for centuries (and he quotes those philosophers). In support of this in the physics side of things, he briefly explains the irreversibility of ever-increasing entropy and how the relations between particles are blurred such that we are unable to perceive them. ""Therefore, our vision of the world is blurred because the physical interactions between the part of the world to which we belong and the rest are blind to many variables. ... This does not mean that blurring is a mental construct; it depends on actual, existing physical interactions."" He then switches to philosophy and quotes Hans Reichenbach, writing that time causes anxiety; as a result, we have imagined the existence of eternity and heaven and higher realms. And from there he suggests: ""Perhaps, ultimately, the emotional dimension of time is not the film of mist that prevents us from apprehending the nature of time objectively. Perhaps the emotion of time is precisely what time is for us."" His foray into the emotions is rooted more in literature and music, which (knowing how poets think) can be hit or miss. My main issue, however, is this. There is a difference between (1) humans being constructed such that we are unable to perceive the reality of time and (2) the emotions that arise from our particular experience of time. Those emotions might well cause us to be attached to time or have an awareness of it that doesn't match reality. But that's not the same as saying that, as humans, the structure of our minds and the physical interactions of slice of the universe we occupy are such that we are unable to perceive temporal reality, which is what I took his argument to be. Emotions are far more like a mental construct than the blurring of thermodynamic interactions occurring in the physical world. And what he says about emotions seems to suggest that we refuse to see reality, not that we are unable to (one could imagine a person who wasn't caught up with anxiety about time and didn't experience those obscuring emotions). Maybe he wasn't trying to put forward a serious argument for the place of emotions or maybe I'm reading ungenerously. Perhaps he was simply swept up with the poetry of it all, but that leads to confusion and makes the entire text less credible.I’m not a physicist and I know this is a pop science book — emphasis on the pop — but by the end it was a pop philosophy book sprinkled over with poetry and references to the likes of the Mahabharata, Bach, and the book of Job. The final chapter consists of his musings on what really drives us as human beings — and I do think it's all connected and that the final chapter drives at the point that really matters, but he didn't earn that ending. He didn't lay out the path correctly and, consequently, his broader conclusions on life feel flimsy. While physics and philosophy certainly have implications for one another, and there is truth also in art and poetry, The Order of Time does not result in a successful mix."
139,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,4,"In The Order of Time, Carlo Rovelli sticks to the theme that reality is not what it seems, in this case focusing entirely on the concept of time. In a sense, the history of science can be described as an uncompromising assault on intuition and common sense. The Earth appears flat and stationary, but in reality spins and soars through space at 67,000 miles per hour. Humans appear to be a species of their own special creation, but in reality are simply naturally evolved primates.These ideas are familiar by now, but they were revolutionary at the time of their discovery. What Rovelli is pointing out is that science may not be done with us yet—the next assault on our common sense might be the revelation of a world without time. Rovelli points out that what we label as “common sense” is often the intellectual work of past thinkers—who may or may not have gotten things right. How we think about time—our common sense notions of it—have in fact been shaped by past thinkers, the two most prominent being Aristotle and Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton thought that time was universal and absolute, that the variable “t” applied to everyone everywhere and continued to tick on even if everything in the universe stood still. Aristotle, in contrast, thought of time simply as the measure of change, and that without change it made no sense to talk about time in any absolute or universal sense. Because Aristotle got so much wrong in so many fields, you might think you ought to favor Newton in this debate, but according to Rovelli you’d be wrong to do so. Aristotle’s picture of time is closer to reality, as confirmed by the work of Albert Einstein. Einstein demonstrated that time is relative, not absolute. We now know that time moves slower at lower altitudes and at higher speeds. Someone living in the plains will age less than someone living in the mountains and someone traveling at high speeds will age less than someone stationary. This counterintuitive notion does not sit well with common sense, but that’s the point: reality is not, and has never been, what it seems. What all of this adds up to is that there is no such thing as universal time; there is only time for you, from your perspective, in relation to other objects. Reality is a world of events and changing quantities, not of shapes and universal space and time. And this is precisely what quantum physics demonstrates, where the equations that work have no time variable at all. So the flow of time is simply a psychological construct, an illusion, and one we may need to discard if we are to penetrate further into the depths of reality. But, if time is not embedded in the fabric of reality, it does beg the question: where does our concept of time come from? In a word: entropy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that entropy can never decrease, and increasing entropy is the way our minds mark the passing of time. Since entropy cannot be reversed, time flows in one direction from past to future. And so, entropy is part of the basic fabric of reality and time is simply our way of measuring it. That is, unless we’re talking quantum mechanics, which needs no time variable at all.----------------------------------------What should we make of this claim? Unless you are working in the field of quantum physics, it would be difficult to refute what Rovelli is saying. If the quantum equations do not require time, then either time is an illusion or else we don’t really understand the quantum world. You’ll have to read the book to get a handle on the more technical aspects that I won’t hesitate to admit flew right over my head. One point of contention I can offer, however, is regarding Rovelli’s claim that the concept of a “universal present” is nonsensical. Here’s how he describes it:Hypothetically, if you had a friend on another planet four light-years away, would both of you be experiencing the same present moment? According to Rovelli, there is no such present moment that applies to both of you.If you were to look at your friend through a telescope, you would be seeing him four years ago, because that’s how long the light would take to travel back to you. So your “now” and his “now” cannot be said to be occuring at the same present moment.But wait, is this right? I’m not so sure. Yes, it’s true that, looking through the telescope, you would be seeing your friend four years earlier, due to the limitation of the speed of light. But, if you were to continue to look through the telescope for four more years, you would see your friend’s “now” moment precisely four years later, and that would only be true if there was an initial present moment that was the same for both of you. So in a sense there is a universal present, it’s just not accessible to us perceptually due to the constraints of the speed of light. Maybe this is a small point, but I think it shows that a universal present has to exist, even if, due to the nature of the universe, time can only be perceived locally. In any case, it’s interesting to contemplate that time is simply the psychological measure of change, and that the underlying changes can speed up or slow down depending on your position and speed relative to other objects. This is the world of relativity and reality, which banishes Newton’s universal clock and redeems Aristotle’s notion of change. A final point to consider is that, if time is only a psychological construct, and is not in any objective sense part of the universe, then this could be the final nail in religion’s casket: without time, without a beginning, there is no need for “creation.” -------------------------------------------This is all, of course, a major oversimplification of the book. Rovelli provides an infinitely more detailed account and his excursions into the quantum realm are fascinating for those who have the interest and patience. He is a skilled and clear writer, and his Feynman-esque ability to explain complex topics in simple terms with ample metaphor and analogy is something you’ll appreciate when the topic turns to quantum loop gravity. Overall, it’s a fascinating book that will help you think more clearly about the concept of time, including what a world without time looks like. "
140,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2599582-aviva,3,"Carlo Rovelli does an amazing job of putting scientific concepts that are incredibly difficult to grasp into beautiful words. That said, I found this one harder going than his earlier Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. Maybe because it went deeper into one topic and thus delved into more difficult territory, or maybe just because the truth about time is so counterintuitive. Either way, it made my brain hurt in a good way (most of the time). But I would still recommend his earlier book first to those who want to get their toes wet in some of modern physics' more incomprehensible topics."
141,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4023528-vheissu,3,"I recommend this book to readers of popular science and philosophy. Physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers will be familiar with the themes already and probably have nothing much to learn here.Rovelli makes clear if not explicit that our difficulty in understanding ""time"" isn't limited to our intellectual shortcomings or even the precision of our measuring instruments, but also a limitation in our language. We simply don't have the vocabulary to understand or express the nature of ""time"" in any other than what the author calls ""naïve"" terms (p. 199), which is to say, our everyday, common-sense meaning of the word (past, present, and future, cause and effect). Even the common sense meaning of ""time"" is deeply flawed (see below), much less relevant to quantum and relativistic ""time."" We need to find terms other than ""time"" to express and understand events that occur beyond our perceptible senses.Rovelli offers a few alternative names for quantum and relativistic events, but the best he can do is apply adjective modifiers to the base noun (""thermal time,"" p. 134, or ""quantum time,"" p. 137). What he--we--needs to do is drop the adjective-noun combination altogether and come up with new terms to describe the relationship of events at micro- and macroscopic levels. As long as we include the noun, ""time,"" in trying to explain these things, confusion can only result, since our common-sense understanding of ""time"" is flawed and inhibits understanding of superficially similar but actually qualitatively different phenomena.Naïve Time. The flaws in our everyday, common sense understanding of ""time"" are well-known and documented. There is no single ""now."" ""Time"" does not pass at the same rate for all or even any two observers. ""Time"" is different for observers at different distances from a mass. A person's head experiences a different ""time"" than does her feet! The difference is imperceptible to human senses but it is not unmeasurable; we now have sufficiently precise instruments to measure those differences.This is not to say that our naïve understanding of ""time"" is so flawed as to be unuseful. The establishment of standard time zones in the late 19th century was arguably one of the most consequential public policy decisions in the last 150 years. Communication and transportation technologies require such standardization and would be difficult without it. It was Einstein's efforts to find a way to standardize timepieces for railroads, after all, that led to his Special Theory of Relativity. So, as far as naïve ""time"" is concerned, the term has practical applications and need not be abandoned. We just need to stop using that word for quantum and relativistic investigation.Thermal Time. At relativistic levels, which is to say macroscopic, Rovelli defines ""time"" in terms of entropy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics establishes the ""arrow"" of time--past, present, future. Heat dissipates. The amount of heat in the universe is the same today as it was at the Big Bang, but it has diffused and continues to do so. Our measurement of ""time,"" therefore, is a measurement of entropy: low entropy is the past, high entropy is the future.In a few trillion years from now, the Universe may reach a state of maximum entropy, a cold, motionless condition in which ""time,"" as such, becomes a meaningless idea. ""Time"" will ""stop,"" or become irrelevant to the state of affairs. That is death.Quantum Time. At the microscopic level, which is to say subatomic, our naïve understanding of ""time"" is of no help at all. Subatomic events occur at such small scales and incredibly quick intervals that it becomes pointless to think in terms of order and duration. The smallest increment of time is called Planck Time, which is something like 10-43 seconds (the value 10 with 43 zeroes behind it, or a hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, p. 83); the corresponding Planck length is 10 -33. We have no means by which to observe such imperceptible events. Yet. The numbers are the result of mathematic equations, not the result of empirical measurement. So it is pointless to apply a clumsy term like ""time"" to quantum mechanics.Rovelli reminds us that it was Aristotle who first explored the philosophy and physics of ""time."" For Aristotle, ""time"" was a measurement of change; if nothing ever changed, there would be no ""time."" Newton offered a contradictory opinion. For the great physicist, ""time"" passed even in the absence of change. Both were a little right and a little wrong. Today, we understand that a state of changelessness has never existed in our Universe. We live in a soup of quantum particles that never stop changing. There is no such thing as an absolute vacuum. Quantum particles pop into and out of existence even in the ""vacuum"" of empty space. You can create an airless volume in a bottle, but you can't stop electromagnetic waves from passing through it. The closest the Universe will ever get to changelessness is when it reaches maximum entropy. And that is a long way off."
142,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,5,"Carlo Rovelli has the brilliance of Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein and the communicative skills of Carl Sagan. Otherwise he is an Italian theoretical physicist that specializes in quantum gravity and is a proponent, if not quite an advocate, of loop theory. Beyond that he is a philosopher with a heart for ancient poetry and love.And he brings all of it to bear in this delightful book about time, which, in the end, is life, and everything, including the context in which it unfolds. It would be in error to suggest that time doesn’t exist, but it would be equally in error to suggest that time is as simple as the continuum we record with our clocks.What I like most about the book is the fact that Rovelli recognizes that philosophy and science, if not two sides of the same coin, are cousins. He refers to Proust, which few scientists do, and suggests that while reason is among the best tools available for interpreting our “collective delirium,” it is “only an instrument, a pincer.”The science and the prose are very accessible. You will, however, have to be willing to think abstractly, a skill that in our wired, binary world seems to be greatly dissipating. And he is the first scientist I have read in a while who takes time to explain why the problem is sometimes not the science itself, but the limitations of language. Language is a human construction and has not kept up with our scientific revelation. Which is why theoretical physicists sometimes seem to be speaking another language. If only there was another language that was constructed in the world as we know it today, our communication would be so much easier and our knowledge would expand more rapidly. It would be impossible to summarize the knowledge contained in this book. You really have to read it. Here is a start, however: “The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.” If you can comprehend that the rest is largely additional perspective.And if the idea that universal time doesn’t exist in any absolute since seems a stretch, consider Rovelli’s simple explanation (I’m paraphrasing): People never used to worry about clocks. They worried about the cycle of sunshine and darkness. But that cycle is different in every single village, town, and city on the planet. The cycle varies both east to west and north to south. And back when we used to spend our lives in our little village we didn’t care. But then the scientists and engineers invented trains to take us from one village to the next. And people needed to know when the train left their village. But how can you develop a timetable when every village has its own time? You can’t. But, at the same time, it’s not quite practical to say that the whole world has just one time. Farmers don’t care what the sun is doing in London. They care what it’s doing on their farm. (China actually has no time zones by edict. The entire country is on Beijing time and there are significant practical implications.) The solution was the time zone, and it’s a compromise. Time zones are a construct and practical in the local sense, but highly inaccurate when talking about the universe. In the language of theoretical physics, they don’t exist.Eastern philosophers believe that reality is not knowable. It is real, but is made up of an infinite number of variables. We can only comprehend or think about a handful at a time. A tree is real. I can touch it and smell it. But it is not entirely knowable because there are too many variables (e.g. altitude, climate, soil, etc.) that define each tree for me to know them all. Time is the same way. Time is real but it is not knowable. Throw in the limitations of language and it begins to look like an illusion.To his great credit, Rovelli admits that there is much we don’t know. Think of a Seurat painting that has been blacked out. We have exposed a few, perhaps 10% (my number), of the original dots of pigment. It’s a lot, but we’re still guessing as to what the underlying picture is.And that’s pretty exciting. The key to our understanding to date, however, is the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy can never decrease. It’s critical to our understanding of time, as Rovelli explains. Personally I’m not convinced it’s inviolate. Perhaps we just haven’t uncovered enough dots of pigment yet. If entropy could work both ways it would explain a lot, but attraction does not equal fact. (Entropy obviously has a big part in causality, of course. Bidirectional entropy would be a huge boost for inductive reason.)It’s a short book and even if you get through a small amount of it you will learn a lot. Beyond writing in an accessible way, Rovelli comes off as very personable. The perfect person to sit down and share a cup of coffee with. If only he had the time. (Sorry)A marvelous book that I highly recommend."

It's a marvel to me that such a relatively short book could completely overturn my conceptions of reality, Newtonian physics, and my sense of self. What I love most about The Order of Time is how it bridges the gap of hard maths into the realm of the human experience. So many of the ""wicked problems"" we talk about today in politics or sociology are down simply to the fact that the solution is imperminent. I realize that this book is an introduction to this field, and a very flowery one at that. I'm sure that people who are steeped in the field have thier issues with some of the poetic liberties Rovelli took in explaining some of the the concepts. The book also has one or two contradictions, and places where the author departs from his stated goal of relaying established theory in digestible terms to trying to convince the audience of his particular ""loop theory"" of time. I know from reading the reviews that many have the same problem with this book that I do with the likes of Sapiens by Yuval Harari. But this book is a fantastic and accessible gateway for those who want to be won over by the wonders of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics while always being afraid of ""the mathy bits."" On a personal note, this book has potentially one of my favorite quotes from any book I've read this year: ""The world... Is a boundless and disorderly network of quantum events... It is much more Naples than Singapore."" As one of the few who has been to Naples Italy and loved it, I now have a justification as to why! Thank you, Dr. Rovelli, for this and so much more.I will definitely be reading this book again, as I don't believe I was able to gleen all it has to offer."
147,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,4,"4.5 stars What is time? What does it really mean to say that time ‘passes’? Do we exist in time, or does time exist in us? What is the meaning of now?These are the questions that Carlo Rovelli tries to answer in The Order of Time. He takes us on a journey on how our understanding of the concept of time has changed from antiquity to the present and into the field of quantum gravity, his area of expertise. It is a magma of beautiful and exciting ideas, from physics to philosophy, “sometimes illuminating, sometimes confusing.”We perceive time as one dimensional thing, it has a direction, the past is completely different from the future. The past seems to be one of the most obvious things, it is fixed, we have traces of it, we have memories, there are books to read and learn about the past. Time is a great conceptual idea and works very well in our daily lives but is has a different meaning in quantum mechanics and general relativity. The elementary equations that govern the physical world fail to show any distinction between the past and the future.Time is not a single thing, says Rovelli, but a multi-layered concept, a combination of properties that we can dismount, one by one. What it remains when you take away all these properties, is nothing at all. This is perhaps best exemplified by the physicists John Wheeler and Bryce DeWitt back in the 1970s, when they attempted to unify relativity and quantum mechanics resulted in time essentially disappearing completely from their equation (known as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation), suggesting that time does not exist at all. Rovelli looks in detail at the nature of entropy, arguing that “what makes the world go round are not sources of energy but sources of low entropy. Without low entropy, energy would dilute into uniform heat and the world would go to sleep in a state of thermal equilibrium – there would no longer be any distinction between past and future, and nothing would happen.” Boltzmann understood that entropy is not just a fundamental quantity but a measure of how things are disordered - when you mix thing (disorder) entropy goes up. The fact that entropy has been low in the past leads to an important fact that is ubiquitous and crucial for the difference between past and future: the past leaves traces of itself in the present. The only cause of the difference between past and future, argues Rovelli, is the low energy of the past. This is an astounding idea that is hard to comprehend and perhaps even harder to accept. But it is also revealing, and told in Rovelli’s clear and concise style, makes perfect sense. Rovelli has a deep technical knowledge of his subject; at the same time, he writes beautifully and although I got lost several times when he discussed the strange world of loop quantum gravity, it was exciting to penetrate some layers of the mystery of time. This is an exquisite and intellectually challenging book. It takes time to read, although, reflecting on the various physical variables of time, you might think otherwise.  link:  my review "
148,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,3,"This is really a 2.5. I was following along fine until mid-way through the second part, and I'm not sure whether it was the translation or the physics that lost me. Through the fuzz, I just kept thinking, ""There has to be an easier way to say this."" And it turns out, there was: the final chapter (The Sources of Time) summarized all his points in a clear and understandable way. So, if he can say it so clearly there, what was up with the rest of the book? He tells readers that the notes are for those who really understand the physics of it, but I'd hesitate to say the rest of the book is for us 'normal folks.' More like us 'normal folks who do LSD/mushrooms', which he hinted at a few times. The other thing that I felt was a problem in the book is a problem I have in general with reductionist metaphysical conversations-- once Rovelli had laid it all out, he did a poor job of explaining the possible significance of the knowledge. He commented a couple of times that our 'naive image of time was suitable [necessary] for our daily life', and that 'at an elementary level there are no cats either, but we do not for this reason cease to bother with cats.' Knowing how time works does not change how we experience it (and he doesn't seem to imply that it should), or how humans find meaning in it. Rovelli worked hard to reinforce the sheer number of possible outcomes and, in the process, essentially undermined the importance of understanding that it was all a series of probabilistic events-- i.e, why cats? and if they once existed, why do cats continue to exist? <-- the point here is that he missed the chance to make a larger tie-in to the meaning of it all (or lack thereof). If this order of time shows us that there is no order, that everything is random, reduced to the physical interactions between all the pieces of the universe, and that this knowledge shouldn't change anything about how we live our lives, to say nothing of the fact that we are so myopic we may never understand it, then knowing how it all works would be meaningless, right? Maybe not. But if not, Rovelli did a poor job explaining why. One final note: After I finished reading The Order of Time, I went looking for reviews to see what I had missed (due to the translation or the physics). This review did a pretty good job of summing up a lot of my feelings:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
149,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315851-roozbeh-daneshvar,3,"Before I started reading this book, I asked myself what is it about time that he is going to say? Time seemed obvious and didn't need any more elaboration (I admit that I knew nothing about time). This book opened my eyes and exposed me to aspects of time that I had never imagined.There were many places throughout reading that I was astonished by the new perspectives. For example, how there is a symmetry between past and future in classical mechanics (you just reverse the time direction and bam, everything works well, even though backwards). As another example, I was amazed that how the author connected time to memory (or how do you perceive time if you do not remember anything). He also connected music to memory. You would not enjoy music if you do not have memory: for every note, you have a recollection of the previous note/notes and also an anticipation of the upcoming notes. Without that memory, every moment of a music is just a single note, which would be meaningless.One part that resonated with me was about death and the fear of death. It was exactly the same case for me, as I have mixed feelings of fear of death and an openness for embracing it, both at the same time. This book put the same concept in the framework of time for me. It talked about how time has been troubling to human beings in the history.The text switched between solid physics concepts and some philosophical or even anecdotal themes. To me, it seemed not as a balanced combination, but an incoherent concoction. A large part might be because of my lack of understanding of the topic. Yet, I am skeptical that a poor translation might have contributed, too. In general, I did not find it a well-written text (although this is a personal opinion).If you want to know about time (with which you are probably in touch with, or you'd better be), do consider reading this book. It might open new doors for you."

Rovelli's attempt to explain away thermodynamic-entropic time and the whole of complex systems by telling us ""it's all a blur"" - that our experience of past and future and the direction of time, of evolution, growth, decay, and the whole of biology is basically nothing but subjective phenomenology or the ignorance of human perception is simply laughable. What universe is he living in?To ignore the work of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world who've established the sciences of chaos, complexity, nonlinear systems, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics and assert that their view of time is somehow not real, some illusion or whatever, is arrogant and irresponsible, not to mention narrow-minded. This is scientific fundamentalism and works against the goal of science to produce a coherent system of thought across many domains. The Order of Time appears to be a last ditch attempt to revive the old Platonic-Newtonian deterministic worldview in the face of the contemporary view of emergence, probability, instability, nonlinearity, complexity, chaos, and irreversibility - a kind of marketing ploy to convince the public that the old view of physics still reigns supreme over all else. In this book, Rovelli appears to represent an old guard of physicists, extreme reductionists, who are unable to embrace the scientific revolution that has engulfed their science, the revolution that is complex, nonequilibrium, and nonlinear systems theory.

155,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Like a lot of young nerds, I had a period of fascination with advanced physics. Never enough to actually become all that good at it, mind you. I just about wrapped my brain around the wave-particle duality, in order to get my degree in Electrical Engineering. I took one course on Relativity. I found it all to be fascinating, and also really, really hard. There were other people, for whom it was equally fascinating, but more like ""fun"" than ""hard"". I was not one of those people.The primary benefit to me of having taken those courses as a youngster, was not that it did me the slightest bit of good whatsoever in my professional life in the semiconductor industry. It turns out that, truth be told, you don't have to be all that good at physics to make semiconductors, or even to test circuits made of them, or even to improve processes for making them. Perhaps you have to be really good at physics to invent them in the first place, but that was not a task I ever had to accomplish.No, the primary benefit was that, when someone invoked quantum physics or relativity to bolster their hand-wavy philosophy, I could recognize that they didn't know what they were talking about. There is, it turns out, nothing in quantum physics or relativity that proves or disproves anybody's idea about God, the meaning of life, whether there is an objective reality, or where consciousness comes from. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying, or just projecting their hopes onto the deeply unintuitive world of the very small or very fast.Still, Rovelli is himself a professional, one of those people who does actually know a lot more about physics than I do, and his book had two other things going for it. One, it was short, and a nice compact size. Two, it had a goodly amount of pictures. When I read something like advanced physics, the reality is I'm not ready to go through 800 pages' worth, and I need some diagrams, or sketches, or graphs, or something besides a wall of text with the occasional equation.It turns out that Rovelli is also apparently quite good at explaining things. It may have helped some that I had learned some of the early parts of the book before, but it had been decades, and I found myself wishing that he had been the guy writing my college physics textbooks, or perhaps teaching the classes. But then, it may also be that reading about physics for fun, is a lot more enjoyable than taking a test on it, which is going to be curved to guarantee that around 25% of the class gets a failing grade.Rovelli's thesis seems to be, that time is not a fundamental part of reality in the way that, say, mass or electromagnetism is. Rather, it is more like perspective. He claims that this is actually the pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian way of thinking about time. Time is nothing other than the order in which we experience things. Rovelli's claim (which I am unable to really evaluate the truth of), is that the modern idea of time as a dimension is Newton's, and while it may have been a reasonable operating assumption for him at that, uh, time, it isn't the literal truth. Just as quantum physics and relativity have upended other parts of Newton's worldview, Rovelli says that they have returned us to a pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian idea of time.One is reminded of the saying, ""time is what keeps everything from happening at once"". Rovelli seems to be saying something more like, time is the order in which we perceive things as happening. If we are all, relative to one another, moving at very low speeds (compared to the speed of light in a vacuum), then we never notice that my time is different than yours. Once you think about the very fast, very big, or very small, our intuitions don't work.There was also some stuff about entropy in there.To be honest, if I really wanted to understand what Rovelli was saying here, in depth, well enough to pass a test on it, I would need to read it again. And you know, I just might do that. But not yet, because I am once again in the blessed position of being able to read about physics for exactly as much as I feel like, and neither more nor less. I believe that it is true for me, anyway, that a little more time should pass before I reread this one.It was pretty good, though, so perhaps not too much time."
156,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison,4,"Originally reviewed at The Book Wheel.Consider the following: time passes faster in the mountains than it does at sea level. If this sentence confounds you but piques your interest, then I can already tell you that you want to read The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli, which answers questions such as what is time? Is there a universal time? What does it mean to live in the present? Does the present exist? Turns out, these are simple questions with no easy answers because time is complicated. I don’t mean that timezones are confusing or that time passing faster in the mountains is perplexing, but that at an elemental level, time doesn’t even exist the way we think it does.Luckily, The Order of Time takes an approachable, scientific look at these questions and explores ideas rooted in quantum physics, thermodynamics, and the human condition. It will expand your mind, confuse the heck out of you, and, if you’re like me, leave you pondering some pretty heavy philosophical conundrums.One thing I learned that does make sense is that there is no now because now is just the perception of time. By the time we perceive something happening, nanoseconds have already passed. This means that everything we do, think, say, or hear exists both in the past and the present depending on if you’re saying it or hearing it. In other words, time is so fleeting we’re more or less living in the future as much as we are the present. For example, I can ask what you’re doing right now (reading this sentence) but by the time you process the words I have written, the act of reading it is in the past. WHAT?!Taking this one step further, this also means two people are never actually in the same place at the same time. I can speak to you, but by the time you perceive my actions, I am already living in the past. Throw in timezones and it’s easy to see why there’s no true, universal time. Time exists in relativity. Perhaps the author says it best when he said, “Physics does not describe how things evolve “in time” but how things evolve in their own times, and how “times” evolve relative to each other.”This relativity also applies to what it means to exist. One example The Order of Time gives is the emergence of teams. A group of children can line up and pick teams, one by one, for a soccer game. This new team doesn’t already exist, but it emerges and then does exist because different entities combine to make it so. So if you can create something out of nothing, what does that mean for the whole of existence? And is existence all relative? Some might say that a literary character doesn’t exist, as in they are not “real”, but yet they do exist, if even in our collective minds. Existence, Rovelli argues, is grammatical: “Words such as “here,” “now,” “I,” “this,” “tonight” all assume a different meaning depending on who utters them and the circumstances in which they are uttered.”Philosophical pondering aside, Rovelli explains all of this by rooting it in science. He tackles major scientific theories of time, from Aristotle’s belief that time measures change to Newton’s idea that time is independent of us. He discusses entropy and how it evolves over time, linking it to the laws of thermodynamics and quantum physics.Yet despite this heavy reading, there’s a romantic quality to The Order of Time. Because in the end, it’s all about how we, as humans, perceive time. It is our own “blurred vision” that shapes how we see the world. We are made up of our experiences, traces, and narratives, and each is unique to us. And although the following quote isn’t about time, per se, it does speak to the larger question of whether the absence of something exists: “But it isn’t absence that causes sorrow. It is affection and love. Without affection, without love, such absences would cause us no pain. For this reason, even the pain caused by absence is, in the end, something good and even beautiful, because it feeds on that which gives meaning to life.”"

For me, it has been emotional to go back to what I have learned when studying general relativity and quantum mechanics, so many years ago.

159,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"I have read a lot of popular physics books and many of them just go over the same ground, but this one was a bit new and different. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of relativity is comfortable with the idea that time passes at different rates depending on the relative velocities of two observers, but Rovelli takes us a step further -- it is not just the rate at which time passes that depends on point of view, it is time itself. Rovelli starts by showing how time and entropy are intimately related as the only physical concepts which have an irreversible forward arrow pointing to the future. He then explains how the level of entropy of a system is a function of point of view -- whether a given system is disordered depends on how order is defined (I remember telling my stepmother when I was a teenager that my room was neat because I could find everything I needed in the mess.) If time is a function of entropy and entropy depends on point of view, then perhaps time does too. Time, like entropy, becomes a function of blurring, of uncertainty about things that we do not or cannot measure. Hmmmm. At the very least it is an intriguing idea; maybe it is even true. Perhaps it only appears to us that the universe must have started with the Big Bang and may end with entropic heat death because of what time and entropy look like to us from our localized point of view. So there is no universal physical truth, or at least not one that depends on space and time, which turn out to be localized concepts. But perhaps there are universal concepts for how things relate to one another that are not built into a fixed unchanging view of space and time and that can therefore give us a broad picture of the universe. Rovelli teases us with the assertion that his field, loop quantum gravity, manages to take time out of the most basic equations of the universe, but he doesn't try to explain how, probably because it is too complex for a popular book.I enjoyed this book as an audiobook with a dazzlingly good narration by Benedict Cumberbatch. Sometimes science books are better enjoyed in print editions, but this one worked quite well in audio. The quality of the writing is excellent and clear. The explanations of scientific ideas are not simple but they are comprenhensible even for a person with a limited background in physics and no math. And the rich, expressive voice of Mr. Cumberbatch makes the experience complete."
160,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,3,"This introduction to the modern physicist's understanding of time is difficult to rate for a few reasons. First of all, I already knew about most of these concepts so there wasn't really anything revelatory here. Had I not brought this foreknowledge to this book, I think I may have found it more interesting. Also, acknowledging the linguistic difficulty of discussing time as frequently people mean very different things when using the word, Rovelli falls victim to this very problem throughout the book. Occasionally he gets the point across very well only to confuse the issue he just clarified in the next paragraph. Lastly, I don't think we need all of the literary and spiritual meanderings he gets into. I know that it is trendy for physicists to bring in literature and use overly flowery language to describe the most complicated of scientific discussions but the degree to which this is used here is quite extreme, and in a work of such brevity, seems like a replacement for genuine profundity as opposed to being additive. I admire Rovelli's interest in bringing these important concepts to a mass audience, even if there is some depth and rigor lost in the effort. However, if your notion of time is that which comes from grade school then perhaps this will be an effective précis for future study, if you want a more interesting discussion about how these notions relate to your functioning as a human then I would recommend, ""Your Brain is a Time Machine,"" by Dean Buonomano.

He argues that our perception of time’s flow depends entirely on our inability to see the world in all its detail. Quantum uncertainty means we cannot know the positions and speeds of all the particles in the Universe. If we could, there would be no entropy and no unraveling of time. Rovelli originated this ‘thermal time hypothesis’ with French mathematician Alain Connes.Maybe, this book alone is not enough to pass judgment as a lay reader but the book has an extraordinary poetic essence to transmute into the Rovelie's reality. :)"

168,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874093-janna,2,"Never thought I’d see the day where I complained that a book leaned too far into the poetic, but here we are. I liked Part One, which lays out the physics behind why time is not as it seems, but Part Two goes too much into philosophising without much of a sound basis and without adequately laying out the supporting physics. Where Reality Is Not What It Seems took readers through a series of logical steps, provided the appropriate rigour, and created a sound place from which to begin amping up the complexity, The Order of Time begins in science and then swerves the argument into flowery interpretations of thinkers from St Augustine to Kant to Buddha. His ultimate conclusion seems to be that our experience of time is something that depends on our human lens: something that philosophers have said for centuries (and he quotes those philosophers). In support of this in the physics side of things, he briefly explains the irreversibility of ever-increasing entropy and how the relations between particles are blurred such that we are unable to perceive them. ""Therefore, our vision of the world is blurred because the physical interactions between the part of the world to which we belong and the rest are blind to many variables. ... This does not mean that blurring is a mental construct; it depends on actual, existing physical interactions."" He then switches to philosophy and quotes Hans Reichenbach, writing that time causes anxiety; as a result, we have imagined the existence of eternity and heaven and higher realms. And from there he suggests: ""Perhaps, ultimately, the emotional dimension of time is not the film of mist that prevents us from apprehending the nature of time objectively. Perhaps the emotion of time is precisely what time is for us."" His foray into the emotions is rooted more in literature and music, which (knowing how poets think) can be hit or miss. My main issue, however, is this. There is a difference between (1) humans being constructed such that we are unable to perceive the reality of time and (2) the emotions that arise from our particular experience of time. Those emotions might well cause us to be attached to time or have an awareness of it that doesn't match reality. But that's not the same as saying that, as humans, the structure of our minds and the physical interactions of slice of the universe we occupy are such that we are unable to perceive temporal reality, which is what I took his argument to be. Emotions are far more like a mental construct than the blurring of thermodynamic interactions occurring in the physical world. And what he says about emotions seems to suggest that we refuse to see reality, not that we are unable to (one could imagine a person who wasn't caught up with anxiety about time and didn't experience those obscuring emotions). Maybe he wasn't trying to put forward a serious argument for the place of emotions or maybe I'm reading ungenerously. Perhaps he was simply swept up with the poetry of it all, but that leads to confusion and makes the entire text less credible.I’m not a physicist and I know this is a pop science book — emphasis on the pop — but by the end it was a pop philosophy book sprinkled over with poetry and references to the likes of the Mahabharata, Bach, and the book of Job. The final chapter consists of his musings on what really drives us as human beings — and I do think it's all connected and that the final chapter drives at the point that really matters, but he didn't earn that ending. He didn't lay out the path correctly and, consequently, his broader conclusions on life feel flimsy. While physics and philosophy certainly have implications for one another, and there is truth also in art and poetry, The Order of Time does not result in a successful mix."
169,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,4,"In The Order of Time, Carlo Rovelli sticks to the theme that reality is not what it seems, in this case focusing entirely on the concept of time. In a sense, the history of science can be described as an uncompromising assault on intuition and common sense. The Earth appears flat and stationary, but in reality spins and soars through space at 67,000 miles per hour. Humans appear to be a species of their own special creation, but in reality are simply naturally evolved primates.These ideas are familiar by now, but they were revolutionary at the time of their discovery. What Rovelli is pointing out is that science may not be done with us yet—the next assault on our common sense might be the revelation of a world without time. Rovelli points out that what we label as “common sense” is often the intellectual work of past thinkers—who may or may not have gotten things right. How we think about time—our common sense notions of it—have in fact been shaped by past thinkers, the two most prominent being Aristotle and Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton thought that time was universal and absolute, that the variable “t” applied to everyone everywhere and continued to tick on even if everything in the universe stood still. Aristotle, in contrast, thought of time simply as the measure of change, and that without change it made no sense to talk about time in any absolute or universal sense. Because Aristotle got so much wrong in so many fields, you might think you ought to favor Newton in this debate, but according to Rovelli you’d be wrong to do so. Aristotle’s picture of time is closer to reality, as confirmed by the work of Albert Einstein. Einstein demonstrated that time is relative, not absolute. We now know that time moves slower at lower altitudes and at higher speeds. Someone living in the plains will age less than someone living in the mountains and someone traveling at high speeds will age less than someone stationary. This counterintuitive notion does not sit well with common sense, but that’s the point: reality is not, and has never been, what it seems. What all of this adds up to is that there is no such thing as universal time; there is only time for you, from your perspective, in relation to other objects. Reality is a world of events and changing quantities, not of shapes and universal space and time. And this is precisely what quantum physics demonstrates, where the equations that work have no time variable at all. So the flow of time is simply a psychological construct, an illusion, and one we may need to discard if we are to penetrate further into the depths of reality. But, if time is not embedded in the fabric of reality, it does beg the question: where does our concept of time come from? In a word: entropy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that entropy can never decrease, and increasing entropy is the way our minds mark the passing of time. Since entropy cannot be reversed, time flows in one direction from past to future. And so, entropy is part of the basic fabric of reality and time is simply our way of measuring it. That is, unless we’re talking quantum mechanics, which needs no time variable at all.----------------------------------------What should we make of this claim? Unless you are working in the field of quantum physics, it would be difficult to refute what Rovelli is saying. If the quantum equations do not require time, then either time is an illusion or else we don’t really understand the quantum world. You’ll have to read the book to get a handle on the more technical aspects that I won’t hesitate to admit flew right over my head. One point of contention I can offer, however, is regarding Rovelli’s claim that the concept of a “universal present” is nonsensical. Here’s how he describes it:Hypothetically, if you had a friend on another planet four light-years away, would both of you be experiencing the same present moment? According to Rovelli, there is no such present moment that applies to both of you.If you were to look at your friend through a telescope, you would be seeing him four years ago, because that’s how long the light would take to travel back to you. So your “now” and his “now” cannot be said to be occuring at the same present moment.But wait, is this right? I’m not so sure. Yes, it’s true that, looking through the telescope, you would be seeing your friend four years earlier, due to the limitation of the speed of light. But, if you were to continue to look through the telescope for four more years, you would see your friend’s “now” moment precisely four years later, and that would only be true if there was an initial present moment that was the same for both of you. So in a sense there is a universal present, it’s just not accessible to us perceptually due to the constraints of the speed of light. Maybe this is a small point, but I think it shows that a universal present has to exist, even if, due to the nature of the universe, time can only be perceived locally. In any case, it’s interesting to contemplate that time is simply the psychological measure of change, and that the underlying changes can speed up or slow down depending on your position and speed relative to other objects. This is the world of relativity and reality, which banishes Newton’s universal clock and redeems Aristotle’s notion of change. A final point to consider is that, if time is only a psychological construct, and is not in any objective sense part of the universe, then this could be the final nail in religion’s casket: without time, without a beginning, there is no need for “creation.” -------------------------------------------This is all, of course, a major oversimplification of the book. Rovelli provides an infinitely more detailed account and his excursions into the quantum realm are fascinating for those who have the interest and patience. He is a skilled and clear writer, and his Feynman-esque ability to explain complex topics in simple terms with ample metaphor and analogy is something you’ll appreciate when the topic turns to quantum loop gravity. Overall, it’s a fascinating book that will help you think more clearly about the concept of time, including what a world without time looks like. "
170,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2599582-aviva,3,"Carlo Rovelli does an amazing job of putting scientific concepts that are incredibly difficult to grasp into beautiful words. That said, I found this one harder going than his earlier Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. Maybe because it went deeper into one topic and thus delved into more difficult territory, or maybe just because the truth about time is so counterintuitive. Either way, it made my brain hurt in a good way (most of the time). But I would still recommend his earlier book first to those who want to get their toes wet in some of modern physics' more incomprehensible topics."
171,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4023528-vheissu,3,"I recommend this book to readers of popular science and philosophy. Physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers will be familiar with the themes already and probably have nothing much to learn here.Rovelli makes clear if not explicit that our difficulty in understanding ""time"" isn't limited to our intellectual shortcomings or even the precision of our measuring instruments, but also a limitation in our language. We simply don't have the vocabulary to understand or express the nature of ""time"" in any other than what the author calls ""naïve"" terms (p. 199), which is to say, our everyday, common-sense meaning of the word (past, present, and future, cause and effect). Even the common sense meaning of ""time"" is deeply flawed (see below), much less relevant to quantum and relativistic ""time."" We need to find terms other than ""time"" to express and understand events that occur beyond our perceptible senses.Rovelli offers a few alternative names for quantum and relativistic events, but the best he can do is apply adjective modifiers to the base noun (""thermal time,"" p. 134, or ""quantum time,"" p. 137). What he--we--needs to do is drop the adjective-noun combination altogether and come up with new terms to describe the relationship of events at micro- and macroscopic levels. As long as we include the noun, ""time,"" in trying to explain these things, confusion can only result, since our common-sense understanding of ""time"" is flawed and inhibits understanding of superficially similar but actually qualitatively different phenomena.Naïve Time. The flaws in our everyday, common sense understanding of ""time"" are well-known and documented. There is no single ""now."" ""Time"" does not pass at the same rate for all or even any two observers. ""Time"" is different for observers at different distances from a mass. A person's head experiences a different ""time"" than does her feet! The difference is imperceptible to human senses but it is not unmeasurable; we now have sufficiently precise instruments to measure those differences.This is not to say that our naïve understanding of ""time"" is so flawed as to be unuseful. The establishment of standard time zones in the late 19th century was arguably one of the most consequential public policy decisions in the last 150 years. Communication and transportation technologies require such standardization and would be difficult without it. It was Einstein's efforts to find a way to standardize timepieces for railroads, after all, that led to his Special Theory of Relativity. So, as far as naïve ""time"" is concerned, the term has practical applications and need not be abandoned. We just need to stop using that word for quantum and relativistic investigation.Thermal Time. At relativistic levels, which is to say macroscopic, Rovelli defines ""time"" in terms of entropy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics establishes the ""arrow"" of time--past, present, future. Heat dissipates. The amount of heat in the universe is the same today as it was at the Big Bang, but it has diffused and continues to do so. Our measurement of ""time,"" therefore, is a measurement of entropy: low entropy is the past, high entropy is the future.In a few trillion years from now, the Universe may reach a state of maximum entropy, a cold, motionless condition in which ""time,"" as such, becomes a meaningless idea. ""Time"" will ""stop,"" or become irrelevant to the state of affairs. That is death.Quantum Time. At the microscopic level, which is to say subatomic, our naïve understanding of ""time"" is of no help at all. Subatomic events occur at such small scales and incredibly quick intervals that it becomes pointless to think in terms of order and duration. The smallest increment of time is called Planck Time, which is something like 10-43 seconds (the value 10 with 43 zeroes behind it, or a hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, p. 83); the corresponding Planck length is 10 -33. We have no means by which to observe such imperceptible events. Yet. The numbers are the result of mathematic equations, not the result of empirical measurement. So it is pointless to apply a clumsy term like ""time"" to quantum mechanics.Rovelli reminds us that it was Aristotle who first explored the philosophy and physics of ""time."" For Aristotle, ""time"" was a measurement of change; if nothing ever changed, there would be no ""time."" Newton offered a contradictory opinion. For the great physicist, ""time"" passed even in the absence of change. Both were a little right and a little wrong. Today, we understand that a state of changelessness has never existed in our Universe. We live in a soup of quantum particles that never stop changing. There is no such thing as an absolute vacuum. Quantum particles pop into and out of existence even in the ""vacuum"" of empty space. You can create an airless volume in a bottle, but you can't stop electromagnetic waves from passing through it. The closest the Universe will ever get to changelessness is when it reaches maximum entropy. And that is a long way off."
172,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,5,"Carlo Rovelli has the brilliance of Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein and the communicative skills of Carl Sagan. Otherwise he is an Italian theoretical physicist that specializes in quantum gravity and is a proponent, if not quite an advocate, of loop theory. Beyond that he is a philosopher with a heart for ancient poetry and love.And he brings all of it to bear in this delightful book about time, which, in the end, is life, and everything, including the context in which it unfolds. It would be in error to suggest that time doesn’t exist, but it would be equally in error to suggest that time is as simple as the continuum we record with our clocks.What I like most about the book is the fact that Rovelli recognizes that philosophy and science, if not two sides of the same coin, are cousins. He refers to Proust, which few scientists do, and suggests that while reason is among the best tools available for interpreting our “collective delirium,” it is “only an instrument, a pincer.”The science and the prose are very accessible. You will, however, have to be willing to think abstractly, a skill that in our wired, binary world seems to be greatly dissipating. And he is the first scientist I have read in a while who takes time to explain why the problem is sometimes not the science itself, but the limitations of language. Language is a human construction and has not kept up with our scientific revelation. Which is why theoretical physicists sometimes seem to be speaking another language. If only there was another language that was constructed in the world as we know it today, our communication would be so much easier and our knowledge would expand more rapidly. It would be impossible to summarize the knowledge contained in this book. You really have to read it. Here is a start, however: “The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.” If you can comprehend that the rest is largely additional perspective.And if the idea that universal time doesn’t exist in any absolute since seems a stretch, consider Rovelli’s simple explanation (I’m paraphrasing): People never used to worry about clocks. They worried about the cycle of sunshine and darkness. But that cycle is different in every single village, town, and city on the planet. The cycle varies both east to west and north to south. And back when we used to spend our lives in our little village we didn’t care. But then the scientists and engineers invented trains to take us from one village to the next. And people needed to know when the train left their village. But how can you develop a timetable when every village has its own time? You can’t. But, at the same time, it’s not quite practical to say that the whole world has just one time. Farmers don’t care what the sun is doing in London. They care what it’s doing on their farm. (China actually has no time zones by edict. The entire country is on Beijing time and there are significant practical implications.) The solution was the time zone, and it’s a compromise. Time zones are a construct and practical in the local sense, but highly inaccurate when talking about the universe. In the language of theoretical physics, they don’t exist.Eastern philosophers believe that reality is not knowable. It is real, but is made up of an infinite number of variables. We can only comprehend or think about a handful at a time. A tree is real. I can touch it and smell it. But it is not entirely knowable because there are too many variables (e.g. altitude, climate, soil, etc.) that define each tree for me to know them all. Time is the same way. Time is real but it is not knowable. Throw in the limitations of language and it begins to look like an illusion.To his great credit, Rovelli admits that there is much we don’t know. Think of a Seurat painting that has been blacked out. We have exposed a few, perhaps 10% (my number), of the original dots of pigment. It’s a lot, but we’re still guessing as to what the underlying picture is.And that’s pretty exciting. The key to our understanding to date, however, is the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy can never decrease. It’s critical to our understanding of time, as Rovelli explains. Personally I’m not convinced it’s inviolate. Perhaps we just haven’t uncovered enough dots of pigment yet. If entropy could work both ways it would explain a lot, but attraction does not equal fact. (Entropy obviously has a big part in causality, of course. Bidirectional entropy would be a huge boost for inductive reason.)It’s a short book and even if you get through a small amount of it you will learn a lot. Beyond writing in an accessible way, Rovelli comes off as very personable. The perfect person to sit down and share a cup of coffee with. If only he had the time. (Sorry)A marvelous book that I highly recommend."
173,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7999890-ken-gronnbeck,2,The book starts good but I get confused at the end. This book is not even close to the two other books I've read by him.

It's a marvel to me that such a relatively short book could completely overturn my conceptions of reality, Newtonian physics, and my sense of self. What I love most about The Order of Time is how it bridges the gap of hard maths into the realm of the human experience. So many of the ""wicked problems"" we talk about today in politics or sociology are down simply to the fact that the solution is imperminent. I realize that this book is an introduction to this field, and a very flowery one at that. I'm sure that people who are steeped in the field have thier issues with some of the poetic liberties Rovelli took in explaining some of the the concepts. The book also has one or two contradictions, and places where the author departs from his stated goal of relaying established theory in digestible terms to trying to convince the audience of his particular ""loop theory"" of time. I know from reading the reviews that many have the same problem with this book that I do with the likes of Sapiens by Yuval Harari. But this book is a fantastic and accessible gateway for those who want to be won over by the wonders of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics while always being afraid of ""the mathy bits."" On a personal note, this book has potentially one of my favorite quotes from any book I've read this year: ""The world... Is a boundless and disorderly network of quantum events... It is much more Naples than Singapore."" As one of the few who has been to Naples Italy and loved it, I now have a justification as to why! Thank you, Dr. Rovelli, for this and so much more.I will definitely be reading this book again, as I don't believe I was able to gleen all it has to offer."
177,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,4,"4.5 stars What is time? What does it really mean to say that time ‘passes’? Do we exist in time, or does time exist in us? What is the meaning of now?These are the questions that Carlo Rovelli tries to answer in The Order of Time. He takes us on a journey on how our understanding of the concept of time has changed from antiquity to the present and into the field of quantum gravity, his area of expertise. It is a magma of beautiful and exciting ideas, from physics to philosophy, “sometimes illuminating, sometimes confusing.”We perceive time as one dimensional thing, it has a direction, the past is completely different from the future. The past seems to be one of the most obvious things, it is fixed, we have traces of it, we have memories, there are books to read and learn about the past. Time is a great conceptual idea and works very well in our daily lives but is has a different meaning in quantum mechanics and general relativity. The elementary equations that govern the physical world fail to show any distinction between the past and the future.Time is not a single thing, says Rovelli, but a multi-layered concept, a combination of properties that we can dismount, one by one. What it remains when you take away all these properties, is nothing at all. This is perhaps best exemplified by the physicists John Wheeler and Bryce DeWitt back in the 1970s, when they attempted to unify relativity and quantum mechanics resulted in time essentially disappearing completely from their equation (known as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation), suggesting that time does not exist at all. Rovelli looks in detail at the nature of entropy, arguing that “what makes the world go round are not sources of energy but sources of low entropy. Without low entropy, energy would dilute into uniform heat and the world would go to sleep in a state of thermal equilibrium – there would no longer be any distinction between past and future, and nothing would happen.” Boltzmann understood that entropy is not just a fundamental quantity but a measure of how things are disordered - when you mix thing (disorder) entropy goes up. The fact that entropy has been low in the past leads to an important fact that is ubiquitous and crucial for the difference between past and future: the past leaves traces of itself in the present. The only cause of the difference between past and future, argues Rovelli, is the low energy of the past. This is an astounding idea that is hard to comprehend and perhaps even harder to accept. But it is also revealing, and told in Rovelli’s clear and concise style, makes perfect sense. Rovelli has a deep technical knowledge of his subject; at the same time, he writes beautifully and although I got lost several times when he discussed the strange world of loop quantum gravity, it was exciting to penetrate some layers of the mystery of time. This is an exquisite and intellectually challenging book. It takes time to read, although, reflecting on the various physical variables of time, you might think otherwise.  link:  my review "
178,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,3,"This is really a 2.5. I was following along fine until mid-way through the second part, and I'm not sure whether it was the translation or the physics that lost me. Through the fuzz, I just kept thinking, ""There has to be an easier way to say this."" And it turns out, there was: the final chapter (The Sources of Time) summarized all his points in a clear and understandable way. So, if he can say it so clearly there, what was up with the rest of the book? He tells readers that the notes are for those who really understand the physics of it, but I'd hesitate to say the rest of the book is for us 'normal folks.' More like us 'normal folks who do LSD/mushrooms', which he hinted at a few times. The other thing that I felt was a problem in the book is a problem I have in general with reductionist metaphysical conversations-- once Rovelli had laid it all out, he did a poor job of explaining the possible significance of the knowledge. He commented a couple of times that our 'naive image of time was suitable [necessary] for our daily life', and that 'at an elementary level there are no cats either, but we do not for this reason cease to bother with cats.' Knowing how time works does not change how we experience it (and he doesn't seem to imply that it should), or how humans find meaning in it. Rovelli worked hard to reinforce the sheer number of possible outcomes and, in the process, essentially undermined the importance of understanding that it was all a series of probabilistic events-- i.e, why cats? and if they once existed, why do cats continue to exist? <-- the point here is that he missed the chance to make a larger tie-in to the meaning of it all (or lack thereof). If this order of time shows us that there is no order, that everything is random, reduced to the physical interactions between all the pieces of the universe, and that this knowledge shouldn't change anything about how we live our lives, to say nothing of the fact that we are so myopic we may never understand it, then knowing how it all works would be meaningless, right? Maybe not. But if not, Rovelli did a poor job explaining why. One final note: After I finished reading The Order of Time, I went looking for reviews to see what I had missed (due to the translation or the physics). This review did a pretty good job of summing up a lot of my feelings:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
179,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315851-roozbeh-daneshvar,3,"Before I started reading this book, I asked myself what is it about time that he is going to say? Time seemed obvious and didn't need any more elaboration (I admit that I knew nothing about time). This book opened my eyes and exposed me to aspects of time that I had never imagined.There were many places throughout reading that I was astonished by the new perspectives. For example, how there is a symmetry between past and future in classical mechanics (you just reverse the time direction and bam, everything works well, even though backwards). As another example, I was amazed that how the author connected time to memory (or how do you perceive time if you do not remember anything). He also connected music to memory. You would not enjoy music if you do not have memory: for every note, you have a recollection of the previous note/notes and also an anticipation of the upcoming notes. Without that memory, every moment of a music is just a single note, which would be meaningless.One part that resonated with me was about death and the fear of death. It was exactly the same case for me, as I have mixed feelings of fear of death and an openness for embracing it, both at the same time. This book put the same concept in the framework of time for me. It talked about how time has been troubling to human beings in the history.The text switched between solid physics concepts and some philosophical or even anecdotal themes. To me, it seemed not as a balanced combination, but an incoherent concoction. A large part might be because of my lack of understanding of the topic. Yet, I am skeptical that a poor translation might have contributed, too. In general, I did not find it a well-written text (although this is a personal opinion).If you want to know about time (with which you are probably in touch with, or you'd better be), do consider reading this book. It might open new doors for you."

Rovelli's attempt to explain away thermodynamic-entropic time and the whole of complex systems by telling us ""it's all a blur"" - that our experience of past and future and the direction of time, of evolution, growth, decay, and the whole of biology is basically nothing but subjective phenomenology or the ignorance of human perception is simply laughable. What universe is he living in?To ignore the work of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world who've established the sciences of chaos, complexity, nonlinear systems, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics and assert that their view of time is somehow not real, some illusion or whatever, is arrogant and irresponsible, not to mention narrow-minded. This is scientific fundamentalism and works against the goal of science to produce a coherent system of thought across many domains. The Order of Time appears to be a last ditch attempt to revive the old Platonic-Newtonian deterministic worldview in the face of the contemporary view of emergence, probability, instability, nonlinearity, complexity, chaos, and irreversibility - a kind of marketing ploy to convince the public that the old view of physics still reigns supreme over all else. In this book, Rovelli appears to represent an old guard of physicists, extreme reductionists, who are unable to embrace the scientific revolution that has engulfed their science, the revolution that is complex, nonequilibrium, and nonlinear systems theory.

185,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Like a lot of young nerds, I had a period of fascination with advanced physics. Never enough to actually become all that good at it, mind you. I just about wrapped my brain around the wave-particle duality, in order to get my degree in Electrical Engineering. I took one course on Relativity. I found it all to be fascinating, and also really, really hard. There were other people, for whom it was equally fascinating, but more like ""fun"" than ""hard"". I was not one of those people.The primary benefit to me of having taken those courses as a youngster, was not that it did me the slightest bit of good whatsoever in my professional life in the semiconductor industry. It turns out that, truth be told, you don't have to be all that good at physics to make semiconductors, or even to test circuits made of them, or even to improve processes for making them. Perhaps you have to be really good at physics to invent them in the first place, but that was not a task I ever had to accomplish.No, the primary benefit was that, when someone invoked quantum physics or relativity to bolster their hand-wavy philosophy, I could recognize that they didn't know what they were talking about. There is, it turns out, nothing in quantum physics or relativity that proves or disproves anybody's idea about God, the meaning of life, whether there is an objective reality, or where consciousness comes from. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying, or just projecting their hopes onto the deeply unintuitive world of the very small or very fast.Still, Rovelli is himself a professional, one of those people who does actually know a lot more about physics than I do, and his book had two other things going for it. One, it was short, and a nice compact size. Two, it had a goodly amount of pictures. When I read something like advanced physics, the reality is I'm not ready to go through 800 pages' worth, and I need some diagrams, or sketches, or graphs, or something besides a wall of text with the occasional equation.It turns out that Rovelli is also apparently quite good at explaining things. It may have helped some that I had learned some of the early parts of the book before, but it had been decades, and I found myself wishing that he had been the guy writing my college physics textbooks, or perhaps teaching the classes. But then, it may also be that reading about physics for fun, is a lot more enjoyable than taking a test on it, which is going to be curved to guarantee that around 25% of the class gets a failing grade.Rovelli's thesis seems to be, that time is not a fundamental part of reality in the way that, say, mass or electromagnetism is. Rather, it is more like perspective. He claims that this is actually the pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian way of thinking about time. Time is nothing other than the order in which we experience things. Rovelli's claim (which I am unable to really evaluate the truth of), is that the modern idea of time as a dimension is Newton's, and while it may have been a reasonable operating assumption for him at that, uh, time, it isn't the literal truth. Just as quantum physics and relativity have upended other parts of Newton's worldview, Rovelli says that they have returned us to a pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian idea of time.One is reminded of the saying, ""time is what keeps everything from happening at once"". Rovelli seems to be saying something more like, time is the order in which we perceive things as happening. If we are all, relative to one another, moving at very low speeds (compared to the speed of light in a vacuum), then we never notice that my time is different than yours. Once you think about the very fast, very big, or very small, our intuitions don't work.There was also some stuff about entropy in there.To be honest, if I really wanted to understand what Rovelli was saying here, in depth, well enough to pass a test on it, I would need to read it again. And you know, I just might do that. But not yet, because I am once again in the blessed position of being able to read about physics for exactly as much as I feel like, and neither more nor less. I believe that it is true for me, anyway, that a little more time should pass before I reread this one.It was pretty good, though, so perhaps not too much time."
186,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison,4,"Originally reviewed at The Book Wheel.Consider the following: time passes faster in the mountains than it does at sea level. If this sentence confounds you but piques your interest, then I can already tell you that you want to read The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli, which answers questions such as what is time? Is there a universal time? What does it mean to live in the present? Does the present exist? Turns out, these are simple questions with no easy answers because time is complicated. I don’t mean that timezones are confusing or that time passing faster in the mountains is perplexing, but that at an elemental level, time doesn’t even exist the way we think it does.Luckily, The Order of Time takes an approachable, scientific look at these questions and explores ideas rooted in quantum physics, thermodynamics, and the human condition. It will expand your mind, confuse the heck out of you, and, if you’re like me, leave you pondering some pretty heavy philosophical conundrums.One thing I learned that does make sense is that there is no now because now is just the perception of time. By the time we perceive something happening, nanoseconds have already passed. This means that everything we do, think, say, or hear exists both in the past and the present depending on if you’re saying it or hearing it. In other words, time is so fleeting we’re more or less living in the future as much as we are the present. For example, I can ask what you’re doing right now (reading this sentence) but by the time you process the words I have written, the act of reading it is in the past. WHAT?!Taking this one step further, this also means two people are never actually in the same place at the same time. I can speak to you, but by the time you perceive my actions, I am already living in the past. Throw in timezones and it’s easy to see why there’s no true, universal time. Time exists in relativity. Perhaps the author says it best when he said, “Physics does not describe how things evolve “in time” but how things evolve in their own times, and how “times” evolve relative to each other.”This relativity also applies to what it means to exist. One example The Order of Time gives is the emergence of teams. A group of children can line up and pick teams, one by one, for a soccer game. This new team doesn’t already exist, but it emerges and then does exist because different entities combine to make it so. So if you can create something out of nothing, what does that mean for the whole of existence? And is existence all relative? Some might say that a literary character doesn’t exist, as in they are not “real”, but yet they do exist, if even in our collective minds. Existence, Rovelli argues, is grammatical: “Words such as “here,” “now,” “I,” “this,” “tonight” all assume a different meaning depending on who utters them and the circumstances in which they are uttered.”Philosophical pondering aside, Rovelli explains all of this by rooting it in science. He tackles major scientific theories of time, from Aristotle’s belief that time measures change to Newton’s idea that time is independent of us. He discusses entropy and how it evolves over time, linking it to the laws of thermodynamics and quantum physics.Yet despite this heavy reading, there’s a romantic quality to The Order of Time. Because in the end, it’s all about how we, as humans, perceive time. It is our own “blurred vision” that shapes how we see the world. We are made up of our experiences, traces, and narratives, and each is unique to us. And although the following quote isn’t about time, per se, it does speak to the larger question of whether the absence of something exists: “But it isn’t absence that causes sorrow. It is affection and love. Without affection, without love, such absences would cause us no pain. For this reason, even the pain caused by absence is, in the end, something good and even beautiful, because it feeds on that which gives meaning to life.”"

For me, it has been emotional to go back to what I have learned when studying general relativity and quantum mechanics, so many years ago. And so exciting to learn the new steps that have been made during the past 50 years. I now have an idea of what originates the arrow of time, and this itself is fantastic! Go read it! And stick to it until the end!"

189,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"I have read a lot of popular physics books and many of them just go over the same ground, but this one was a bit new and different. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of relativity is comfortable with the idea that time passes at different rates depending on the relative velocities of two observers, but Rovelli takes us a step further -- it is not just the rate at which time passes that depends on point of view, it is time itself. Rovelli starts by showing how time and entropy are intimately related as the only physical concepts which have an irreversible forward arrow pointing to the future. He then explains how the level of entropy of a system is a function of point of view -- whether a given system is disordered depends on how order is defined (I remember telling my stepmother when I was a teenager that my room was neat because I could find everything I needed in the mess.) If time is a function of entropy and entropy depends on point of view, then perhaps time does too. Time, like entropy, becomes a function of blurring, of uncertainty about things that we do not or cannot measure. Hmmmm. At the very least it is an intriguing idea; maybe it is even true. Perhaps it only appears to us that the universe must have started with the Big Bang and may end with entropic heat death because of what time and entropy look like to us from our localized point of view. So there is no universal physical truth, or at least not one that depends on space and time, which turn out to be localized concepts. But perhaps there are universal concepts for how things relate to one another that are not built into a fixed unchanging view of space and time and that can therefore give us a broad picture of the universe. Rovelli teases us with the assertion that his field, loop quantum gravity, manages to take time out of the most basic equations of the universe, but he doesn't try to explain how, probably because it is too complex for a popular book.I enjoyed this book as an audiobook with a dazzlingly good narration by Benedict Cumberbatch. Sometimes science books are better enjoyed in print editions, but this one worked quite well in audio. The quality of the writing is excellent and clear. The explanations of scientific ideas are not simple but they are comprenhensible even for a person with a limited background in physics and no math. And the rich, expressive voice of Mr. Cumberbatch makes the experience complete."
190,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,3,"This introduction to the modern physicist's understanding of time is difficult to rate for a few reasons. First of all, I already knew about most of these concepts so there wasn't really anything revelatory here. Had I not brought this foreknowledge to this book, I think I may have found it more interesting. Also, acknowledging the linguistic difficulty of discussing time as frequently people mean very different things when using the word, Rovelli falls victim to this very problem throughout the book. Occasionally he gets the point across very well only to confuse the issue he just clarified in the next paragraph. Lastly, I don't think we need all of the literary and spiritual meanderings he gets into. I know that it is trendy for physicists to bring in literature and use overly flowery language to describe the most complicated of scientific discussions but the degree to which this is used here is quite extreme, and in a work of such brevity, seems like a replacement for genuine profundity as opposed to being additive. I admire Rovelli's interest in bringing these important concepts to a mass audience, even if there is some depth and rigor lost in the effort. However, if your notion of time is that which comes from grade school then perhaps this will be an effective précis for future study, if you want a more interesting discussion about how these notions relate to your functioning as a human then I would recommend, ""Your Brain is a Time Machine,"" by Dean Buonomano.

He argues that our perception of time’s flow depends entirely on our inability to see the world in all its detail. Quantum uncertainty means we cannot know the positions and speeds of all the particles in the Universe. If we could, there would be no entropy and no unraveling of time. Rovelli originated this ‘thermal time hypothesis’ with French mathematician Alain Connes.Maybe, this book alone is not enough to pass judgment as a lay reader but the book has an extraordinary poetic essence to transmute into the Rovelie's reality. :)"

198,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874093-janna,2,"Never thought I’d see the day where I complained that a book leaned too far into the poetic, but here we are. I liked Part One, which lays out the physics behind why time is not as it seems, but Part Two goes too much into philosophising without much of a sound basis and without adequately laying out the supporting physics. Where Reality Is Not What It Seems took readers through a series of logical steps, provided the appropriate rigour, and created a sound place from which to begin amping up the complexity, The Order of Time begins in science and then swerves the argument into flowery interpretations of thinkers from St Augustine to Kant to Buddha. His ultimate conclusion seems to be that our experience of time is something that depends on our human lens: something that philosophers have said for centuries (and he quotes those philosophers). In support of this in the physics side of things, he briefly explains the irreversibility of ever-increasing entropy and how the relations between particles are blurred such that we are unable to perceive them. ""Therefore, our vision of the world is blurred because the physical interactions between the part of the world to which we belong and the rest are blind to many variables. ... This does not mean that blurring is a mental construct; it depends on actual, existing physical interactions."" He then switches to philosophy and quotes Hans Reichenbach, writing that time causes anxiety; as a result, we have imagined the existence of eternity and heaven and higher realms. And from there he suggests: ""Perhaps, ultimately, the emotional dimension of time is not the film of mist that prevents us from apprehending the nature of time objectively. Perhaps the emotion of time is precisely what time is for us."" His foray into the emotions is rooted more in literature and music, which (knowing how poets think) can be hit or miss. My main issue, however, is this. There is a difference between (1) humans being constructed such that we are unable to perceive the reality of time and (2) the emotions that arise from our particular experience of time. Those emotions might well cause us to be attached to time or have an awareness of it that doesn't match reality. But that's not the same as saying that, as humans, the structure of our minds and the physical interactions of slice of the universe we occupy are such that we are unable to perceive temporal reality, which is what I took his argument to be. Emotions are far more like a mental construct than the blurring of thermodynamic interactions occurring in the physical world. And what he says about emotions seems to suggest that we refuse to see reality, not that we are unable to (one could imagine a person who wasn't caught up with anxiety about time and didn't experience those obscuring emotions). Maybe he wasn't trying to put forward a serious argument for the place of emotions or maybe I'm reading ungenerously. Perhaps he was simply swept up with the poetry of it all, but that leads to confusion and makes the entire text less credible.I’m not a physicist and I know this is a pop science book — emphasis on the pop — but by the end it was a pop philosophy book sprinkled over with poetry and references to the likes of the Mahabharata, Bach, and the book of Job. The final chapter consists of his musings on what really drives us as human beings — and I do think it's all connected and that the final chapter drives at the point that really matters, but he didn't earn that ending. He didn't lay out the path correctly and, consequently, his broader conclusions on life feel flimsy. While physics and philosophy certainly have implications for one another, and there is truth also in art and poetry, The Order of Time does not result in a successful mix."
199,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,4,"In The Order of Time, Carlo Rovelli sticks to the theme that reality is not what it seems, in this case focusing entirely on the concept of time. In a sense, the history of science can be described as an uncompromising assault on intuition and common sense. The Earth appears flat and stationary, but in reality spins and soars through space at 67,000 miles per hour. Humans appear to be a species of their own special creation, but in reality are simply naturally evolved primates.These ideas are familiar by now, but they were revolutionary at the time of their discovery. What Rovelli is pointing out is that science may not be done with us yet—the next assault on our common sense might be the revelation of a world without time. Rovelli points out that what we label as “common sense” is often the intellectual work of past thinkers—who may or may not have gotten things right. How we think about time—our common sense notions of it—have in fact been shaped by past thinkers, the two most prominent being Aristotle and Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton thought that time was universal and absolute, that the variable “t” applied to everyone everywhere and continued to tick on even if everything in the universe stood still. Aristotle, in contrast, thought of time simply as the measure of change, and that without change it made no sense to talk about time in any absolute or universal sense. Because Aristotle got so much wrong in so many fields, you might think you ought to favor Newton in this debate, but according to Rovelli you’d be wrong to do so. Aristotle’s picture of time is closer to reality, as confirmed by the work of Albert Einstein. Einstein demonstrated that time is relative, not absolute. We now know that time moves slower at lower altitudes and at higher speeds. Someone living in the plains will age less than someone living in the mountains and someone traveling at high speeds will age less than someone stationary. This counterintuitive notion does not sit well with common sense, but that’s the point: reality is not, and has never been, what it seems. What all of this adds up to is that there is no such thing as universal time; there is only time for you, from your perspective, in relation to other objects. Reality is a world of events and changing quantities, not of shapes and universal space and time. And this is precisely what quantum physics demonstrates, where the equations that work have no time variable at all. So the flow of time is simply a psychological construct, an illusion, and one we may need to discard if we are to penetrate further into the depths of reality. But, if time is not embedded in the fabric of reality, it does beg the question: where does our concept of time come from? In a word: entropy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that entropy can never decrease, and increasing entropy is the way our minds mark the passing of time. Since entropy cannot be reversed, time flows in one direction from past to future. And so, entropy is part of the basic fabric of reality and time is simply our way of measuring it. That is, unless we’re talking quantum mechanics, which needs no time variable at all.----------------------------------------What should we make of this claim? Unless you are working in the field of quantum physics, it would be difficult to refute what Rovelli is saying. If the quantum equations do not require time, then either time is an illusion or else we don’t really understand the quantum world. You’ll have to read the book to get a handle on the more technical aspects that I won’t hesitate to admit flew right over my head. One point of contention I can offer, however, is regarding Rovelli’s claim that the concept of a “universal present” is nonsensical. Here’s how he describes it:Hypothetically, if you had a friend on another planet four light-years away, would both of you be experiencing the same present moment? According to Rovelli, there is no such present moment that applies to both of you.If you were to look at your friend through a telescope, you would be seeing him four years ago, because that’s how long the light would take to travel back to you. So your “now” and his “now” cannot be said to be occuring at the same present moment.But wait, is this right? I’m not so sure. Yes, it’s true that, looking through the telescope, you would be seeing your friend four years earlier, due to the limitation of the speed of light. But, if you were to continue to look through the telescope for four more years, you would see your friend’s “now” moment precisely four years later, and that would only be true if there was an initial present moment that was the same for both of you. So in a sense there is a universal present, it’s just not accessible to us perceptually due to the constraints of the speed of light. Maybe this is a small point, but I think it shows that a universal present has to exist, even if, due to the nature of the universe, time can only be perceived locally. In any case, it’s interesting to contemplate that time is simply the psychological measure of change, and that the underlying changes can speed up or slow down depending on your position and speed relative to other objects. This is the world of relativity and reality, which banishes Newton’s universal clock and redeems Aristotle’s notion of change. A final point to consider is that, if time is only a psychological construct, and is not in any objective sense part of the universe, then this could be the final nail in religion’s casket: without time, without a beginning, there is no need for “creation.” -------------------------------------------This is all, of course, a major oversimplification of the book. Rovelli provides an infinitely more detailed account and his excursions into the quantum realm are fascinating for those who have the interest and patience. He is a skilled and clear writer, and his Feynman-esque ability to explain complex topics in simple terms with ample metaphor and analogy is something you’ll appreciate when the topic turns to quantum loop gravity. Overall, it’s a fascinating book that will help you think more clearly about the concept of time, including what a world without time looks like. "
200,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2599582-aviva,3,"Carlo Rovelli does an amazing job of putting scientific concepts that are incredibly difficult to grasp into beautiful words. That said, I found this one harder going than his earlier Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. Maybe because it went deeper into one topic and thus delved into more difficult territory, or maybe just because the truth about time is so counterintuitive. Either way, it made my brain hurt in a good way (most of the time). But I would still recommend his earlier book first to those who want to get their toes wet in some of modern physics' more incomprehensible topics."
201,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4023528-vheissu,3,"I recommend this book to readers of popular science and philosophy. Physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers will be familiar with the themes already and probably have nothing much to learn here.Rovelli makes clear if not explicit that our difficulty in understanding ""time"" isn't limited to our intellectual shortcomings or even the precision of our measuring instruments, but also a limitation in our language. We simply don't have the vocabulary to understand or express the nature of ""time"" in any other than what the author calls ""naïve"" terms (p. 199), which is to say, our everyday, common-sense meaning of the word (past, present, and future, cause and effect). Even the common sense meaning of ""time"" is deeply flawed (see below), much less relevant to quantum and relativistic ""time."" We need to find terms other than ""time"" to express and understand events that occur beyond our perceptible senses.Rovelli offers a few alternative names for quantum and relativistic events, but the best he can do is apply adjective modifiers to the base noun (""thermal time,"" p. 134, or ""quantum time,"" p. 137). What he--we--needs to do is drop the adjective-noun combination altogether and come up with new terms to describe the relationship of events at micro- and macroscopic levels. As long as we include the noun, ""time,"" in trying to explain these things, confusion can only result, since our common-sense understanding of ""time"" is flawed and inhibits understanding of superficially similar but actually qualitatively different phenomena.Naïve Time. The flaws in our everyday, common sense understanding of ""time"" are well-known and documented. There is no single ""now."" ""Time"" does not pass at the same rate for all or even any two observers. ""Time"" is different for observers at different distances from a mass. A person's head experiences a different ""time"" than does her feet! The difference is imperceptible to human senses but it is not unmeasurable; we now have sufficiently precise instruments to measure those differences.This is not to say that our naïve understanding of ""time"" is so flawed as to be unuseful. The establishment of standard time zones in the late 19th century was arguably one of the most consequential public policy decisions in the last 150 years. Communication and transportation technologies require such standardization and would be difficult without it. It was Einstein's efforts to find a way to standardize timepieces for railroads, after all, that led to his Special Theory of Relativity. So, as far as naïve ""time"" is concerned, the term has practical applications and need not be abandoned. We just need to stop using that word for quantum and relativistic investigation.Thermal Time. At relativistic levels, which is to say macroscopic, Rovelli defines ""time"" in terms of entropy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics establishes the ""arrow"" of time--past, present, future. Heat dissipates. The amount of heat in the universe is the same today as it was at the Big Bang, but it has diffused and continues to do so. Our measurement of ""time,"" therefore, is a measurement of entropy: low entropy is the past, high entropy is the future.In a few trillion years from now, the Universe may reach a state of maximum entropy, a cold, motionless condition in which ""time,"" as such, becomes a meaningless idea. ""Time"" will ""stop,"" or become irrelevant to the state of affairs. That is death.Quantum Time. At the microscopic level, which is to say subatomic, our naïve understanding of ""time"" is of no help at all. Subatomic events occur at such small scales and incredibly quick intervals that it becomes pointless to think in terms of order and duration. The smallest increment of time is called Planck Time, which is something like 10-43 seconds (the value 10 with 43 zeroes behind it, or a hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, p. 83); the corresponding Planck length is 10 -33. We have no means by which to observe such imperceptible events. Yet. The numbers are the result of mathematic equations, not the result of empirical measurement. So it is pointless to apply a clumsy term like ""time"" to quantum mechanics.Rovelli reminds us that it was Aristotle who first explored the philosophy and physics of ""time."" For Aristotle, ""time"" was a measurement of change; if nothing ever changed, there would be no ""time."" Newton offered a contradictory opinion. For the great physicist, ""time"" passed even in the absence of change. Both were a little right and a little wrong. Today, we understand that a state of changelessness has never existed in our Universe. We live in a soup of quantum particles that never stop changing. There is no such thing as an absolute vacuum. Quantum particles pop into and out of existence even in the ""vacuum"" of empty space. You can create an airless volume in a bottle, but you can't stop electromagnetic waves from passing through it. The closest the Universe will ever get to changelessness is when it reaches maximum entropy. And that is a long way off."
202,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,5,"Carlo Rovelli has the brilliance of Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein and the communicative skills of Carl Sagan. Otherwise he is an Italian theoretical physicist that specializes in quantum gravity and is a proponent, if not quite an advocate, of loop theory. Beyond that he is a philosopher with a heart for ancient poetry and love.And he brings all of it to bear in this delightful book about time, which, in the end, is life, and everything, including the context in which it unfolds. It would be in error to suggest that time doesn’t exist, but it would be equally in error to suggest that time is as simple as the continuum we record with our clocks.What I like most about the book is the fact that Rovelli recognizes that philosophy and science, if not two sides of the same coin, are cousins. He refers to Proust, which few scientists do, and suggests that while reason is among the best tools available for interpreting our “collective delirium,” it is “only an instrument, a pincer.”The science and the prose are very accessible. You will, however, have to be willing to think abstractly, a skill that in our wired, binary world seems to be greatly dissipating. And he is the first scientist I have read in a while who takes time to explain why the problem is sometimes not the science itself, but the limitations of language. Language is a human construction and has not kept up with our scientific revelation. Which is why theoretical physicists sometimes seem to be speaking another language. If only there was another language that was constructed in the world as we know it today, our communication would be so much easier and our knowledge would expand more rapidly. It would be impossible to summarize the knowledge contained in this book. You really have to read it. Here is a start, however: “The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.” If you can comprehend that the rest is largely additional perspective.And if the idea that universal time doesn’t exist in any absolute since seems a stretch, consider Rovelli’s simple explanation (I’m paraphrasing): People never used to worry about clocks. They worried about the cycle of sunshine and darkness. But that cycle is different in every single village, town, and city on the planet. The cycle varies both east to west and north to south. And back when we used to spend our lives in our little village we didn’t care. But then the scientists and engineers invented trains to take us from one village to the next. And people needed to know when the train left their village. But how can you develop a timetable when every village has its own time? You can’t. But, at the same time, it’s not quite practical to say that the whole world has just one time. Farmers don’t care what the sun is doing in London. They care what it’s doing on their farm. (China actually has no time zones by edict. The entire country is on Beijing time and there are significant practical implications.) The solution was the time zone, and it’s a compromise. Time zones are a construct and practical in the local sense, but highly inaccurate when talking about the universe. In the language of theoretical physics, they don’t exist.Eastern philosophers believe that reality is not knowable. It is real, but is made up of an infinite number of variables. We can only comprehend or think about a handful at a time. A tree is real. I can touch it and smell it. But it is not entirely knowable because there are too many variables (e.g. altitude, climate, soil, etc.) that define each tree for me to know them all. Time is the same way. Time is real but it is not knowable. Throw in the limitations of language and it begins to look like an illusion.To his great credit, Rovelli admits that there is much we don’t know. Think of a Seurat painting that has been blacked out. We have exposed a few, perhaps 10% (my number), of the original dots of pigment. It’s a lot, but we’re still guessing as to what the underlying picture is.And that’s pretty exciting. The key to our understanding to date, however, is the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy can never decrease. It’s critical to our understanding of time, as Rovelli explains. Personally I’m not convinced it’s inviolate. Perhaps we just haven’t uncovered enough dots of pigment yet. If entropy could work both ways it would explain a lot, but attraction does not equal fact. (Entropy obviously has a big part in causality, of course. Bidirectional entropy would be a huge boost for inductive reason.)It’s a short book and even if you get through a small amount of it you will learn a lot. Beyond writing in an accessible way, Rovelli comes off as very personable. The perfect person to sit down and share a cup of coffee with. If only he had the time. (Sorry)A marvelous book that I highly recommend."

It's a marvel to me that such a relatively short book could completely overturn my conceptions of reality, Newtonian physics, and my sense of self. What I love most about The Order of Time is how it bridges the gap of hard maths into the realm of the human experience. So many of the ""wicked problems"" we talk about today in politics or sociology are down simply to the fact that the solution is imperminent. I realize that this book is an introduction to this field, and a very flowery one at that. I'm sure that people who are steeped in the field have thier issues with some of the poetic liberties Rovelli took in explaining some of the the concepts. The book also has one or two contradictions, and places where the author departs from his stated goal of relaying established theory in digestible terms to trying to convince the audience of his particular ""loop theory"" of time. I know from reading the reviews that many have the same problem with this book that I do with the likes of Sapiens by Yuval Harari. But this book is a fantastic and accessible gateway for those who want to be won over by the wonders of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics while always being afraid of ""the mathy bits."" On a personal note, this book has potentially one of my favorite quotes from any book I've read this year: ""The world... Is a boundless and disorderly network of quantum events... It is much more Naples than Singapore."" As one of the few who has been to Naples Italy and loved it, I now have a justification as to why! Thank you, Dr. Rovelli, for this and so much more.I will definitely be reading this book again, as I don't believe I was able to gleen all it has to offer."
207,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,4,"4.5 stars What is time? What does it really mean to say that time ‘passes’? Do we exist in time, or does time exist in us? What is the meaning of now?These are the questions that Carlo Rovelli tries to answer in The Order of Time. He takes us on a journey on how our understanding of the concept of time has changed from antiquity to the present and into the field of quantum gravity, his area of expertise. It is a magma of beautiful and exciting ideas, from physics to philosophy, “sometimes illuminating, sometimes confusing.”We perceive time as one dimensional thing, it has a direction, the past is completely different from the future. The past seems to be one of the most obvious things, it is fixed, we have traces of it, we have memories, there are books to read and learn about the past. Time is a great conceptual idea and works very well in our daily lives but is has a different meaning in quantum mechanics and general relativity. The elementary equations that govern the physical world fail to show any distinction between the past and the future.Time is not a single thing, says Rovelli, but a multi-layered concept, a combination of properties that we can dismount, one by one. What it remains when you take away all these properties, is nothing at all. This is perhaps best exemplified by the physicists John Wheeler and Bryce DeWitt back in the 1970s, when they attempted to unify relativity and quantum mechanics resulted in time essentially disappearing completely from their equation (known as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation), suggesting that time does not exist at all. Rovelli looks in detail at the nature of entropy, arguing that “what makes the world go round are not sources of energy but sources of low entropy. Without low entropy, energy would dilute into uniform heat and the world would go to sleep in a state of thermal equilibrium – there would no longer be any distinction between past and future, and nothing would happen.” Boltzmann understood that entropy is not just a fundamental quantity but a measure of how things are disordered - when you mix thing (disorder) entropy goes up. The fact that entropy has been low in the past leads to an important fact that is ubiquitous and crucial for the difference between past and future: the past leaves traces of itself in the present. The only cause of the difference between past and future, argues Rovelli, is the low energy of the past. This is an astounding idea that is hard to comprehend and perhaps even harder to accept. But it is also revealing, and told in Rovelli’s clear and concise style, makes perfect sense. Rovelli has a deep technical knowledge of his subject; at the same time, he writes beautifully and although I got lost several times when he discussed the strange world of loop quantum gravity, it was exciting to penetrate some layers of the mystery of time. This is an exquisite and intellectually challenging book. It takes time to read, although, reflecting on the various physical variables of time, you might think otherwise.  link:  my review "
208,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,3,"This is really a 2.5. I was following along fine until mid-way through the second part, and I'm not sure whether it was the translation or the physics that lost me. Through the fuzz, I just kept thinking, ""There has to be an easier way to say this."" And it turns out, there was: the final chapter (The Sources of Time) summarized all his points in a clear and understandable way. So, if he can say it so clearly there, what was up with the rest of the book? He tells readers that the notes are for those who really understand the physics of it, but I'd hesitate to say the rest of the book is for us 'normal folks.' More like us 'normal folks who do LSD/mushrooms', which he hinted at a few times. The other thing that I felt was a problem in the book is a problem I have in general with reductionist metaphysical conversations-- once Rovelli had laid it all out, he did a poor job of explaining the possible significance of the knowledge. He commented a couple of times that our 'naive image of time was suitable [necessary] for our daily life', and that 'at an elementary level there are no cats either, but we do not for this reason cease to bother with cats.' Knowing how time works does not change how we experience it (and he doesn't seem to imply that it should), or how humans find meaning in it. Rovelli worked hard to reinforce the sheer number of possible outcomes and, in the process, essentially undermined the importance of understanding that it was all a series of probabilistic events-- i.e, why cats? and if they once existed, why do cats continue to exist? <-- the point here is that he missed the chance to make a larger tie-in to the meaning of it all (or lack thereof). If this order of time shows us that there is no order, that everything is random, reduced to the physical interactions between all the pieces of the universe, and that this knowledge shouldn't change anything about how we live our lives, to say nothing of the fact that we are so myopic we may never understand it, then knowing how it all works would be meaningless, right? Maybe not. But if not, Rovelli did a poor job explaining why. One final note: After I finished reading The Order of Time, I went looking for reviews to see what I had missed (due to the translation or the physics). This review did a pretty good job of summing up a lot of my feelings:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
209,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315851-roozbeh-daneshvar,3,"Before I started reading this book, I asked myself what is it about time that he is going to say? Time seemed obvious and didn't need any more elaboration (I admit that I knew nothing about time). This book opened my eyes and exposed me to aspects of time that I had never imagined.There were many places throughout reading that I was astonished by the new perspectives. For example, how there is a symmetry between past and future in classical mechanics (you just reverse the time direction and bam, everything works well, even though backwards). As another example, I was amazed that how the author connected time to memory (or how do you perceive time if you do not remember anything). He also connected music to memory. You would not enjoy music if you do not have memory: for every note, you have a recollection of the previous note/notes and also an anticipation of the upcoming notes. Without that memory, every moment of a music is just a single note, which would be meaningless.One part that resonated with me was about death and the fear of death. It was exactly the same case for me, as I have mixed feelings of fear of death and an openness for embracing it, both at the same time. This book put the same concept in the framework of time for me. It talked about how time has been troubling to human beings in the history.The text switched between solid physics concepts and some philosophical or even anecdotal themes. To me, it seemed not as a balanced combination, but an incoherent concoction. A large part might be because of my lack of understanding of the topic. Yet, I am skeptical that a poor translation might have contributed, too. In general, I did not find it a well-written text (although this is a personal opinion).If you want to know about time (with which you are probably in touch with, or you'd better be), do consider reading this book. It might open new doors for you."

Rovelli's attempt to explain away thermodynamic-entropic time and the whole of complex systems by telling us ""it's all a blur"" - that our experience of past and future and the direction of time, of evolution, growth, decay, and the whole of biology is basically nothing but subjective phenomenology or the ignorance of human perception is simply laughable. What universe is he living in?To ignore the work of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world who've established the sciences of chaos, complexity, nonlinear systems, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics and assert that their view of time is somehow not real, some illusion or whatever, is arrogant and irresponsible, not to mention narrow-minded. This is scientific fundamentalism and works against the goal of science to produce a coherent system of thought across many domains. The Order of Time appears to be a last ditch attempt to revive the old Platonic-Newtonian deterministic worldview in the face of the contemporary view of emergence, probability, instability, nonlinearity, complexity, chaos, and irreversibility - a kind of marketing ploy to convince the public that the old view of physics still reigns supreme over all else. In this book, Rovelli appears to represent an old guard of physicists, extreme reductionists, who are unable to embrace the scientific revolution that has engulfed their science, the revolution that is complex, nonequilibrium, and nonlinear systems theory.

215,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Like a lot of young nerds, I had a period of fascination with advanced physics. Never enough to actually become all that good at it, mind you. I just about wrapped my brain around the wave-particle duality, in order to get my degree in Electrical Engineering. I took one course on Relativity. I found it all to be fascinating, and also really, really hard. There were other people, for whom it was equally fascinating, but more like ""fun"" than ""hard"". I was not one of those people.The primary benefit to me of having taken those courses as a youngster, was not that it did me the slightest bit of good whatsoever in my professional life in the semiconductor industry. It turns out that, truth be told, you don't have to be all that good at physics to make semiconductors, or even to test circuits made of them, or even to improve processes for making them. Perhaps you have to be really good at physics to invent them in the first place, but that was not a task I ever had to accomplish.No, the primary benefit was that, when someone invoked quantum physics or relativity to bolster their hand-wavy philosophy, I could recognize that they didn't know what they were talking about. There is, it turns out, nothing in quantum physics or relativity that proves or disproves anybody's idea about God, the meaning of life, whether there is an objective reality, or where consciousness comes from. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying, or just projecting their hopes onto the deeply unintuitive world of the very small or very fast.Still, Rovelli is himself a professional, one of those people who does actually know a lot more about physics than I do, and his book had two other things going for it. One, it was short, and a nice compact size. Two, it had a goodly amount of pictures. When I read something like advanced physics, the reality is I'm not ready to go through 800 pages' worth, and I need some diagrams, or sketches, or graphs, or something besides a wall of text with the occasional equation.It turns out that Rovelli is also apparently quite good at explaining things. It may have helped some that I had learned some of the early parts of the book before, but it had been decades, and I found myself wishing that he had been the guy writing my college physics textbooks, or perhaps teaching the classes. But then, it may also be that reading about physics for fun, is a lot more enjoyable than taking a test on it, which is going to be curved to guarantee that around 25% of the class gets a failing grade.Rovelli's thesis seems to be, that time is not a fundamental part of reality in the way that, say, mass or electromagnetism is. Rather, it is more like perspective. He claims that this is actually the pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian way of thinking about time. Time is nothing other than the order in which we experience things. Rovelli's claim (which I am unable to really evaluate the truth of), is that the modern idea of time as a dimension is Newton's, and while it may have been a reasonable operating assumption for him at that, uh, time, it isn't the literal truth. Just as quantum physics and relativity have upended other parts of Newton's worldview, Rovelli says that they have returned us to a pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian idea of time.One is reminded of the saying, ""time is what keeps everything from happening at once"". Rovelli seems to be saying something more like, time is the order in which we perceive things as happening. If we are all, relative to one another, moving at very low speeds (compared to the speed of light in a vacuum), then we never notice that my time is different than yours. Once you think about the very fast, very big, or very small, our intuitions don't work.There was also some stuff about entropy in there.To be honest, if I really wanted to understand what Rovelli was saying here, in depth, well enough to pass a test on it, I would need to read it again. And you know, I just might do that. But not yet, because I am once again in the blessed position of being able to read about physics for exactly as much as I feel like, and neither more nor less. I believe that it is true for me, anyway, that a little more time should pass before I reread this one.It was pretty good, though, so perhaps not too much time."
216,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison,4,"Originally reviewed at The Book Wheel.Consider the following: time passes faster in the mountains than it does at sea level. If this sentence confounds you but piques your interest, then I can already tell you that you want to read The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli, which answers questions such as what is time? Is there a universal time? What does it mean to live in the present? Does the present exist? Turns out, these are simple questions with no easy answers because time is complicated. I don’t mean that timezones are confusing or that time passing faster in the mountains is perplexing, but that at an elemental level, time doesn’t even exist the way we think it does.Luckily, The Order of Time takes an approachable, scientific look at these questions and explores ideas rooted in quantum physics, thermodynamics, and the human condition. It will expand your mind, confuse the heck out of you, and, if you’re like me, leave you pondering some pretty heavy philosophical conundrums.One thing I learned that does make sense is that there is no now because now is just the perception of time. By the time we perceive something happening, nanoseconds have already passed. This means that everything we do, think, say, or hear exists both in the past and the present depending on if you’re saying it or hearing it. In other words, time is so fleeting we’re more or less living in the future as much as we are the present. For example, I can ask what you’re doing right now (reading this sentence) but by the time you process the words I have written, the act of reading it is in the past. WHAT?!Taking this one step further, this also means two people are never actually in the same place at the same time. I can speak to you, but by the time you perceive my actions, I am already living in the past. Throw in timezones and it’s easy to see why there’s no true, universal time. Time exists in relativity. Perhaps the author says it best when he said, “Physics does not describe how things evolve “in time” but how things evolve in their own times, and how “times” evolve relative to each other.”This relativity also applies to what it means to exist. One example The Order of Time gives is the emergence of teams. A group of children can line up and pick teams, one by one, for a soccer game. This new team doesn’t already exist, but it emerges and then does exist because different entities combine to make it so. So if you can create something out of nothing, what does that mean for the whole of existence? And is existence all relative? Some might say that a literary character doesn’t exist, as in they are not “real”, but yet they do exist, if even in our collective minds. Existence, Rovelli argues, is grammatical: “Words such as “here,” “now,” “I,” “this,” “tonight” all assume a different meaning depending on who utters them and the circumstances in which they are uttered.”Philosophical pondering aside, Rovelli explains all of this by rooting it in science. He tackles major scientific theories of time, from Aristotle’s belief that time measures change to Newton’s idea that time is independent of us. He discusses entropy and how it evolves over time, linking it to the laws of thermodynamics and quantum physics.Yet despite this heavy reading, there’s a romantic quality to The Order of Time. Because in the end, it’s all about how we, as humans, perceive time. It is our own “blurred vision” that shapes how we see the world. We are made up of our experiences, traces, and narratives, and each is unique to us. And although the following quote isn’t about time, per se, it does speak to the larger question of whether the absence of something exists: “But it isn’t absence that causes sorrow. It is affection and love. Without affection, without love, such absences would cause us no pain. For this reason, even the pain caused by absence is, in the end, something good and even beautiful, because it feeds on that which gives meaning to life.”"

For me, it has been emotional to go back to what I have learned when studying general relativity and quantum mechanics, so many years ago.

219,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"I have read a lot of popular physics books and many of them just go over the same ground, but this one was a bit new and different. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of relativity is comfortable with the idea that time passes at different rates depending on the relative velocities of two observers, but Rovelli takes us a step further -- it is not just the rate at which time passes that depends on point of view, it is time itself. Rovelli starts by showing how time and entropy are intimately related as the only physical concepts which have an irreversible forward arrow pointing to the future. He then explains how the level of entropy of a system is a function of point of view -- whether a given system is disordered depends on how order is defined (I remember telling my stepmother when I was a teenager that my room was neat because I could find everything I needed in the mess.) If time is a function of entropy and entropy depends on point of view, then perhaps time does too. Time, like entropy, becomes a function of blurring, of uncertainty about things that we do not or cannot measure. Hmmmm. At the very least it is an intriguing idea; maybe it is even true. Perhaps it only appears to us that the universe must have started with the Big Bang and may end with entropic heat death because of what time and entropy look like to us from our localized point of view. So there is no universal physical truth, or at least not one that depends on space and time, which turn out to be localized concepts. But perhaps there are universal concepts for how things relate to one another that are not built into a fixed unchanging view of space and time and that can therefore give us a broad picture of the universe. Rovelli teases us with the assertion that his field, loop quantum gravity, manages to take time out of the most basic equations of the universe, but he doesn't try to explain how, probably because it is too complex for a popular book.I enjoyed this book as an audiobook with a dazzlingly good narration by Benedict Cumberbatch. Sometimes science books are better enjoyed in print editions, but this one worked quite well in audio. The quality of the writing is excellent and clear. The explanations of scientific ideas are not simple but they are comprenhensible even for a person with a limited background in physics and no math. And the rich, expressive voice of Mr. Cumberbatch makes the experience complete."
220,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,3,"This introduction to the modern physicist's understanding of time is difficult to rate for a few reasons. First of all, I already knew about most of these concepts so there wasn't really anything revelatory here. Had I not brought this foreknowledge to this book, I think I may have found it more interesting. Also, acknowledging the linguistic difficulty of discussing time as frequently people mean very different things when using the word, Rovelli falls victim to this very problem throughout the book. Occasionally he gets the point across very well only to confuse the issue he just clarified in the next paragraph. Lastly, I don't think we need all of the literary and spiritual meanderings he gets into. I know that it is trendy for physicists to bring in literature and use overly flowery language to describe the most complicated of scientific discussions but the degree to which this is used here is quite extreme, and in a work of such brevity, seems like a replacement for genuine profundity as opposed to being additive. I admire Rovelli's interest in bringing these important concepts to a mass audience, even if there is some depth and rigor lost in the effort. However, if your notion of time is that which comes from grade school then perhaps this will be an effective précis for future study, if you want a more interesting discussion about how these notions relate to your functioning as a human then I would recommend, ""Your Brain is a Time Machine,"" by Dean Buonomano.

He argues that our perception of time’s flow depends entirely on our inability to see the world in all its detail. Quantum uncertainty means we cannot know the positions and speeds of all the particles in the Universe. If we could, there would be no entropy and no unraveling of time. Rovelli originated this ‘thermal time hypothesis’ with French mathematician Alain Connes.Maybe, this book alone is not enough to pass judgment as a lay reader but the book has an extraordinary poetic essence to transmute into the Rovelie's reality. :)"

228,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874093-janna,2,"Never thought I’d see the day where I complained that a book leaned too far into the poetic, but here we are. I liked Part One, which lays out the physics behind why time is not as it seems, but Part Two goes too much into philosophising without much of a sound basis and without adequately laying out the supporting physics. Where Reality Is Not What It Seems took readers through a series of logical steps, provided the appropriate rigour, and created a sound place from which to begin amping up the complexity, The Order of Time begins in science and then swerves the argument into flowery interpretations of thinkers from St Augustine to Kant to Buddha. His ultimate conclusion seems to be that our experience of time is something that depends on our human lens: something that philosophers have said for centuries (and he quotes those philosophers). In support of this in the physics side of things, he briefly explains the irreversibility of ever-increasing entropy and how the relations between particles are blurred such that we are unable to perceive them. ""Therefore, our vision of the world is blurred because the physical interactions between the part of the world to which we belong and the rest are blind to many variables. ... This does not mean that blurring is a mental construct; it depends on actual, existing physical interactions."" He then switches to philosophy and quotes Hans Reichenbach, writing that time causes anxiety; as a result, we have imagined the existence of eternity and heaven and higher realms. And from there he suggests: ""Perhaps, ultimately, the emotional dimension of time is not the film of mist that prevents us from apprehending the nature of time objectively. Perhaps the emotion of time is precisely what time is for us."" His foray into the emotions is rooted more in literature and music, which (knowing how poets think) can be hit or miss. My main issue, however, is this. There is a difference between (1) humans being constructed such that we are unable to perceive the reality of time and (2) the emotions that arise from our particular experience of time. Those emotions might well cause us to be attached to time or have an awareness of it that doesn't match reality. But that's not the same as saying that, as humans, the structure of our minds and the physical interactions of slice of the universe we occupy are such that we are unable to perceive temporal reality, which is what I took his argument to be. Emotions are far more like a mental construct than the blurring of thermodynamic interactions occurring in the physical world. And what he says about emotions seems to suggest that we refuse to see reality, not that we are unable to (one could imagine a person who wasn't caught up with anxiety about time and didn't experience those obscuring emotions). Maybe he wasn't trying to put forward a serious argument for the place of emotions or maybe I'm reading ungenerously. Perhaps he was simply swept up with the poetry of it all, but that leads to confusion and makes the entire text less credible.I’m not a physicist and I know this is a pop science book — emphasis on the pop — but by the end it was a pop philosophy book sprinkled over with poetry and references to the likes of the Mahabharata, Bach, and the book of Job. The final chapter consists of his musings on what really drives us as human beings — and I do think it's all connected and that the final chapter drives at the point that really matters, but he didn't earn that ending. He didn't lay out the path correctly and, consequently, his broader conclusions on life feel flimsy. While physics and philosophy certainly have implications for one another, and there is truth also in art and poetry, The Order of Time does not result in a successful mix."
229,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,4,"In The Order of Time, Carlo Rovelli sticks to the theme that reality is not what it seems, in this case focusing entirely on the concept of time. In a sense, the history of science can be described as an uncompromising assault on intuition and common sense. The Earth appears flat and stationary, but in reality spins and soars through space at 67,000 miles per hour. Humans appear to be a species of their own special creation, but in reality are simply naturally evolved primates.These ideas are familiar by now, but they were revolutionary at the time of their discovery. What Rovelli is pointing out is that science may not be done with us yet—the next assault on our common sense might be the revelation of a world without time. Rovelli points out that what we label as “common sense” is often the intellectual work of past thinkers—who may or may not have gotten things right. How we think about time—our common sense notions of it—have in fact been shaped by past thinkers, the two most prominent being Aristotle and Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton thought that time was universal and absolute, that the variable “t” applied to everyone everywhere and continued to tick on even if everything in the universe stood still. Aristotle, in contrast, thought of time simply as the measure of change, and that without change it made no sense to talk about time in any absolute or universal sense. Because Aristotle got so much wrong in so many fields, you might think you ought to favor Newton in this debate, but according to Rovelli you’d be wrong to do so. Aristotle’s picture of time is closer to reality, as confirmed by the work of Albert Einstein. Einstein demonstrated that time is relative, not absolute. We now know that time moves slower at lower altitudes and at higher speeds. Someone living in the plains will age less than someone living in the mountains and someone traveling at high speeds will age less than someone stationary. This counterintuitive notion does not sit well with common sense, but that’s the point: reality is not, and has never been, what it seems. What all of this adds up to is that there is no such thing as universal time; there is only time for you, from your perspective, in relation to other objects. Reality is a world of events and changing quantities, not of shapes and universal space and time. And this is precisely what quantum physics demonstrates, where the equations that work have no time variable at all. So the flow of time is simply a psychological construct, an illusion, and one we may need to discard if we are to penetrate further into the depths of reality. But, if time is not embedded in the fabric of reality, it does beg the question: where does our concept of time come from? In a word: entropy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that entropy can never decrease, and increasing entropy is the way our minds mark the passing of time. Since entropy cannot be reversed, time flows in one direction from past to future. And so, entropy is part of the basic fabric of reality and time is simply our way of measuring it. That is, unless we’re talking quantum mechanics, which needs no time variable at all.----------------------------------------What should we make of this claim? Unless you are working in the field of quantum physics, it would be difficult to refute what Rovelli is saying. If the quantum equations do not require time, then either time is an illusion or else we don’t really understand the quantum world. You’ll have to read the book to get a handle on the more technical aspects that I won’t hesitate to admit flew right over my head. One point of contention I can offer, however, is regarding Rovelli’s claim that the concept of a “universal present” is nonsensical. Here’s how he describes it:Hypothetically, if you had a friend on another planet four light-years away, would both of you be experiencing the same present moment? According to Rovelli, there is no such present moment that applies to both of you.If you were to look at your friend through a telescope, you would be seeing him four years ago, because that’s how long the light would take to travel back to you. So your “now” and his “now” cannot be said to be occuring at the same present moment.But wait, is this right? I’m not so sure. Yes, it’s true that, looking through the telescope, you would be seeing your friend four years earlier, due to the limitation of the speed of light. But, if you were to continue to look through the telescope for four more years, you would see your friend’s “now” moment precisely four years later, and that would only be true if there was an initial present moment that was the same for both of you. So in a sense there is a universal present, it’s just not accessible to us perceptually due to the constraints of the speed of light. Maybe this is a small point, but I think it shows that a universal present has to exist, even if, due to the nature of the universe, time can only be perceived locally. In any case, it’s interesting to contemplate that time is simply the psychological measure of change, and that the underlying changes can speed up or slow down depending on your position and speed relative to other objects. This is the world of relativity and reality, which banishes Newton’s universal clock and redeems Aristotle’s notion of change. A final point to consider is that, if time is only a psychological construct, and is not in any objective sense part of the universe, then this could be the final nail in religion’s casket: without time, without a beginning, there is no need for “creation.” -------------------------------------------This is all, of course, a major oversimplification of the book. Rovelli provides an infinitely more detailed account and his excursions into the quantum realm are fascinating for those who have the interest and patience. He is a skilled and clear writer, and his Feynman-esque ability to explain complex topics in simple terms with ample metaphor and analogy is something you’ll appreciate when the topic turns to quantum loop gravity. Overall, it’s a fascinating book that will help you think more clearly about the concept of time, including what a world without time looks like. "
230,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2599582-aviva,3,"Carlo Rovelli does an amazing job of putting scientific concepts that are incredibly difficult to grasp into beautiful words. That said, I found this one harder going than his earlier Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. Maybe because it went deeper into one topic and thus delved into more difficult territory, or maybe just because the truth about time is so counterintuitive. Either way, it made my brain hurt in a good way (most of the time). But I would still recommend his earlier book first to those who want to get their toes wet in some of modern physics' more incomprehensible topics."
231,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4023528-vheissu,3,"I recommend this book to readers of popular science and philosophy. Physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers will be familiar with the themes already and probably have nothing much to learn here.Rovelli makes clear if not explicit that our difficulty in understanding ""time"" isn't limited to our intellectual shortcomings or even the precision of our measuring instruments, but also a limitation in our language. We simply don't have the vocabulary to understand or express the nature of ""time"" in any other than what the author calls ""naïve"" terms (p. 199), which is to say, our everyday, common-sense meaning of the word (past, present, and future, cause and effect). Even the common sense meaning of ""time"" is deeply flawed (see below), much less relevant to quantum and relativistic ""time."" We need to find terms other than ""time"" to express and understand events that occur beyond our perceptible senses.Rovelli offers a few alternative names for quantum and relativistic events, but the best he can do is apply adjective modifiers to the base noun (""thermal time,"" p. 134, or ""quantum time,"" p. 137). What he--we--needs to do is drop the adjective-noun combination altogether and come up with new terms to describe the relationship of events at micro- and macroscopic levels. As long as we include the noun, ""time,"" in trying to explain these things, confusion can only result, since our common-sense understanding of ""time"" is flawed and inhibits understanding of superficially similar but actually qualitatively different phenomena.Naïve Time. The flaws in our everyday, common sense understanding of ""time"" are well-known and documented. There is no single ""now."" ""Time"" does not pass at the same rate for all or even any two observers. ""Time"" is different for observers at different distances from a mass. A person's head experiences a different ""time"" than does her feet! The difference is imperceptible to human senses but it is not unmeasurable; we now have sufficiently precise instruments to measure those differences.This is not to say that our naïve understanding of ""time"" is so flawed as to be unuseful. The establishment of standard time zones in the late 19th century was arguably one of the most consequential public policy decisions in the last 150 years. Communication and transportation technologies require such standardization and would be difficult without it. It was Einstein's efforts to find a way to standardize timepieces for railroads, after all, that led to his Special Theory of Relativity. So, as far as naïve ""time"" is concerned, the term has practical applications and need not be abandoned. We just need to stop using that word for quantum and relativistic investigation.Thermal Time. At relativistic levels, which is to say macroscopic, Rovelli defines ""time"" in terms of entropy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics establishes the ""arrow"" of time--past, present, future. Heat dissipates. The amount of heat in the universe is the same today as it was at the Big Bang, but it has diffused and continues to do so. Our measurement of ""time,"" therefore, is a measurement of entropy: low entropy is the past, high entropy is the future.In a few trillion years from now, the Universe may reach a state of maximum entropy, a cold, motionless condition in which ""time,"" as such, becomes a meaningless idea. ""Time"" will ""stop,"" or become irrelevant to the state of affairs. That is death.Quantum Time. At the microscopic level, which is to say subatomic, our naïve understanding of ""time"" is of no help at all. Subatomic events occur at such small scales and incredibly quick intervals that it becomes pointless to think in terms of order and duration. The smallest increment of time is called Planck Time, which is something like 10-43 seconds (the value 10 with 43 zeroes behind it, or a hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, p. 83); the corresponding Planck length is 10 -33. We have no means by which to observe such imperceptible events. Yet. The numbers are the result of mathematic equations, not the result of empirical measurement. So it is pointless to apply a clumsy term like ""time"" to quantum mechanics.Rovelli reminds us that it was Aristotle who first explored the philosophy and physics of ""time."" For Aristotle, ""time"" was a measurement of change; if nothing ever changed, there would be no ""time."" Newton offered a contradictory opinion. For the great physicist, ""time"" passed even in the absence of change. Both were a little right and a little wrong. Today, we understand that a state of changelessness has never existed in our Universe. We live in a soup of quantum particles that never stop changing. There is no such thing as an absolute vacuum. Quantum particles pop into and out of existence even in the ""vacuum"" of empty space. You can create an airless volume in a bottle, but you can't stop electromagnetic waves from passing through it. The closest the Universe will ever get to changelessness is when it reaches maximum entropy. And that is a long way off."
232,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,5,"Carlo Rovelli has the brilliance of Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein and the communicative skills of Carl Sagan. Otherwise he is an Italian theoretical physicist that specializes in quantum gravity and is a proponent, if not quite an advocate, of loop theory. Beyond that he is a philosopher with a heart for ancient poetry and love.And he brings all of it to bear in this delightful book about time, which, in the end, is life, and everything, including the context in which it unfolds. It would be in error to suggest that time doesn’t exist, but it would be equally in error to suggest that time is as simple as the continuum we record with our clocks.What I like most about the book is the fact that Rovelli recognizes that philosophy and science, if not two sides of the same coin, are cousins. He refers to Proust, which few scientists do, and suggests that while reason is among the best tools available for interpreting our “collective delirium,” it is “only an instrument, a pincer.”The science and the prose are very accessible. You will, however, have to be willing to think abstractly, a skill that in our wired, binary world seems to be greatly dissipating. And he is the first scientist I have read in a while who takes time to explain why the problem is sometimes not the science itself, but the limitations of language. Language is a human construction and has not kept up with our scientific revelation. Which is why theoretical physicists sometimes seem to be speaking another language. If only there was another language that was constructed in the world as we know it today, our communication would be so much easier and our knowledge would expand more rapidly. It would be impossible to summarize the knowledge contained in this book. You really have to read it. Here is a start, however: “The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.” If you can comprehend that the rest is largely additional perspective.And if the idea that universal time doesn’t exist in any absolute since seems a stretch, consider Rovelli’s simple explanation (I’m paraphrasing): People never used to worry about clocks. They worried about the cycle of sunshine and darkness. But that cycle is different in every single village, town, and city on the planet. The cycle varies both east to west and north to south. And back when we used to spend our lives in our little village we didn’t care. But then the scientists and engineers invented trains to take us from one village to the next. And people needed to know when the train left their village. But how can you develop a timetable when every village has its own time? You can’t. But, at the same time, it’s not quite practical to say that the whole world has just one time. Farmers don’t care what the sun is doing in London. They care what it’s doing on their farm. (China actually has no time zones by edict. The entire country is on Beijing time and there are significant practical implications.) The solution was the time zone, and it’s a compromise. Time zones are a construct and practical in the local sense, but highly inaccurate when talking about the universe. In the language of theoretical physics, they don’t exist.Eastern philosophers believe that reality is not knowable. It is real, but is made up of an infinite number of variables. We can only comprehend or think about a handful at a time. A tree is real. I can touch it and smell it. But it is not entirely knowable because there are too many variables (e.g. altitude, climate, soil, etc.) that define each tree for me to know them all. Time is the same way. Time is real but it is not knowable. Throw in the limitations of language and it begins to look like an illusion.To his great credit, Rovelli admits that there is much we don’t know. Think of a Seurat painting that has been blacked out. We have exposed a few, perhaps 10% (my number), of the original dots of pigment. It’s a lot, but we’re still guessing as to what the underlying picture is.And that’s pretty exciting. The key to our understanding to date, however, is the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy can never decrease. It’s critical to our understanding of time, as Rovelli explains. Personally I’m not convinced it’s inviolate. Perhaps we just haven’t uncovered enough dots of pigment yet. If entropy could work both ways it would explain a lot, but attraction does not equal fact. (Entropy obviously has a big part in causality, of course. Bidirectional entropy would be a huge boost for inductive reason.)It’s a short book and even if you get through a small amount of it you will learn a lot. Beyond writing in an accessible way, Rovelli comes off as very personable. The perfect person to sit down and share a cup of coffee with. If only he had the time. (Sorry)A marvelous book that I highly recommend."
233,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7999890-ken-gronnbeck,2,The book starts good but I get confused at the end. This book is not even close to the two other books I've read by him.

It's a marvel to me that such a relatively short book could completely overturn my conceptions of reality, Newtonian physics, and my sense of self. What I love most about The Order of Time is how it bridges the gap of hard maths into the realm of the human experience. So many of the ""wicked problems"" we talk about today in politics or sociology are down simply to the fact that the solution is imperminent. I realize that this book is an introduction to this field, and a very flowery one at that. I'm sure that people who are steeped in the field have thier issues with some of the poetic liberties Rovelli took in explaining some of the the concepts. The book also has one or two contradictions, and places where the author departs from his stated goal of relaying established theory in digestible terms to trying to convince the audience of his particular ""loop theory"" of time. I know from reading the reviews that many have the same problem with this book that I do with the likes of Sapiens by Yuval Harari. But this book is a fantastic and accessible gateway for those who want to be won over by the wonders of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics while always being afraid of ""the mathy bits."" On a personal note, this book has potentially one of my favorite quotes from any book I've read this year: ""The world... Is a boundless and disorderly network of quantum events... It is much more Naples than Singapore."" As one of the few who has been to Naples Italy and loved it, I now have a justification as to why! Thank you, Dr. Rovelli, for this and so much more.I will definitely be reading this book again, as I don't believe I was able to gleen all it has to offer."
237,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,4,"4.5 stars What is time? What does it really mean to say that time ‘passes’? Do we exist in time, or does time exist in us? What is the meaning of now?These are the questions that Carlo Rovelli tries to answer in The Order of Time. He takes us on a journey on how our understanding of the concept of time has changed from antiquity to the present and into the field of quantum gravity, his area of expertise. It is a magma of beautiful and exciting ideas, from physics to philosophy, “sometimes illuminating, sometimes confusing.”We perceive time as one dimensional thing, it has a direction, the past is completely different from the future. The past seems to be one of the most obvious things, it is fixed, we have traces of it, we have memories, there are books to read and learn about the past. Time is a great conceptual idea and works very well in our daily lives but is has a different meaning in quantum mechanics and general relativity. The elementary equations that govern the physical world fail to show any distinction between the past and the future.Time is not a single thing, says Rovelli, but a multi-layered concept, a combination of properties that we can dismount, one by one. What it remains when you take away all these properties, is nothing at all. This is perhaps best exemplified by the physicists John Wheeler and Bryce DeWitt back in the 1970s, when they attempted to unify relativity and quantum mechanics resulted in time essentially disappearing completely from their equation (known as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation), suggesting that time does not exist at all. Rovelli looks in detail at the nature of entropy, arguing that “what makes the world go round are not sources of energy but sources of low entropy. Without low entropy, energy would dilute into uniform heat and the world would go to sleep in a state of thermal equilibrium – there would no longer be any distinction between past and future, and nothing would happen.” Boltzmann understood that entropy is not just a fundamental quantity but a measure of how things are disordered - when you mix thing (disorder) entropy goes up. The fact that entropy has been low in the past leads to an important fact that is ubiquitous and crucial for the difference between past and future: the past leaves traces of itself in the present. The only cause of the difference between past and future, argues Rovelli, is the low energy of the past. This is an astounding idea that is hard to comprehend and perhaps even harder to accept. But it is also revealing, and told in Rovelli’s clear and concise style, makes perfect sense. Rovelli has a deep technical knowledge of his subject; at the same time, he writes beautifully and although I got lost several times when he discussed the strange world of loop quantum gravity, it was exciting to penetrate some layers of the mystery of time. This is an exquisite and intellectually challenging book. It takes time to read, although, reflecting on the various physical variables of time, you might think otherwise.  link:  my review "
238,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,3,"This is really a 2.5. I was following along fine until mid-way through the second part, and I'm not sure whether it was the translation or the physics that lost me. Through the fuzz, I just kept thinking, ""There has to be an easier way to say this."" And it turns out, there was: the final chapter (The Sources of Time) summarized all his points in a clear and understandable way. So, if he can say it so clearly there, what was up with the rest of the book? He tells readers that the notes are for those who really understand the physics of it, but I'd hesitate to say the rest of the book is for us 'normal folks.' More like us 'normal folks who do LSD/mushrooms', which he hinted at a few times. The other thing that I felt was a problem in the book is a problem I have in general with reductionist metaphysical conversations-- once Rovelli had laid it all out, he did a poor job of explaining the possible significance of the knowledge. He commented a couple of times that our 'naive image of time was suitable [necessary] for our daily life', and that 'at an elementary level there are no cats either, but we do not for this reason cease to bother with cats.' Knowing how time works does not change how we experience it (and he doesn't seem to imply that it should), or how humans find meaning in it. Rovelli worked hard to reinforce the sheer number of possible outcomes and, in the process, essentially undermined the importance of understanding that it was all a series of probabilistic events-- i.e, why cats? and if they once existed, why do cats continue to exist? <-- the point here is that he missed the chance to make a larger tie-in to the meaning of it all (or lack thereof). If this order of time shows us that there is no order, that everything is random, reduced to the physical interactions between all the pieces of the universe, and that this knowledge shouldn't change anything about how we live our lives, to say nothing of the fact that we are so myopic we may never understand it, then knowing how it all works would be meaningless, right? Maybe not. But if not, Rovelli did a poor job explaining why. One final note: After I finished reading The Order of Time, I went looking for reviews to see what I had missed (due to the translation or the physics). This review did a pretty good job of summing up a lot of my feelings:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
239,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315851-roozbeh-daneshvar,3,"Before I started reading this book, I asked myself what is it about time that he is going to say? Time seemed obvious and didn't need any more elaboration (I admit that I knew nothing about time). This book opened my eyes and exposed me to aspects of time that I had never imagined.There were many places throughout reading that I was astonished by the new perspectives. For example, how there is a symmetry between past and future in classical mechanics (you just reverse the time direction and bam, everything works well, even though backwards). As another example, I was amazed that how the author connected time to memory (or how do you perceive time if you do not remember anything). He also connected music to memory. You would not enjoy music if you do not have memory: for every note, you have a recollection of the previous note/notes and also an anticipation of the upcoming notes. Without that memory, every moment of a music is just a single note, which would be meaningless.One part that resonated with me was about death and the fear of death. It was exactly the same case for me, as I have mixed feelings of fear of death and an openness for embracing it, both at the same time. This book put the same concept in the framework of time for me. It talked about how time has been troubling to human beings in the history.The text switched between solid physics concepts and some philosophical or even anecdotal themes. To me, it seemed not as a balanced combination, but an incoherent concoction. A large part might be because of my lack of understanding of the topic. Yet, I am skeptical that a poor translation might have contributed, too. In general, I did not find it a well-written text (although this is a personal opinion).If you want to know about time (with which you are probably in touch with, or you'd better be), do consider reading this book. It might open new doors for you."

Rovelli's attempt to explain away thermodynamic-entropic time and the whole of complex systems by telling us ""it's all a blur"" - that our experience of past and future and the direction of time, of evolution, growth, decay, and the whole of biology is basically nothing but subjective phenomenology or the ignorance of human perception is simply laughable. What universe is he living in?To ignore the work of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world who've established the sciences of chaos, complexity, nonlinear systems, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics and assert that their view of time is somehow not real, some illusion or whatever, is arrogant and irresponsible, not to mention narrow-minded. This is scientific fundamentalism and works against the goal of science to produce a coherent system of thought across many domains. The Order of Time appears to be a last ditch attempt to revive the old Platonic-Newtonian deterministic worldview in the face of the contemporary view of emergence, probability, instability, nonlinearity, complexity, chaos, and irreversibility - a kind of marketing ploy to convince the public that the old view of physics still reigns supreme over all else. In this book, Rovelli appears to represent an old guard of physicists, extreme reductionists, who are unable to embrace the scientific revolution that has engulfed their science, the revolution that is complex, nonequilibrium, and nonlinear systems theory.

245,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Like a lot of young nerds, I had a period of fascination with advanced physics. Never enough to actually become all that good at it, mind you. I just about wrapped my brain around the wave-particle duality, in order to get my degree in Electrical Engineering. I took one course on Relativity. I found it all to be fascinating, and also really, really hard. There were other people, for whom it was equally fascinating, but more like ""fun"" than ""hard"". I was not one of those people.The primary benefit to me of having taken those courses as a youngster, was not that it did me the slightest bit of good whatsoever in my professional life in the semiconductor industry. It turns out that, truth be told, you don't have to be all that good at physics to make semiconductors, or even to test circuits made of them, or even to improve processes for making them. Perhaps you have to be really good at physics to invent them in the first place, but that was not a task I ever had to accomplish.No, the primary benefit was that, when someone invoked quantum physics or relativity to bolster their hand-wavy philosophy, I could recognize that they didn't know what they were talking about. There is, it turns out, nothing in quantum physics or relativity that proves or disproves anybody's idea about God, the meaning of life, whether there is an objective reality, or where consciousness comes from. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying, or just projecting their hopes onto the deeply unintuitive world of the very small or very fast.Still, Rovelli is himself a professional, one of those people who does actually know a lot more about physics than I do, and his book had two other things going for it. One, it was short, and a nice compact size. Two, it had a goodly amount of pictures. When I read something like advanced physics, the reality is I'm not ready to go through 800 pages' worth, and I need some diagrams, or sketches, or graphs, or something besides a wall of text with the occasional equation.It turns out that Rovelli is also apparently quite good at explaining things. It may have helped some that I had learned some of the early parts of the book before, but it had been decades, and I found myself wishing that he had been the guy writing my college physics textbooks, or perhaps teaching the classes. But then, it may also be that reading about physics for fun, is a lot more enjoyable than taking a test on it, which is going to be curved to guarantee that around 25% of the class gets a failing grade.Rovelli's thesis seems to be, that time is not a fundamental part of reality in the way that, say, mass or electromagnetism is. Rather, it is more like perspective. He claims that this is actually the pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian way of thinking about time. Time is nothing other than the order in which we experience things. Rovelli's claim (which I am unable to really evaluate the truth of), is that the modern idea of time as a dimension is Newton's, and while it may have been a reasonable operating assumption for him at that, uh, time, it isn't the literal truth. Just as quantum physics and relativity have upended other parts of Newton's worldview, Rovelli says that they have returned us to a pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian idea of time.One is reminded of the saying, ""time is what keeps everything from happening at once"". Rovelli seems to be saying something more like, time is the order in which we perceive things as happening. If we are all, relative to one another, moving at very low speeds (compared to the speed of light in a vacuum), then we never notice that my time is different than yours. Once you think about the very fast, very big, or very small, our intuitions don't work.There was also some stuff about entropy in there.To be honest, if I really wanted to understand what Rovelli was saying here, in depth, well enough to pass a test on it, I would need to read it again. And you know, I just might do that. But not yet, because I am once again in the blessed position of being able to read about physics for exactly as much as I feel like, and neither more nor less. I believe that it is true for me, anyway, that a little more time should pass before I reread this one.It was pretty good, though, so perhaps not too much time."
246,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison,4,"Originally reviewed at The Book Wheel.Consider the following: time passes faster in the mountains than it does at sea level. If this sentence confounds you but piques your interest, then I can already tell you that you want to read The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli, which answers questions such as what is time? Is there a universal time? What does it mean to live in the present? Does the present exist? Turns out, these are simple questions with no easy answers because time is complicated. I don’t mean that timezones are confusing or that time passing faster in the mountains is perplexing, but that at an elemental level, time doesn’t even exist the way we think it does.Luckily, The Order of Time takes an approachable, scientific look at these questions and explores ideas rooted in quantum physics, thermodynamics, and the human condition. It will expand your mind, confuse the heck out of you, and, if you’re like me, leave you pondering some pretty heavy philosophical conundrums.One thing I learned that does make sense is that there is no now because now is just the perception of time. By the time we perceive something happening, nanoseconds have already passed. This means that everything we do, think, say, or hear exists both in the past and the present depending on if you’re saying it or hearing it. In other words, time is so fleeting we’re more or less living in the future as much as we are the present. For example, I can ask what you’re doing right now (reading this sentence) but by the time you process the words I have written, the act of reading it is in the past. WHAT?!Taking this one step further, this also means two people are never actually in the same place at the same time. I can speak to you, but by the time you perceive my actions, I am already living in the past. Throw in timezones and it’s easy to see why there’s no true, universal time. Time exists in relativity. Perhaps the author says it best when he said, “Physics does not describe how things evolve “in time” but how things evolve in their own times, and how “times” evolve relative to each other.”This relativity also applies to what it means to exist. One example The Order of Time gives is the emergence of teams. A group of children can line up and pick teams, one by one, for a soccer game. This new team doesn’t already exist, but it emerges and then does exist because different entities combine to make it so. So if you can create something out of nothing, what does that mean for the whole of existence? And is existence all relative? Some might say that a literary character doesn’t exist, as in they are not “real”, but yet they do exist, if even in our collective minds. Existence, Rovelli argues, is grammatical: “Words such as “here,” “now,” “I,” “this,” “tonight” all assume a different meaning depending on who utters them and the circumstances in which they are uttered.”Philosophical pondering aside, Rovelli explains all of this by rooting it in science. He tackles major scientific theories of time, from Aristotle’s belief that time measures change to Newton’s idea that time is independent of us. He discusses entropy and how it evolves over time, linking it to the laws of thermodynamics and quantum physics.Yet despite this heavy reading, there’s a romantic quality to The Order of Time. Because in the end, it’s all about how we, as humans, perceive time. It is our own “blurred vision” that shapes how we see the world. We are made up of our experiences, traces, and narratives, and each is unique to us. And although the following quote isn’t about time, per se, it does speak to the larger question of whether the absence of something exists: “But it isn’t absence that causes sorrow. It is affection and love. Without affection, without love, such absences would cause us no pain. For this reason, even the pain caused by absence is, in the end, something good and even beautiful, because it feeds on that which gives meaning to life.”"

For me, it has been emotional to go back to what I have learned when studying general relativity and quantum mechanics, so many years ago. And so exciting to learn the new steps that have been made during the past 50 years. I now have an idea of what originates the arrow of time, and this itself is fantastic! Go read it! And stick to it until the end!"

249,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"I have read a lot of popular physics books and many of them just go over the same ground, but this one was a bit new and different. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of relativity is comfortable with the idea that time passes at different rates depending on the relative velocities of two observers, but Rovelli takes us a step further -- it is not just the rate at which time passes that depends on point of view, it is time itself. Rovelli starts by showing how time and entropy are intimately related as the only physical concepts which have an irreversible forward arrow pointing to the future. He then explains how the level of entropy of a system is a function of point of view -- whether a given system is disordered depends on how order is defined (I remember telling my stepmother when I was a teenager that my room was neat because I could find everything I needed in the mess.) If time is a function of entropy and entropy depends on point of view, then perhaps time does too. Time, like entropy, becomes a function of blurring, of uncertainty about things that we do not or cannot measure. Hmmmm. At the very least it is an intriguing idea; maybe it is even true. Perhaps it only appears to us that the universe must have started with the Big Bang and may end with entropic heat death because of what time and entropy look like to us from our localized point of view. So there is no universal physical truth, or at least not one that depends on space and time, which turn out to be localized concepts. But perhaps there are universal concepts for how things relate to one another that are not built into a fixed unchanging view of space and time and that can therefore give us a broad picture of the universe. Rovelli teases us with the assertion that his field, loop quantum gravity, manages to take time out of the most basic equations of the universe, but he doesn't try to explain how, probably because it is too complex for a popular book.I enjoyed this book as an audiobook with a dazzlingly good narration by Benedict Cumberbatch. Sometimes science books are better enjoyed in print editions, but this one worked quite well in audio. The quality of the writing is excellent and clear. The explanations of scientific ideas are not simple but they are comprenhensible even for a person with a limited background in physics and no math. And the rich, expressive voice of Mr. Cumberbatch makes the experience complete."
250,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,3,"This introduction to the modern physicist's understanding of time is difficult to rate for a few reasons. First of all, I already knew about most of these concepts so there wasn't really anything revelatory here. Had I not brought this foreknowledge to this book, I think I may have found it more interesting. Also, acknowledging the linguistic difficulty of discussing time as frequently people mean very different things when using the word, Rovelli falls victim to this very problem throughout the book. Occasionally he gets the point across very well only to confuse the issue he just clarified in the next paragraph. Lastly, I don't think we need all of the literary and spiritual meanderings he gets into. I know that it is trendy for physicists to bring in literature and use overly flowery language to describe the most complicated of scientific discussions but the degree to which this is used here is quite extreme, and in a work of such brevity, seems like a replacement for genuine profundity as opposed to being additive. I admire Rovelli's interest in bringing these important concepts to a mass audience, even if there is some depth and rigor lost in the effort. However, if your notion of time is that which comes from grade school then perhaps this will be an effective précis for future study, if you want a more interesting discussion about how these notions relate to your functioning as a human then I would recommend, ""Your Brain is a Time Machine,"" by Dean Buonomano.

He argues that our perception of time’s flow depends entirely on our inability to see the world in all its detail. Quantum uncertainty means we cannot know the positions and speeds of all the particles in the Universe. If we could, there would be no entropy and no unraveling of time. Rovelli originated this ‘thermal time hypothesis’ with French mathematician Alain Connes.Maybe, this book alone is not enough to pass judgment as a lay reader but the book has an extraordinary poetic essence to transmute into the Rovelie's reality. :)"

258,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874093-janna,2,"Never thought I’d see the day where I complained that a book leaned too far into the poetic, but here we are. I liked Part One, which lays out the physics behind why time is not as it seems, but Part Two goes too much into philosophising without much of a sound basis and without adequately laying out the supporting physics. Where Reality Is Not What It Seems took readers through a series of logical steps, provided the appropriate rigour, and created a sound place from which to begin amping up the complexity, The Order of Time begins in science and then swerves the argument into flowery interpretations of thinkers from St Augustine to Kant to Buddha. His ultimate conclusion seems to be that our experience of time is something that depends on our human lens: something that philosophers have said for centuries (and he quotes those philosophers). In support of this in the physics side of things, he briefly explains the irreversibility of ever-increasing entropy and how the relations between particles are blurred such that we are unable to perceive them. ""Therefore, our vision of the world is blurred because the physical interactions between the part of the world to which we belong and the rest are blind to many variables. ... This does not mean that blurring is a mental construct; it depends on actual, existing physical interactions."" He then switches to philosophy and quotes Hans Reichenbach, writing that time causes anxiety; as a result, we have imagined the existence of eternity and heaven and higher realms. And from there he suggests: ""Perhaps, ultimately, the emotional dimension of time is not the film of mist that prevents us from apprehending the nature of time objectively. Perhaps the emotion of time is precisely what time is for us."" His foray into the emotions is rooted more in literature and music, which (knowing how poets think) can be hit or miss. My main issue, however, is this. There is a difference between (1) humans being constructed such that we are unable to perceive the reality of time and (2) the emotions that arise from our particular experience of time. Those emotions might well cause us to be attached to time or have an awareness of it that doesn't match reality. But that's not the same as saying that, as humans, the structure of our minds and the physical interactions of slice of the universe we occupy are such that we are unable to perceive temporal reality, which is what I took his argument to be. Emotions are far more like a mental construct than the blurring of thermodynamic interactions occurring in the physical world. And what he says about emotions seems to suggest that we refuse to see reality, not that we are unable to (one could imagine a person who wasn't caught up with anxiety about time and didn't experience those obscuring emotions). Maybe he wasn't trying to put forward a serious argument for the place of emotions or maybe I'm reading ungenerously. Perhaps he was simply swept up with the poetry of it all, but that leads to confusion and makes the entire text less credible.I’m not a physicist and I know this is a pop science book — emphasis on the pop — but by the end it was a pop philosophy book sprinkled over with poetry and references to the likes of the Mahabharata, Bach, and the book of Job. The final chapter consists of his musings on what really drives us as human beings — and I do think it's all connected and that the final chapter drives at the point that really matters, but he didn't earn that ending. He didn't lay out the path correctly and, consequently, his broader conclusions on life feel flimsy. While physics and philosophy certainly have implications for one another, and there is truth also in art and poetry, The Order of Time does not result in a successful mix."
259,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,4,"In The Order of Time, Carlo Rovelli sticks to the theme that reality is not what it seems, in this case focusing entirely on the concept of time. In a sense, the history of science can be described as an uncompromising assault on intuition and common sense. The Earth appears flat and stationary, but in reality spins and soars through space at 67,000 miles per hour. Humans appear to be a species of their own special creation, but in reality are simply naturally evolved primates.These ideas are familiar by now, but they were revolutionary at the time of their discovery. What Rovelli is pointing out is that science may not be done with us yet—the next assault on our common sense might be the revelation of a world without time. Rovelli points out that what we label as “common sense” is often the intellectual work of past thinkers—who may or may not have gotten things right. How we think about time—our common sense notions of it—have in fact been shaped by past thinkers, the two most prominent being Aristotle and Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton thought that time was universal and absolute, that the variable “t” applied to everyone everywhere and continued to tick on even if everything in the universe stood still. Aristotle, in contrast, thought of time simply as the measure of change, and that without change it made no sense to talk about time in any absolute or universal sense. Because Aristotle got so much wrong in so many fields, you might think you ought to favor Newton in this debate, but according to Rovelli you’d be wrong to do so. Aristotle’s picture of time is closer to reality, as confirmed by the work of Albert Einstein. Einstein demonstrated that time is relative, not absolute. We now know that time moves slower at lower altitudes and at higher speeds. Someone living in the plains will age less than someone living in the mountains and someone traveling at high speeds will age less than someone stationary. This counterintuitive notion does not sit well with common sense, but that’s the point: reality is not, and has never been, what it seems. What all of this adds up to is that there is no such thing as universal time; there is only time for you, from your perspective, in relation to other objects. Reality is a world of events and changing quantities, not of shapes and universal space and time. And this is precisely what quantum physics demonstrates, where the equations that work have no time variable at all. So the flow of time is simply a psychological construct, an illusion, and one we may need to discard if we are to penetrate further into the depths of reality. But, if time is not embedded in the fabric of reality, it does beg the question: where does our concept of time come from? In a word: entropy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that entropy can never decrease, and increasing entropy is the way our minds mark the passing of time. Since entropy cannot be reversed, time flows in one direction from past to future. And so, entropy is part of the basic fabric of reality and time is simply our way of measuring it. That is, unless we’re talking quantum mechanics, which needs no time variable at all.----------------------------------------What should we make of this claim? Unless you are working in the field of quantum physics, it would be difficult to refute what Rovelli is saying. If the quantum equations do not require time, then either time is an illusion or else we don’t really understand the quantum world. You’ll have to read the book to get a handle on the more technical aspects that I won’t hesitate to admit flew right over my head. One point of contention I can offer, however, is regarding Rovelli’s claim that the concept of a “universal present” is nonsensical. Here’s how he describes it:Hypothetically, if you had a friend on another planet four light-years away, would both of you be experiencing the same present moment? According to Rovelli, there is no such present moment that applies to both of you.If you were to look at your friend through a telescope, you would be seeing him four years ago, because that’s how long the light would take to travel back to you. So your “now” and his “now” cannot be said to be occuring at the same present moment.But wait, is this right? I’m not so sure. Yes, it’s true that, looking through the telescope, you would be seeing your friend four years earlier, due to the limitation of the speed of light. But, if you were to continue to look through the telescope for four more years, you would see your friend’s “now” moment precisely four years later, and that would only be true if there was an initial present moment that was the same for both of you. So in a sense there is a universal present, it’s just not accessible to us perceptually due to the constraints of the speed of light. Maybe this is a small point, but I think it shows that a universal present has to exist, even if, due to the nature of the universe, time can only be perceived locally. In any case, it’s interesting to contemplate that time is simply the psychological measure of change, and that the underlying changes can speed up or slow down depending on your position and speed relative to other objects. This is the world of relativity and reality, which banishes Newton’s universal clock and redeems Aristotle’s notion of change. A final point to consider is that, if time is only a psychological construct, and is not in any objective sense part of the universe, then this could be the final nail in religion’s casket: without time, without a beginning, there is no need for “creation.” -------------------------------------------This is all, of course, a major oversimplification of the book. Rovelli provides an infinitely more detailed account and his excursions into the quantum realm are fascinating for those who have the interest and patience. He is a skilled and clear writer, and his Feynman-esque ability to explain complex topics in simple terms with ample metaphor and analogy is something you’ll appreciate when the topic turns to quantum loop gravity. Overall, it’s a fascinating book that will help you think more clearly about the concept of time, including what a world without time looks like. "
260,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2599582-aviva,3,"Carlo Rovelli does an amazing job of putting scientific concepts that are incredibly difficult to grasp into beautiful words. That said, I found this one harder going than his earlier Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. Maybe because it went deeper into one topic and thus delved into more difficult territory, or maybe just because the truth about time is so counterintuitive. Either way, it made my brain hurt in a good way (most of the time). But I would still recommend his earlier book first to those who want to get their toes wet in some of modern physics' more incomprehensible topics."
261,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4023528-vheissu,3,"I recommend this book to readers of popular science and philosophy. Physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers will be familiar with the themes already and probably have nothing much to learn here.Rovelli makes clear if not explicit that our difficulty in understanding ""time"" isn't limited to our intellectual shortcomings or even the precision of our measuring instruments, but also a limitation in our language. We simply don't have the vocabulary to understand or express the nature of ""time"" in any other than what the author calls ""naïve"" terms (p. 199), which is to say, our everyday, common-sense meaning of the word (past, present, and future, cause and effect). Even the common sense meaning of ""time"" is deeply flawed (see below), much less relevant to quantum and relativistic ""time."" We need to find terms other than ""time"" to express and understand events that occur beyond our perceptible senses.Rovelli offers a few alternative names for quantum and relativistic events, but the best he can do is apply adjective modifiers to the base noun (""thermal time,"" p. 134, or ""quantum time,"" p. 137). What he--we--needs to do is drop the adjective-noun combination altogether and come up with new terms to describe the relationship of events at micro- and macroscopic levels. As long as we include the noun, ""time,"" in trying to explain these things, confusion can only result, since our common-sense understanding of ""time"" is flawed and inhibits understanding of superficially similar but actually qualitatively different phenomena.Naïve Time. The flaws in our everyday, common sense understanding of ""time"" are well-known and documented. There is no single ""now."" ""Time"" does not pass at the same rate for all or even any two observers. ""Time"" is different for observers at different distances from a mass. A person's head experiences a different ""time"" than does her feet! The difference is imperceptible to human senses but it is not unmeasurable; we now have sufficiently precise instruments to measure those differences.This is not to say that our naïve understanding of ""time"" is so flawed as to be unuseful. The establishment of standard time zones in the late 19th century was arguably one of the most consequential public policy decisions in the last 150 years. Communication and transportation technologies require such standardization and would be difficult without it. It was Einstein's efforts to find a way to standardize timepieces for railroads, after all, that led to his Special Theory of Relativity. So, as far as naïve ""time"" is concerned, the term has practical applications and need not be abandoned. We just need to stop using that word for quantum and relativistic investigation.Thermal Time. At relativistic levels, which is to say macroscopic, Rovelli defines ""time"" in terms of entropy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics establishes the ""arrow"" of time--past, present, future. Heat dissipates. The amount of heat in the universe is the same today as it was at the Big Bang, but it has diffused and continues to do so. Our measurement of ""time,"" therefore, is a measurement of entropy: low entropy is the past, high entropy is the future.In a few trillion years from now, the Universe may reach a state of maximum entropy, a cold, motionless condition in which ""time,"" as such, becomes a meaningless idea. ""Time"" will ""stop,"" or become irrelevant to the state of affairs. That is death.Quantum Time. At the microscopic level, which is to say subatomic, our naïve understanding of ""time"" is of no help at all. Subatomic events occur at such small scales and incredibly quick intervals that it becomes pointless to think in terms of order and duration. The smallest increment of time is called Planck Time, which is something like 10-43 seconds (the value 10 with 43 zeroes behind it, or a hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, p. 83); the corresponding Planck length is 10 -33. We have no means by which to observe such imperceptible events. Yet. The numbers are the result of mathematic equations, not the result of empirical measurement. So it is pointless to apply a clumsy term like ""time"" to quantum mechanics.Rovelli reminds us that it was Aristotle who first explored the philosophy and physics of ""time."" For Aristotle, ""time"" was a measurement of change; if nothing ever changed, there would be no ""time."" Newton offered a contradictory opinion. For the great physicist, ""time"" passed even in the absence of change. Both were a little right and a little wrong. Today, we understand that a state of changelessness has never existed in our Universe. We live in a soup of quantum particles that never stop changing. There is no such thing as an absolute vacuum. Quantum particles pop into and out of existence even in the ""vacuum"" of empty space. You can create an airless volume in a bottle, but you can't stop electromagnetic waves from passing through it. The closest the Universe will ever get to changelessness is when it reaches maximum entropy. And that is a long way off."
262,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,5,"Carlo Rovelli has the brilliance of Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein and the communicative skills of Carl Sagan. Otherwise he is an Italian theoretical physicist that specializes in quantum gravity and is a proponent, if not quite an advocate, of loop theory. Beyond that he is a philosopher with a heart for ancient poetry and love.And he brings all of it to bear in this delightful book about time, which, in the end, is life, and everything, including the context in which it unfolds. It would be in error to suggest that time doesn’t exist, but it would be equally in error to suggest that time is as simple as the continuum we record with our clocks.What I like most about the book is the fact that Rovelli recognizes that philosophy and science, if not two sides of the same coin, are cousins. He refers to Proust, which few scientists do, and suggests that while reason is among the best tools available for interpreting our “collective delirium,” it is “only an instrument, a pincer.”The science and the prose are very accessible. You will, however, have to be willing to think abstractly, a skill that in our wired, binary world seems to be greatly dissipating. And he is the first scientist I have read in a while who takes time to explain why the problem is sometimes not the science itself, but the limitations of language. Language is a human construction and has not kept up with our scientific revelation. Which is why theoretical physicists sometimes seem to be speaking another language. If only there was another language that was constructed in the world as we know it today, our communication would be so much easier and our knowledge would expand more rapidly. It would be impossible to summarize the knowledge contained in this book. You really have to read it. Here is a start, however: “The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.” If you can comprehend that the rest is largely additional perspective.And if the idea that universal time doesn’t exist in any absolute since seems a stretch, consider Rovelli’s simple explanation (I’m paraphrasing): People never used to worry about clocks. They worried about the cycle of sunshine and darkness. But that cycle is different in every single village, town, and city on the planet. The cycle varies both east to west and north to south. And back when we used to spend our lives in our little village we didn’t care. But then the scientists and engineers invented trains to take us from one village to the next. And people needed to know when the train left their village. But how can you develop a timetable when every village has its own time? You can’t. But, at the same time, it’s not quite practical to say that the whole world has just one time. Farmers don’t care what the sun is doing in London. They care what it’s doing on their farm. (China actually has no time zones by edict. The entire country is on Beijing time and there are significant practical implications.) The solution was the time zone, and it’s a compromise. Time zones are a construct and practical in the local sense, but highly inaccurate when talking about the universe. In the language of theoretical physics, they don’t exist.Eastern philosophers believe that reality is not knowable. It is real, but is made up of an infinite number of variables. We can only comprehend or think about a handful at a time. A tree is real. I can touch it and smell it. But it is not entirely knowable because there are too many variables (e.g. altitude, climate, soil, etc.) that define each tree for me to know them all. Time is the same way. Time is real but it is not knowable. Throw in the limitations of language and it begins to look like an illusion.To his great credit, Rovelli admits that there is much we don’t know. Think of a Seurat painting that has been blacked out. We have exposed a few, perhaps 10% (my number), of the original dots of pigment. It’s a lot, but we’re still guessing as to what the underlying picture is.And that’s pretty exciting. The key to our understanding to date, however, is the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy can never decrease. It’s critical to our understanding of time, as Rovelli explains. Personally I’m not convinced it’s inviolate. Perhaps we just haven’t uncovered enough dots of pigment yet. If entropy could work both ways it would explain a lot, but attraction does not equal fact. (Entropy obviously has a big part in causality, of course. Bidirectional entropy would be a huge boost for inductive reason.)It’s a short book and even if you get through a small amount of it you will learn a lot. Beyond writing in an accessible way, Rovelli comes off as very personable. The perfect person to sit down and share a cup of coffee with. If only he had the time. (Sorry)A marvelous book that I highly recommend."

It's a marvel to me that such a relatively short book could completely overturn my conceptions of reality, Newtonian physics, and my sense of self. What I love most about The Order of Time is how it bridges the gap of hard maths into the realm of the human experience. So many of the ""wicked problems"" we talk about today in politics or sociology are down simply to the fact that the solution is imperminent. I realize that this book is an introduction to this field, and a very flowery one at that. I'm sure that people who are steeped in the field have thier issues with some of the poetic liberties Rovelli took in explaining some of the the concepts. The book also has one or two contradictions, and places where the author departs from his stated goal of relaying established theory in digestible terms to trying to convince the audience of his particular ""loop theory"" of time. I know from reading the reviews that many have the same problem with this book that I do with the likes of Sapiens by Yuval Harari. But this book is a fantastic and accessible gateway for those who want to be won over by the wonders of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics while always being afraid of ""the mathy bits."" On a personal note, this book has potentially one of my favorite quotes from any book I've read this year: ""The world... Is a boundless and disorderly network of quantum events... It is much more Naples than Singapore."" As one of the few who has been to Naples Italy and loved it, I now have a justification as to why! Thank you, Dr. Rovelli, for this and so much more.I will definitely be reading this book again, as I don't believe I was able to gleen all it has to offer."
267,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,4,"4.5 stars What is time? What does it really mean to say that time ‘passes’? Do we exist in time, or does time exist in us? What is the meaning of now?These are the questions that Carlo Rovelli tries to answer in The Order of Time. He takes us on a journey on how our understanding of the concept of time has changed from antiquity to the present and into the field of quantum gravity, his area of expertise. It is a magma of beautiful and exciting ideas, from physics to philosophy, “sometimes illuminating, sometimes confusing.”We perceive time as one dimensional thing, it has a direction, the past is completely different from the future. The past seems to be one of the most obvious things, it is fixed, we have traces of it, we have memories, there are books to read and learn about the past. Time is a great conceptual idea and works very well in our daily lives but is has a different meaning in quantum mechanics and general relativity. The elementary equations that govern the physical world fail to show any distinction between the past and the future.Time is not a single thing, says Rovelli, but a multi-layered concept, a combination of properties that we can dismount, one by one. What it remains when you take away all these properties, is nothing at all. This is perhaps best exemplified by the physicists John Wheeler and Bryce DeWitt back in the 1970s, when they attempted to unify relativity and quantum mechanics resulted in time essentially disappearing completely from their equation (known as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation), suggesting that time does not exist at all. Rovelli looks in detail at the nature of entropy, arguing that “what makes the world go round are not sources of energy but sources of low entropy. Without low entropy, energy would dilute into uniform heat and the world would go to sleep in a state of thermal equilibrium – there would no longer be any distinction between past and future, and nothing would happen.” Boltzmann understood that entropy is not just a fundamental quantity but a measure of how things are disordered - when you mix thing (disorder) entropy goes up. The fact that entropy has been low in the past leads to an important fact that is ubiquitous and crucial for the difference between past and future: the past leaves traces of itself in the present. The only cause of the difference between past and future, argues Rovelli, is the low energy of the past. This is an astounding idea that is hard to comprehend and perhaps even harder to accept. But it is also revealing, and told in Rovelli’s clear and concise style, makes perfect sense. Rovelli has a deep technical knowledge of his subject; at the same time, he writes beautifully and although I got lost several times when he discussed the strange world of loop quantum gravity, it was exciting to penetrate some layers of the mystery of time. This is an exquisite and intellectually challenging book. It takes time to read, although, reflecting on the various physical variables of time, you might think otherwise.  link:  my review "
268,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,3,"This is really a 2.5. I was following along fine until mid-way through the second part, and I'm not sure whether it was the translation or the physics that lost me. Through the fuzz, I just kept thinking, ""There has to be an easier way to say this."" And it turns out, there was: the final chapter (The Sources of Time) summarized all his points in a clear and understandable way. So, if he can say it so clearly there, what was up with the rest of the book? He tells readers that the notes are for those who really understand the physics of it, but I'd hesitate to say the rest of the book is for us 'normal folks.' More like us 'normal folks who do LSD/mushrooms', which he hinted at a few times. The other thing that I felt was a problem in the book is a problem I have in general with reductionist metaphysical conversations-- once Rovelli had laid it all out, he did a poor job of explaining the possible significance of the knowledge. He commented a couple of times that our 'naive image of time was suitable [necessary] for our daily life', and that 'at an elementary level there are no cats either, but we do not for this reason cease to bother with cats.' Knowing how time works does not change how we experience it (and he doesn't seem to imply that it should), or how humans find meaning in it. Rovelli worked hard to reinforce the sheer number of possible outcomes and, in the process, essentially undermined the importance of understanding that it was all a series of probabilistic events-- i.e, why cats? and if they once existed, why do cats continue to exist? <-- the point here is that he missed the chance to make a larger tie-in to the meaning of it all (or lack thereof). If this order of time shows us that there is no order, that everything is random, reduced to the physical interactions between all the pieces of the universe, and that this knowledge shouldn't change anything about how we live our lives, to say nothing of the fact that we are so myopic we may never understand it, then knowing how it all works would be meaningless, right? Maybe not. But if not, Rovelli did a poor job explaining why. One final note: After I finished reading The Order of Time, I went looking for reviews to see what I had missed (due to the translation or the physics). This review did a pretty good job of summing up a lot of my feelings:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
269,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315851-roozbeh-daneshvar,3,"Before I started reading this book, I asked myself what is it about time that he is going to say? Time seemed obvious and didn't need any more elaboration (I admit that I knew nothing about time). This book opened my eyes and exposed me to aspects of time that I had never imagined.There were many places throughout reading that I was astonished by the new perspectives. For example, how there is a symmetry between past and future in classical mechanics (you just reverse the time direction and bam, everything works well, even though backwards). As another example, I was amazed that how the author connected time to memory (or how do you perceive time if you do not remember anything). He also connected music to memory. You would not enjoy music if you do not have memory: for every note, you have a recollection of the previous note/notes and also an anticipation of the upcoming notes. Without that memory, every moment of a music is just a single note, which would be meaningless.One part that resonated with me was about death and the fear of death. It was exactly the same case for me, as I have mixed feelings of fear of death and an openness for embracing it, both at the same time. This book put the same concept in the framework of time for me. It talked about how time has been troubling to human beings in the history.The text switched between solid physics concepts and some philosophical or even anecdotal themes. To me, it seemed not as a balanced combination, but an incoherent concoction. A large part might be because of my lack of understanding of the topic. Yet, I am skeptical that a poor translation might have contributed, too. In general, I did not find it a well-written text (although this is a personal opinion).If you want to know about time (with which you are probably in touch with, or you'd better be), do consider reading this book. It might open new doors for you."

Rovelli's attempt to explain away thermodynamic-entropic time and the whole of complex systems by telling us ""it's all a blur"" - that our experience of past and future and the direction of time, of evolution, growth, decay, and the whole of biology is basically nothing but subjective phenomenology or the ignorance of human perception is simply laughable. What universe is he living in?To ignore the work of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world who've established the sciences of chaos, complexity, nonlinear systems, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics and assert that their view of time is somehow not real, some illusion or whatever, is arrogant and irresponsible, not to mention narrow-minded. This is scientific fundamentalism and works against the goal of science to produce a coherent system of thought across many domains. The Order of Time appears to be a last ditch attempt to revive the old Platonic-Newtonian deterministic worldview in the face of the contemporary view of emergence, probability, instability, nonlinearity, complexity, chaos, and irreversibility - a kind of marketing ploy to convince the public that the old view of physics still reigns supreme over all else. In this book, Rovelli appears to represent an old guard of physicists, extreme reductionists, who are unable to embrace the scientific revolution that has engulfed their science, the revolution that is complex, nonequilibrium, and nonlinear systems theory.

275,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"Like a lot of young nerds, I had a period of fascination with advanced physics. Never enough to actually become all that good at it, mind you. I just about wrapped my brain around the wave-particle duality, in order to get my degree in Electrical Engineering. I took one course on Relativity. I found it all to be fascinating, and also really, really hard. There were other people, for whom it was equally fascinating, but more like ""fun"" than ""hard"". I was not one of those people.The primary benefit to me of having taken those courses as a youngster, was not that it did me the slightest bit of good whatsoever in my professional life in the semiconductor industry. It turns out that, truth be told, you don't have to be all that good at physics to make semiconductors, or even to test circuits made of them, or even to improve processes for making them. Perhaps you have to be really good at physics to invent them in the first place, but that was not a task I ever had to accomplish.No, the primary benefit was that, when someone invoked quantum physics or relativity to bolster their hand-wavy philosophy, I could recognize that they didn't know what they were talking about. There is, it turns out, nothing in quantum physics or relativity that proves or disproves anybody's idea about God, the meaning of life, whether there is an objective reality, or where consciousness comes from. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either lying, or just projecting their hopes onto the deeply unintuitive world of the very small or very fast.Still, Rovelli is himself a professional, one of those people who does actually know a lot more about physics than I do, and his book had two other things going for it. One, it was short, and a nice compact size. Two, it had a goodly amount of pictures. When I read something like advanced physics, the reality is I'm not ready to go through 800 pages' worth, and I need some diagrams, or sketches, or graphs, or something besides a wall of text with the occasional equation.It turns out that Rovelli is also apparently quite good at explaining things. It may have helped some that I had learned some of the early parts of the book before, but it had been decades, and I found myself wishing that he had been the guy writing my college physics textbooks, or perhaps teaching the classes. But then, it may also be that reading about physics for fun, is a lot more enjoyable than taking a test on it, which is going to be curved to guarantee that around 25% of the class gets a failing grade.Rovelli's thesis seems to be, that time is not a fundamental part of reality in the way that, say, mass or electromagnetism is. Rather, it is more like perspective. He claims that this is actually the pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian way of thinking about time. Time is nothing other than the order in which we experience things. Rovelli's claim (which I am unable to really evaluate the truth of), is that the modern idea of time as a dimension is Newton's, and while it may have been a reasonable operating assumption for him at that, uh, time, it isn't the literal truth. Just as quantum physics and relativity have upended other parts of Newton's worldview, Rovelli says that they have returned us to a pre-Newtonian, Aristotelian idea of time.One is reminded of the saying, ""time is what keeps everything from happening at once"". Rovelli seems to be saying something more like, time is the order in which we perceive things as happening. If we are all, relative to one another, moving at very low speeds (compared to the speed of light in a vacuum), then we never notice that my time is different than yours. Once you think about the very fast, very big, or very small, our intuitions don't work.There was also some stuff about entropy in there.To be honest, if I really wanted to understand what Rovelli was saying here, in depth, well enough to pass a test on it, I would need to read it again. And you know, I just might do that. But not yet, because I am once again in the blessed position of being able to read about physics for exactly as much as I feel like, and neither more nor less. I believe that it is true for me, anyway, that a little more time should pass before I reread this one.It was pretty good, though, so perhaps not too much time."
276,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4685740-allison,4,"Originally reviewed at The Book Wheel.Consider the following: time passes faster in the mountains than it does at sea level. If this sentence confounds you but piques your interest, then I can already tell you that you want to read The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli, which answers questions such as what is time? Is there a universal time? What does it mean to live in the present? Does the present exist? Turns out, these are simple questions with no easy answers because time is complicated. I don’t mean that timezones are confusing or that time passing faster in the mountains is perplexing, but that at an elemental level, time doesn’t even exist the way we think it does.Luckily, The Order of Time takes an approachable, scientific look at these questions and explores ideas rooted in quantum physics, thermodynamics, and the human condition. It will expand your mind, confuse the heck out of you, and, if you’re like me, leave you pondering some pretty heavy philosophical conundrums.One thing I learned that does make sense is that there is no now because now is just the perception of time. By the time we perceive something happening, nanoseconds have already passed. This means that everything we do, think, say, or hear exists both in the past and the present depending on if you’re saying it or hearing it. In other words, time is so fleeting we’re more or less living in the future as much as we are the present. For example, I can ask what you’re doing right now (reading this sentence) but by the time you process the words I have written, the act of reading it is in the past. WHAT?!Taking this one step further, this also means two people are never actually in the same place at the same time. I can speak to you, but by the time you perceive my actions, I am already living in the past. Throw in timezones and it’s easy to see why there’s no true, universal time. Time exists in relativity. Perhaps the author says it best when he said, “Physics does not describe how things evolve “in time” but how things evolve in their own times, and how “times” evolve relative to each other.”This relativity also applies to what it means to exist. One example The Order of Time gives is the emergence of teams. A group of children can line up and pick teams, one by one, for a soccer game. This new team doesn’t already exist, but it emerges and then does exist because different entities combine to make it so. So if you can create something out of nothing, what does that mean for the whole of existence? And is existence all relative? Some might say that a literary character doesn’t exist, as in they are not “real”, but yet they do exist, if even in our collective minds. Existence, Rovelli argues, is grammatical: “Words such as “here,” “now,” “I,” “this,” “tonight” all assume a different meaning depending on who utters them and the circumstances in which they are uttered.”Philosophical pondering aside, Rovelli explains all of this by rooting it in science. He tackles major scientific theories of time, from Aristotle’s belief that time measures change to Newton’s idea that time is independent of us. He discusses entropy and how it evolves over time, linking it to the laws of thermodynamics and quantum physics.Yet despite this heavy reading, there’s a romantic quality to The Order of Time. Because in the end, it’s all about how we, as humans, perceive time. It is our own “blurred vision” that shapes how we see the world. We are made up of our experiences, traces, and narratives, and each is unique to us. And although the following quote isn’t about time, per se, it does speak to the larger question of whether the absence of something exists: “But it isn’t absence that causes sorrow. It is affection and love. Without affection, without love, such absences would cause us no pain. For this reason, even the pain caused by absence is, in the end, something good and even beautiful, because it feeds on that which gives meaning to life.”"

For me, it has been emotional to go back to what I have learned when studying general relativity and quantum mechanics, so many years ago.

279,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,4,"I have read a lot of popular physics books and many of them just go over the same ground, but this one was a bit new and different. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of relativity is comfortable with the idea that time passes at different rates depending on the relative velocities of two observers, but Rovelli takes us a step further -- it is not just the rate at which time passes that depends on point of view, it is time itself. Rovelli starts by showing how time and entropy are intimately related as the only physical concepts which have an irreversible forward arrow pointing to the future. He then explains how the level of entropy of a system is a function of point of view -- whether a given system is disordered depends on how order is defined (I remember telling my stepmother when I was a teenager that my room was neat because I could find everything I needed in the mess.) If time is a function of entropy and entropy depends on point of view, then perhaps time does too. Time, like entropy, becomes a function of blurring, of uncertainty about things that we do not or cannot measure. Hmmmm. At the very least it is an intriguing idea; maybe it is even true. Perhaps it only appears to us that the universe must have started with the Big Bang and may end with entropic heat death because of what time and entropy look like to us from our localized point of view. So there is no universal physical truth, or at least not one that depends on space and time, which turn out to be localized concepts. But perhaps there are universal concepts for how things relate to one another that are not built into a fixed unchanging view of space and time and that can therefore give us a broad picture of the universe. Rovelli teases us with the assertion that his field, loop quantum gravity, manages to take time out of the most basic equations of the universe, but he doesn't try to explain how, probably because it is too complex for a popular book.I enjoyed this book as an audiobook with a dazzlingly good narration by Benedict Cumberbatch. Sometimes science books are better enjoyed in print editions, but this one worked quite well in audio. The quality of the writing is excellent and clear. The explanations of scientific ideas are not simple but they are comprenhensible even for a person with a limited background in physics and no math. And the rich, expressive voice of Mr. Cumberbatch makes the experience complete."
280,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,3,"This introduction to the modern physicist's understanding of time is difficult to rate for a few reasons. First of all, I already knew about most of these concepts so there wasn't really anything revelatory here. Had I not brought this foreknowledge to this book, I think I may have found it more interesting. Also, acknowledging the linguistic difficulty of discussing time as frequently people mean very different things when using the word, Rovelli falls victim to this very problem throughout the book. Occasionally he gets the point across very well only to confuse the issue he just clarified in the next paragraph. Lastly, I don't think we need all of the literary and spiritual meanderings he gets into. I know that it is trendy for physicists to bring in literature and use overly flowery language to describe the most complicated of scientific discussions but the degree to which this is used here is quite extreme, and in a work of such brevity, seems like a replacement for genuine profundity as opposed to being additive. I admire Rovelli's interest in bringing these important concepts to a mass audience, even if there is some depth and rigor lost in the effort. However, if your notion of time is that which comes from grade school then perhaps this will be an effective précis for future study, if you want a more interesting discussion about how these notions relate to your functioning as a human then I would recommend, ""Your Brain is a Time Machine,"" by Dean Buonomano.

He argues that our perception of time’s flow depends entirely on our inability to see the world in all its detail. Quantum uncertainty means we cannot know the positions and speeds of all the particles in the Universe. If we could, there would be no entropy and no unraveling of time. Rovelli originated this ‘thermal time hypothesis’ with French mathematician Alain Connes.Maybe, this book alone is not enough to pass judgment as a lay reader but the book has an extraordinary poetic essence to transmute into the Rovelie's reality. :)"

288,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874093-janna,2,"Never thought I’d see the day where I complained that a book leaned too far into the poetic, but here we are. I liked Part One, which lays out the physics behind why time is not as it seems, but Part Two goes too much into philosophising without much of a sound basis and without adequately laying out the supporting physics. Where Reality Is Not What It Seems took readers through a series of logical steps, provided the appropriate rigour, and created a sound place from which to begin amping up the complexity, The Order of Time begins in science and then swerves the argument into flowery interpretations of thinkers from St Augustine to Kant to Buddha. His ultimate conclusion seems to be that our experience of time is something that depends on our human lens: something that philosophers have said for centuries (and he quotes those philosophers). In support of this in the physics side of things, he briefly explains the irreversibility of ever-increasing entropy and how the relations between particles are blurred such that we are unable to perceive them. ""Therefore, our vision of the world is blurred because the physical interactions between the part of the world to which we belong and the rest are blind to many variables. ... This does not mean that blurring is a mental construct; it depends on actual, existing physical interactions."" He then switches to philosophy and quotes Hans Reichenbach, writing that time causes anxiety; as a result, we have imagined the existence of eternity and heaven and higher realms. And from there he suggests: ""Perhaps, ultimately, the emotional dimension of time is not the film of mist that prevents us from apprehending the nature of time objectively. Perhaps the emotion of time is precisely what time is for us."" His foray into the emotions is rooted more in literature and music, which (knowing how poets think) can be hit or miss. My main issue, however, is this. There is a difference between (1) humans being constructed such that we are unable to perceive the reality of time and (2) the emotions that arise from our particular experience of time. Those emotions might well cause us to be attached to time or have an awareness of it that doesn't match reality. But that's not the same as saying that, as humans, the structure of our minds and the physical interactions of slice of the universe we occupy are such that we are unable to perceive temporal reality, which is what I took his argument to be. Emotions are far more like a mental construct than the blurring of thermodynamic interactions occurring in the physical world. And what he says about emotions seems to suggest that we refuse to see reality, not that we are unable to (one could imagine a person who wasn't caught up with anxiety about time and didn't experience those obscuring emotions). Maybe he wasn't trying to put forward a serious argument for the place of emotions or maybe I'm reading ungenerously. Perhaps he was simply swept up with the poetry of it all, but that leads to confusion and makes the entire text less credible.I’m not a physicist and I know this is a pop science book — emphasis on the pop — but by the end it was a pop philosophy book sprinkled over with poetry and references to the likes of the Mahabharata, Bach, and the book of Job. The final chapter consists of his musings on what really drives us as human beings — and I do think it's all connected and that the final chapter drives at the point that really matters, but he didn't earn that ending. He didn't lay out the path correctly and, consequently, his broader conclusions on life feel flimsy. While physics and philosophy certainly have implications for one another, and there is truth also in art and poetry, The Order of Time does not result in a successful mix."
289,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,4,"In The Order of Time, Carlo Rovelli sticks to the theme that reality is not what it seems, in this case focusing entirely on the concept of time. In a sense, the history of science can be described as an uncompromising assault on intuition and common sense. The Earth appears flat and stationary, but in reality spins and soars through space at 67,000 miles per hour. Humans appear to be a species of their own special creation, but in reality are simply naturally evolved primates.These ideas are familiar by now, but they were revolutionary at the time of their discovery. What Rovelli is pointing out is that science may not be done with us yet—the next assault on our common sense might be the revelation of a world without time. Rovelli points out that what we label as “common sense” is often the intellectual work of past thinkers—who may or may not have gotten things right. How we think about time—our common sense notions of it—have in fact been shaped by past thinkers, the two most prominent being Aristotle and Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton thought that time was universal and absolute, that the variable “t” applied to everyone everywhere and continued to tick on even if everything in the universe stood still. Aristotle, in contrast, thought of time simply as the measure of change, and that without change it made no sense to talk about time in any absolute or universal sense. Because Aristotle got so much wrong in so many fields, you might think you ought to favor Newton in this debate, but according to Rovelli you’d be wrong to do so. Aristotle’s picture of time is closer to reality, as confirmed by the work of Albert Einstein. Einstein demonstrated that time is relative, not absolute. We now know that time moves slower at lower altitudes and at higher speeds. Someone living in the plains will age less than someone living in the mountains and someone traveling at high speeds will age less than someone stationary. This counterintuitive notion does not sit well with common sense, but that’s the point: reality is not, and has never been, what it seems. What all of this adds up to is that there is no such thing as universal time; there is only time for you, from your perspective, in relation to other objects. Reality is a world of events and changing quantities, not of shapes and universal space and time. And this is precisely what quantum physics demonstrates, where the equations that work have no time variable at all. So the flow of time is simply a psychological construct, an illusion, and one we may need to discard if we are to penetrate further into the depths of reality. But, if time is not embedded in the fabric of reality, it does beg the question: where does our concept of time come from? In a word: entropy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that entropy can never decrease, and increasing entropy is the way our minds mark the passing of time. Since entropy cannot be reversed, time flows in one direction from past to future. And so, entropy is part of the basic fabric of reality and time is simply our way of measuring it. That is, unless we’re talking quantum mechanics, which needs no time variable at all.----------------------------------------What should we make of this claim? Unless you are working in the field of quantum physics, it would be difficult to refute what Rovelli is saying. If the quantum equations do not require time, then either time is an illusion or else we don’t really understand the quantum world. You’ll have to read the book to get a handle on the more technical aspects that I won’t hesitate to admit flew right over my head. One point of contention I can offer, however, is regarding Rovelli’s claim that the concept of a “universal present” is nonsensical. Here’s how he describes it:Hypothetically, if you had a friend on another planet four light-years away, would both of you be experiencing the same present moment? According to Rovelli, there is no such present moment that applies to both of you.If you were to look at your friend through a telescope, you would be seeing him four years ago, because that’s how long the light would take to travel back to you. So your “now” and his “now” cannot be said to be occuring at the same present moment.But wait, is this right? I’m not so sure. Yes, it’s true that, looking through the telescope, you would be seeing your friend four years earlier, due to the limitation of the speed of light. But, if you were to continue to look through the telescope for four more years, you would see your friend’s “now” moment precisely four years later, and that would only be true if there was an initial present moment that was the same for both of you. So in a sense there is a universal present, it’s just not accessible to us perceptually due to the constraints of the speed of light. Maybe this is a small point, but I think it shows that a universal present has to exist, even if, due to the nature of the universe, time can only be perceived locally. In any case, it’s interesting to contemplate that time is simply the psychological measure of change, and that the underlying changes can speed up or slow down depending on your position and speed relative to other objects. This is the world of relativity and reality, which banishes Newton’s universal clock and redeems Aristotle’s notion of change. A final point to consider is that, if time is only a psychological construct, and is not in any objective sense part of the universe, then this could be the final nail in religion’s casket: without time, without a beginning, there is no need for “creation.” -------------------------------------------This is all, of course, a major oversimplification of the book. Rovelli provides an infinitely more detailed account and his excursions into the quantum realm are fascinating for those who have the interest and patience. He is a skilled and clear writer, and his Feynman-esque ability to explain complex topics in simple terms with ample metaphor and analogy is something you’ll appreciate when the topic turns to quantum loop gravity. Overall, it’s a fascinating book that will help you think more clearly about the concept of time, including what a world without time looks like. "
290,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2599582-aviva,3,"Carlo Rovelli does an amazing job of putting scientific concepts that are incredibly difficult to grasp into beautiful words. That said, I found this one harder going than his earlier Seven Brief Lessons on Physics. Maybe because it went deeper into one topic and thus delved into more difficult territory, or maybe just because the truth about time is so counterintuitive. Either way, it made my brain hurt in a good way (most of the time). But I would still recommend his earlier book first to those who want to get their toes wet in some of modern physics' more incomprehensible topics."
291,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4023528-vheissu,3,"I recommend this book to readers of popular science and philosophy. Physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers will be familiar with the themes already and probably have nothing much to learn here.Rovelli makes clear if not explicit that our difficulty in understanding ""time"" isn't limited to our intellectual shortcomings or even the precision of our measuring instruments, but also a limitation in our language. We simply don't have the vocabulary to understand or express the nature of ""time"" in any other than what the author calls ""naïve"" terms (p. 199), which is to say, our everyday, common-sense meaning of the word (past, present, and future, cause and effect). Even the common sense meaning of ""time"" is deeply flawed (see below), much less relevant to quantum and relativistic ""time."" We need to find terms other than ""time"" to express and understand events that occur beyond our perceptible senses.Rovelli offers a few alternative names for quantum and relativistic events, but the best he can do is apply adjective modifiers to the base noun (""thermal time,"" p. 134, or ""quantum time,"" p. 137). What he--we--needs to do is drop the adjective-noun combination altogether and come up with new terms to describe the relationship of events at micro- and macroscopic levels. As long as we include the noun, ""time,"" in trying to explain these things, confusion can only result, since our common-sense understanding of ""time"" is flawed and inhibits understanding of superficially similar but actually qualitatively different phenomena.Naïve Time. The flaws in our everyday, common sense understanding of ""time"" are well-known and documented. There is no single ""now."" ""Time"" does not pass at the same rate for all or even any two observers. ""Time"" is different for observers at different distances from a mass. A person's head experiences a different ""time"" than does her feet! The difference is imperceptible to human senses but it is not unmeasurable; we now have sufficiently precise instruments to measure those differences.This is not to say that our naïve understanding of ""time"" is so flawed as to be unuseful. The establishment of standard time zones in the late 19th century was arguably one of the most consequential public policy decisions in the last 150 years. Communication and transportation technologies require such standardization and would be difficult without it. It was Einstein's efforts to find a way to standardize timepieces for railroads, after all, that led to his Special Theory of Relativity. So, as far as naïve ""time"" is concerned, the term has practical applications and need not be abandoned. We just need to stop using that word for quantum and relativistic investigation.Thermal Time. At relativistic levels, which is to say macroscopic, Rovelli defines ""time"" in terms of entropy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics establishes the ""arrow"" of time--past, present, future. Heat dissipates. The amount of heat in the universe is the same today as it was at the Big Bang, but it has diffused and continues to do so. Our measurement of ""time,"" therefore, is a measurement of entropy: low entropy is the past, high entropy is the future.In a few trillion years from now, the Universe may reach a state of maximum entropy, a cold, motionless condition in which ""time,"" as such, becomes a meaningless idea. ""Time"" will ""stop,"" or become irrelevant to the state of affairs. That is death.Quantum Time. At the microscopic level, which is to say subatomic, our naïve understanding of ""time"" is of no help at all. Subatomic events occur at such small scales and incredibly quick intervals that it becomes pointless to think in terms of order and duration. The smallest increment of time is called Planck Time, which is something like 10-43 seconds (the value 10 with 43 zeroes behind it, or a hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, p. 83); the corresponding Planck length is 10 -33. We have no means by which to observe such imperceptible events. Yet. The numbers are the result of mathematic equations, not the result of empirical measurement. So it is pointless to apply a clumsy term like ""time"" to quantum mechanics.Rovelli reminds us that it was Aristotle who first explored the philosophy and physics of ""time."" For Aristotle, ""time"" was a measurement of change; if nothing ever changed, there would be no ""time."" Newton offered a contradictory opinion. For the great physicist, ""time"" passed even in the absence of change. Both were a little right and a little wrong. Today, we understand that a state of changelessness has never existed in our Universe. We live in a soup of quantum particles that never stop changing. There is no such thing as an absolute vacuum. Quantum particles pop into and out of existence even in the ""vacuum"" of empty space. You can create an airless volume in a bottle, but you can't stop electromagnetic waves from passing through it. The closest the Universe will ever get to changelessness is when it reaches maximum entropy. And that is a long way off."
292,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,5,"Carlo Rovelli has the brilliance of Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein and the communicative skills of Carl Sagan. Otherwise he is an Italian theoretical physicist that specializes in quantum gravity and is a proponent, if not quite an advocate, of loop theory. Beyond that he is a philosopher with a heart for ancient poetry and love.And he brings all of it to bear in this delightful book about time, which, in the end, is life, and everything, including the context in which it unfolds. It would be in error to suggest that time doesn’t exist, but it would be equally in error to suggest that time is as simple as the continuum we record with our clocks.What I like most about the book is the fact that Rovelli recognizes that philosophy and science, if not two sides of the same coin, are cousins. He refers to Proust, which few scientists do, and suggests that while reason is among the best tools available for interpreting our “collective delirium,” it is “only an instrument, a pincer.”The science and the prose are very accessible. You will, however, have to be willing to think abstractly, a skill that in our wired, binary world seems to be greatly dissipating. And he is the first scientist I have read in a while who takes time to explain why the problem is sometimes not the science itself, but the limitations of language. Language is a human construction and has not kept up with our scientific revelation. Which is why theoretical physicists sometimes seem to be speaking another language. If only there was another language that was constructed in the world as we know it today, our communication would be so much easier and our knowledge would expand more rapidly. It would be impossible to summarize the knowledge contained in this book. You really have to read it. Here is a start, however: “The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.” If you can comprehend that the rest is largely additional perspective.And if the idea that universal time doesn’t exist in any absolute since seems a stretch, consider Rovelli’s simple explanation (I’m paraphrasing): People never used to worry about clocks. They worried about the cycle of sunshine and darkness. But that cycle is different in every single village, town, and city on the planet. The cycle varies both east to west and north to south. And back when we used to spend our lives in our little village we didn’t care. But then the scientists and engineers invented trains to take us from one village to the next. And people needed to know when the train left their village. But how can you develop a timetable when every village has its own time? You can’t. But, at the same time, it’s not quite practical to say that the whole world has just one time. Farmers don’t care what the sun is doing in London. They care what it’s doing on their farm. (China actually has no time zones by edict. The entire country is on Beijing time and there are significant practical implications.) The solution was the time zone, and it’s a compromise. Time zones are a construct and practical in the local sense, but highly inaccurate when talking about the universe. In the language of theoretical physics, they don’t exist.Eastern philosophers believe that reality is not knowable. It is real, but is made up of an infinite number of variables. We can only comprehend or think about a handful at a time. A tree is real. I can touch it and smell it. But it is not entirely knowable because there are too many variables (e.g. altitude, climate, soil, etc.) that define each tree for me to know them all. Time is the same way. Time is real but it is not knowable. Throw in the limitations of language and it begins to look like an illusion.To his great credit, Rovelli admits that there is much we don’t know. Think of a Seurat painting that has been blacked out. We have exposed a few, perhaps 10% (my number), of the original dots of pigment. It’s a lot, but we’re still guessing as to what the underlying picture is.And that’s pretty exciting. The key to our understanding to date, however, is the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy can never decrease. It’s critical to our understanding of time, as Rovelli explains. Personally I’m not convinced it’s inviolate. Perhaps we just haven’t uncovered enough dots of pigment yet. If entropy could work both ways it would explain a lot, but attraction does not equal fact. (Entropy obviously has a big part in causality, of course. Bidirectional entropy would be a huge boost for inductive reason.)It’s a short book and even if you get through a small amount of it you will learn a lot. Beyond writing in an accessible way, Rovelli comes off as very personable. The perfect person to sit down and share a cup of coffee with. If only he had the time. (Sorry)A marvelous book that I highly recommend."
293,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7999890-ken-gronnbeck,2,The book starts good but I get confused at the end. This book is not even close to the two other books I've read by him. 
294,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34045599-kiril-panchev,2,Another poorly executed book from this author. 
295,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/965781-rachel-ayers,5,The audiobook is narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch so it was kiiind of like having Doctor Strange explain concepts of time and physics to me.
296,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15445172-andrew-ferguson,5,"""We must describe the world as it happens, not how it is...""As someone completely new to the fields of quantum theory and theoretical physics, this book is a master stroke in mind bending explanation of the physics of time. It's a marvel to me that such a relatively short book could completely overturn my conceptions of reality, Newtonian physics, and my sense of self. What I love most about The Order of Time is how it bridges the gap of hard maths into the realm of the human experience. So many of the ""wicked problems"" we talk about today in politics or sociology are down simply to the fact that the solution is imperminent. I realize that this book is an introduction to this field, and a very flowery one at that. I'm sure that people who are steeped in the field have thier issues with some of the poetic liberties Rovelli took in explaining some of the the concepts. The book also has one or two contradictions, and places where the author departs from his stated goal of relaying established theory in digestible terms to trying to convince the audience of his particular ""loop theory"" of time. I know from reading the reviews that many have the same problem with this book that I do with the likes of Sapiens by Yuval Harari. But this book is a fantastic and accessible gateway for those who want to be won over by the wonders of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics while always being afraid of ""the mathy bits."" On a personal note, this book has potentially one of my favorite quotes from any book I've read this year: ""The world... Is a boundless and disorderly network of quantum events... It is much more Naples than Singapore."" As one of the few who has been to Naples Italy and loved it, I now have a justification as to why! Thank you, Dr. Rovelli, for this and so much more.I will definitely be reading this book again, as I don't believe I was able to gleen all it has to offer."
297,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,4,"4.5 stars What is time? What does it really mean to say that time ‘passes’? Do we exist in time, or does time exist in us? What is the meaning of now?These are the questions that Carlo Rovelli tries to answer in The Order of Time. He takes us on a journey on how our understanding of the concept of time has changed from antiquity to the present and into the field of quantum gravity, his area of expertise. It is a magma of beautiful and exciting ideas, from physics to philosophy, “sometimes illuminating, sometimes confusing.”We perceive time as one dimensional thing, it has a direction, the past is completely different from the future. The past seems to be one of the most obvious things, it is fixed, we have traces of it, we have memories, there are books to read and learn about the past. Time is a great conceptual idea and works very well in our daily lives but is has a different meaning in quantum mechanics and general relativity. The elementary equations that govern the physical world fail to show any distinction between the past and the future.Time is not a single thing, says Rovelli, but a multi-layered concept, a combination of properties that we can dismount, one by one. What it remains when you take away all these properties, is nothing at all. This is perhaps best exemplified by the physicists John Wheeler and Bryce DeWitt back in the 1970s, when they attempted to unify relativity and quantum mechanics resulted in time essentially disappearing completely from their equation (known as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation), suggesting that time does not exist at all. Rovelli looks in detail at the nature of entropy, arguing that “what makes the world go round are not sources of energy but sources of low entropy. Without low entropy, energy would dilute into uniform heat and the world would go to sleep in a state of thermal equilibrium – there would no longer be any distinction between past and future, and nothing would happen.” Boltzmann understood that entropy is not just a fundamental quantity but a measure of how things are disordered - when you mix thing (disorder) entropy goes up. The fact that entropy has been low in the past leads to an important fact that is ubiquitous and crucial for the difference between past and future: the past leaves traces of itself in the present. The only cause of the difference between past and future, argues Rovelli, is the low energy of the past. This is an astounding idea that is hard to comprehend and perhaps even harder to accept. But it is also revealing, and told in Rovelli’s clear and concise style, makes perfect sense. Rovelli has a deep technical knowledge of his subject; at the same time, he writes beautifully and although I got lost several times when he discussed the strange world of loop quantum gravity, it was exciting to penetrate some layers of the mystery of time. This is an exquisite and intellectually challenging book. It takes time to read, although, reflecting on the various physical variables of time, you might think otherwise.  link:  my review "
298,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116818-erica,3,"This is really a 2.5. I was following along fine until mid-way through the second part, and I'm not sure whether it was the translation or the physics that lost me. Through the fuzz, I just kept thinking, ""There has to be an easier way to say this."" And it turns out, there was: the final chapter (The Sources of Time) summarized all his points in a clear and understandable way. So, if he can say it so clearly there, what was up with the rest of the book? He tells readers that the notes are for those who really understand the physics of it, but I'd hesitate to say the rest of the book is for us 'normal folks.' More like us 'normal folks who do LSD/mushrooms', which he hinted at a few times. The other thing that I felt was a problem in the book is a problem I have in general with reductionist metaphysical conversations-- once Rovelli had laid it all out, he did a poor job of explaining the possible significance of the knowledge. He commented a couple of times that our 'naive image of time was suitable [necessary] for our daily life', and that 'at an elementary level there are no cats either, but we do not for this reason cease to bother with cats.' Knowing how time works does not change how we experience it (and he doesn't seem to imply that it should), or how humans find meaning in it. Rovelli worked hard to reinforce the sheer number of possible outcomes and, in the process, essentially undermined the importance of understanding that it was all a series of probabilistic events-- i.e, why cats? and if they once existed, why do cats continue to exist? <-- the point here is that he missed the chance to make a larger tie-in to the meaning of it all (or lack thereof). If this order of time shows us that there is no order, that everything is random, reduced to the physical interactions between all the pieces of the universe, and that this knowledge shouldn't change anything about how we live our lives, to say nothing of the fact that we are so myopic we may never understand it, then knowing how it all works would be meaningless, right? Maybe not. But if not, Rovelli did a poor job explaining why. One final note: After I finished reading The Order of Time, I went looking for reviews to see what I had missed (due to the translation or the physics). This review did a pretty good job of summing up a lot of my feelings:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
299,073521610X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315851-roozbeh-daneshvar,3,"Before I started reading this book, I asked myself what is it about time that he is going to say? Time seemed obvious and didn't need any more elaboration (I admit that I knew nothing about time). This book opened my eyes and exposed me to aspects of time that I had never imagined.There were many places throughout reading that I was astonished by the new perspectives. For example, how there is a symmetry between past and future in classical mechanics (you just reverse the time direction and bam, everything works well, even though backwards). As another example, I was amazed that how the author connected time to memory (or how do you perceive time if you do not remember anything). He also connected music to memory. You would not enjoy music if you do not have memory: for every note, you have a recollection of the previous note/notes and also an anticipation of the upcoming notes. Without that memory, every moment of a music is just a single note, which would be meaningless.One part that resonated with me was about death and the fear of death. It was exactly the same case for me, as I have mixed feelings of fear of death and an openness for embracing it, both at the same time. This book put the same concept in the framework of time for me. It talked about how time has been troubling to human beings in the history.The text switched between solid physics concepts and some philosophical or even anecdotal themes. To me, it seemed not as a balanced combination, but an incoherent concoction. A large part might be because of my lack of understanding of the topic. Yet, I am skeptical that a poor translation might have contributed, too. In general, I did not find it a well-written text (although this is a personal opinion).If you want to know about time (with which you are probably in touch with, or you'd better be), do consider reading this book. It might open new doors for you."
