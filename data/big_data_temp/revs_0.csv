How? This fascinating book, a sort of big history/big science blend, is exactly as its title describes it. The Universe Within: Discovering the Common History of Rocks, Planets and People explores how the properties of our bodies and the course of our lives have been affected by the universe we live in, beginning with the big bang. It also includes some science history with personality filled stories of how plate tectonics and other scientific theories were first hypothesized, and it gives a taste of how current scientists in in the author’s field of biological sciences work, for instance dropping to all fours to hunt for tiny fossils that shed light on the evolution of our Earth. The tone is enthusiastic, and the endnotes include lots of suggestions for further reading. My copy of the book is decked with post it flags marking sections I have already reread several times, often sharing them with whoever happens to be around me at the time."

What a little condensed power-house it was.As a fellow scientist I'm well-versed in the theories presented here; but teh book offered much more. Firstly, it ties together multidisciplinary sciences in a neat little dialogue. One moment you're reading about biology, the next geology, but it all ties together. Science as a spectrum is well demonstrated here.Secondly, the history of these discoveries was told with great detail. Shubin discusses the political and scientific climate of the time of the discoveries giving great detail and insight into the nature of scientific research.This book is recommended for fellow scientist and science enthusiasts. I'd question whether a layman may find it too dense in comparison to other popular science books (such as Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything). Great read!"
2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,5,"I have a bit of a nerd crush on Shubin, having now read both of his books this year. What I like about his writing, is that it is as smart and informative as it is accessible. I don't know about your average Joe, but I do not have a degree in evolutionary biology, astronomy, or tectonics, so it was sure nice to find an author who can really explain the tricky details. I've read explanations of Carbon 14 dating of fossils in both this book and Nick Lane's Oxygen, and I only really got Shubin. Lane went right over my head, like a supersonic jet. Compared to Your Inner Fish, the author's first book, The Universe Within has a broader scope. Sometimes Shubin steps aside to weave in relevant stories of great scientists, and it takes a page or two to connect the dots, but the desirable ""a-ha"" moment never seems to miss the reader. The first few chapters that deal with formation of our planet and life in general, as well as chapter nine that talked about human evolution were of the most interest to me. There are a few theories and topics that I would love to expand my knowledge on a little further: the great conveyor belt of the bedrock, life in pre-historic Antarctic, a single male ancestor of all Native American people, and the mysterious civilization of Natufians. Thankfully, the book also contains a fascinating and very extensive section with notes and further reading suggestions, with the help of which I have already added several other scientific works to my shelves. I cannot wait to see what else Mr. Shubin publishes. "

This sounds as if it’s going to be in that vein, and in a way it is — certainly it brings home that it’s only possible for us to have iron in our blood because of ancient fusion in the hearts of stars — but on a more banal level, it’s the perfect way of revising what you’ve learnt in the Open University’s introduction to science module, S104. If you can follow and understand everything here, you’re okay on at least the first and second book of that course.It’s fairly simply written, not going too much into depth about the technical details, but more providing a survey of some important scientific discoveries. Though the title The Universe Within may imply that it’s more about our own bodies, it actually goes into a lot of Earth science, touching on continental drift, global warming, even the formation of planets and the existence of water in the solar system.It’s an easy enough read, and not a bad way to check your understanding.Originally posted here."
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,3,"This book reminded me of A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson. Except, it isn't as well written, or as comprehensive. Shubin introduces the formation of the planets and our moon. He talks about circadian rhythms. He talks about oxygen and how it allows for big bodies and mammals, etc. He tries to be Carl Sagan, with pontification on how stars go supernova and make the chemical elements that find their way into out bodies. That's about it. I guess that's the origin of the title? He never says. This book sort of felt like a waste of my time. It wasn't awfully written, but it wasn't that good, either."

Popular science at its best!""Ours is a species that can extend its biological inheritance to see vast reaches of space, know 13.7 billion years of history, and explore our deep connections to planets, galaxies, and ohter living things. There is something almost magical to the notion that our bodies, minds, and ideas have roots in the crust of Earth, water of the oceans, and atoms in celestial bodies. The stars in the sky and the fossils in the ground are enduring beacons that signal, though the pace of human change is ever accelerating, we are but a recent link in a network of connections as old as the heavens."" (Page 190)The above paragraph sums up what the themes that this book explores. One of the chapters deals with continental drift. I've read the story many times before but I still find it highly amusing and a bit distressing that what any child given a map of the world can see was considered a heretical idea as little as 50 years ago. The importance of continental drift? It created an enormous amount of new coast line, susceptible to erosion and dumping sediments into the sea, thus burying the mud consisting of rotting single celled organisms. This covering of this mud led to an increase in oxygen levels, enabling the evolution of warm-blooded mammals (page 117/118).All in all, this book is immensely readable and highly recommended for anyone curious about the history of our world and its creatures."

This book really filled that bill for me. It starts with the big bang and traces developments since then that led to human beings: how solar systems formed, how the earth's atmosphere came to contain so much oxygen, and so on. I am a person of faith and it disappoints and perplexes me that so many other people of faith are anti-science. To me, it is all the more awe-inspiring to understand that I am ""fearfully and wonderfully"" made of atoms that formed in the big bang over 13 billion years ago. Science is about what and how; it will never explain why. Why is the province of faith. But to humbly seek to understand what and how is just another form of worship in my opinion. "

While I as a conservative Christian and pastor cannot agree with Shubin's evolutionary scientific conclusions, I nevertheless appreciated hearing his voice in this book, and found the breadth of topics to be sufficiently satisfying. All in all, a good read if you appreciate a scientist who is able to speak from his worldview with articulation and without condescension."

And that India bumping into Asia led to a cooling of the Earth and that made our ancestors developing color vision (because this helped them finding more nutritious food.) But I did not like the astronomical part of the book and certainly not the biographical stuff. Shubin was a student of Gould. So he felt he had to mention Baseball, by the way. I had never heard of Stigler’s law, which states that no scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer. This law was found by Robert Merton. Okay, so it is kind of funny. But somehow it reminds me of Sturgeon's law. And that, I believe, was pronounced by Ted. 7/10"

This was a good, but obviously compact, look on how life started and evolved on Earth, using astronomy, geology, physics, chemistry and paleontology to tell the story. The best part is while telling the parts of the story, some of the people and scientists mentioned aren't the usual ones that always brought up in popular science books - so even if you have read other science books about the general ideas on how the Earth was created or how life began, you will still learn plenty of new things from this book."

16,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,3,"I don't understand how this book gets its name. It is really a geological/biological/astronomical survey of earth over time. 13.7 billion years ago - The formation of the universe and how the different elements were created. This chapter includes a nice write up of how scientist estimate the age of the universe and the odd fact that all of the stars are red-shifted indicating they are moving away and why that radio telescope in New Jersey was important.4.7 billion years ago - The creation of the earth and other planets in the solar system including the formation of the moon from a collision with earth. This chapter includes an explanation of how scientists date the earth and why those comet rocks were important, but not the only way they did it (they also used some very old rocks in Australia).2.4 billion years ago - The evolution of large animals from the single-celled and simple multi-celled forms of life that dominated the fossil record of earth the previous 2 billion years.65 million years ago - The great die off of dinosaurs and other reptilian forms of life that happened when an asteroid hit the earth and how such cataclysmic events are not uncommon, including one die-off that occurred as a result of changing sea chemistry.Reading this book and watching that Bill Nye debate brings up some issues between science and religion. Science shows the universe is unimaginably old with billions of stars at vast distances. The religion teaches that God only took the same time to create all of that as he did on the oceans. One view encourages a view of man as a humbly small part of a huge universe, the other as something special.Science shows that all life is related. We share DNA with even the humblest jelly fish. Religion teaches that man is a special creation of God and can therefore do what he pleases to the earth and all other life forms on it.Science shows the earth has gone through several biological apocalypses where almost every species on earth has gone extinct. Religion claims the earth is only 6000 years old and the species on it are immutable. We can do whatever we want to the planet and not worry.I think I am buying the science. That does not eliminate a belief in God, it just eliminates a belief in most religions."
17,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875081-arvind-balasundaram,4,"In this lively book, Neil Shubin (noted author of Your Inner Fish), makes paleontology, carbon chemistry, and climate science all come together in explaining our lives and the world around us. Drawing on the deep connectivity between our chemical composition and the natural processes in our universe, Shubin makes an immediate case of how dependent we are on almost everything around us. He explains how the state of the planet is greatly dependent on its carbon balance, a process maintained and governed by seemingly discrete earth processes. Volcanoes spew carbon into the air, which then settles in rocks via acid rain. This flows into the ocean by way of erosion due to rivers and glaciers. The ocean floor has rifts that create new ocean floor, while at another end, older sea floor gets buried into the earth's internal core at subduction fault zones, thus feeding the volcanic activity. In typical flowing writing style, Shubin identifies how the collision of India into the Tibetan landmass led to the formation of the Himalayan range, an activity so profound in its absorption of carbon from the air, that it led to steady declines in the world's temperature, thus leading to the Ice Ages.This book nicely pulls together facts available from other sources - but it excels in its ability to intertwine all these discrete facts into a yarn that clearly and compellingly demonstrates our intimate connection to the universe around us. Besides, there is the passion of interbeing here, as Shubin succintly summarizes his story in ten quick chapters, accompanied by an exhaustive list of references for the more serious reader. As the universe changes, so do we. Sometimes these changes are catastrophic, as when the landmass pulled away from Antartica, transforming it very quickly into a teeming landscape of frozen ice instead of the greenery it once nurtured. In other cases, the changes are more gradual, but still going on. It gives special relevance to the Upanishadic quip: ""Tat tvam asi"" - that thou art.."

That connection begins at a single point 13.7 billion years ago.This book takes a big scientific fact and then links it back to life on Earth and our lives specifically. For example, the Big Bang created particles that exist on Earth and in living creatures today (including us). Along the way he tells the stories of scientists whose ""wacky theories"" just happened to be right and what happened in the process of proving them. Those personal stories, along with Shubin's own scientific exploration which is interspersed throughout the chapters, bring the science to a personal level and keep the reader engaged.I particularly enjoyed the fact that Shubin celebrates the science and connections without imposing any philosophical opinions on us. I have seen some complaining about his lack of concern about climate change and it was then that I realized how refreshing it was to just get the facts without the author's personal opinion as well.The book is only 240 pages so clearly it is an overview, but it is one with just enough details for those who, like me, have just a smattering of scientific knowledge. Note: I received this review copy from the Amazon Vine program."

Love that stuff, especially in overviews like this where I sometimes want more info.What I didn't like:- the interdisciplinary interweaving sometimes felt like mental ping-pong, which made it hard to maintain focus at times- I didn't get the point of all the portraits of dead science dudes. I don't care what they looked like or that they had a stare-down with a rattlesnake. However, this didn't bother me nearly as much as....- the whole thing about Marie Tharp, with long detailed descriptions about how her work as a scientist was basically belittled as ""girl talk"" and her career was eclipsed by that of her male supervisor (who ignored her ideas until she had ""mountains of data"" to prove her observations about underwater ridges that basically led to the conclusion that continental drift was a real thing) and Shubin not only never mentions that institutional sexism almost cost us major scientific insights, but feels the need to point out that Tharp's relationship with her supervisor/colleague was ""emotionally intense but entirely platonic."" Cue a moment of stabby rage in the middle of a book about happy sciencey things >_<"

We have such a deep connection to our environment, yet it doesnt feel like it? Through this book, I've felt like I've solidified a mysterious missing piece... a sort of lost-family connection. Seeing the development of the earth, then of land and sea, then of plants and animals... now humans and cities and etc... we have been given to see the world in SUCH a different way!

It was easy for me to follow and understand. In this book Neil Shubin had a way of making me the reader so interested and always wanting to know what was going to be around the corner. I love how he broke everything down, explaining the different scientists and how there different ideas originally came about. My only criticism for this book would be the fact that it didn't seem to flow as nicely as I would have liked, that did make it difficult to read. And although the information given was so interesting, I was a little disappointed that he didn't talk more about the connection between Homo sapiens and the Universe, it focused on geology allot more than I expected, when I first picked up the book I already had a pretty good Idea of what it he was going to be discussing, honestly I was way off. But regardless it was still well written and had loads of good information."

He wrote a book about that, which I quite enjoyed.The Universe Within is more generic pop-sci, which is a bit disappointing; it's certainly not bad pop-sci, but there's also little to set it apart from a hundred other such books. Still, if you're looking for a low-difficulty thing under two hundred pages about the history of life, you could do worse."

He is an engaging speaker, and so I look forward to the book."

The book jumps off to a pretty quick start and is a real smooth read. I would have liked to see a little more chemistry just to tie everything together a bit tighter. Also, I prefer footnotes that serve as little asides. Regardless, this is a great book for anyone who has an interest in science and is an effortless read. Nice work."

34,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5075000-gregg-sapp,3,"In college, when my roommate – a physics major, and therefore an authority – explained to me how the carbon atoms in my body had been fabricated in a supernova explosion some six billion years ago, it completely blew my mind. (Possibly, the impact was enhanced by controlled substances, but still…) We really were stardust, just like Joni Mitchell and the authors of the Vedas had written. “Wow” was all I could say.Reading Neil Shubin’s “The Universe Within: Discovering the Common History of Rocks, Planets, and People” reminded me of how delighted my roommate was to have been the agent of my revelation. Similarly, where Shubin writes that “There is something almost magical in the notion that our bodies, minds, and ideas have roots in the crust of the Earth, water of the oceans, and atoms in celestial bodies… We are but a recent link in a network of connections as old as the heavens,” he seems eager to take readers on a trip into virgin mindscapes. His earlier book, “Your Inner Fish,” explored how human beings, for all of their exalted intelligence, retain primitive, fish-like features in their bodies. He takes this theme of biological unity to the cosmic level in “The Universe Within.” Alas, maybe because I’m older and more jaded, but that revelation no longer inspires such breathtaking astonishment in me as it did in my halcyon undergraduate days. Of course, we are citizens of the universe, inhabiting a planet that formed according to physical process set ineluctably in motion during the Big Bang. What else could we be? It is the only universe we have and, thankfully, since we are here, there’s no other way that it could be. To me, “The Universe Within” functions better at the level of good storytelling than at either popular cosmology or existential philosophy. The author’s stories of his own expeditions in Greenland searching for fossils, or of the dedicated but under-appreciated women of earlier generations who cataloged stars, or of a researcher who tested their Circadian Rhythms by locking himself in a cave for months, or of a zoologist who tossed frogs off tall buildings to prove the feasibility of his theories of species dissemination... all of these tales edify, entertain, and focus attention on how science works, minus the transcendent, universalist palaver. If I could go back and give this book to my college–age self, I imagine he would’ve embraced ""The Universe Within"" with the fervor of a religious conviction. (For a time, I thought “The Tao of Physics” was far, freakin’ out, too.) They are the readers who will find truths worth pondering in “The Universe Within.” To those whose minds are yet to be blown, I recommend this book. "
35,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,3,"From my list of book reviews it will be blatantly obvious that I like non-fiction, especially non-fiction science books. I therefore naturally thought that The universe within by Neil Shubin would be a perfect match. A little bit of geology mixed with astronomy and evolution combined with reportedly good writing. It felt like a safe bet for me. I was wrong. Shubin starts out by describing a geological expedition to Greenland. It was indeed interesting to learn about the hardships associated with finding stones that were formed during the time you are interested in. Shubin quickly moves on (it is a rather short book) to state that all living creatures on earth are related to one another and then he also takes it one step further, saying that we are also related to distant stars because had it not been for supernovas of massive stars the elements on which life depends, would not have formed. This, I suppose, is a profound fact, but I guess that a few paragraphs is not sufficient to convey a feeling of awe.The book proceeds on a wild journey through space and evolution. Shubin writes about the origin of life and about the formation of stars as well as the entire universe. He frequently diverts from the main story (if there is one) and discusses other things such as the circadian rhythm. The part I personally found most interesting was the one about earth’s climate on a geological timescale. Did you know that before the Himalayas formed 40 million years ago (due to the collision of the Indian and Chinese landmasses), earth was considerably larger than it has been since then. At some points there were not even any ice caps over Antarctica. The Himalayas, Shubin explains, drained carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which was flushed into the oceans which in turn reduced the greenhouse effect of our atmosphere which cooled earth. We should expect more such drastic changes of the earth’s climate in the future and we better hope that we humans are able to adapt to such changes. This is not a bad book but I feel that if suffers from trying to cover too broad an area in too few pages. It reminds me of when my supervisor was going to give a talk about “cognition and evolution”, which he felt was already stretching what you could cram into one talk. The arrangers however felt that this was too modest, can’t we change the title to cogntion, evolution, and the cosmos to raise interest? I don’t know how that episode ended but I can imagine that, like this book, the result would lack focus."
36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18653872-steve-wiggins,3,"This is one of those books that tries to fit the whole universe in. I'd read Shubin's previous book, Your Inner Fish, and decided to give this one a try. It is full of diverse information that sometimes makes it a little hard to follow. I'm a fan of paleontology, and I guess I was expecting a bit more of that here. The book starts with an expedition about which it would be interesting to hear. It then shifts to the Big Bang and starts to narrate how we are all related to the history of the universe at an atomic level. Taking immense eras at a time, Shubin considers the origin of the elements that make our physical bodies, the development of life on earth, and on down to our own age.Plenty of interesting things emerge along the way. The globe is slowing down in its rotations. Our bodies need darkness as well as light. We share structures with both flies and fish. He talks about the origin of extinction and how this was a brand new idea, born only of human learning how to kill off entire species of animals.My sense is that Shubin intended for this to be a hopeful book. It struck me, however, as being somewhat somber. When I read that our planet had only about a billion years left, I felt a wave of panic. I know the universe will expire in its own heat-death trillions of years from now, if current scientific understanding is correct. But billions now seem so small, vast as they may be for a human lifespan. It made me stop and wonder.I wrote a little more about this book here: Sects and Violence in the Ancient World. There is also a review of his previous book if you care to read about it as well."

His first, Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body was great!

(Possibly, the impact was enhanced by controlled substances, but still…) We really were stardust, just like Joni Mitchell and the authors of the Vedas had written. “Wow” was all I could say.Reading Neil Shubin’s “The Universe Within: Discovering the Common History of Rocks, Planets, and People” reminded me of how delighted my roommate was to have been the agent of my revelation. Similarly, where Shubin writes that “There is something almost magical in the notion that our bodies, minds, and ideas have roots in the crust of the Earth, water of the oceans, and atoms in celestial bodies… We are but a recent link in a network of connections as old as the heavens,” he seems eager to take readers on a trip into virgin mindscapes. His earlier book, “Your Inner Fish,” explored how human beings, for all of their exalted intelligence, retain primitive, fish-like features in their bodies. He takes this theme of biological unity to the cosmic level in “The Universe Within.” Alas, maybe because I’m older and more jaded, but that revelation no longer inspires such breathtaking astonishment in me as it did in my halcyon undergraduate days. Of course, we are citizens of the universe, inhabiting a planet that formed according to physical process set ineluctably in motion during the Big Bang. What else could we be? It is the only universe we have and, thankfully, since we are here, there’s no other way that it could be. To me, “The Universe Within” functions better at the level of good storytelling than at either popular cosmology or existential philosophy. The author’s stories of his own expeditions in Greenland searching for fossils, or of the dedicated but under-appreciated women of earlier generations who cataloged stars, or of a researcher who tested their Circadian Rhythms by locking himself in a cave for months, or of a zoologist who tossed frogs off tall buildings to prove the feasibility of his theories of species dissemination... all of these tales edify, entertain, and focus attention on how science works, minus the transcendent, universalist palaver. If I could go back and give this book to my college–age self, I imagine he would’ve embraced ""The Universe Within"" with the fervor of a religious conviction. (For a time, I thought “The Tao of Physics” was far, freakin’ out, too.) They are the readers who will find truths worth pondering in “The Universe Within.” To those whose minds are yet to be blown, I recommend this book. "
65,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,3,"From my list of book reviews it will be blatantly obvious that I like non-fiction, especially non-fiction science books. I therefore naturally thought that The universe within by Neil Shubin would be a perfect match. A little bit of geology mixed with astronomy and evolution combined with reportedly good writing. It felt like a safe bet for me. I was wrong. Shubin starts out by describing a geological expedition to Greenland. It was indeed interesting to learn about the hardships associated with finding stones that were formed during the time you are interested in. Shubin quickly moves on (it is a rather short book) to state that all living creatures on earth are related to one another and then he also takes it one step further, saying that we are also related to distant stars because had it not been for supernovas of massive stars the elements on which life depends, would not have formed. This, I suppose, is a profound fact, but I guess that a few paragraphs is not sufficient to convey a feeling of awe.The book proceeds on a wild journey through space and evolution. Shubin writes about the origin of life and about the formation of stars as well as the entire universe. He frequently diverts from the main story (if there is one) and discusses other things such as the circadian rhythm. The part I personally found most interesting was the one about earth’s climate on a geological timescale. Did you know that before the Himalayas formed 40 million years ago (due to the collision of the Indian and Chinese landmasses), earth was considerably larger than it has been since then. At some points there were not even any ice caps over Antarctica. The Himalayas, Shubin explains, drained carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which was flushed into the oceans which in turn reduced the greenhouse effect of our atmosphere which cooled earth. We should expect more such drastic changes of the earth’s climate in the future and we better hope that we humans are able to adapt to such changes. This is not a bad book but I feel that if suffers from trying to cover too broad an area in too few pages. It reminds me of when my supervisor was going to give a talk about “cognition and evolution”, which he felt was already stretching what you could cram into one talk. The arrangers however felt that this was too modest, can’t we change the title to cogntion, evolution, and the cosmos to raise interest? I don’t know how that episode ended but I can imagine that, like this book, the result would lack focus."
66,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18653872-steve-wiggins,3,"This is one of those books that tries to fit the whole universe in. I'd read Shubin's previous book, Your Inner Fish, and decided to give this one a try. It is full of diverse information that sometimes makes it a little hard to follow. I'm a fan of paleontology, and I guess I was expecting a bit more of that here. The book starts with an expedition about which it would be interesting to hear. It then shifts to the Big Bang and starts to narrate how we are all related to the history of the universe at an atomic level. Taking immense eras at a time, Shubin considers the origin of the elements that make our physical bodies, the development of life on earth, and on down to our own age.Plenty of interesting things emerge along the way. The globe is slowing down in its rotations. Our bodies need darkness as well as light. We share structures with both flies and fish. He talks about the origin of extinction and how this was a brand new idea, born only of human learning how to kill off entire species of animals.My sense is that Shubin intended for this to be a hopeful book. It struck me, however, as being somewhat somber. When I read that our planet had only about a billion years left, I felt a wave of panic. I know the universe will expire in its own heat-death trillions of years from now, if current scientific understanding is correct. But billions now seem so small, vast as they may be for a human lifespan. It made me stop and wonder.I wrote a little more about this book here: Sects and Violence in the Ancient World.

(Possibly, the impact was enhanced by controlled substances, but still…) We really were stardust, just like Joni Mitchell and the authors of the Vedas had written. “Wow” was all I could say.Reading Neil Shubin’s “The Universe Within: Discovering the Common History of Rocks, Planets, and People” reminded me of how delighted my roommate was to have been the agent of my revelation. Similarly, where Shubin writes that “There is something almost magical in the notion that our bodies, minds, and ideas have roots in the crust of the Earth, water of the oceans, and atoms in celestial bodies… We are but a recent link in a network of connections as old as the heavens,” he seems eager to take readers on a trip into virgin mindscapes. His earlier book, “Your Inner Fish,” explored how human beings, for all of their exalted intelligence, retain primitive, fish-like features in their bodies. He takes this theme of biological unity to the cosmic level in “The Universe Within.” Alas, maybe because I’m older and more jaded, but that revelation no longer inspires such breathtaking astonishment in me as it did in my halcyon undergraduate days. Of course, we are citizens of the universe, inhabiting a planet that formed according to physical process set ineluctably in motion during the Big Bang. What else could we be? It is the only universe we have and, thankfully, since we are here, there’s no other way that it could be. To me, “The Universe Within” functions better at the level of good storytelling than at either popular cosmology or existential philosophy. The author’s stories of his own expeditions in Greenland searching for fossils, or of the dedicated but under-appreciated women of earlier generations who cataloged stars, or of a researcher who tested their Circadian Rhythms by locking himself in a cave for months, or of a zoologist who tossed frogs off tall buildings to prove the feasibility of his theories of species dissemination... all of these tales edify, entertain, and focus attention on how science works, minus the transcendent, universalist palaver. If I could go back and give this book to my college–age self, I imagine he would’ve embraced ""The Universe Within"" with the fervor of a religious conviction. (For a time, I thought “The Tao of Physics” was far, freakin’ out, too.) They are the readers who will find truths worth pondering in “The Universe Within.” To those whose minds are yet to be blown, I recommend this book. "
95,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,3,"From my list of book reviews it will be blatantly obvious that I like non-fiction, especially non-fiction science books. I therefore naturally thought that The universe within by Neil Shubin would be a perfect match. A little bit of geology mixed with astronomy and evolution combined with reportedly good writing. It felt like a safe bet for me. I was wrong. Shubin starts out by describing a geological expedition to Greenland. It was indeed interesting to learn about the hardships associated with finding stones that were formed during the time you are interested in. Shubin quickly moves on (it is a rather short book) to state that all living creatures on earth are related to one another and then he also takes it one step further, saying that we are also related to distant stars because had it not been for supernovas of massive stars the elements on which life depends, would not have formed. This, I suppose, is a profound fact, but I guess that a few paragraphs is not sufficient to convey a feeling of awe.The book proceeds on a wild journey through space and evolution. Shubin writes about the origin of life and about the formation of stars as well as the entire universe. He frequently diverts from the main story (if there is one) and discusses other things such as the circadian rhythm. The part I personally found most interesting was the one about earth’s climate on a geological timescale. Did you know that before the Himalayas formed 40 million years ago (due to the collision of the Indian and Chinese landmasses), earth was considerably larger than it has been since then. At some points there were not even any ice caps over Antarctica. The Himalayas, Shubin explains, drained carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which was flushed into the oceans which in turn reduced the greenhouse effect of our atmosphere which cooled earth. We should expect more such drastic changes of the earth’s climate in the future and we better hope that we humans are able to adapt to such changes. This is not a bad book but I feel that if suffers from trying to cover too broad an area in too few pages. It reminds me of when my supervisor was going to give a talk about “cognition and evolution”, which he felt was already stretching what you could cram into one talk. The arrangers however felt that this was too modest, can’t we change the title to cogntion, evolution, and the cosmos to raise interest? I don’t know how that episode ended but I can imagine that, like this book, the result would lack focus."
96,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18653872-steve-wiggins,3,"This is one of those books that tries to fit the whole universe in. I'd read Shubin's previous book, Your Inner Fish, and decided to give this one a try. It is full of diverse information that sometimes makes it a little hard to follow. I'm a fan of paleontology, and I guess I was expecting a bit more of that here. The book starts with an expedition about which it would be interesting to hear. It then shifts to the Big Bang and starts to narrate how we are all related to the history of the universe at an atomic level. Taking immense eras at a time, Shubin considers the origin of the elements that make our physical bodies, the development of life on earth, and on down to our own age.Plenty of interesting things emerge along the way. The globe is slowing down in its rotations. Our bodies need darkness as well as light. We share structures with both flies and fish. He talks about the origin of extinction and how this was a brand new idea, born only of human learning how to kill off entire species of animals.My sense is that Shubin intended for this to be a hopeful book. It struck me, however, as being somewhat somber. When I read that our planet had only about a billion years left, I felt a wave of panic. I know the universe will expire in its own heat-death trillions of years from now, if current scientific understanding is correct. But billions now seem so small, vast as they may be for a human lifespan. It made me stop and wonder.I wrote a little more about this book here: Sects and Violence in the Ancient World. There is also a review of his previous book if you care to read about it as well."
97,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"Disclaimer: I really do not find either Geology or Geography especially interesting and this book is about both.That said, I really learned a lot from Neil Shubin's second book. His first, Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body was great! The first book is about evolution, DNA, etc. This sequel goes into the history and makeup of the cosmos and the evolution of the physical world. These are directly related to our evolution and definitely tie into the concepts of climate change, human's impact on the planet, future resources, etc.I gave this book only 4 stars because I did not find it as quite as entertaining and easy to read as his first one. (Note that the disclaimer above could contribute to this.) My theory is that he had so much material to cover in X number of pages that he left out a lot of the stories and self reflection that I enjoyed so much in his first book.One of the best features of this book is the Further Ending and Notes. More than a bibliography, Shubin goes chapter by chapter showing where his material came from and where both scientists and non-scientists could read more about any particular topic. This is a fantastic reference source for teacher and students as well as a reading list for us ""life long learners""."

How did everything come to be? Why does the universe function the way it does? Is there any connection between the human body and the universe we were drawn from? If any of these questions have ever floated through your head...this is the book for you. The works that Neil Shubin covers range from the rotation of the planets to how the mammal brain perceives time to firsthand accounts of his archeology digs and how his discoveries relate to other planets in and past our solar system. I found this book a bit difficult to get into at first, but once I was a few pages in, I was captured by Shubin's tales and explanations. Some passages are written with such learned vocabulary that I had to reread them, but once I could comprehend the message, I was in awe. Not only in awe of the subjects but also of how Shubin is able to explain and put a new twist on how things connect in our world. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone with an itch of curiosity about the universe, the earth, and people. It is an eye-opening read!"

Especially interesting for someone who has a deep interest, and hopefully also already some background, in geology, paleontology and cosmology. The author writes in a clear, concise yet engaging manner, interweaving events and phenomena in the universe and the Earth's history in order to draw links on how we, and many things living and non-living, came to be the way they are today. He aims for a self-assured audience, which I appreciate, since nowadays there are too many overly watered-down, 'pop-culture' type books attempting to explain so-called complex science to the uninitiated. That said, don't be afraid to jump right into it even if you may not be well-versed with the jargon (there's always Wikipedia).I wish I could give it 5 stars, but there are parts where he fails to provide a compelling link from one section to the next. This is of course entirely cosmetic noting the nature and content of this book.Overall, a wonderful book with interesting anecdotes, with a remarkable tone of playfulness and sense of humour."

Interesting-ish, but little of it is new to me, and what is new is poorly explained. And he ping pongs all the hell over the place. I feel like I'm trying to have a conversation with a really brilliant toddler with an attention disorder. He keeps asserting things and either explaining them 40 pages later or never mentioning them again. It just wasn't a fun read, nor nearly as enlightening as I suspect it could have been.(He also seems determined not see institutional sexism.) "

It is a good book on interesting and unique advances in history that take you from the birth of the universe to the late 20th century. Shubin is focused on history and discovery, through big topics like how exploding stars give the universe the elements necessary to make galaxies, planets, and us. He usually discusses a topic by introducing the leading scientist and how he or she brought about the discovery in question. This method repeats for many of the major evolutionary developments in the cosmos or our planet. Some of the discussions seem a little random, but they are all very interesting. Whether it's exploding stars, how plate tectonics were discovered, or the expeditions that drilled cores in the earth to give us understanding on the five extinction events, they are all interesting.

The author uses geology as a way to introduce and tie together lots of different ideas from the creation of the cosmos to how global temperatures have impacted DNA. Shubin makes complicated topics easy to understand and has a knack for recognizing what part of subject is most interesting to generalists. What I loved about the book was the science history that got included. The author talks extensively about the individual scientists involved with the major discoveries, including their loves, their passions, their feuds. It's amazing how some major discoveries go unnoticed for decades because the scientist who discovered them didn't have the charisma to charm people into believing his/her idea. If you like science writing or geology, I definitely recommend this book. "

It's actually about that surrounding universe affecting, even creating, that within. “Written inside us is the birth of the stars, the movement of heavenly bodies across the sky, even the origin of days themselves.” Why is the Earth tilted? Better question, how has that affected the Earth and its life over the millennia. Many questions result in more than answers: the answers creep out into a web that establishes and sustains the face of the Earth and the DNA crawling on it. It's an easy read in that I've covered some of this territory before, but it's very well written. Along with some new concepts it has certainly deepened my appreciation of how complex and amazing it is that we exist here at all."

The book makes me appreciate our existence in the world. It is not just a random accident that we are in a friendly environment for human being but it is a mechanism and support from different forces. The book is a little difficult to read because it has used some scientific explanation. However, it feeds the curiosity about the foundation of the universe. This is one of the best book I have ever read. "

(Possibly, the impact was enhanced by controlled substances, but still…) We really were stardust, just like Joni Mitchell and the authors of the Vedas had written. “Wow” was all I could say.Reading Neil Shubin’s “The Universe Within: Discovering the Common History of Rocks, Planets, and People” reminded me of how delighted my roommate was to have been the agent of my revelation. Similarly, where Shubin writes that “There is something almost magical in the notion that our bodies, minds, and ideas have roots in the crust of the Earth, water of the oceans, and atoms in celestial bodies… We are but a recent link in a network of connections as old as the heavens,” he seems eager to take readers on a trip into virgin mindscapes. His earlier book, “Your Inner Fish,” explored how human beings, for all of their exalted intelligence, retain primitive, fish-like features in their bodies. He takes this theme of biological unity to the cosmic level in “The Universe Within.” Alas, maybe because I’m older and more jaded, but that revelation no longer inspires such breathtaking astonishment in me as it did in my halcyon undergraduate days. Of course, we are citizens of the universe, inhabiting a planet that formed according to physical process set ineluctably in motion during the Big Bang. What else could we be? It is the only universe we have and, thankfully, since we are here, there’s no other way that it could be. To me, “The Universe Within” functions better at the level of good storytelling than at either popular cosmology or existential philosophy. The author’s stories of his own expeditions in Greenland searching for fossils, or of the dedicated but under-appreciated women of earlier generations who cataloged stars, or of a researcher who tested their Circadian Rhythms by locking himself in a cave for months, or of a zoologist who tossed frogs off tall buildings to prove the feasibility of his theories of species dissemination... all of these tales edify, entertain, and focus attention on how science works, minus the transcendent, universalist palaver. If I could go back and give this book to my college–age self, I imagine he would’ve embraced ""The Universe Within"" with the fervor of a religious conviction. (For a time, I thought “The Tao of Physics” was far, freakin’ out, too.) They are the readers who will find truths worth pondering in “The Universe Within.” To those whose minds are yet to be blown, I recommend this book. "
155,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,3,"From my list of book reviews it will be blatantly obvious that I like non-fiction, especially non-fiction science books. I therefore naturally thought that The universe within by Neil Shubin would be a perfect match. A little bit of geology mixed with astronomy and evolution combined with reportedly good writing. It felt like a safe bet for me. I was wrong. Shubin starts out by describing a geological expedition to Greenland. It was indeed interesting to learn about the hardships associated with finding stones that were formed during the time you are interested in. Shubin quickly moves on (it is a rather short book) to state that all living creatures on earth are related to one another and then he also takes it one step further, saying that we are also related to distant stars because had it not been for supernovas of massive stars the elements on which life depends, would not have formed. This, I suppose, is a profound fact, but I guess that a few paragraphs is not sufficient to convey a feeling of awe.The book proceeds on a wild journey through space and evolution. Shubin writes about the origin of life and about the formation of stars as well as the entire universe. He frequently diverts from the main story (if there is one) and discusses other things such as the circadian rhythm. The part I personally found most interesting was the one about earth’s climate on a geological timescale. Did you know that before the Himalayas formed 40 million years ago (due to the collision of the Indian and Chinese landmasses), earth was considerably larger than it has been since then. At some points there were not even any ice caps over Antarctica. The Himalayas, Shubin explains, drained carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which was flushed into the oceans which in turn reduced the greenhouse effect of our atmosphere which cooled earth. We should expect more such drastic changes of the earth’s climate in the future and we better hope that we humans are able to adapt to such changes. This is not a bad book but I feel that if suffers from trying to cover too broad an area in too few pages.

184,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5075000-gregg-sapp,3,"In college, when my roommate – a physics major, and therefore an authority – explained to me how the carbon atoms in my body had been fabricated in a supernova explosion some six billion years ago, it completely blew my mind. (Possibly, the impact was enhanced by controlled substances, but still…) We really were stardust, just like Joni Mitchell and the authors of the Vedas had written. “Wow” was all I could say.Reading Neil Shubin’s “The Universe Within: Discovering the Common History of Rocks, Planets, and People” reminded me of how delighted my roommate was to have been the agent of my revelation. Similarly, where Shubin writes that “There is something almost magical in the notion that our bodies, minds, and ideas have roots in the crust of the Earth, water of the oceans, and atoms in celestial bodies… We are but a recent link in a network of connections as old as the heavens,” he seems eager to take readers on a trip into virgin mindscapes. His earlier book, “Your Inner Fish,” explored how human beings, for all of their exalted intelligence, retain primitive, fish-like features in their bodies. He takes this theme of biological unity to the cosmic level in “The Universe Within.” Alas, maybe because I’m older and more jaded, but that revelation no longer inspires such breathtaking astonishment in me as it did in my halcyon undergraduate days. Of course, we are citizens of the universe, inhabiting a planet that formed according to physical process set ineluctably in motion during the Big Bang. What else could we be? It is the only universe we have and, thankfully, since we are here, there’s no other way that it could be. To me, “The Universe Within” functions better at the level of good storytelling than at either popular cosmology or existential philosophy. The author’s stories of his own expeditions in Greenland searching for fossils, or of the dedicated but under-appreciated women of earlier generations who cataloged stars, or of a researcher who tested their Circadian Rhythms by locking himself in a cave for months, or of a zoologist who tossed frogs off tall buildings to prove the feasibility of his theories of species dissemination... all of these tales edify, entertain, and focus attention on how science works, minus the transcendent, universalist palaver. If I could go back and give this book to my college–age self, I imagine he would’ve embraced ""The Universe Within"" with the fervor of a religious conviction. (For a time, I thought “The Tao of Physics” was far, freakin’ out, too.) They are the readers who will find truths worth pondering in “The Universe Within.” To those whose minds are yet to be blown, I recommend this book. "
185,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,3,"From my list of book reviews it will be blatantly obvious that I like non-fiction, especially non-fiction science books. I therefore naturally thought that The universe within by Neil Shubin would be a perfect match. A little bit of geology mixed with astronomy and evolution combined with reportedly good writing. It felt like a safe bet for me. I was wrong. Shubin starts out by describing a geological expedition to Greenland. It was indeed interesting to learn about the hardships associated with finding stones that were formed during the time you are interested in. Shubin quickly moves on (it is a rather short book) to state that all living creatures on earth are related to one another and then he also takes it one step further, saying that we are also related to distant stars because had it not been for supernovas of massive stars the elements on which life depends, would not have formed. This, I suppose, is a profound fact, but I guess that a few paragraphs is not sufficient to convey a feeling of awe.The book proceeds on a wild journey through space and evolution. Shubin writes about the origin of life and about the formation of stars as well as the entire universe. He frequently diverts from the main story (if there is one) and discusses other things such as the circadian rhythm. The part I personally found most interesting was the one about earth’s climate on a geological timescale. Did you know that before the Himalayas formed 40 million years ago (due to the collision of the Indian and Chinese landmasses), earth was considerably larger than it has been since then. At some points there were not even any ice caps over Antarctica. The Himalayas, Shubin explains, drained carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which was flushed into the oceans which in turn reduced the greenhouse effect of our atmosphere which cooled earth. We should expect more such drastic changes of the earth’s climate in the future and we better hope that we humans are able to adapt to such changes. This is not a bad book but I feel that if suffers from trying to cover too broad an area in too few pages. It reminds me of when my supervisor was going to give a talk about “cognition and evolution”, which he felt was already stretching what you could cram into one talk. The arrangers however felt that this was too modest, can’t we change the title to cogntion, evolution, and the cosmos to raise interest? I don’t know how that episode ended but I can imagine that, like this book, the result would lack focus."
186,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18653872-steve-wiggins,3,"This is one of those books that tries to fit the whole universe in. I'd read Shubin's previous book, Your Inner Fish, and decided to give this one a try. It is full of diverse information that sometimes makes it a little hard to follow. I'm a fan of paleontology, and I guess I was expecting a bit more of that here. The book starts with an expedition about which it would be interesting to hear. It then shifts to the Big Bang and starts to narrate how we are all related to the history of the universe at an atomic level. Taking immense eras at a time, Shubin considers the origin of the elements that make our physical bodies, the development of life on earth, and on down to our own age.Plenty of interesting things emerge along the way. The globe is slowing down in its rotations. Our bodies need darkness as well as light. We share structures with both flies and fish. He talks about the origin of extinction and how this was a brand new idea, born only of human learning how to kill off entire species of animals.My sense is that Shubin intended for this to be a hopeful book. It struck me, however, as being somewhat somber. When I read that our planet had only about a billion years left, I felt a wave of panic. I know the universe will expire in its own heat-death trillions of years from now, if current scientific understanding is correct. But billions now seem so small, vast as they may be for a human lifespan. It made me stop and wonder.I wrote a little more about this book here: Sects and Violence in the Ancient World. There is also a review of his previous book if you care to read about it as well."
187,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"Disclaimer: I really do not find either Geology or Geography especially interesting and this book is about both.That said, I really learned a lot from Neil Shubin's second book. His first, Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body was great! The first book is about evolution, DNA, etc. This sequel goes into the history and makeup of the cosmos and the evolution of the physical world. These are directly related to our evolution and definitely tie into the concepts of climate change, human's impact on the planet, future resources, etc.I gave this book only 4 stars because I did not find it as quite as entertaining and easy to read as his first one. (Note that the disclaimer above could contribute to this.) My theory is that he had so much material to cover in X number of pages that he left out a lot of the stories and self reflection that I enjoyed so much in his first book.One of the best features of this book is the Further Ending and Notes. More than a bibliography, Shubin goes chapter by chapter showing where his material came from and where both scientists and non-scientists could read more about any particular topic. This is a fantastic reference source for teacher and students as well as a reading list for us ""life long learners""."

How did everything come to be? Why does the universe function the way it does? Is there any connection between the human body and the universe we were drawn from? If any of these questions have ever floated through your head...this is the book for you. The works that Neil Shubin covers range from the rotation of the planets to how the mammal brain perceives time to firsthand accounts of his archeology digs and how his discoveries relate to other planets in and past our solar system. I found this book a bit difficult to get into at first, but once I was a few pages in, I was captured by Shubin's tales and explanations. Some passages are written with such learned vocabulary that I had to reread them, but once I could comprehend the message, I was in awe. Not only in awe of the subjects but also of how Shubin is able to explain and put a new twist on how things connect in our world. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone with an itch of curiosity about the universe, the earth, and people. It is an eye-opening read!"

Especially interesting for someone who has a deep interest, and hopefully also already some background, in geology, paleontology and cosmology. The author writes in a clear, concise yet engaging manner, interweaving events and phenomena in the universe and the Earth's history in order to draw links on how we, and many things living and non-living, came to be the way they are today. He aims for a self-assured audience, which I appreciate, since nowadays there are too many overly watered-down, 'pop-culture' type books attempting to explain so-called complex science to the uninitiated. That said, don't be afraid to jump right into it even if you may not be well-versed with the jargon (there's always Wikipedia).I wish I could give it 5 stars, but there are parts where he fails to provide a compelling link from one section to the next. This is of course entirely cosmetic noting the nature and content of this book.Overall, a wonderful book with interesting anecdotes, with a remarkable tone of playfulness and sense of humour."

Interesting-ish, but little of it is new to me, and what is new is poorly explained. And he ping pongs all the hell over the place. I feel like I'm trying to have a conversation with a really brilliant toddler with an attention disorder. He keeps asserting things and either explaining them 40 pages later or never mentioning them again.

It is a good book on interesting and unique advances in history that take you from the birth of the universe to the late 20th century. Shubin is focused on history and discovery, through big topics like how exploding stars give the universe the elements necessary to make galaxies, planets, and us. He usually discusses a topic by introducing the leading scientist and how he or she brought about the discovery in question. This method repeats for many of the major evolutionary developments in the cosmos or our planet. Some of the discussions seem a little random, but they are all very interesting. Whether it's exploding stars, how plate tectonics were discovered, or the expeditions that drilled cores in the earth to give us understanding on the five extinction events, they are all interesting.

The author uses geology as a way to introduce and tie together lots of different ideas from the creation of the cosmos to how global temperatures have impacted DNA. Shubin makes complicated topics easy to understand and has a knack for recognizing what part of subject is most interesting to generalists. What I loved about the book was the science history that got included. The author talks extensively about the individual scientists involved with the major discoveries, including their loves, their passions, their feuds. It's amazing how some major discoveries go unnoticed for decades because the scientist who discovered them didn't have the charisma to charm people into believing his/her idea. If you like science writing or geology, I definitely recommend this book. "

It's actually about that surrounding universe affecting, even creating, that within. “Written inside us is the birth of the stars, the movement of heavenly bodies across the sky, even the origin of days themselves.” Why is the Earth tilted? Better question, how has that affected the Earth and its life over the millennia. Many questions result in more than answers: the answers creep out into a web that establishes and sustains the face of the Earth and the DNA crawling on it. It's an easy read in that I've covered some of this territory before, but it's very well written. Along with some new concepts it has certainly deepened my appreciation of how complex and amazing it is that we exist here at all."

Of course, we are citizens of the universe, inhabiting a planet that formed according to physical process set ineluctably in motion during the Big Bang. What else could we be? It is the only universe we have and, thankfully, since we are here, there’s no other way that it could be. To me, “The Universe Within” functions better at the level of good storytelling than at either popular cosmology or existential philosophy. The author’s stories of his own expeditions in Greenland searching for fossils, or of the dedicated but under-appreciated women of earlier generations who cataloged stars, or of a researcher who tested their Circadian Rhythms by locking himself in a cave for months, or of a zoologist who tossed frogs off tall buildings to prove the feasibility of his theories of species dissemination... all of these tales edify, entertain, and focus attention on how science works, minus the transcendent, universalist palaver. If I could go back and give this book to my college–age self, I imagine he would’ve embraced ""The Universe Within"" with the fervor of a religious conviction. (For a time, I thought “The Tao of Physics” was far, freakin’ out, too.) They are the readers who will find truths worth pondering in “The Universe Within.” To those whose minds are yet to be blown, I recommend this book. "

It was indeed interesting to learn about the hardships associated with finding stones that were formed during the time you are interested in. Shubin quickly moves on (it is a rather short book) to state that all living creatures on earth are related to one another and then he also takes it one step further, saying that we are also related to distant stars because had it not been for supernovas of massive stars the elements on which life depends, would not have formed. This, I suppose, is a profound fact, but I guess that a few paragraphs is not sufficient to convey a feeling of awe.The book proceeds on a wild journey through space and evolution. Shubin writes about the origin of life and about the formation of stars as well as the entire universe. He frequently diverts from the main story (if there is one) and discusses other things such as the circadian rhythm. The part I personally found most interesting was the one about earth’s climate on a geological timescale. Did you know that before the Himalayas formed 40 million years ago (due to the collision of the Indian and Chinese landmasses), earth was considerably larger than it has been since then. At some points there were not even any ice caps over Antarctica. The Himalayas, Shubin explains, drained carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which was flushed into the oceans which in turn reduced the greenhouse effect of our atmosphere which cooled earth. We should expect more such drastic changes of the earth’s climate in the future and we better hope that we humans are able to adapt to such changes. This is not a bad book but I feel that if suffers from trying to cover too broad an area in too few pages. It reminds me of when my supervisor was going to give a talk about “cognition and evolution”, which he felt was already stretching what you could cram into one talk. The arrangers however felt that this was too modest, can’t we change the title to cogntion, evolution, and the cosmos to raise interest?

It is a good book on interesting and unique advances in history that take you from the birth of the universe to the late 20th century. Shubin is focused on history and discovery, through big topics like how exploding stars give the universe the elements necessary to make galaxies, planets, and us. He usually discusses a topic by introducing the leading scientist and how he or she brought about the discovery in question. This method repeats for many of the major evolutionary developments in the cosmos or our planet. Some of the discussions seem a little random, but they are all very interesting. Whether it's exploding stars, how plate tectonics were discovered, or the expeditions that drilled cores in the earth to give us understanding on the five extinction events, they are all interesting. "

The author uses geology as a way to introduce and tie together lots of different ideas from the creation of the cosmos to how global temperatures have impacted DNA. Shubin makes complicated topics easy to understand and has a knack for recognizing what part of subject is most interesting to generalists. What I loved about the book was the science history that got included. The author talks extensively about the individual scientists involved with the major discoveries, including their loves, their passions, their feuds. It's amazing how some major discoveries go unnoticed for decades because the scientist who discovered them didn't have the charisma to charm people into believing his/her idea. If you like science writing or geology, I definitely recommend this book. "

It's actually about that surrounding universe affecting, even creating, that within. “Written inside us is the birth of the stars, the movement of heavenly bodies across the sky, even the origin of days themselves.” Why is the Earth tilted? Better question, how has that affected the Earth and its life over the millennia. Many questions result in more than answers: the answers creep out into a web that establishes and sustains the face of the Earth and the DNA crawling on it. It's an easy read in that I've covered some of this territory before, but it's very well written. Along with some new concepts it has certainly deepened my appreciation of how complex and amazing it is that we exist here at all."

The book makes me appreciate our existence in the world. It is not just a random accident that we are in a friendly environment for human being but it is a mechanism and support from different forces. The book is a little difficult to read because it has used some scientific explanation. However, it feeds the curiosity about the foundation of the universe.

Similarly, where Shubin writes that “There is something almost magical in the notion that our bodies, minds, and ideas have roots in the crust of the Earth, water of the oceans, and atoms in celestial bodies… We are but a recent link in a network of connections as old as the heavens,” he seems eager to take readers on a trip into virgin mindscapes.

274,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5075000-gregg-sapp,3,"In college, when my roommate – a physics major, and therefore an authority – explained to me how the carbon atoms in my body had been fabricated in a supernova explosion some six billion years ago, it completely blew my mind. (Possibly, the impact was enhanced by controlled substances, but still…) We really were stardust, just like Joni Mitchell and the authors of the Vedas had written. “Wow” was all I could say.Reading Neil Shubin’s “The Universe Within: Discovering the Common History of Rocks, Planets, and People” reminded me of how delighted my roommate was to have been the agent of my revelation. Similarly, where Shubin writes that “There is something almost magical in the notion that our bodies, minds, and ideas have roots in the crust of the Earth, water of the oceans, and atoms in celestial bodies… We are but a recent link in a network of connections as old as the heavens,” he seems eager to take readers on a trip into virgin mindscapes. His earlier book, “Your Inner Fish,” explored how human beings, for all of their exalted intelligence, retain primitive, fish-like features in their bodies. He takes this theme of biological unity to the cosmic level in “The Universe Within.” Alas, maybe because I’m older and more jaded, but that revelation no longer inspires such breathtaking astonishment in me as it did in my halcyon undergraduate days. Of course, we are citizens of the universe, inhabiting a planet that formed according to physical process set ineluctably in motion during the Big Bang. What else could we be? It is the only universe we have and, thankfully, since we are here, there’s no other way that it could be. To me, “The Universe Within” functions better at the level of good storytelling than at either popular cosmology or existential philosophy. The author’s stories of his own expeditions in Greenland searching for fossils, or of the dedicated but under-appreciated women of earlier generations who cataloged stars, or of a researcher who tested their Circadian Rhythms by locking himself in a cave for months, or of a zoologist who tossed frogs off tall buildings to prove the feasibility of his theories of species dissemination... all of these tales edify, entertain, and focus attention on how science works, minus the transcendent, universalist palaver. If I could go back and give this book to my college–age self, I imagine he would’ve embraced ""The Universe Within"" with the fervor of a religious conviction. (For a time, I thought “The Tao of Physics” was far, freakin’ out, too.) They are the readers who will find truths worth pondering in “The Universe Within.” To those whose minds are yet to be blown, I recommend this book. "
275,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46255232-anders-rasmussen,3,"From my list of book reviews it will be blatantly obvious that I like non-fiction, especially non-fiction science books. I therefore naturally thought that The universe within by Neil Shubin would be a perfect match. A little bit of geology mixed with astronomy and evolution combined with reportedly good writing. It felt like a safe bet for me. I was wrong. Shubin starts out by describing a geological expedition to Greenland. It was indeed interesting to learn about the hardships associated with finding stones that were formed during the time you are interested in. Shubin quickly moves on (it is a rather short book) to state that all living creatures on earth are related to one another and then he also takes it one step further, saying that we are also related to distant stars because had it not been for supernovas of massive stars the elements on which life depends, would not have formed. This, I suppose, is a profound fact, but I guess that a few paragraphs is not sufficient to convey a feeling of awe.The book proceeds on a wild journey through space and evolution. Shubin writes about the origin of life and about the formation of stars as well as the entire universe. He frequently diverts from the main story (if there is one) and discusses other things such as the circadian rhythm. The part I personally found most interesting was the one about earth’s climate on a geological timescale. Did you know that before the Himalayas formed 40 million years ago (due to the collision of the Indian and Chinese landmasses), earth was considerably larger than it has been since then. At some points there were not even any ice caps over Antarctica. The Himalayas, Shubin explains, drained carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which was flushed into the oceans which in turn reduced the greenhouse effect of our atmosphere which cooled earth. We should expect more such drastic changes of the earth’s climate in the future and we better hope that we humans are able to adapt to such changes. This is not a bad book but I feel that if suffers from trying to cover too broad an area in too few pages. It reminds me of when my supervisor was going to give a talk about “cognition and evolution”, which he felt was already stretching what you could cram into one talk. The arrangers however felt that this was too modest, can’t we change the title to cogntion, evolution, and the cosmos to raise interest? I don’t know how that episode ended but I can imagine that, like this book, the result would lack focus."
276,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18653872-steve-wiggins,3,"This is one of those books that tries to fit the whole universe in. I'd read Shubin's previous book, Your Inner Fish, and decided to give this one a try. It is full of diverse information that sometimes makes it a little hard to follow. I'm a fan of paleontology, and I guess I was expecting a bit more of that here. The book starts with an expedition about which it would be interesting to hear. It then shifts to the Big Bang and starts to narrate how we are all related to the history of the universe at an atomic level. Taking immense eras at a time, Shubin considers the origin of the elements that make our physical bodies, the development of life on earth, and on down to our own age.Plenty of interesting things emerge along the way. The globe is slowing down in its rotations. Our bodies need darkness as well as light. We share structures with both flies and fish. He talks about the origin of extinction and how this was a brand new idea, born only of human learning how to kill off entire species of animals.My sense is that Shubin intended for this to be a hopeful book. It struck me, however, as being somewhat somber. When I read that our planet had only about a billion years left, I felt a wave of panic. I know the universe will expire in its own heat-death trillions of years from now, if current scientific understanding is correct. But billions now seem so small, vast as they may be for a human lifespan. It made me stop and wonder.I wrote a little more about this book here: Sects and Violence in the Ancient World. There is also a review of his previous book if you care to read about it as well."
277,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62352876-richard,4,"Disclaimer: I really do not find either Geology or Geography especially interesting and this book is about both.That said, I really learned a lot from Neil Shubin's second book. His first, Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body was great! The first book is about evolution, DNA, etc. This sequel goes into the history and makeup of the cosmos and the evolution of the physical world. These are directly related to our evolution and definitely tie into the concepts of climate change, human's impact on the planet, future resources, etc.I gave this book only 4 stars because I did not find it as quite as entertaining and easy to read as his first one. (Note that the disclaimer above could contribute to this.) My theory is that he had so much material to cover in X number of pages that he left out a lot of the stories and self reflection that I enjoyed so much in his first book.One of the best features of this book is the Further Ending and Notes. More than a bibliography, Shubin goes chapter by chapter showing where his material came from and where both scientists and non-scientists could read more about any particular topic. This is a fantastic reference source for teacher and students as well as a reading list for us ""life long learners""."

How did everything come to be? Why does the universe function the way it does? Is there any connection between the human body and the universe we were drawn from? If any of these questions have ever floated through your head...this is the book for you. The works that Neil Shubin covers range from the rotation of the planets to how the mammal brain perceives time to firsthand accounts of his archeology digs and how his discoveries relate to other planets in and past our solar system. I found this book a bit difficult to get into at first, but once I was a few pages in, I was captured by Shubin's tales and explanations. Some passages are written with such learned vocabulary that I had to reread them, but once I could comprehend the message, I was in awe.

The author writes in a clear, concise yet engaging manner, interweaving events and phenomena in the universe and the Earth's history in order to draw links on how we, and many things living and non-living, came to be the way they are today. He aims for a self-assured audience, which I appreciate, since nowadays there are too many overly watered-down, 'pop-culture' type books attempting to explain so-called complex science to the uninitiated. That said, don't be afraid to jump right into it even if you may not be well-versed with the jargon (there's always Wikipedia).I wish I could give it 5 stars, but there are parts where he fails to provide a compelling link from one section to the next.

The book mostly focuses on Earth science, continental drift, global warming, planet formation and the existence of water in the solar system.Shubin attempts to mimic Bill Bryson's writing style but falls flat.

The book includes some nice illustrations, a section of further reading and note, acknowledgements, illustration credit, and an index. Very interesting read. Recommended. Very accessible."
