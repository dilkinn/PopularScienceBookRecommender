Einstein felt that way too, but there is a vast difference between Mr. Leonard and Einstein; most of Einstein's work could be for the most part tested in short order. The only detail left was gravitational waves which took instruments 100 years of development before being ready to capture their existence. With string theory the time scale before technology is advanced enough to test could be greater than the life of the universe. And of course if SUSY is not found at the LHC then string theory is so mathematically flexible that you can just claim ""not enough energy"". Maybe that is what Penrose is pissed at. The math puts forth unproven models as for example extra dimensions. No one sees this as puzzling but there is a huge chasm and string theorists fail to see it. Extra dimensions require faith. No way around it. The same faith one has in believing in a standard religion (I am all for religion). Religion transcends the physical but so do extra dimensions. They assume a fourth or fifth spatial dimension is as real as 3 dimensions without a physical way of seeing, feeling, testing or even imagining it. How is that for faith?  If you're into shitty arguments regarding Black Holes, read on. "
1,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"People like unified, completed pictures, and science books tend to go for that approach, typically some version of the Hero's Journey: the heroic scientist (sometimes also the narrator) encounters the fiendish problem, bravely engages it, goes through many trials and setbacks, perseveres, and eventually triumphs. But real life is messier. You're never at all sure what's going on while you're in the middle of the fight, and quite often you aren't even sure if you've won or not. This book pretends to be a Hero's Journey, but it's pretty clear that in fact it isn't. I enjoyed it for the opposite reason: it effectively conveyed the confusion and uncertainty of these would-be heroic enterprises, where you don't know who's a good guy and who's a bad guy, whether you're making progress or going backwards, whether your idea is a brilliant flash of inspiration or the most complete bullshit.We're somewhere in the middle of a transition period in physics, where people are painfully trying to sort out the contradictions inherent in the 20th century's two great breakthroughs, relativity and quantum mechanics. They just won't fit together. The story in The Black Hole War follows one thread, which engaged the attention of many of the world's best physicists for decades and is still anything but resolved. What happens when an observer falls into a black hole? What happens to the faint Hawking radiation that the black hole emits? Is information destroyed in this process, or somehow just very effectively scrambled? To what extent do observers outside the black hole see the same thing as observers falling into it? Black holes, it turns out, combine aspects of relativity and quantum mechanics in ways which do not allow people to ignore their mutual inconsistencies. Thinking about them is a kind of spiritual exercise, which one day may lead us to a new understanding of the most fundamental ideas in physics.Susskind does a good job of conveying the frustration of grappling with these extraordinarily treacherous questions. He has a long drawn out series of skirmishes with Stephen Hawking, where he tries to convince him of the correctness of his point of view and meets with determined resistance. Hawking eventually capitulates, as far as I can see mostly from exhaustion, to a bizarre argument which seems anything but conclusive. My understanding is that it's already been more or less dismissed, and the Black Hole War, far from ending in a victory for Susskind's faction, is still going on. But I didn't feel cheated; I understand more clearly now what the issues are in this strange conflict, and I'll be better placed to follow the dispatches from the front lines. Thank you Len, fine battlefield reporting.________________________[And on further consideration...]There's a claimed paradox which plays a major part in this book, and has been mentioned extensively elsewhere. Consider, says Susskind, what happens to an astronaut who falls into a very large black hole. From the point of view of someone a long way from the black hole, the astronaut will be fried to a crisp as they get closer to the event horizon. But from astronaut's own point of view, they will be fine. Since the black hole is very large, tidal forces will not be strong at the event horizon, and the Principle of Equivalence means that they won't notice anything special happening. This paradox is dramatized in the short story ""Don't Forget Your Antigravity Pills"".Well... Susskind says he gets plenty of crank mail from people who write to tell him they have black hole paradoxes all figured out. I am reluctant to join this unhappy band, but there is an obvious point I'm surprised not to see highlighted, and it's not mentioned either on any of the pages I found when I googled ""what happens when you fall into a black hole"". Tidal forces aren't the only thing that might kill you when you are in the extreme situation of falling into a supermassive black hole! There is also the problem of your velocity, which, as far as I can see, asymptotically approaches the speed of light as you near the event horizon. That means that any light travelling towards you will be blue-shifted to higher and higher frequencies, which only fail to become infinite because the quantum nature of light means that it will arrive as a finite number of discrete photons. We know there will be some such photons, due to Hawking radiation. The last few photons you get hit by before you reach the event horizon should have truly enormous energies - quite high enough that you will get burned to a crisp from your own perspective. What's wrong with this argument?Okay, okay, Professor Susskind... you pass my ""good philosophy"" test. That was such an interesting question that I have to start playing too. You win, and I'm giving you an extra star to show I mean it."
2,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a very good, engaging book about the frontiers of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, and how these fields apply to the physics of black holes. The basic question at the heart of the book is whether information is lost as a particle is entrapped by the horizon of a black hole. On the one hand, Stephen Hawking and many other physicists claimed that information was, in fact, lost. On the other side, Leonard Susskind claimed that information was not lost. The entire issue was seemingly wrapped up in a paradox. Information should be conserved, but some simple thought experiments lead one to believe that it is not conserved. Leonard Susskind was nonplussed by the nonchalant attitude of so many followers of Stephen Hawking, in believing that information conservation does not hold for black holes.Susskind went to battle at scientific conferences, in explaining the apparent paradox. He argued that there should be a complementarity principle with regards to the viewpoint of an observer relative to a black hole. This is similar to the complementarity principle for light as a particle or a wave. Light can be observed either as a particle or a wave, but not both simultaneously. Likewise, when a particle falls into a black hole, information can be seen to be discharged from the black hole by an observer outside its event horizon, or can be seen to fall into the black hole by an observer inside its event horizon. However, since an observer cannot be both inside and outside the event horizon at the same time, there is no paradox.Susskind has some funny anecdotes about the characters in his book. He writes a few humorous anecdotes about Stephen Hawking. I think the best anecdote was a conversation that Susskind had with Dutch physicist Gerard t'Hooft. Susskind said, ""I completely agree with you!"" and t'Hooft replied, ""well, I completely disagree with you!""I did not read this book. I listened to the audiobook, as narrated by Ray Porter. The narration is wonderful, especially the rendition of the story about an emperor who punishes ""Steve and his family"" to a quick end by black hole. Steve is not worried, for he believes that he could continue to live to old age after entering the event horizon. Ray Porter makes the story really come to life with the hilarious accents and dramatic reading."
3,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"Okay, I need to face facts: I'm a physics geek. I may not be brilliant on all that math stuff, but I have a pretty good intuitive feel for all the big and a lot of the really small questions. Just don't ask me to actually DO the math.So after all these fun-filled years of grabbing all the popular science books by all the great names in physics today, I revel in all the conflicting theories and directions that they take.Sometimes, they can get bitter and protracted, and other times... friendly, if still intractable. This particular book had a little of it all. But about what? Susskind VS Hawking square-off about BLACK HOLES. Specifically, whether or not entropy is, in fact, happening on the other side of the Schwarzschild radius. The war is over now and Hawking had backstepped in the early 2000's, but it still meant that two camps of physicists were up in arms against each other about whether information COULD actually be lost in the special conditions of a Black Hole.From the start to the end of this book, I was hooked. It FELT like we were on the stage of a grand debate. Susskind always felt like he was on the losing side, but you know how those niggling doubts are. Conflict, losses, concessions, brief respites, and ultimate vindication. It's all here. :) Fun. :)Yeah, but what about the science? Oh? You want to know about that? Well in the spaces of these years, we went from total loss of information and not just scrambled information (information being any kind of physical state in the universe) to a discovery of a cool little idea that states that if you add information (matter or energy) into a Singularity, it will either A: get bigger by at least a Plank or B: heat up. We must incorporate the little idea that the information of a holographic universe is contained on the SURFACE of any kind of container and not its volume. Cool, right? Well, things get better once we start introducing String Theory. :) Susskind makes one hell of a narrative here. I love reading about all these great men battling it out over long stretches of time and visiting each other amiably and still holding on to their positions for their lives. The point is... none of them knew who was going to be right. The battle was the thing. And in the end, it was the very real and fundamental conflicts on a pure science level that pushed everyone to new heights. :) And we got to see it. :)Very fun."
4,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,1,"Light on ""science"" and heavy on ""popular"", this is the kind of ""popular science"" that makes me cringe.The Black Hole War is a book that fears offending any reader by asking them to think for an entire chapter. Genuinely interesting yet shallow islands of physics are sprinkled in a vast sea of mundane travel stories, idle cultural speculations, and weakly veiled self-aggrandizement.The central physical question of the book, the black hole information paradox, is a very fascinating issue that has led to powerful new ideas (such as the holographic principle) and offered new insights into old ones (such as information and entropy). Unfortunately, this ""central physical question"" is spread so thinly over the book's 400+ pages that potential readers will likely save much time and boredom by instead referring to the Wikipedia links above.Two important caveats though:1) I listened to this on audiobook on long runs and in the gym. Your experience may vary.2) Leonard Susskind is an excellent lecturer and his free video lectures on everything from Hamiltonian mechanics to special relativity to quantum mechanics are some of the best available. So he can be a great communicator of physics when he tries."
5,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7697369-claudio-arena,5,"An amazing book.It needs to be said, that this is not for everybody. Even if Leonard Susskind does a perfect job to explain even the more difficult concepts, what he talks about is still incredibly complex.It needs to be read by somebody that has the basis for physics (but not too much: high school physics is enough to follow the reasoning), and is used to scientific reasoning.That said, I would say this book is one of the few that classify still as not being technical (as I said before, you don't need to have a degree to read it), but still treats complex, high-level and current problems in physics. It's not like most of Stephen Hawking books: for the public, but regarding things that are fundamental in physics.I found it rare to have a book like this.The book is sometime hard to follow, and I got the impression that in the hope to be very clear on everything, and to explain it all, the authors put even too many things, and it was hard to remember all.Anyway, the authors refresh concepts every now and then, and guide you by the hand through the book. Really fascinating and interesting, if you're patient enough to read this and assimilate the concepts.Really really recommended to any science fan, or physics student. It might also be a good guide for refreshing some concepts, and think about them in different ways if you're taking a degree in Physics. "
6,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"Chapter 1 - In 1981, Hawkings postulates that information is lost in black holes.Chapter 2 - Black holes and the horizon at the Shwartzchild radius described. Einstein rejected black holes. Tidal forces are less at the horizon of large black holes. Einstein Equivalence Principle states that the effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable.Chapter 3 - Reimann proposed that space may be curved, an idea incorporated into General Relativity. Minkowski space incorporates space and time, with a world line representing the path of an object. Einstein discovered time dilation where rapidly moving clocks slow down. General Theory of Relativity states that objects move straight ahead through space-time. If space is curved, the object follows. Gravitational force is the curvature of space-time. John Wheeler proposed wormholes but they would stay open for so short a time that even light could not pass through. Einstein discovered (General Theory of Relativity) gravitational red shift where clocks slow down near a heavy mass.Chapter 4 - Duality of light - not only wavelike but particle like - Einstein 1905. Planck constant h = 6.62 x 10 exp -34.. Information conservation, or reversibility, states that given the present, one can construct the future and the past. Quantum Mechanics respects the conservation of information. Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle states that the greater the certainty of velocity, the lesser the certainty of position. m delta v delta x > h. When a system is derived of all energy it is in ground state. QM, however, states that particles are still in motion - zero point motion or the quantum jitters. Energy of a photon E = hf. In Quantum Field Theory, the path of a particle is a propagator. A split, such as in the release of a particle, is a vertex.Chapter 5 - Planck found that if c, G (Newtons gravitational constant) and h are set to one, three fundamental Planck units result. The Planck length is very small (10 exp -35 m.), much smaller than a proton. Planck time (10 exp -42 sec) is very small, being the time it takes light to traverse the Planck length. Planck mass is about that of a dust mote. The energy equivalent is about equal to a tank of gasoline. The Planck length, time and mass are the size, half-life and mass of the smallest possible black hole.Chapter 6 - The question of how black holes decay. A possibility is that quantum fluctuations would allow a piece of the horizon to fly away.Chapter 7 - Equivalence of chemical, potential, kinetic and thermal energy. Conservation of energy is the First Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law states that entropy always increases. Entropy is a measure of the number of arrangements that conform to some specific recognizable criterion. Entropy is hidden information. Entropy increases because we lose track of the details over time. The smallest size containing a bit of information is a Planck length. Maximum amount of information that can be put into a region of space is equal to the area of the region, not the volume.Chapter 8 - John Wheeler stated that black holes have no hair, meaning the horizon was smooth. Adding one bit of information to a black hole increases its horizon by one square Planck length. Entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of the horizon.Chapter 9 - Black holes have temperature which is inversely proportional to their size. Black holes are black bodies - they reflect no light. Black holes emit photons and therefore evaporate. A black hole the mass of the moon would be 1 deg K. One the mass of a boulder would be a billion billion deg. Photon emission from a BH is Hawking radiation. Hawking calculates that the entropy of a BH equals one quarter of the horizon area, measured in Planck units.Chapter 10 - Hawking states that when a BH evaporates, the trapped bits of information disappear from the universe.Chapter 11 - Particle collisions are described by an S or scattering matrix, which is reversible. Hawking invented the not S matrix or dollar matrix which is not reversible.Chapter 12 - Surrounding space is warmer than astronomical BH's, so they are still gathering mass rather than evaporating, although the evaporation rate is very slow. Einstein Equivalence Principle - the effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable from one another.Chapter 13 - Susskind Antigravity Pill paradox where characters fall through a BH horizon. Apparently they are destroyed and emitted as evaporation products as required by QM. But apparently they also pass safely through the horizon as predicted by the Equivalence Principle.Chapter 14 - The possibility that a BH horizon is covered with quantum copying machines so that evaporation and passage are both possible. However, a quantum copying machine is not possible as it would violate Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.Chapter 15 - A BH stretched horizon is one Planck distance above the horizon. It is an energetic, hot layer. Susskind proposes complementarity whereby both alternatives of the paradox are true. No paradox because the observers on the inside and outside can never meet, so each story is true in it's own zone of reference.Chapter 16 - It requires increasingly short wavelength (high energy) photons to observe smaller particles. As an atom falls closer to a horizon, it requires increasingly high energy photons to resolve them. So as the atom falls to the horizon, it becomes increasingly blurred and appears to spread out over the horizon.Chapter 17 - About Cambridge, religion and Hawkings.Chapter 18 - The Holographic Principle - the contents of space are actually a holographic representation of the information on the area bounding that space. Perhaps all space / the universe is a hologram, coded on a distant two dimensional space.Chapter 19 - String Theory - We do not know whether this model actually represents the real world. However, it is consistent with the real world and does allow theories to be tested for consistency.Hadrons are nucleons, mesons and glueballs. Nucleons are protons and neutrons.As you spin a nucleon, the energy increases in proportion to the angular momentum, but in steps. An electron cannot be spun.Energetic nucleons are stringlike objects, made up of quarks and gluons. The simplest hadron is a meson, composed of a quark, an anti-quark joined by a stringlike gluon. Open strings, such as mesons, have ends, but there can also be closed strings. Nucleons are 3 quarks joined by a Y shaped string. Another hadron, the closed string or glueball, has no quarks.The mathematical theory of quarks and gluons is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Quarks are elementary particles with six flavors - up, down, strange, charmed, bottom and top. All quarks come in three colours - blue, green and red.Gluons have positive and negative poles, and each has a color - R, B or G. Therefore, nine types of gluon are possible. The propagator of a gluon has two sides corresponding to the two poles - each side is R, B or G. At a vertex, or split, each side must be consistent - e.g. a BR can split into BG - GR.While string theory applied to hadrons is well accepted, fundamental strings associated with gravity at Plank scales are not. The graviton is the primary fundamental string.Electrical and gravitational forces create waves. Hence, gravitational waves. Gravitons are conjecture. Any particle can emit a graviton, even other gravitons.Possibly, fundamental and QCD strings are the same objects at different scales.Fundamental strings require 9 dimensions. The 6 extra dimensions are compacted into geometric spaces called Calabi Yau Manifolds. Feyman theorized that electrical force is due to particles continually emitting and absorbing photons - photon exchange. Also, all matter continually emits and absorbs gravitons. Fundamental strings spawn off and absorb tiny strings - these are the gravitons.The string theory of gravity is not fully described but appears to be the best mathematical model of quantum gravity.Chapter 20 - As things slow down, more structure comes into view. Much structure cannot be seen due to cosmic jitter. Perhaps particles are much larger than thought.Chapter 21 - Going up the mass scale beyond elementary particles, are conjectural collections called superpartners, grand unification partners and string excitations. These range to the Planck mass. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) should see superpartners. T' Hooft speculates that the spectrum of particles extends beyond the Planck mass in the form of black holes. A 1 kg BH is a trillion times smaller than a proton.Strings, such as those making up photons, have temperature and entropy.The entropy of a BH is proportional to the area of the horizon, and therefore the square of the mass.Strings can cross each other, normally passing through each other. A small probability (the string coupling constant) exists that they split and re-arrange. This is how small strings are formed at a horizon, producing Hawking radiation.If an electron is dropped into a BH, it becomes charged. A charge on a BH pushes the horizon out from the singularity. If enough charge exists to balance the graviton, you have an extremal BH.Polchinski discovered D-branes, a membrane on which fundamental strings can end. These turn out to fill a large mathematical hole in String Theory. The use of D-5 branes for the extra dimensions, D-1 branes for the normal dimensions, and fundamental strings allowed the math to be developed for an extremal BH showing that the entropy = one quarter of the horizon area. Also allowed the math of the evaporation process to be developed. This clinched the argument that BH are storage containers for information, not eaters of information.Chapter 22 - De Sitter space is a four dimensional (4 + 1) space with positive curvature that satisfies Einstein's equations. It is becoming important in cosmology.Anti De Sitter (ADS) space is similar, but with negative curvature. The space time curvature in ADS creates a gravitational field that pulls objects back to the center even if there is nothing there. If matter is added to an ADS space, a BH trapped in the space (like a box) results - a BTZ black hole.Strings on a stack of D-branes are governed by the same rules as those that govern gluons in QCD. Maldacena showed that a three dimensional world with gravity is equivalent to a two dimensional quantum hologram on the boundary of space.Witten showed that a BH in ADS must be equivalent to something on the surface bounding the the space - a hot fluid of gluons.Chapter 23 - The Holographic Principle states that everything that takes place in ADS (4+1) is describable by a mathematical theory with fewer dimensions. Quantum gravity in ADS is mathematically equivalent to QCD.If an ADS space is modified to a Q space with both a UV (small scale) brane and an IR (large scale) brane, particles near the UV brane act like fundamental strings while those near the IR brane act like nuclear particles. The possibility is that fundamental particles and nuclear particles are really the same objects in different areas of space. The hot quark soup produced in nuclear collision events has an unexpected very low viscosity, as does a BH horizon.Nuclear physics may allow String Theory to be tested. Conversely, String Theory may be applicable to nuclear evenets.Chapter 24 - It appears that the cosmological constant is non zero - 10 exp -123 in Planck units. Einstein had originally included an extra term in his equations, called the cosmological term. The constant (Greek lambda) creates a repulsive force if negative; attractive if positive. Eventually, Einstein set it to zero, eliminating it from his equations, and calling it his biggest mistake.A cosmic horizon exists at 15 billion light years where the universe is receding from earth at the speed of light. This cosmic horizon may be analagous to BH horizon."
7,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2615958-j,2,"A good introduction to the debate in physics regarding on whether information was lost when it entered a black hole. This was a big deal because conservation of entropy would thereby be threatened if this was, in fact, the case. The current physical theory indicates that this is not so.I dislike how the emphasis of this book seems to be on this nebulous concept of ""information"" instead of in the physical states themselves from which this ""information"" is deduced. The world is made up of physical objects on which ""information"" can be coded by means of differing physical configurations of said physical objects. But it is the physical objects, it seems to me, that are the primary ones and about whom physics can be done. It may be mathematically and conceptually easier to think of these physical configurations as containing ""information"", but said ""information"" cannot exist apart from the physical objects in their respective configurations. Thus, it is not ""information"" which gets or doesn't get lost when it enters a black hole, but rather an ensemble of physical particles in particular configurations.The book also mentions the holographic duality principle: wherein all the physical happenings on a particular chunk of space can be coded on any surface which surrounds said chunk of space. Using this principle, the author claims that the universe is a hologram, with the real physics going on at the boundary of space-time. But this claim goes too far, I think. Just because we can recover (some of) the physical information about solid objects from shadows on a wall does not mean that the shadows are more real or have primacy over the solid 3-dimentional objects. Why do physicists want to make this jump and state that the real physics is happening at the boundary while the things going on inside the volume are as incorporeal as a hologram? Why is it not the other way around?Mildly interesting book, if you can ignore those two confusions."
8,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/558430-toni-daugherty,4,"Could the King of physics be wrong about black holes? For 30 years Hawking and Susskind debated whether or not information disappears once it is sucked into a black hole. I commend Susskind for his courage not in debating Hawking, but in explaining concepts like Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Gravity, and String Theory to regular people like me. If you want to learn more about your universe and you don't want to spend a lot of time on the math - this is the book.These black hole ideas are important because if Hawking is right and information really does disappear once the black hole evaporates then we too disappear - erased forever! One day we will all be at the horizon of a black hole and eventually at the singularity - and sucked in! Once that black hole takes in more ""information"" (stuff) than it can hold, it begins to evaporate - as it sucks in more & more stuff - cuz the gravity won't quit. It becomes so dense that it begins to expand (evaporate) & information is lost - according to Hawking. Susskind proves his own argument (theoretically) using Gerardus 'et Hoofts ""holographic principle"" and Hawking is forced to make a statement that gives Susskind victory (once Suskind proves the math). This book is a twisty, unexpected, real-life story about real people who set physics on a new path. You'll learn physics terms and a lot about influential people who changed the way we see the world today."
9,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50206516-fabio-kung,5,"All I wanted was to take a peek on our modern understanding of quantum gravity and black holes. This book gave me exactly that. And more!If you are looking for in-depth details and advanced math, I would say it is probably not for you. For non-physicists like me, this was a fantastic introduction on what we currently know about quantum gravity and its relation with other areas of science. As a bonus, it also (finally) helped me start grasping string theory, and better understand entropy, the event horizon (complementarity, information paradox) and the holographic principle.Great book. Highly recommended if you are curious on what's beyond the Standard Model and what questions some of most brilliant physicists are trying to answer."
10,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836306-isk,4,"Started a year ago, finally finished! Hate Susskind's writing -- shut the fuck up with your inane and bloated ""war"" metaphor that appears every other page. And no, you don't need to constantly remind that why you were always so sure you were right and that you couldn't believe all the other physicists were too dense to see why the war was important. But the cool physics is inside.Hawking: seemed to prove that information is irretrievably lost in a black hole. Also, empty space full of super-fleeting black holes that pop in and out of existence almost instantaneously (and these quickies do erase info).Susskind: WTF! Also, losing information = increasing entropy = generating heat, so empty space should be super hot.Einstein's equivalence principle: You can't distinguish between accelerating (e.g., in an elevator in space) and gravity. So, e.g., gravity bends light.Pollywog dumb hole-illustration of black holes: Doppler effect. The pollywog falling into the sinkhole does fall, but the pollywog watching the doomedee sees the doomedee taking an infinite amount of time to reach the horizon.Minkowski space and proper time: the proper time between two events along a worldline in Minkowski space is the amount of time passed according to a stopwatch that travels along that worldline. According to this proper time metric, a straight worldline between two events has the largest proper time!Quantum jitters: put a bunch of particles in a super-tiny box, and then cool the box down to absolute zero. Classically, you'd think that this means the particles have velocity zero, but by the Uncertainty Principle, these particles are jittering!Maximum amount of information allowable in a region of space is proportional to the *area* of that region, not the volume. Black holes can be thought of as regions of maximally compressed information.Bekenstein showed that adding one unit of entropy to a black hole (by sending a photon whose wavelength is equal to the radius of the horizon -- this ensures that all we know is that the photon is somewhere in the black hole, not where) increases the mass of the black hole such that the surface area of the horizon increases by one square Planck unit. So the entropy of a black hole (in bits) is proportional to the surface area of its horizon (in Planck units). But note that the horizon is supposed to be indistinguishable to someone passing through -- this disparity is fundamental to the BHW.It used to be thought that black holes of any fixed size were indistinguishable from one another. But Hawking showed that black holes have a temperature, and thus, that they must radiate electromagnetic radiation (i.e., photons) in the same way a hot black pot does, meaning it loses energy (and thus, by Einstein's equation) mass, and thus the size of the black hole must decrease.Two kinds of jitters: quantum jitters and thermal jitters (the latter are due to excess energy). Thermal jitters are due to real photons that bombard our skin and transfer energy to it; quantum jitters are due to virtual photon pairs which are created and then quickly disappear. One member of a virtual photon pair may be inside the horizon, while the other may be outside -- but someone outside the horizon can't see the photon trapped inside. So what someone near the horizon detects as quantum jitters will look like thermal jitters to someone outside the horizon.From Hawking's formula for the temperature of a black hole, temperature is inversely related to mass, so that smaller black holes are hotter and larger black holes are colder.But if black holes evaporate, what happens to the information that gets sucked into them? Hawking says that this information disappears. But to Susskind, this violates the law of information conservation, which he thinks is always satisfied. (The real-world is either perfectly deterministic -- such that if A -> B, then only A can go to B, and only B can follow from A -- or its quantum randomness is reversible (as long as we don't observe it)).Einstein's Principle of Relativity: physics is the same in all reference frames moving with uniform velocity relative to each other. But how can you make this compatible with Maxwell's Principle (that the speed of light is constant)? -- It seems like if you're also moving at the speed of light, then light should stand still. Also, Einstein's Equivalence Principle: the effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable.What happens to someone falling into a black hole? By quantum mechanics (and quantum jitters), an observer sees the poor dude evaporating as he crosses the horizon (since particles near the horizon must be super energetic, since after all they're escaping from a black hole!). By relativity and the Equivalence Principle, the person falling into the black hole survives until hitting the singularity. Which is right? Susskind says that this is black hole *complementarity* -- both are right, and it's not a contradiction, since nobody surviving the pass through the horizon can ever come out again and prove the observers wrong. (Complementarity, as in the complementary particle-wave nature of photons.)If a photon is trapped inside a box (say, by making the sides of the box mirrors), then as the box gets smaller, the photon's wavelength must also get smaller (since the photon's wavelength can't be larger than the sides of the box). This means that the energy in the box increases, so its max increases. So smaller is heavier.Holographic principle. There is a 2-dimensional (scrambled) representation of our 3-dimensional world for out on the boundaries (or beyond) of our universe. Why? Take any spherical region of space. The maximum amount of entropy this region of space can contain is given by the entropy of a black hole, which is proportional to the surface area of the black hole's horizon.How to tell whether a particle is elementary or not? One way: see if you can spin it. If so, then it's not elementary.String theory: there are two applications. One is 'large-scale'. Mesons are two quarks connected by a string made of gluons. Nucleons (= protons and neutrons) are three quarks connected by gluons. Quarks can come in six flavors (up, down, strange, charmed, bottom, top) and three colors (red, blue, green). Gluons have a positive and negative pole, and each pole has a color (red, blue, green). Glueballs are closed string-gluons without quarks. The other application is small-scale fundamental strings, and these are the ones causing all the excitement.We need six more *compact* dimensions of space in order to make the equations of string theory consistent. Compact means that as you travel along that dimension, you eventually return to the starting point. Think of one-dimension balls along a line -- and if you zoom in, you see that the line is actually a cylinder along which ants can travel in the transverse direction.One counterintuitive part of black hole complementarity: Alice, falling through the horizon, sees an atom fall through as well; Bob, observing Alice, sees the atom get destroyed and get spread throughout the horizon. How to reconcile? Think of plane propellers -- at first, all you see is the hub, but as you increase the shutter speed, you can make out the individual propellers. Next, imagine that on each propeller is another set of plane propellers revolving even faster, ad infinitum. If Alice flies along with such an airplane toward the horizon, she sees nothing but the central hub; but Bob, as his shutter speed increases, sees more and more of the propellers.Similarly, while in Quantum Field Theory we see progressively smaller things as we increase the shutter speed (e.g., first we see a blur of electric charge around a nucleus, then we see these resolve into electrons, etc.), in String Theory we see the strings get progressively larger (because we see the wild fluctuations and vibrations of the string)."
11,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,4,"""Science is a human affair, and during the painful struggles for new paradigms, opinions and emotions can be just as volatile as in any other human endeavor.""Leonard Susskind's expertise as a leading theoretical physicist is beyond dispute. He is skilled in teaching students at several levels: university college students; continuing-education adults (the heavy-math, nearly-legendary Theoretical Minimum series of lectures and books); and readers of popular science books (The Cosmic Landscape: String Theory and the Illusion of Intelligent Design is his other book, about his leadership role in String Theory.)Nevertheless, looking over some reviews, I am disturbed by the near animus some people have toward him and this book. What is the source of this?I suspect some criticism of The Black Hole War is misdirected at best, or is mere grandstanding by the reviewer. Before you pick up this book to read, be sure you have chosen correctly. This one is intended for smart people–of course—but without mathematics. If you are expecting a graduate-level course, and a deep understanding, this is not the book. For mathematical thoroughness, you may be interested in the same topic in his own online Theoretical Minimum course. Naturally, any modern textbook on general relativity is even better if you can handle it. But to pan this book as mind-numbingly simple is to miss the point of this book entirely.The Black Hole War is not a physics course, it is a personalized, practical history of discovery, of how the nuts and bolts of science work; how one, sometimes insecure, scientist participated in a modern ""paradigm shift."" Susskind is not shy to expose his joy of discovery, his envy of others, particularly Stephen Hawking, his frustration at being ignored, his outsized ego, and his fearless evangelization of the truth. In Susskind's mind, it was definitely war, even though it likely wasn't for most others.To appreciate Susskind's dramatic tale, he knows the reader must appreciate, if not understand, physics across the spectrum of classical mechanics, special and general relativity, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and cosmology. Since this book assumes none of that from the reader, he devotes the first 178 pages to a whirlwind tour of all those topics. It's highly readable, internally consistent and complete enough to understand the topic of the book...amazingly done without math, as is appropriate for the target audience. Of course, if you are a physicist or working scientist or just a really smart person, this 178-page preliminary overview will too simple for you—so just skip it! The purpose of this book is to tell the dramatic history of an exciting breakthrough in modern science, not to serve as a 4-year undergraduate course in Physics. To criticize it for not being so is simply stupid.Humor, and other non-scientific ""human"" elements are scattered throughout. Susskind doesn't spare us the droll jokes and anecdotes—most groaningly bad, which is his trademark. Also there are short asides on religion, politics, bits of amusing cultural criticism, and other non-scientific topics. These items may go a long way toward explaining why some readers—who basically need to lighten up—don't like this book. Then, he gives us his unabashed opinions of coworkers in the field. You'll know who he likes and doesn't like by the end.Susskind justifies his argumentative relationship with his key antagonist Stephen Hawking because he confidently thought Hawking to be terribly wrong on the main controversy: that information is irrecoverably destroyed inside a black hole. From this the major tension in the book arises: Susskind felt guilty attacking the most famous scientist in the world today. This guilt has two causes. Hawking had trouble ""fighting back"" because of his physical difficulties, so apparently obvious, but which also unmentionably hindered progress. Sometimes months, and years, passed before Hawking would address some criticism; by then Susskind and his fellows had resolved and moved far beyond the point in question. Some readers criticize Susskind for criticizing Hawking, themselves presumably resonating with this same guilt. Whatever the reason, scientific criticism is not personal, and this is one of the key lessons Susskind teaches in this book, really a characteristic of true science.Susskind's unease also stems from his own unconventional working-class background. He was a plumber (as was his father) before getting into physics rather late, initially through ""lesser"" institutions. He relates how this made him feel uncomfortable in the halls of Cambridge, for example. It took him some years before he felt the equal of his peers. Many readers feel that such details detract from, or even tarnish, the science. In a peer-reviewed paper that would be the case. Here in a book about teamwork and its resultant emotions, it is entirely relevant.To wrap: Is all this a display of authorial ego as many claim? Yes! Absolutely it is! And it's justified, since he is fair to others, honest with himself, true to intellectual principles—and scientifically right."
12,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2702139-rohith,5,"Science is boring work. Most scientific discoveries are a result of doing boring tasks meticulously. Since finding the true picture of Universe requires such laborious work, it is unfair to expect an average human to spend so much time, which is a luxury for many, to properly understand scientific discoveries. However, the urge to know what is happening in the Universe is strong in every human. Due to lack of time, many will take comfort in lazy explanations. Attention Span is a major impediment.So how do you communicate the scientific discoveries to laypeople? Talk in their own linguistic style. Once the people are connected and are familiar with the basic terms of the scientific theory, their own curiosity will drive them to read advanced books in that area, hopefully. And this is preciously what Leonard Susskind has done. Written in style of a travelogue/auto biography/human stories, this physicist from Stanford, tried to explain both Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics in order to describe the Information Paradox and how the Physicists finally solved the paradox. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who are confident about their high school physics knowledge. Even if you didn't understand the solution to the paradox, the analogies that were used to explain the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are very useful for further study or just appreciate the complexity. The war metaphors are what makes this book interesting. I certainly started reading the book only because I saw a chapter named ""Battle of Santa Barbara"" and decided to see what a battle means in Scientific Community :) "
13,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96664-samantha,2,"About 60% (and that's a conservative estimate) went over my head, despite Susskind's valiant effort to dumb it down. In a nutshell, he explains how he and a group of like-minded theoretical physicists ultimately proved Stephen Hawking wrong.What was the issue? Hawking said he had proven that information that enters a black hole is lost forever. Susskind disagreed, mainly because that would mean that one of the fundamental tenets of physics -- that matter is never destroyed -- would be wrong. And if that was true, then everything known about physics would have to be wrong, too.The book was fascinating (and elicited some funny looks from my friends when I showed them what I was reading) and I had to re-read a lot of it just to be able to follow along on the fringes of understanding. But the gist of it was that no, information is not lost forever in a black hole. It eventually escapes the black hole through quantum evaporations at the black hole's event horizon.Oh, and the entire universe is a hologram.I wish I could say I feel smarter now, but I don't. I do, however, realize why I didn't major in physics in college."
14,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1782531-mark,5,"An absolutely fascinating recounting of the process to reconcile our understanding of Einstein's General Relativity and gravity with Quantum Mechanics and the surprising discoveries in String Theory that made it possible. This reader has always been fascinated with physics and is always on the lookout for works like this that explore the current state of our understanding of the universe and how it works. The author does a masterful job of explaining complex concepts in simple terms using word pictures, thought experiments, and metaphors, and without resorting to the esoteric mathematics, except in the most general terms. I know that this is not for everyone (anybody?) but I thoroughly enjoyed this. The anecdotes, the humor, and the clear way the author presented the material kept me enthralled. Certainly not lightweight reading but, eminently entertaining nonetheless."
15,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10931399-hasher,5,"A really excellent book. Susskind is that rare breed of scientist with the ability to take incredibly complex concepts and make them intelligible to a lay reader. This book stands in sharp contrast to Hawking's 'A Brief History..' which, despite its popularity is very hard to grasp for an average person. I would say this is a must-read for anyone interested in learning about cutting edge concepts in Physics like Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Gravity, and String Theory which can be very hard to understand for a lay person through existing introductory literature. That the book basically tells the story of a bet between the author and Hawking on whether or not information is lost in black holes provides a human element to the difficult Physics concepts brilliantly explained within without recourse to complex mathematics. "
16,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,4,"Overall, I really liked it. Susskind's ""diss track"" (how Robyn referred to the book) on Stephen Hawking. The conflict was centered around Hawking's belief that information (in the physics context, any matter) absorbed into black holes is irretrievably lost forever, whereas Susskind and others believed that matter slowly radiates out of black holes. Susskind is an above-average science communicator and brought a lot of concepts to life - most of the book is accessible to a general audience with high school physics. The last 100 pages or so, I really struggled to comprehend the details about string theory, multiple dimensions... so the book's thrilling conclusion fell a bit flat for me. Still, really interesting read. A good one if you're into science books. "
17,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"One of the best popular physics books I have read in a long time. Leonard Susskind's The Black Hole War spends 450 pages focused on one question: what happens when information is absorbed by a black hole? It is a debate between Stephen Hawking and other general relativists who think that the information is lost and Gerard 't Hooft, Leonard Susskind and others, who are deeply uncomfortable with the conclusion that black holes can violate the second law of thermodynamics by reducing entropy.In the course of explaining this debate, Susskind necessarily goes through quantum mechanics, general relativity, string theory, and other areas of physics. And it is leavened with first person discussion of his personal odyssey and his obsession with Stephen Hawking, whose unvarnished portrait as epically arrogant and self-centered yet brilliant and charismatic is considerably more impressive than the pop culture version. The first person account not only makes for interesting reading it also lets you learn something about how science is advanced and debates are settled. Hawking posed his view in 1981. By 1993, there was significant theory/evidence that it was wrong but it still was not universally clear: at a conference in Santa Barbara the Susskind view prevailed in a 39-25 vote, not exactly the method most of us would recognize in determining universal scientific truths. By 2007 Hawking himself conceded in writing and paid a debt.What makes the book so good, however, is how much Susskind explains in a fundamental way, as close to first principals as possible. One of the remarkable results of the last few decades is that the amount of information stored in a black hole is proportional to its surface area, not its volume. Susskind shows how this result is derived by solving several equations, most of them explained or semi-derived in the text itself, ending with the remarkable result that almost all of the arbitrary constants cancel and you're left with what appears to be one of those fundamental equations that make you believe that physicists really have figured out some of the fundamental laws of nature.From explanations of Hawking radiation and Black Hole entropy, the book takes you through understanding why Hawking's view was so persuasive and the physical discoveries that were needed to overthrow it -- almost all of them generated by simple and profound thought experiments. The book shows that whether or not string theory is ""true,"" it still helps settle existing questions and generate new ones, including the fact that the world can be thought of us a hologram that has a dual in a lower-dimensional, gravity-less world.I felt myself following almost everything until the last quarter of the book, which focused on Quantum Chromodynamics and string theory. Not sure if my increasingly low comprehension rate was anything that could be remedied by Susskind or inherent in the material."
18,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"A while ago I read an essay by Susskind and put this book on my to read list. If I had known it was going to be the single best explanation I have yet encountered on the nature of black holes and the information paradox, I would have bumped it to the top of the list. If you are at all unclear about the following, this book is for you:- What is Alices experience as she passes the event horizon?- What is Bob's experience as he sees Alice enter the black hole?- If they have contradictory experiences, can both be true? - If so, how?- Is the event horizon actually a storage area for information? - If so, does that information get projected as matter (as the very reality we see around us), just like the eye projects an image in front of us?- Is the whole universe a hologram? Other authors have tackled these questions. Many have done well. I have to say that Susskind does very well. There are few books more exciting, more mind-bending, or clearer than Susskind's Black Hole War. If you have this on your to read list, it's worth putting at the top. A+This video covers some of what Susskind addresses in the book. It's a great accompaniment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR3Ms...Here is an interesting article about how, depending on the manner in which information is stored on the horizon, time can run forward or backward in a black hole. In this article, they suggest that the black holes already know the past and future before it is even formed. In fact, they argue that black holes knows everything you, or anything else in the universe, will ever do. Fun to think about. http://phys.org/news/2015-09-law-impl...At the end of the day, Susskind thinks string theory is correct. I have no idea what will come of Hoagn's research (see article below), but he suggests string theory is incorrect and posits that there are discrete units of quantum space (""chunky space). I am not sure what that will mean for our understanding of black holes. But it's a very exciting time in physics. So many wonderful debates and discoveries. http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/... "
19,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17219145-william,3,"3-stars here means: Fabulous subject matter, good pedagogy, and way too much of the authors voice. The rub: an investigation of black holes and their framework used to describe them (classical on one hand, QM on the other). Problems arise: information is destroyed according to Hawking, and Susskind is certain that, due to QM, this is wrong. 30 years of discoveries ensue, resulting in the all kinds of fun things like Anti-De Sitter Space, Extremal Black Holes, the ""expanded horizon"", Black Hole Complimentarity, and for lay readers, fun facts like:  - black holes are hot and evaporate (when the universe is colder than them, which it isn't...yet) - Planck Units are whack - Small things are heavy and big things are light (read the book) - Information is a function of surface area not volumeAND WHAT YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR— 3D Space is a hologram, aka the Holographic Principle. It's good stuff. Not much math, but so much is resting on faith already that one can hardly ask for some Calculus to be thrown in to make us feel cool. The explanations are strong. Susskind is obviously—and he admits this in the book—an egomaniac of monumental proportions. The result is that he is always showing how he knew things before everyone else, or knew the most important people. More annoyingly, he passes judgement on ALL of his fellow physicists in some way, describing their pro's and con's as people and scientists, and it gave me a distinctly icky feeling. The book fascinates, explains, and succeeds in spite of its author. "
20,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17814600-michael,3,"The Black Hole War is at times an autobiographical tale about the theoretical physics community, and at times a physics lesson. It introduces the minds, senses of humor, and egos of the great theoretical physicists of our time, and attempts to explain the ideas they contributed to the argument at hand.I enjoyed learning about the physicists themselves. Their personalities, competitive yet respectful spirit, and comradery were the highlights of the book. The most memorable bits are Susskind's musings on the ego, and on the meaning of Stephen Hawking's almost perpetual half-smile.However I paid special attention to the science lessons, since I enjoy that sort of thing. I found Susskind went to some lengths to keep the language in these explanations simple and accessible, but often enough he would seem to forget this mandate and begin to narrate in more obscure terms peculiar to physicists. The result was a sometimes confusing science lesson, with parts very interesting and mind-widening, and other parts during which I had to take a deep breath and gloss over things that were inaccessible to me.Overall, I would recommend Stephen Hawking's work before I would recommend Susskind, and not because of Hawking's larger celebrity. Susskind presents his mind and thoughts in a way that seems unedited. This makes The Black Hole War a more difficult read, but there is something to be said for the honesty and openness with which Susskind tells his tale."

Leonard Susskind I was in the physics section of the library, and this book caught my eye. I have to admit that the title was the major contributing factor that incited me to read this. Now I have a soft spot for quantum mechanics and string theory (not to mention puppies, kittens and cheesecake, but that's an entirely different matter) and so it's no surprise that I jumped at the opportunity to read this book. I am glad to say that professor Susskind did not disappoint. It was as if a friend was explaining these amazing concepts, which made the book feel like a once-in-a-lifetime lecture. The Black Hole War is filled with emotion, suspense and science, could you get a better combination? For the sake of clarification, the purpose of this book is not to humiliate Stephen Hawking (whose work I deeply enjoy). There isn't a ""haha-I-defeated-Stephen-Hawking"" bit, but a vivid a description of a true intellectual battle. Now just a warning, if you're not willing to follow vigorous concepts, analyse a number of laws and principles and ""rewire"" you brain for quantum mechanics, then this book is not for you. But if you are willing to take a chance, then stick with it because it's worth it!"
22,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4694528-amanda,4,"I found this book interesting, Susskind seems to be a bit egotistical, but it is my understanding that that is a common trait among physicists and seeing as his claim is finally winning the war with Stephen Hawking (a name in physics known even to the general populace) I don't suppose I can really fault him for that. This book isn't for the faint of heart, but if you have the time (and energy!) to put into comprehending strange abstract physics concepts (String Theory anyone?) then it can really be an entertaining read.I was somewhat disappointed in his adamant disbelief in God, mostly just because he bothered bringing it up at all. I felt like he was belittling faith in general while maintaining such a steadfast belief in his mathematics. It's not that I'm trying to say that mathematics is some mystical concept not to be taken seriously, but when you're doing math that requires adding six extra dimensions at a scale that in order to prove anything you would need a collider the size of the our galaxy, I think there is definitely an element of faith to that."

I cannot claim to understand much of what was written about in this book, but it is fun to try. This book was an interesting combination of the explanation of aspects of the quantum world and a story of great minds at opposite ends of theoretical beliefs trying to come to grips with their differences. I've read several ""physics for the non-physicist"" books, and this was one of the first that had this kind of human connection wrapped up in the mix. Echoing a quote from the book- ""We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.""

He tunes into focus the big picture of time, space and black holes as well as the elementary level of quarks and gluons. It was (somewhat) easy to follow, and fascinating to experience the thought experiments developed by physicists, past and present. Regardless of Susskind's accessibility and storytelling method of explaining complex thought, there were still elements that left me spinning. And the book is long. I was fried before I reached the end. I put it down, feeling stuffed like Thanksgiving. I couldn't take another bite. I think I've had my fill of physics for dummies. For quite some time."

30,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6977363-marjorie-thelen,5,"I found this book through Goodreads’ recommendations and since I hadn’t read Susskind before but had heard a lot about him, I wanted to read something he wrote. I requested the book through our local library and when I read the dust jacket I knew I was hooked. The title alone is a hook. The war was about Stephen Hawking’s attack on one of the most trusted principles of physics – the law of information conservation that says information is never lost. (p. 179, 180) Leonard Susskind, an American elementary particle physicist who teaches at Stanford, and Gerard ‘t Hooft, a Dutch physicist, were deeply disturbed about Hawking’s claim that once information crosses the horizon of a black hole it is lost forever. Susskind realized that this claim undermined the fundamental laws of physics and with Gerard ‘t Hooft, he went about disproving Hawking’s theory. What hooked me when I read the dust jacket was that in doing so, they arrived at the “mindbending conclusion that everything in our world – this book, your house, yourself – is a hologram projected from the farthest edges of space.” I read the book often not understanding what I was reading because I’m not mathematically adept. But Susskind is able with endless examples, drawings and prose to get his ideas across to the lay public. The glossary in the back of the book was very helpful. I liked the way his discussion and thinking is laid out in short, well titled sections. The “war” in itself was interesting to follow from Susskind’s prospective. He lays out Hawking’s arguments and then systematically disproves them. The book is jammed packed with insights into modern physics. Here are just a few of the ideas that I came away with that were helpful to me. They might get you thinking.•	Susskind said to memorize this: high energy means short wave-length; low energy means long wavelength. (82)•	Richard Feynman: “I think it’s safe to say that no one understands Quantum Mechanics.” (83)•	The Uncertainly Principle was the great divide that separated physics into pre-quantum classical era and post modern era of quantum weirdness. Classical physics is deterministic; quantum physics is full of uncertainty. The Uncertainty Principle, as developed by Werner Heisenberg who along with Erwin Schrodinger discovered the mathematics of quantum mechanics, says that any attempt to shrink the uncertainty of the position of an object will inevitably expand the uncertainty of the velocity. Or it is not possible to know both the position and the velocity of an object at the same time. (p. 92)•	Nature didn’t prepare our brains for quantum uncertainty. There was no need. In ordinary life, we never encounter objects light enough for the Uncertainty Principle to matter. (96)•	The First Law of Thermodynamics is the law of energy conversation: you cannot create energy; you cannot destroy it; all you can do is change its form. The second Law: ignorance always increases. (140)•	Hawking claimed that “when a black hole evaporates, the trapped bits of information disappear from our universe. Information isn’t scrambled. It is irreversibly, and eternally, obliterated.” He was dancing on the grave of quantum mechanics. (185)•	Nothing can return from behind the horizon of a black hole because to do so would require exceeding the speed of light, an impossibility according to Einstein. All the relativists believed this, like Hawking. (191)•	Mathematical physics would come to embrace one of the most philosophically disturbing ideas of all time: in a certain sense, the solid three-dimensional world of experience is a mere illusion. (291) •	In some way that we don’t understand, every bit of information in the world is stored far away at the most distant boundaries of space. (294)•	Leonard Susskind’s confession: Despite the fact that I have been an elementary particle physicist for more than forty years, I really don’t like particle physics very much. The whole thing is too messy. Why keep doing it then? Because the very messiness must be telling us something about nature. At some yet undiscovered level, there must be a lot of machinery underlying these so-called elementary particles. It’s curiosity about that hidden machinery, as well as it implications for the basic principles of nature, that pushes me on through the miserable swamp of particle physics. (325)•	Nothing compares with the difficulties of trying to build a Quantum Field Theory of gravity. Gravity is geometry. In trying to combine General Relativity with Quantum Mechanics, at least according to the rules of Quantum Field theory, one finds that space-time itself constantly varying its shape. . . . Applying conventional methods of Quantum Field theory to gravity leads to a mathematical fiasco. (334)•	The remarkable fact is that String Theory is quintessentially a holographic theory describing a pixilated universe. (335)•	String theorists discovered many years ago that the mathematical consistency of their equations breaks down unless six more dimensions of space are added. . . . With nine directions to move in, it can be shown that String Theory is mathematically consistent. . . . String theorists make the six extra dimensions of space compact, thus compactifying or hiding the existence of extra dimensions. The idea is that the extra dimensions of space can be wrapped up in very small knots, so that we enormous creatures are far too big to move around in them, or to even notice them. (339)•	The fact that black hole entropy can be accounted for by the information stored in string wiggles went strongly against the view of many relativists, including Hawking. He saw black holes as eaters of information, not storage containers for retrievable information. (393).•	Holographic Principle: The three-dimensional world of ordinary experience – the universe filled with galaxies, stars, planets, houses, boulders, and people – is a hologram, an image of reality coded on a distant two-dimensional surface. . Everything inside a region of space can be described by bits of information restricted to the boundary. (410)•	Maldacena and Witten had proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that information would never be lost behind a black hole horizon. The string theorists could understand this immediately; the relativists would take longer. But the war was over. (419)So the black hole war ended with Susskind proving that information is not lost. At the same time he makes it very clear that all this is theoretical (based on mathematics) and not experiential. I stayed with the book to the very end, my eyes glazing over by the chapter on nuclear physics. But it was well worth the read. In the last chapter, Susskind gives us physics in a nutshell: The more we discover, the less we seem to know. That’s physics in a nutshell."
31,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7434712-sandeep-tammu,3,"So, we have Alice and Bob. Out of scientific curiosity, Alice decided to jump into a black hole. Bob decided to play it safe and was instead asked to witness and report the status of Alice back to Earth. What happened to Alice? Of course, she is not alive anymore but that's not the paradox. Where is the information of Alice's atoms? Hawking proved that the information disappears from the universe, but that clashes with one of the fundamental principles of Physics that the information in a closed system is conserved. This book explains the paradox and a couple of approaches to solve it. I don't know if it was me or the writing style of Leonard Susskind, I was only able to understand ~70% of this book. Some of the chapters explaining string theory, Ads/CFT correspondence are not so well explained. It would have been nice if Susskind struck to physics, but he veered off into some complicated prose that is not so coherent. Some of the physics is really well explained. I would only recommend this book to people who are into black hole physics, and want to understand the historical narrative of the paradox."
32,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68942877-justyna-polita-ska,5,"To me, this book is a masterpiece. Not only does Susskind explain complex physics in a way that a person without any background in advanced maths or physics is able to comprehend. He also does it in a fascinating way. Susskind's book is not only about the most amazing theories and proven facts in science. It is also an incredibly interesting story of some of the gratest minds of the planet. Although I understood some 70% of the book (things got really hard to imagine somewhere around the String Theory and the Universe being a hologram), I would need to come back to ""Black hole wars"" a few times more to be able to connect all dots. Which I am already looking forward to doing."

Now, seven years later working in a field outside of physics, I read it again. For such bizarre concepts, Susskind does an incredible job at making them easy to follow along with.If you’ve ever wondered “what is physics?”, this book will fill you in without getting lost in math and details.Or if you’ve found yourself intrigued by black holes (as I have been since a young child), this book does a great job at explaining their peculiarities.

The Holographic Principle is one of the most unintuitive abstractions in all of physics. It was the culmination of more than two decades of intellectual warfare over the fate of information that falls into a black hole. It was not a war between angry enemies; indeed the main participants are all friends. But it was a fierce intellectual struggle of ideas between people who deeply respected each other but also profoundly disagreed.location 719-722 | Added on Thursday, 2 October 2014 09:24:49 Bob travels through space-time on a straight line, while Alice travels on a curved trajectory. Yet the proper time along Alice’s trajectory is smaller than the proper time along Bob’s. That’s an example of a counterintuitive fact about the geometry of Minkowski space: a straight world line has the longest proper time between two events. Put that in your rewiring kit.location 794-799 | Added on Thursday, 2 October 2014 09:36:38 The idea was that two black holes, perhaps billions of light-years apart, could be joined at their horizons, forming a fantastic shortcut across the universe. Instead of the embedding diagram of the black hole ending at a sharp singularity, once it passed the horizon, it would open out into a large new region of space-time. Entering one end and leaving the other would be like going into a tunnel in New York and emerging, after no more than a couple of miles, in Beijing, or even on Mars. Wheeler’s wormhole was based on genuine mathematical solutions of the General Theory of Relativity.location 801-803 | Added on Thursday, 2 October 2014 09:37:08 The wormhole opens and closes so quickly that it is impossible for anything to pass through, including light. It is as though the short tunnel to Beijing would collapse before anyone could traverse it. Some physicists have speculated that Quantum Mechanics might somehow stabilize the worm-hole, but there is no evidence for this.location 1765-1772 | Added on Thursday, 2 October 2014 15:03:39 Bekenstein concluded that the Second Law is too deeply rooted in the rules of physics to be so easily violated. Instead, he made a radical new proposal: black holes themselves must have entropy. He argued that when you count up all the entropy in the universe—the missing information in stars, interstellar gas, the atmosphere of the planets, and all the bathtubs of warm water—you must include a certain amount of entropy for each black hole. Furthermore, the bigger the black hole is, the bigger its entropy. With that idea, Bekenstein could rescue the Second Law. Einstein would no doubt have approved. Here is how Bekenstein thought about it. Entropy always goes together with energy. Entropy has to do with the number of arrangements of something, and that something, in all cases, has energy. Even the ink on a page is made of massive atoms, which, according to Einstein, have energy, because mass is a form of energy. One might say that entropy counts the possible ways of arranging bits of energy.location 2043-2049 | Added on Thursday, 2 October 2014 16:17:53 Defining entropy in terms of temperature is putting the cart before the horse. Although it’s true that we all have an innate sense of temperature, the more abstract concepts of energy and entropy are much more basic. The professor should have first explained that entropy is a measure of hidden information and is given in bits. Then he could have gone on to say (correctly): Temperature is the increase in the energy of a system when you add one bit of entropy. 6 The energy change when you add one bit? That’s exactly what Bekenstein had figured out for a black hole. Apparently, Bekenstein had calculated the temperature of a black hole without realizing it.location 2508-2514 | Added on Friday, 3 October 2014 14:05:48 Einstein seized on that idea: it is impossible to tell acceleration from the effect of gravity. The passenger has no way of knowing whether the train is starting out on its journey or gravity is pulling him back in his seat. Out of paradox and contradiction was born the Equivalence Principle: The effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable from one another. The effect of gravity on any physical system is exactly the same as the effect of acceleration. Again and again, we see the same pattern. At the risk of overstating the point, the greatest advances in physics have been uncovered by thought experiments that revealed a clash between deeply held principles. The present is no different from the past in this respect.location 2932-2934 | Added on Friday, 3 October 2014 15:25:22 My own view about the paradoxes of black holes was the same as Bohr’s view about the paradoxes of Quantum Mechanics. In physics, a contradiction is only a contradiction if it leads to inconsistent experimental results. Bohr was also a stickler for the precise use of words. When used in an imprecise way, words sometimes lead to the appearance of a contradiction where there is none.location 2937-2945 | Added on Friday, 3 October 2014 15:28:00 What Bohr meant was that in certain experiments, light behaves like a collection of particles, while in other experiments, it behaves like a wave. There is no experiment where it behaves like both. If you measure some wave characteristic—say, the value of the electrical field along the wave—you will get an answer. If you measure a particle property, such as the location of the photons in a very low-intensity light beam, you will also get an answer. But don’t try to measure a wave property at the same time that you measure a particle property. One thing gets in the way of the other. You can measure a wave property or a particle property. Bohr said that neither waves nor particles are complete descriptions of light, but that they complement each other. Exactly the same is true of position and velocity. Some experiments are sensitive to the position of an electron—for example, the point at which an electron hits a TV screen and illuminates it. Other experiments are sensitive to its velocity—for example, how much the trajectory of an electron bends when the electron passes near a magnet. But no experiment can be sensitive to the precise position and the velocity of the electron.location 3253-3257 | Added on Sunday, 5 October 2014 22:44:25 Although we will probably never be able to accelerate particles to the Planck energy, let alone one million times larger, we already know what would happen if we could. When that much mass becomes stuffed into a tiny space, a black hole will form. We will be frustrated by the horizon of the black hole, which will hide everything that we are trying to detect in its interior. As we try to see smaller and smaller distances by increasing the photon energy, the horizon will get bigger and bigger, and hide more and more: another Catch-22.location 3729-3733 | Added on Thursday, 9 October 2014 08:15:54 The critical events that I’ve described share some features. First, they were surprising. A totally unanticipated result, whether experimental or mathematical, is a powerful attention getter. Second, for a mathematical result, the more technical, precise, unintuitive, and difficult it is, the more it shocks people into recognizing the value of a new way of thinking. Part of the reason is that intricate calculations can go wrong at many points. Surviving potential dangers makes them difficult to ignore. Both ’t Hooft’s and Hawking’s calculations had this quality.location 4042-4046 | Added on Sunday, 12 October 2014 18:33:14 But fundamental strings are not happy with only three dimensions to move in. By that I mean that the subtle mathematics of String Theory goes haywire unless more dimensions of space are added. String theorists discovered many years ago that the mathematical consistency of their equations breaks down unless six more dimensions of space are added. I have always felt that if a thing is understood well enough, it should be possible to explain it in nontechnical terms. But String Theory’s need for six extra dimensions has eluded a simple explanation, even after more than thirty-five years. I fear that I will have to take the scoundrel’s way out and say, “It can be shown that …”location 4207-4211 | Added on Sunday, 12 October 2014 22:22:41 quote from the beginning of this chapter: “Imagine that I give you a chair, while explaining that the legs are still missing, and that the seat, back and armrest will perhaps be delivered soon; whatever I did give you, can I still call it a chair?” It is true that String Theory is not yet a full-blown theory, but at the moment it is far and away our best mathematical guide to the ultimate principles of quantum gravity. And, I might add, it has been the most powerful weapon in the Black Hole War, particularly in confirming Gerard’s own beliefs.location 4673-4677 | Added on Monday, 13 October 2014 20:43:18 Certain special systems have many states with exactly the same minimum value of energy. In other words, even after all the energy has been drained away, there are ways of rearranging the system to hide information, and to do so without adding energy. Physicists say that such systems have degenerate ground states. Systems with degenerate ground states have entropy—they can hide information—even at absolute zero. Extremal black holes are perfect examples of these unusual systems. Unlike ordinary Schwarzschild black holes, they are at absolute zero, which means they don’t evaporate.location 5052-5057 | Added on Thursday, 16 October 2014 18:52:02 There are two views of the similarity between fundamental String Theory and nuclear physics. The more conservative view is that it is accidental, more or less like the similarity between atoms and the solar system. That similarity was useful in the early days of atomic physics. Niels Bohr, in his theory of the atom, used the same mathematics for atoms that Newton had used for the solar system. But neither Bohr nor anyone else really thought that the solar system was a blown-up version of an atom. According to this more conservative view, the connection between quantum gravity and nuclear physics is also just a mathematical analogy, but a useful analogy that allows us to use the mathematics of gravity to explain certain features of nuclear physics."

36,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"This is another case where I would like to be able to give a 4.5 instead of a ""lowly"" 4. To be brief, if you like engaging non-fiction, this is a great book.This is a very well written book about a lengthy debate in the scientific community about the rules of physics and their ""universality"", in a manner of speaking. Granted we really on get one side of the ""argument"", but he presents the opposition fairly and with enough detail to let the reader understand the gravity (pun intended) of the situation and draw their own inferences as the war progresses.I have not read Susskind's earlier book, but after finishing this, you can be sure that I will be adding it to my ""To Read"" list.Although this book deals with very important, tricky and deep topics that span cosmology, quantum theory, relativity, and string theory, there is remarkably little math involved. Instead, Susskind has created detailed and graphic conceptual models (""stories"" if you like) that present and illustrate the key ideas and points that he must get the audience to understand to follow the physics. While I may have preferred a few more equations and technical descriptions, I readily acknowledge the beauty of his approach and his skill in presenting the material.Although Susskind himself is not a Cosmologist, the primary focus of the book, and indeed the ""war"", is the black hole. Which, as most people are aware is commonly formed by stars more massive (at least 2.2 times as massive) as our own local star, the Sun. But it draws (as did the eventual solution of the problem) on the differences between many theories that are used to describe or model the observed universe.If you have any interest in learning a bit about many facets of modern particle and quantum physics, this is a great book. It has one of the best presentations of string theory (both that of the hadrons and fundamental strings) that I have ever come across. So, don't be fearful that the material is too hard. The concepts may be difficult to think through, but the way it is parceled out and written will make it as painless as possible.On the other hand, if you have any background or have kept up with layman's books on physics and cosmology, this book is a great edition to your mental mindset. I don't think you'll miss the equations or derivations either. Plus, there is a good bibliography if you want to learn more (along with many useful footnotes).PS I'm told that Susskind has a series of videos in which he presents physics to an adult education audience. I'm sure that if he has developed a method of communicating for that audience, it only improved his ability to write for the popular press. As he says in the book, he was told that for every equation he included he would lose 10,000 sales. In any event the number is small enough that it should not worry you. Check out the man in action on You Tube (I will, too!)"
37,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2706969-stephen,4,"I enjoyed this book and read it in only a few days.It disappointed me in a couple of places, however. In the ""Battle of Santa Barbara"" Susskind introduces the Black Hole Complementarity Theory. Part of the theory uses the Equivalence Principle to describe what would happen to someone who falls throught the Horizon. ""Obviously, at least one of the endings must be wrong since they say opposite things. Nevertheless, I have come to tell you the impossible: Neither story is false. They are bothe true -- in complementary ways.""The Equivalence Principle is simply not absolutely true. (Note 1) It can be a good approximation for some calculations. But measurement of tidal forces (or gravitational gradient) within any frame of reference will identify whether the frame of reference is an accelerating frame far away from gravity sources or whether it is in a strong gravitational field. Even the difference between a free-falling frame of reference and a frame in a distant orbit can be determined because the falling one has a much higher time-rate-of-change of the gravitational gradient than the orbital one. So ""Equivalence"" in my mind is a ""flat-earth"" approximatation, quite useful in block-size civil engineering, but unacceptable when building the Channel Tunnel. (See Asimov's ""The Relativity of Wrong.""I expected some discussion from Susskind about how Equivalence isn't strictly true, but it is still good enough at the Horizon. But he seemed to treat Equivalence as a rock solid principle that will not be invalidated near a black hole. Maybe it won't, but some discussion is needed.Another weak spot in his story was what does ""Steve"" observe of the Black Hole and its horizon and environments as he approaches and falls throught it. He is undergoing time dialation before falling in, and he would have to report some of those affects if he were reprieved at the last moment.And what was completely missing is what does ""Dave"" (my invention) see who is sentenced only to orbit the Black Hole eliptically and pass very close to the Horizon and return to report his observations.The book made me think.Note 1:(From Wikipedia:Equivalence Principle: So the original equivalence principle, as described by Einstein, concluded that free-fall and inertial motion were physically equivalent. This form of the equivalence principle can be stated as follows. An observer in a windowless room cannot distinguish between being on the surface of the Earth, and being in a spaceship in deep space accelerating at 1g. This is not strictly true, because massive bodies give rise to tidal effects (caused by variations in the strength and direction of the gravitational field) which are absent from an accelerating spaceship in deep space."
38,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23115118-luca,5,"1. I chose this book because I have always had great interest in theoretical physics, and this was a great event in the world of science that changed the way we though about the universe, by explaining what happens to an object that falls into a black hole, and validates the law of conservation of information.2. This book recalls the ""war"" between physicists that took place in the late 1900's. On one side, Stephen Hawking, who believed that an object that falls into a black hole is destroyed, violating the law of conservation of information, and his followers. On the other, Leonard Susskind, who believed that an object that falls into a black hole goes through a process that would take too long to explain here. If you want to know, either read the book, or, if you know me personally, ask me.3.""The world sees the diminutive Stephen as a mighty man, a hero of extraordinary courage and fortitude. Those who know him see other sides: Stephen the Playful and Stephen the Bold. One evening during the EST conference, a few of us were out walking on one of San Francisco's famous brake- busting hills. Stephen was with us, driving his power chair. When we reached the steepest section, he turned on the devilish smile. Without a moment's hesitation, he took off down the hill at maximum velocity, the rest of us startled. We chased him, fearing the worst. When we got to the bottom, we found him sitting and smiling. He wanted to know whether there was a steeper hill to try. Stephen Hawking: the Evel Knievel of physics."" I apologize for the incredibly long quote, but the whole thing needed to be told. I personally found this amazing. One would never think that a cosmologist would ever try anything like that, let alone Stephen Hawking in his condition. I absolutely had to chose this quote as my favorite.4. I thought that the author's writing style was very fitting for this book. Over half of it was explanation of physics, so it didn't need to be too exciting. I did enjoy that there was constant presence of clever humor.5. I am sorry to say, in general, I would not recommend this book. The general population has no interest in the world of physics, and would rather check their Facebook, or tweet some random comment that will make no difference in their lives, but do it anyway. So if you are in the lower class of the general population, stay away from this book, as it will bore you. However, If you are in the higher class of future, current, or ex-physicists, such as myself, I would urge you to go out and by this book right now. (And yes, I realize that was offensive to the general population. I don't care. It was supposed to be)."
39,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1374721-jeremy,4,"I bought this book while passing through McMinville, Oregon. Though I knew nothing about Leonard Susskind, the subject matter sounded fascinating, and scanning the text it seemed accessible. Sure enough, the book proved to be quite entertaining and interesting, walking you through the history of physics to give enough background to understand an argument between the author and Stephen Hawking.Using plenty of references to other favorites such as Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman and of course Stephen Hawking, Susskind begins by setting the stage of the argument: it was accepted that by definition nothing can escape from the gravity of a black hole, yet Hawking proved that black holes slowly evaporate, so what happens to the matter and energy (""information"") that was sucked in? Hawking demonstrated that this ""information"" is lost forever, disappearing from the universe. Susskind strongly disagreed, and spent 20 years proving that information does eventually escape from a black hole, discussed in a story that in the process explains the Special Theory of Relativity, Quantum Field Theory, entropy, ever smaller particles, Matrix Theory, String Theory, Cosmic Horizons, and the Holographic Principle.I was a little disappointed reading chapter 4, where Quantum Mechanics were initially explored. Susskind began by explaining that nobody really understands Quantum Mechanics, quoting Feynman saying nearly those exact words. I remembered learning about Quantum Mechanics in high school, but felt I understood it less now after reading this chapter, not more. I realized later in the book that what I was missing was more of an understanding of how this theory is supported -- it feels somewhat arbitrary at first. Fortunately, in later chapters the necessary background is provided.I had not read much about String Theory before, and found the discussion fascinating. However, when we moved on to the Holographic Principle, I was again left wanting. Though Susskind did a great job of describing what it was in layman terms, I was left confused as to why it was resulting in another massive paradigm shift in physics. The ability to explain and define 3 dimensions using only 2 is somehow profoundly disturbing, no matter how well the mathematics may work and agree with other more proven theories. That said, the author's parting comment was that he hopes in future years understanding of these theories will evolve enough for him to write another book, one which I will eagerly await."
40,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1508173-david,4,"This is a very interesting account of a 30-year-old feud between two very prominent present-day physicists/cosmologists: Leonard Susskind and Stephen Hawking. It is written by Susskind who, proudly enough, ultimately won the contest.At issue is a fundamental question of physics: does information contained inside a black hole disappear when the black hole eventually ""evaporates"". Susskind, arguing from basic principles of quantum mechanics, held that information is preserved, and in fact must be emanated as radiation from the black hole before it evaporates. Hawking, arguing from general relativity, held that it disappears when the black hole disappears. This gentlemanly argument continued for many years, before being resolved in Susskind's favor only in 2004, when Hawking formally acknowledged defeat at a scientific meeting in Dublin, Ireland.In the process, scientists stumbled upon a profound principle that may turn out to be one of the most important facts of modern physics -- namely that any black hole, as well as the entire universe itself, is a ""hologram"" -- the total amount of information contained within it is limited, in a precise way, by the surface area that surrounds it.Susskind's account of this episode is a triumph of modern-day scientific writing. There are even a few equations included. I, as a research mathematician, greatly appreciated this detail, as it makes the account much more precise and technically substantive. However, this material is so well explained that even a math-phobic reader should have no trouble following it.It should be noted that the ""holographic universe"" has recently re-emerged in the news, as it now appears that scientists seeking evidence of gravitational waves may have stumbled onto evidence of the holographic universe in the form of low-level ""noise"" that cannot be explained or made to disappear. This is remarkably analogous to the discovery of the microwave background radiation in the 1950s that provided dramatic confirmation to the big bang theory of cosmology. A well-written account of the latest development can be read here:http://www.newscientist.com/article/m...Perhaps the best feature of Susskind's book is its many fascinating insights into the day-to-day lives and personalities of the scientists involved. All of this is told with a remarkable touch of humor. The book is worth the purchase price for this reason alone.Highly recommended!"
41,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/762235-marcus,4,"There is a point in the expanding universe where things are moving away from us at the speed of light. Since nothing can exceed the speed of light, we can know nothing of what lies beyond that point. Not only that, but any currently known object that speeds beyond that horizon is lost to us forever. The only other way an object in space can disappear forever is by being sucked into the strangest type of star, a black hole. This second way of vanishing is the topic of controversy in Susskind's Black Hole War. Is something really completely lost when it goes into a black hole? Does it matter? Stephen Hawking (the other side in the ""war"") believed the radiation that escapes from black holes is entirely uniform, devoid of information, and that once something crossed the horizon of a black hole, it was truly lost. Susskind, and a few others believed this theory of information loss was so dangerous that it undermined and threatened all we think we know about post-newtonian physics.Not to spoil the ending, but as you might expect, Susskind won. Information isn't annihilated in black holes and the laws of physics prevail. But in Black Hole War, the journey is the show. In the battles on the way to discovering how black holes work, there is plenty to appreciate. For example, the holographic principle which says that the amount of information that can be contained in an area of space is equal to the amount of information that can be encoded in its perimeter. So if I take a sphere of space, maybe the one that includes your house and computer and you, I can know everything about what is in that sphere based solely on the information found on the outside of the sphere. It's weird. It's counter-intuitive I still don't really get it. Strange as it is, having fairly solid evidence of its truth was so important that was after Juan Maldacena, an Argentine physicist, showed strong evidence for it, a version of the song Macarena was written for him by another physicist, Dr. Jeffrey Harvey, and performed at a conference. Here's the last verse:
M-theory is finishedJuan has great repute The black hole we have mastered Q.C.D. we can compute Too bad the glueball spectrum is still in some disputeEhhhh! Maldacena! 
Bits like this make Black Hole War a fun, readable, first-hand account of a historical debate among the titans of physics that lasted years and led to a profusion of extremely fascinating research."
42,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2743016-dick-gullickson,4,"Thanks, John, for buying this thought provoking book for me for Christmas. Leonard Susskind has written a fascinating book which combines the sociology of physics with a thoughtful discussion of the implications of quantum mechanics, Einstein’s general theory of relativity, and string theory. Susskind describes black holes, which are objects which are so massive that they push through the fabric of the universe, creating a hole (perhaps into an alternate universe) from which no object can escape. Stephen Hawking, who contributed much to the theory of black holes, had postulated that information is lost when an object falls into a black hole and passes the event horizon. Because nothing can escape a black hole, Hawking proposes that information is “swallowed” in apparent contradiction to quantum mechanics and thermodyamics. Susskind also introduces the holographic principle (invited by Nobel laureate Gerald ‘t Hooft of Utrecht University) that a volume in space (i.e. the interior of a black hole) can be fully described by the two dimensional surfaces that surrounds it, just as a 2D holographic plate can be used to reconstruct a 3D object. He also points out the complementarity principle which implies that there is no absolute reality since an observer falling into a black hole experiences a different reality from one observing from the outside. Susskind also describes how string theory, used to represent elementary particles through the vibration of strings (where frequency and amplitude determine energy and mass) leads to multiple universes. By the way, this has led to another fascinating idea from Andrew Hamilton of the University of Colorado that one can think of what happens by objects falling into a black holes as the “Big Bang” in reverse. 13.7 billion years ago, our universe was created with a massive explosion arising from a singularity (all matter and energy in a spot with no dimensions) which spewed forth elementary particles which ultimately became the building blocks of our bodies and our universe. Hamilton postulates that a black hole in our universe may product a big bang event which creates another universe.Getting back to the Susskind – Hawkings debate, Susskind ultimate prevails in convincing the scientific community (and perhaps Hawking – this isn’t clear) that his quantum mechanically consistent viewpoint of information conservation prevails."
43,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,4,"I really wanted to give this book five stars, and the limits of the star mechanism above prevents me from giving it 4.5 stars. I also had issues with how the publisher decided to print the book. The lackluster printing detracted from my reading experience. I recently critiqued Richard Panek's 4% Universe for what I considered to be poor science writing. Susskind is the antidote. On the whole, he is the clearest expositor of advanced physics concepts that I have encountered, much better than Brian Greene - who is not too shabby as my fiancee would say. That said, the end of the book is a bit of a let down in terms of clarity. I suspect that Professor Susskind was getting tired of the book at the end (it shows). This is not a sharp rebuke as I have had that issue with several papers that I have written. Also, the end of the book discusses material, in particular the Holographic Principle, that really is at the cutting edge of physics and as yet still in the process of being understood. Hence Professor Susskind has not had the time to refine his metaphors, images, and thought experiments to make them more clear. Still, I learned a great deal. Additionally, as a student of Science and Technology Studies, Susskind demonstrates quite clearly science as a *human* enterprise. In terms of the book itself, I was struck by its cheapness and indifferent quality. The publisher saw fit to cut corners printing the book. The illustrations seem to be taken directly from Susskind's proof, and are of variable quality. It is up to the publisher to go through the proof illustrations and bring them to a higher standard. They did not do this. His illustrations were acceptable by the standards of a class or conference PowerPoint presentation - not a book. Along the same lines, the text was all so pixellated that I could resolve the dots at ordinary reading distance. It was reading an entire book in greyscale. Text SHOULD BE solid black with no hint of pixellation. It causes fatigue to the eyes and looks shoddy. I would without question read other books by this author. "
44,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22039713-bob-anderson,4,"Susskind’s book is a very entertaining read, and is approachable without much more than a desire to learn. Even if his simplified descriptions of the physics (not much actual math here) aren’t clear to a reader, his account of the actual process of debate and discovery in an emerging field is easy to follow and extraordinarily entertaining. Helpful graphics fill the book and contribute meaningfully to its exposition. The basic scientific conflict is about what happens when something crosses from the observable world over a black hole’s horizon. We can no longer observe it, but how does that change the information in the world? Hawking believed that the Hawking radiation which gradually diminishes black holes means that this information disappears without a trace. Susskind’s book is the story of how he tries to deal with this foundation-shaking paradox. He covers a lot of territory here, and does it skillfully. There are really only three concepts here that Susskind’s version of pop science fails to make hang together with the rest. First, what exactly is ‘information’ in the physical sense, i.e., what information could a hydrogen atom falling into a black hole be said to have, and how could that transfer into Hawking radiation if this theory is right? Second, why should we expect quantum mechanics laws to be reversible only without observation at the ‘end point’ of the particle? These first two may have good pop science explanations in other sources for those who can’t follow the mathematical/physical arguments. The third is, just what are these higher dimensional branes in string theory, and how are these extra dimensions arranged in a Calabi-Yau manifold, etc? This last one may have to wait a long time for a pop science explanation to bridge the ‘pop’ and the ‘science’ sufficiently for even a good mental picture. Overall the book is as good as any other popular scientific work, doubly so since it’s written by one of the main participants. Highly recommended if the subject matter interests you."
45,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16528929-shamik-ghosh,5,"One word to describe this book: PROFOUND.Written by one of the modern day stalwarts of Physics, The Black Hole War is Susskind's first hand account of the intellectual argument between him and Stephen Hawking. Susskind's calm and informal style with his clear thinking shines through the book as he presents some of the deepest concepts of core physics in a way that is accessible to even a layman. This book is made even more enjoyable by Susskind's style of writing. Unlike other famous author like Sagan or Hawking, Susskind talks physics in a casual and informal fashion beautifully mixing his humor and wit through interesting anecdotes. He sets himself apart from other noteworthy authors like Brian Greene or Michio Kaku, by presenting modern theories of physics with a personal touch and not making it read like a mere historical account of the evolution of the theory. Perhaps that is because he was directly involved in the science of the Black Hole War.The Black Hole War is about an intellectual battle between two stellar physicist about a fundamental question : ""Does information get destroyed inside a black hole?"" The discussion of the concepts of entropy, energy and information, all fundamental to physics, is unlike any other you are likely to find. He discusses physics of black hole, of fundamental particles and string theory up to the present level of research. At the end you would be feel how profound physics is! Susskind manages to pack a heavy dose of advanced physics into an enjoyable and understandable book that all can enjoy. However, midway though the book after the Santa Barbara Conference chapter, there is a break in momentum and it get a bit tedious after the fast build up. But patience has its virtues. Stick through the slow description of String Theory and you are rewarded by not just the end of the black hole war but also the level at which people are working now-a-days the AdS<->QFT correspondence."
46,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1879178-kathy,4,"This book was like a summary of everything I love about physics; the thought experiments, the elegant mathematics, the condensing of everyday reality into really bizarre activities on a subatomic level and the necessity of thinking in a completely new way to even begin to understand it all. The only thing I didn't like about this book is the continual regret that I do not have the mathematical chops to follow the math he didn't include. Susskind not only follows the progression of some extremely difficult physics with a translation everyone can understand, he also describes the personalities involved in the scientific dispute with wit and warmth. A scientific argument of this scale does not happen all that frequently and it is interesting to note that human qualities of curiosity, persistence and complacency have just as much to do with scientific achievement as mere cold facts do.The equal parts respect and frustration that are accorded to Stephen Hawking is also interesting. The one physicist that everyone knows about is proven to be wrong about an essential fact of science. That alone is enough to make a good general reading book. We have a tendency to put great scientists on pillars they don't deserve. Ever since Einstein people have thought of physicists as our society's answer to mystic gurus who have the keys to the universe the plebeian masses cannot understand. But they are people who have egos just like the rest of us.The author is direct in stating that String Theory and the interesting things happening in physics now is just the beginning of a revolution perhaps as epic as the changes that happened around the turn of the 20th century. There are a lot of things still to be figured out in this field, it is a very exciting time to be a physicist."
47,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,4,"In this book, Leonard Susskind does a great job winning a bet against Stephen Hawking. Decades ago, Stephen Hawking made the assertion that anything that goes into a black hole is lost forever. Specifically, Hawking argued that there is no way to tell what went into the black hole, and thus any information (e.g. quantum states, etc.) are lost forever. This flies right in the face of the conservation of information, a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics. According to QM, all of the information about a system is encoded in its wave function up to when the wave function collapses. Susskind tries to reconcile what we believe happens to matter entering a black hole, and this information paradox. He (and t'Hooft) asserts that all of the information of anything that has entered a black hole is stored on its outer event horizon (like a hologram), and this is a result our entire universe being a hologram. That is, a black hole represents the highest density in the universe and if this is true and the universe is a hologram, then all information has to be accessible on the surface area surrounding the volume in space. Not only is the information of what is in a black hole on its surface, but the entire set of information of what is in the universe is in theory located on the outer surface area of the universe. This implies that our universe and anything in it is ultimately a 3D hologram created by or represented by the 2D ""reality"" on the surface of the volume considered. It was a great book and right up my alley. I love astrophysics, cosmology, relativity, QM, and this book touches on all those subjects. You won the bet Susskind! Hawking had to give you $1, and it was well worth it I bet."
48,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1787954-jack,3,"Another fine read for physics fans. This one was recommended by blogger Sean Carroll. There were several places where it seemed very clear that Susskind was following someone's advice to include personal anecdotes to make the book more appealing to general readers. It might have worked. The anecdotes mostly don't detract from the main thrust of the book, but I don't think they add very much either.What Susskind does really well is discuss some very abstruse physics in a clear and careful way, explaining (sometimes repeatedly, but in a good way) what kind of physical results we would see if we could look at things like black hole event horizons. The ""war"" of the title is an oddly one-sided affair, though. Hawking appears several times, but once he makes his initial proclamation in the early 1980s, Susskind is the only one doing any intellectual fighting. Susskind is very honest and generous about crediting the others who contribute critical ideas to the argument that he marshals over 20 some-odd years, and in the end he manages to communicate (without ever saying it outright) that even the most esoteric theoretical physics is a highly collaborative enterprise.I was very pleased to see him mention Lisa Randall's Warped Passages favorably, since I read, enjoyed and maybe understood it, a little, last year."
49,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1150384-johnny-story,5,"I think the world is intruiged by Stephen Hawking. He reached cult status years ago, the butt end of many jokes on SNL or TV shows. That being said he's regarded as THE physicist of physicists. Who knew much more than he had a book to help the layman? Or that he was in a battle about Black Holes? I certainly didn't. As a whole the book has too much science in it. I know I know, it's a book about Quantum Mechanics, thermal energy, space-time, partical difublators and time machines (not really some of those), and although Susskind does a good job of laying it out there, I think certain parts of the book scream 'take a break from me now, come back later.'The author's strong sense of self-worth might rub some the wrong way, it's subtle, but I can't imaginge a physicist who is not that way, not competitive, not pushing for new and innovative ideas, challenging others and CLAIMING the next big bright brilliant bad ass idea as their own; like every anthropologist that finds ancient bones in the ground, it's always the 'missing link.' It's not a big issue, I mean I give the book 5 stars. I love the subject matter and the book was compelling. I like the TV show RESCUE ME even though I assume Dennis Leary loves himself dearly. Anyway, aside from an insecure rant on Cambridge and Susskind's take on God/Mormon friend it's an awesome awesome book."
50,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/329383-dale,4,"When I was around middle-school-aged, I thought astrophysicist was a good potential career choice and I enjoyed flipping through Omni magazine. By the time I got to college I had already somehow become a dyed-in-the-wool English major, but in order complete my science-realted graduation requirements I took both Astronomy and Cosmology. Glean from all of that what you will, but basically I was sentimentally predisposed to like this book and it did not disappoint. It made my head spin a bit with examinations of String Theory and nine-dimensional space and whatnot, but that is not disappointing.I was impressed with the manner in which Susskind told his story - and make no mistake, for a science-heavy book it did rest on a narrative throughline, basically ""here's where we started, here's where we needed to be, here's who made what discoveries to get us from A to B"". Susskind has a good knack for putting mind-boggling concepts of elementary particle physics into layman's terms, knows when to include personal anecdotes with little or no relation to physics in order to keep the story human, and depicts himself with a charming mix of a theoretical scientist's ego and a nerd's self-deprecating humor. Plus he takes that blowhard Stephen Hawking down a peg or two. In your face, Hawking!"
51,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2348903-greg-talbot,4,"Imbued with personality and charm, Susskind's ""Black Hole War"" shows how little and much we understand about black holes. Quoting Thomas Kuhn's ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"", Susskind shows readers just how tenuous our firm knowledge can be, and how the differing opinions on black holes was waged and won. The book delivers on a number of fronts. As a reader without a strong physics background, I found the elemental physics parts riveting, but often lost when Susskind makes the leaps from Newtonian to quantum physics. But unlike a lot of scientific non-fiction works, it's Susskind's blue collar groudedness. One of my favorite's is how the students were not allowed to walk across the grass, and Susskind as a young professor walks across. When accosted, and vexed by the rudeness, the yeller says oh, well that only applies to to the English!Susskind takes you through black hole theory: singularity, information lose/distortion, debunks the time traveling sci-fi of it, and has excellent demonstrations demonstrations to explain space-time, black holes and atomic structures. Even ending with the unease that we might be living in a holographic universe, do-do-do-do!If you're up for a challenge, this book will lead you there."
52,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,4,"A cheerful, chatty, kind of goofy account of the author's battle with Hawking to prove that information is not permanently lost in black holes. Largely non-mathematical and easy to follow, even though I'm far less comfortable with quantum mechanics than general relativity. And I mostly didn't have my usual problem with popular physics books and their reliance on mind-bending physics revelations by analogy. I actually stopped reading and went ""ha!"" when Susskind explained to me why I've always thought the analogy of a ball on a rubber sheet to explain the relationship between gravity and mass doesn't work (it uses the effects of gravity to demonstrate gravity). Thank you! That has been bothering me for years.Anyway. The last third slid over into the realm of obscuring what we're talking about by using analogies that are supposed to explain it, but it's not Susskind's fault. He's doing his best with some pretty freaking weird ideas, and there just isn't any way I'm going to be satisfied with what he says without the math, and it would take me years to get to the point where I could understand that, so I'll just complain about it a bit instead."
53,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3112401-alan-h-jordan,4,"First, let me say that Ray Porter does a superb job narrating this book. He breathes life into a production that could boring with another narrator.For the most part this book is a conversational discussion of many complicated concepts such as black holes, Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Gravity, and Sting Theory. There are times when it finds itself a bit long-winded. At times I get tired of Susskind blowing his own horn. There are times when I don't quite follow the explanations, but on the whole it has helped me to appreciate many concepts through the use of analogy.I've decided to quote from portions of this book for Harmony123. Example:""What is it that takes a fringe idea, something that may have lain dormant for years and abruptly tips the scale in its favor? In Physics it often happens without warning. A crucial, dramatic event suddenly catches the attention of a critical mass of physicists and within a short time, the bizarre, the fantastic, the unthinkable becomes the ordinary.""I'll be using some of the information in the book as the motivation for certain characters in the Harmony123 books."
54,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,4,"The Hole War follows the scientific debate regarding whether or not black hole formation and evaporation represents true loss of information as told from the winning side by Leonard Susskind.Susskind follows the events, developments, and personalities of the debate with a strong insider's knowledge and near reverence for the minds involved. He tends to go into lengthy asides about people and hits on string theory a bit harder than I think is needed but this is his book from his perspective and he's welcome to add to it.The book has a classic failing that I see in history of science books about an event or idea in that it gets very ""excited"" at the end. He spends some 20 chapters outlining the problems, false starts, and parts of the eventual answer but the tying together is very frantic and poorly explained. The final statement is concise, but the explanation that precedes it assumes you've kept perfect track to that point which I think over reaches. The wind down afterward is also weak with either too much or too little information on Susskind's thoughts on recurring laws at different scales and what falls out de Sitter space."
55,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/377421-heather-denkmire,5,"Wow. Amazing. It helped, I'm sure, that the narrator of the audiobook was fantastic. There were some concepts I didn't fully grasp, but it wasn't so much that I couldn't follow most of it. I can't believe he was able to take something so mind-blowingly complicated and make it understandable. I'm just amazed. In awe.I finished the book in tears because the content is so powerful.My only trouble is that I have to just trust that the math he refers to is ""right."" For the most part, though, he relied on analogies instead of equations. Even when he used equations, though, he made it possible for me to sort of follow along. Not entirely, but as if I was hearing something in Spanish. I haven't known or spoken Spanish much since my high school years and I can only pick out some words, but listening often provides enough context that I get the gist of it. That's how the equations sections of the book were.The content was challenging, of course. But I also finished this with a pretty clear sense of what I didn't understand and some ideas of where I might learn more to get the picture even clearer."
56,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876978-anthony-tenaglier,4,"I have always enjoyed Susskind and his writing style. Despite his arrogance (which he also explicitly states in this book) which sometimes distracts me from the read, he makes excellent analogies as to illustrate the basic principles of what I will call ""higher level"" physics. I would rather see him ""show"" and not ""tell"" us of his innovative ideas that went against the great Stephen Hawking. He makes a great claim as to the information that can escape from a black hole, with the use of strings having a probabilistic chance to break away from the event horizon of the black hole. I don't know why I like to read these types of books. They excite me for some reason in more of a creative sense, than the enlightenment of what physics is doing in unifying the four forces know to man. The physicists remind of children playing again. Physicists playing with concepts like eleven dimensions from our customary three plus time. Drawing outside the lines when they feel like it. They are artists when I read the works of Hawking, Greene, Smolin, and Susskind. I think we need more of this from the black and white we are so used studying and reading about."
57,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1809206-nick-gotch,5,"This was one of the most delightful, fascinating physics reads I've come across in a long time. Dr. Susskind does a phenomenal job of mixing modern physics with analogies so helpful for visualization as well as breaking things up with fun backstory and wit. He does an amazing job of working toward ""rewiring"" the reader's mind for grappling with the obscure worlds of Quantum Mechanics, String Theory, Black Hole Dynamics, and (subject of the book) the Holographic Principle.From someone who routinely reads physics books I found this one refreshing and thought-provoking. It inspired me to think about a variety of interesting concepts, most notably being that we may live in a 2D Universe with a 3-dimensional illusion.All this being said, ""The Black Hole Wars"" is probably beyond the casual beginner and such a reader would probably do well to ""ease"" into the subject matter first with some more fundamental works. I pursued physics in college and some of the subject matter covered was beyond my education level. It's a fantastic book if you have a fair background though."
58,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34958836-rich-baker,5,"I loved this book! But it's not for everyone. It's a great read and you'll learn a lot, but it's some heavy shit to follow sometimes. In one chapter he explains how the universe is potentially a hologram. I was able to follow most of it mainly because I've read many articles and listened to many podcasts trying to explain that concept before. And even I don't think I got all of it. The book is about a disagreement about an unproven scientific concept about black holes, mainly whether they break the 2nd law of thermodynamics. It goes into the multi decade search for information to finally settle who was right and who was wrong. It's fascinating stuff. If you've never read a non-fiction science book before, I wouldn't recommend this as your first. You might be totally fine, but because some of the subject matter is so heady that it could get frustrated. It would be like me reading a real heady and thick book on the US Criminal justice system. I have no background in that, so I'd need the author to really break it down for me to understand any of it."
59,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Well written and fascinating. I devoured this book and enjoyed every second of reading it.The first chapters talk about how quantum mechanics works in a really basic form. This book is written for the layman, and as such it doesn't really go heavily into the mathematics. Interspersed throughout the book is Susskind's relationship with Hawking and their friendly(?) rivalry to prove the other wrong.The basic problem was that Stephen Hawking came out with a mathematical reason for Information to be lost in a Black Hole and be completely obliterated. Leonard Susskind and Gerard t'Hooft disagreed based on the Second Law of Thermodynamics and had to wait for over 20 years for a formal proof to present itself. In the meantime, they discovered that it might have to do with the universe being a Hologram and many other things. Mostly it has to do with how much entropy can be fit into a certain amount of area.In any case, I really like reading this book. It would have taken even less time if I hadn't stopped reading it on Saturday and Sunday to go to a Theme Park."
60,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510944-anima,5,"A great book that makes us think about the complexity of the Universe. Here are few excerpts. ""Stephen had proven that black holes eventually evaporate and disappear, leaving no trace of what has fallen in..He postulated that vacuum-empty space was a full of ""virtual"" black holes that flashed into and out of existence so rapidly that we didn't notice them.The effect of these virtual black holes, he claimed , was to erase information..""""We found that if Stephen was right, empty space would heat up to thousand billion billion billion degrees in a tint fraction of a second. Although I knew that Stephen was wrong, I could not find the hole in his reasoning.""""The ensuing Black Hole War ...was also a war of ideas..""""Many very famous physicists have seriously contemplated the idea that space has more than three dimensions. they were obviously not hallucinating... The buzzwords for hiding extra dimensions are compact, compactify, and compactification: string theorists make the six extra dimensions of space compact, thus compactifying them by the process of compactification."".."
61,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1536062-jh6p,4,"This book is an exciting survey of the more interesting theories circulating in physics today, put into laymans terms. The translation from precise theory to layman's metaphor sacrafices a lot of accuracy, perhaps more than was necessary. For example, Suskind slides easily from Energy is proportional to Mass (true), and Energy can be converted to Mass(true), to Energy IS Mass (not precisely true).I'd love to know why he asserts that gravity is stronger than electricity at unmeasurable distances. He states it several times without explanation, and it is not (yet) accepted scientific fact.Although I dislike Susskind's grand sweeping misstatements, the book in nonetheless an interesting story. The personalities in the book both give it character though they sometimes become a very tiresome parade of name dropping. I think Susskind is still keeping a chip on his shoulder about his working class background. "
62,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,4,"I’d love to say that Susskind cleared up string theory for me and I understand it perfectly now, along with all things physics. Instead, I feel something like the inverse of Stephen Hawking, physiologically brilliant but mentally incapacitated, stricken to a cerebral wheelchair. This isn’t because Susskind failed as an author or instructor. I now have in my possession a lot more information about physics, albeit more food for thought than I can digest. Still, I love the menu, and the meal (this book) was delicious. One of the things I particularly liked was that Susskind introduced me to many other physicists and told interesting and funny stories about their personalities and contributions, from their quirks to their quarks. While I’m still far from mastering the fundamentals, I have a better grasp and appreciation of the landscape and I’m that much more conversant in the language of this awesome yet confounding field of study."
63,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6258574-amit-srivastava,5,"This is an awesome book on Black Holes. And about one of the greatest intellectual wars in the recent times. Though the core theme of the book is the information paradox pertaining to the Black Hole physics, the book covers the fundamentals of some of the fundamental sciences (esp. Quantum Mechanics, QCD, String Theory) that lead to a better understanding of what happens in and around black holes. There a good deal of explanation around what 'Information' is. I had heard Leonard Susskind on a few popular science documentaries. Not everyone can explain things well. But Susskind can. The book also led me to some interesting (and disturbing) stuff that we were never taught. Like, energy may not be conserved in general relativity!!!! We'll, it is not that simple, but then, no one really understands :)There have been some very recent developments around the Black Holes. So better read this book before the information becomes obsolete!"

Primary among these is the holographic principle, which reveals the universe as a hologram.I learned more physics from this book than any I've read previously, but as a layman much of the material was still far above my ability. One thing is clear--Susskind is far too humble and his contribution to our understanding of the universe stands among the greats of the last century. His tale of this paradoxical clash of titans spans the macro, micro, and human scales effectively and entertainingly. A worthy read for those interested in the subject and willing to expend the effort required to increase their understanding of the strangest corners of reality."
65,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5513241-sameer,5,This is a book that makes a wholehearted approach to explaining the physics of black holes and the contradictions from using quantum mechanics and relativity together to explain their behavior. This is not so much a popular science book in that it requires some knowledge of physics and the author does not shy away from non-trivial analogies that stretch across the chapter and sometimes the entire book. He makes a good attempt to keep them consistent i.e. you can keep reasoning using the analogies for quite some length and get good physics out of it.The last few chapters were really hard for me to understand though. It's a combination of the length (there are pieces of a travel diary and an autobiography in the book) and that some of the analogies for string theory just don't have much explanatory power since it seems like a fundamentally mathematical theory and some explanations come solely from the mathematics rather than physical intuition.
66,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186015-mike-s,5,"I liked this book very much because it has many good qualities. The author does a really good job explaining the latest in scientific thought about quarks, strings, black holes, entropy, information, Planck mass/size/time and gravity, among others. He spends a lot of time on black holes, their temperature, whether they lose information, Hawking radiation, evaporation, and what happens at their horizon. He does all of this without requiring you to know any math, and he manages to be informed, intelligent, honest, readable and entertaining all at once. The book is cast with dozens of scientific characters that he personalizes and demystifies and makes quite human and, for me, less overwhelming. If you like science and want to get up to speed on the latest scientific thought on a range of subjects and you don't have a lot of math, I think you'll really enjoy this book. "
67,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/456911-scott,3,"Was I not smart enough to understand the book, or did the author lack the skill necessary to communicate high-level physics to the layman? Well, surely the answer is a mix of the two, which brings us to the more important question: who gets blamed? Obviously not me. I'm going to be optimistic and assume that it's possible to make clear why this conservation of information theorem is so important, and why the holographic principle is worth calling a principle. And thus Susskind, in failing to make his points comprehensible, failed as a popular science writer.He also comes off as a bit of a prick. Once, referring to a colleage of his, he says something along the lines of ""So and so is a devout Christian -- but he's still a good scientist, not ideological in the least"" -- as if this is a rarity."
68,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4469349-steve,4,"I found this book quite interesting, if a little over-focussed and breathless in its description of the battle between Susskind and Hawking. It was really, apparently, a fairly peaceable difference of opinion that Susskind eventually won. No matter, the book delves into some of the insanity that is quantum gravity, quantum chromodynamics, string theory, relativity, the holographic principle, and most importantly, black holes. It certainly reminded me why I was so hell-bent on being a physicist when I was a kid. Susskind gives credit to many people along the way, and tells some interesting stories about the personalities in theoretical physics, all the while tracking the brutally strange world of the extremely small.I recommend this book to anyone fascinated by the ultimate weirdness of the universe we live in."

I am VERY impressed with Leonard Susskind's ability to make a very opaque subject surprisingly understandable. The Black Hole War in question was between Susskind and Stephen Hawking, and the disagreement was about whether information that is ""sucked"" into a black hole is destroyed (i.e. disappears from the universe) or is preserved and radiated back out. Susskind held that it was preserved, and he presents his position and unfolds it over the course of this book in a very well thought-out fashion. Each chapter builds on the previous chapters, the concepts build on other concepts, and in the end I found myself thinking that yes, he had won the War."

In The Black Hole War, Susskind plays on our insatiable appetite for the gee-whiz moment, combining lucid explanations for some complex ideas with stories that tend to confirm the eccentricities of the highly intelligent. In fact, it's the author's knack for teaching and his conversational prose that make the book accessible and therefore appealing to a wide audience. And, of course, it's never a bad idea to drop Hawking's name in a book's title.

Susskind is a good writer, and this provided a good in depth discussion of the physics of the black hole horizon. For some of the book you have to wonder how much is slanted toward the author's theories, but without knowing, it seems to provide a good discussion of each side of the arguments.My only slight complaint is the books tendency to provide this war as important as Quantum Mechanics and the General Relativity theories on the early 1900's. I never felt it was that fundamental, or paradigm shifting a theory. But I liked it just because it got into great depth on how the arguments were made and the scientific details worked out."
72,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6017367-j,0,"Despite being an insanely long book, I found it absolutely fascinating. It was written to interest a wide spectrum of people, from the human interest readers to those who really just want to hear string theory in layman's terms, or to those who enjoy physics humour. If it weren't so ridiculously long I would read it again, but I have other books to read. I find it strange however (warning: this is a matter of opinon) that Susskind and many other physicists he speaks of cannot even begin to reconcile intelligent design with theoretical physics, despite the brilliant complementarity theory discussed in detail in the book. It fits in other ways that he can't imagine, even though this guy is so smart he can wrap his brain around more than four dimensions and beat out Hawking at black holes."
73,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25591973-andrew-scribner,4,"I read this (actually listened to the audiobook) 2 yrs ago after watching an episode of 'Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman' on the Science Channel called 'The Riddle of Black Holes', which included a segment w/ Leonard Susskind discussing his holographic principle. I'm posting this now in response to recent buzz over a new Nature paper on the topic (http://www.nature.com/news/simulation...). Susskind's book is conceptually challenging, and highly speculative rather than supported by observable data, but still fascinating. The NY Times has a good review @ http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/boo.... This new Nature paper suggests that there is now data to support this theory."
74,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34133705-jeff-landry,4,"Very good book on string theory and quantum mechanics. Susskind is witty, and his anecdotal approach to framing his professional disagreement with Hawking provided a smooth, accessible forum for the science. It sort of lost me at the end, once he got into the nitty gritty of the Holographic Principle and Quantum Chromodynamics, but its an inherent problem with a books that try to stay away from being overloaded with math. The math is too hard for people like me to understand, but the concepts are too vague and nebulous without the math. So it's almost impossible to really grasp some of the concepts without the math - but the math would be too confounding to follow. But overall, Susskind has an enjoyable, fresh, direct style that makes for a fast read."
75,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15649779-orville-jenkins,5,"A fascinating recounting of the various Quantum theories attempting to account for the phenomena associated with Black Holes. Susskind provides a historical perspective as well as summing up the varieties of approach to the problem. I especially appreciated the good detailing of String Theory, which I was only vaguely familiar with.He provides actual mathematical formulae and their variations that illustrate the problems and approaches he is discussing to a solution to the lose ends existing in our knowledge about the state of the universe and its workings. We learn a lot here also about the inner workings of procedures used in theoretical physics and the interpersonal dynamics involved.This was a refreshing, enlightening and rewarding volume. Exciting, even, I might say!"
76,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,4,"I liked this book more than I originally thought I would. Although, I felt that Author sounded goofy and childish in the beginning of the book about the whole 'war' thing. This book was especially enlightening because I had just finished reading ""The Trouble with Physics"" which dismisses String Theory and many of Modern String Theorist's claims very blatantly. So, it was nice to know both sides of the story.Leonard Susskind is a very well known name in the world of modern physics and as expected he does a great job in dumbing down the complex theories for non-physicists and enthusiasts like me. Deserves a read for sure."
77,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18669822-derrick-ferree,4,"After a few nosebleeds, I feel I've learned a lot about theoretical physics, and it wasn't too hard to follow. (Granted I've studied physics in college.) In the last chapter, this comment really stood out: ""There is a philosophy that says that if something is unobservable, unobservable in principle, it is not part of science (i.e. the inside of black holes). If there is no way to falsify or confirm a hypothesis it belongs to the realm of metaphysical speculation, together with astrology and spiritualism. By that standard, most of the universe has no scientific reality. It's just a figment of our imaginations."""
78,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27131192-arko,5,A masterpiece of Susskind I must say. This book became an obsession for me as much as the Author's obsession with black hole information loss conclusion made by Stephen Hawking some forty years back. Very radical thoughts and ideas put in wonderful clarity makes this book a must read for all the curious minds and avid readers. This book delves into the deepest problems of physics and grants a whole new way of finding the solution.I personally hate wars but this Black hole war is special and unlike most of the wars it was healthy and yielded fruitful perspectives to understand our reality.#5star #susskind #hawking #blackholes.
79,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/983193-peter,3,"Without a rebuttal from Hawking, explaining just why he felt so strongly against the holographic universe, it's difficult for Susskind to build sufficient tension around this particular scientific disagreement. Other than that this is a good primer for what is currently known about black holes, quantum gravity and how modern physics reconciles the very small and the very large.I should note that my dog ate the Acknowledgments, Glossary and Index from the back of the book. I feel as though enough of the book survived that I can give an accurate rating."
80,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3427960-nathan-miller,3,"It reads much like a history of Physics from Einstein on. Really pretty crazy stuff. Covers Quantum Mechanics, Black Holes, String Theory. Likely you will be amazed at some of the discoveries that are being made. Things that sound impossible, yet seem to be true. Susskind simplifies it all nicely for readers like me who don't have a PhD's in Supercalculus. However, I don't think I could explain much of what I read to anyone else. Take that for what it's worth. I also like that this guy sank Hawking. Hawking is just so arrogant. "
81,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2236176-christopher,3,"A good amount went clean over my head. That being said it was a good solid read. I had a good time reading the account of a thirty plus year battle of the minds between two great physicists. So, does information become lost once it falls into a black hole? It would seem not. The answer to that question has lead to even larger more bizare questions. I can only imagine the answers to those REALLY going over my head. Pick this up, grab a bottle of Advil and have a read. You just may learn something. "
82,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905114-boots,2,"Should probably be 2.5 stars. It was a good book, and I plan on reading it again to catch more of the details. That said, the author is kind of obnoxious (obviously non-christian, a big name dropper). And I don't really buy the whole universe is a hologram and what does it all mean stuff. Part of the reason I want to go back and reread this book though is to see if what he's saying makes any more sense the 2nd time through. The explanations for other things though are very clear, which alone could make this book worth reading. "
83,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016798-jrohde,5,"a very readable account of a very difficult subject. I have tried lots of books on modern physics - none as readable as this. and to boot, it is an account of a 25 year disagreement with Hawking that Susskind wins in the end, over whether information that falls into a black hole is lost forever - it is not! in the process one learns in an understandable way about the unbelievably tiny, sub atomic world, and the cosmic dimensions of relativity. Well worth the read and the insights - one that I will probably go back and read again. this stuff is simply too tough to get on one round."
84,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1664866-alvin,5,"Wow, this is one of the best physics books I've read in years. One of the few that exposed me to lots of new concepts and not a simple rehash of known territory (QM, Relativity etc.). The holographic universe, black hole complementarity, information loss. It even comes with a narrative explaining the process the author experienced in expounding his ideas and trying to win converts, providing insights into the very human endevour of science which is driven as much by emotion and social networks as any other."
85,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5921993-bart,3,"I found the structure of the book a bit strange & confusing - especially the first part lacks in cohesion. The Susskind & Hawking relation description is a bit drawn-out. And on the subject, I'm more a fan of the Brian Greene's books.I did appreciate the few formula's in his book - always nice to see some elaboration on some statements... As a matter of fact, I think I'd even like to see an introductory book on the same subject with even more mathematics...Great illustration of how many people are actually involved in making progress in theoretical models & theories. "
86,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9550564-sh-n-r-m-n,4,"Susskind does a great job helping the average joe understand ( in the simplest form, though it's not that simple.. ) Quantum Mechanics & General Relativity. Hawkins says anything passing through a black hole (event horizon) disappears, is lost. Susskind comes in and says ""Nope! That violates laws of quantum mechanics; Laws of physics!"" the information never passes through. It's still falling. It never reaches the inside? Well, it's more complicated than that. String theory, holographic principle and such.To me, anything that tries to discredit Stephen Hawkins is worth the read!"
87,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28816458-elizabeth-humphries,5,"I never thought I'd say this about a book on quantum mechanics, but this is a surprisingly easy read. Leonard Susskind is an engaging and clear writer, making even the utter insanity of quantum mechanics and string theory relatively straightforward. (Well, for quantum mechanics. It's not straightforward compared to any other topic.) I'd previously read a book about quantum computing, and now I wish I'd read this one first. I suspect I'll get a LOT more out of additional books on this topic, thanks to Susskind's excellent primer."
88,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4852263-stacey,4,"In addition to the excellent explanations regarding the nature of black holes- and the scientists involved in the ""war"" over said nature- this book provides a comprehensive explanation of various related subjects in astronomy, cosmology, and physics in general. If you're interested in physics or cosmology, I recommend that you read this book. While it tackles fairly complex concepts, Susskind effectively uses imagery and real-life scenarios to bring theories to life for laymen and science enthusiasts alike. "
89,0316016403,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31488314-jo-watson,5,"I am a huge fan of Susskind. I have watched a lot of his lectures and his witty, humorous personality comes through in this book too. His ability to articulate difficult principles, using down -to- each easy to grasp analogies can be compared to Briane Greene. If only I had the brain for maths, because I would love to work in this field. To have it intrinsically divided down the middle like this, with a constant battle between 'the big' and 'the small' and an endless fascinating search for something that unifies- what an exciting place to be everyday.

I get the impression that Leonard Susskind is one of those professors you have who spends 40 minutes of every 50 minute class talking about various things tangentially-related to the subject matter.

There were only a few times I felt lost in a field that is way beyond my current knowledge base. To me this means that Susskind's ability to explain is quite amazing. If you want to be even more fascinated by the universe we live in and can know about this is one of those books to read.

Leonard Susskind is very good at explaining conventional physics and comes as close as one can in explaining things that, in the end, won't make sense to most of us. Besides the physics he has wonderful stories about others in the field. He is very good at handling both sides of the story and he is as unbiased as someone who has a strong opinion can be."

I recommend it! "

If you want to be even more fascinated by the universe we live in and can know about this is one of those books to read.

Leonard Susskind is very good at explaining conventional physics and comes as close as one can in explaining things that, in the end, won't make sense to most of us. Besides the physics he has wonderful stories about others in the field. He is very good at handling both sides of the story and he is as unbiased as someone who has a strong opinion can be."

AND then, I read a book like this and find myself proud that I can even follow ANY of the physics in the book and fascinated with the argument (even if I can't really tell you the basic arguments!) Any rate, it was a fun read and in my opinion written for the lay man, with only a few times when I felt there were unnecessary explanations of basic concepts (like Big Bang Theory exposition at times, lol)! I recommend it! "

I read it again after watching the movie ""Interstellar"", which popularizes wormholes and black holes but skips over the Holographic Principle, the focus of this book. Stories and debates surrounding the physical concepts of black holes are enjoyably narrated by Susskind as well as how he and t'Hooft came up with the Holographic Principle. He also has the best visual metaphors I've ever seen to explain string theory. Personal stories with his fellow physicists, some with colorful characters, round up the story. Overall, enjoyable to read and to learn. "

He walks you thro, I found it pretty how you could fully understand how Hawking has shaked modern physics foundation without having to be an expert, virtually no need to know about thermodynamics or quantum mechanics or general Relativity in prior, he simply walks you through and leaves you with a fleshy kick to look it up yourself. It's a definite recommendation. Y and yes : in principle, you can't rely on this to understand black holes as a whole, it's merely the war chapter in the story. Beautiful piece of work tho. "

A lucid, readily understood account not just of the astrophysics and quantum mechanics governing our current understanding of black holes, but also of the human relationships among the world's great living theoretical physicists. Mind-stretching but within reach, this book proves that Leonard Sussking can write for a lay audience every bit as well as his dear friend and ""rival,"" Stephen Hawking. I'm impressed!"

I have no physics training, although I'm fairly well educated in other areas of science. I felt I had a pretty good grasp of the book when I finished, but I'm not sure how well I could discuss what I read with someone else. Theories like the holographic principle are fascinating, but you'd probably have to read a book on just that to really understand it. "

The main idea I got from this book is: modern physics is mind-bendingly weird. The author does his best to convey the concepts, but I had a hard time retaining the concepts because there were so many of them and they were so strange. I do finally understand what quarks are, though! I think non-science types might have a hard time with the book, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. "

In a nutshell, it describes a battle of egos that, after the first two hundred pages of fluff, becomes tiring. There are bits of fascinating physics sprinkled here and there but the topic is limited and could have been covered in a single chapter. This is all the more disappointing in light of Susskind's earlier Cosmic Landscape, which dealt with a fascinating topic with far-reaching philosophical implications. Read that book instead."

The battle of egos between Leonard Susskind and Stephen Hawking was less interesting. I get the impression that Leonard Susskind is one of those professors you have who spends 40 minutes of every 50 minute class talking about various things tangentially-related to the subject matter. It's ok, but he's good at explaining science and I wish he would have stuck to that."

If you want to be even more fascinated by the universe we live in and can know about this is one of those books to read.
