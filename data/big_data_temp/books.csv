14,14,0465029736,in pursuit of the unknown: 17 equations that changed the world,4.0,ianstewart,"in in pursuit of the unknown, celebrated mathematician ian stewart uses a handful of mathematical equations to explore the vitally important connections between math and human progress. we often overlook the historical link between mathematics and technological advances, says stewart—but this connection is integral to any complete understanding of human history.equations are modeled on the patterns we find in the world around us, says stewart, and it is through equations that we are able to make sense of, and in turn influence, our world. stewart locates the origins of each equation he presents—from pythagoras's theorem to newton's law of gravity to einstein's theory of relativity—within a particular historical moment, elucidating the development of mathematical and philosophical thought necessary for each equation's discovery. none of these equations emerged in a vacuum, stewart shows; each drew, in some way, on past equations and the thinking of the day. in turn, all of these equations paved the way for major developments in mathematics, science, philosophy, and technology. without logarithms (invented in the early 17th century by john napier and improved by henry briggs), scientists would not have been able to calculate the movement of the planets, and mathematicians would not have been able to develop fractal geometry. the wave equation is one of the most important equations in physics, and is crucial for engineers studying the vibrations in vehicles and the response of buildings to earthquakes. and the equation at the heart of information theory, devised by claude shannon, is the basis of digital communication today.an approachable and informative guide to the equations upon which nearly every aspect of scientific and mathematical understanding depends, in pursuit of the unknown is also a reminder that equations have profoundly influenced our thinking and continue to make possible many of the advances that we take for granted.",science nonfiction science mathematics history science physics science popular science reference philosophy science history of science science technology,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.314752391788165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2505476952776605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09605682718131517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15985436404519163,0.18988205379430323,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1375806063657356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29575272047668694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7582762597978748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29315572151797925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

19,19,0199550166,antimatter,4.0,frankclose,"of all the mind-bending discoveries of physics--quarks, black holes, strange attractors, curved space--the existence of antimatter is one of the most bizarre. it is also one of the most difficult, literally and figuratively, to grasp.   antimatter explores this strange mirror world, where particles have identical yet opposite properties to those that make up the familiar matter we encounter everyday, where left becomes right, positive becomes negative, and where--should matter and antimatter meet--the resulting flash of blinding energy would make even thermonuclear explosions look feeble by comparison. antimatter is an idea long beloved of science-fiction writers--but here, renowned science writer frank close shows that the reality of antimatter is even more intriguing than the fiction. we know that at one time antimatter and matter existed in perfect counterbalance, and that antimatter then perpetrated a vanishing act on a cosmic scale that remains one of the great mysteries of the universe. today, antimatter does not exist normally, at least on earth, but we know that it is real, as scientists are now able to make small pieces of it in particle accelerators, such as that at cern in geneva. looking at the remarkable prediction of antimatter and how it grew from the meeting point of relativity and quantum theory in the early 20th century, at the discovery of the first antiparticles, at cosmic rays, annihilation, antimatter bombs, and antiworlds, close separates the facts from the fiction about antimatter, and explains how its existence can give us profound clues about the origins and structure of the universe.  for all those wishing to take a closer look at the flip side of the visible world, this lucidly written book shines a bright light into a truly strange realm.

23,23,0375704051,awakenings,4.1,oliversacks,"per dieci anni, fra il 1917 e il 1927, una grave epidemia di encefalite letargica (malattia del sonno) invase il mondo. quasi cinque milioni di persone furono colpite dal male. poi l’epidemia scomparve, improvvisamente e misteriosamente come era sopraggiunta. una minuscola frazione dei malati sopravvisse, in una sorta di perpetuo torpore, fino al 1969, quando un nuovo farmaco, la l-dopa, permise di risvegliarli. oliver sacks, fra il 1969 e il 1972, somministrò questo farmaco a più di duecento malati al mount carmel hospital di new york. risvegli racconta le storie di venti di loro. già da tali elementi è facile rendersi conto della impressionante singolarità di questo libro. ma qui, ancora una volta, l’elemento decisivo è il narratore: oliver sacks, colui che sa farsi strada all’interno delle esperienze più remote e inaccessibili dei suoi pazienti. ciascuna delle persone di cui sacks qui racconta è un mondo a parte, ma tutte sono unite da una caratteristica: quella di aver passato la maggior parte della loro vita in una zona inesplorata e muta, vicino «al cuore oscuro dell’essere», e di essere stati sbalzati dalla «notte encefalitica» verso le «tribolazioni» e le meraviglie del risveglio. sconvolgente è la varietà e la qualità delle esperienze che queste persone tentano disperatamente di comunicarci. e stupefacente è la capacità che qui sacks dimostra nel capire e ricostruire il tessuto drammatico di tali esperienze. confidando, come il grande lurija, in una visione della medicina come «scienza romantica», sacks rivendica la definizione della malattia che leggiamo in novalis: «ogni malattia è un problema musicale. ogni cura è una soluzione musicale». appunto questo presupposto gli ha permesso di accedere ai mondi murati di persone che vivevano nell’oscillazione fra una terribile presenza e una terribile assenza. e questo contatto si è rivelato essere il più grande aiuto che possiamo dare a chi cerca, con pena infinita, di trovare un accomodamento con la realtà. dietro le cartelle cliniche, qui si apre uno sconfinato paesaggio, «un paesaggio molto variato, in parte familiare, in parte inquietante, con altopiani battuti dal sole, abissi senza fondo, vulcani, geyser, praterie, paludi; qualcosa come il parco di yellowstone: arcaico, preumano, quasi preistorico, con una sensazione di potenti forze sobbollenti tutt’intorno». risvegli apparve nel 1973 e da allora l’autore lo ha più volte rielaborato nelle successive edizioni.",nonfiction science psychology health medicine biology neuroscience medical history health autobiography memoir biography,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36115103359689843,0.30390268202367154,0.18503007424232046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5361751663860629,0.0,0.0,0.16171296054963732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28888894857078284,0.2843580628442381,0.3518681576697046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29364093877143194,0.0,0.09870383393273666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18910583540697692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09739647901464416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

63,14,0553805371,the grand design,4.0,stephenhawking,"the first major work in nearly a decade by one of the world’s great thinkers—a marvelously concise book with new answers to the ultimate questions of life when and how did the universe begin? why are we here? why is there something rather than nothing? what is the nature of reality? why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? and, finally, is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation? the most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet—if only to disagree. in their new book, stephen hawking and leonard mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. in the grand design they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. when applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. but the “top-down” approach to cosmology that hawking and mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. the authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.along the way hawking and mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. and they conclude with a riveting assessment of m-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete “theory of everything.” if confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason.a succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, the grand design is a book that will inform—and provoke—like no other.'",science nonfiction science physics philosophy science popular science science astronomy audiobook religion history space,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3292417563181716,0.0,0.194361258812042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20273289570891304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12374094199217386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20592528578082767,0.2446071236515519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17723210656766464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4161168548692189,0.0,0.0,0.6105098241779569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3433461067995807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

65,16,1910701882,homo deus: a history of tomorrow,4.2,yuvalnoahharari,"yuval noah harari, author of the critically-acclaimed new york times bestseller and international phenomenon sapiens, returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity’s future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods.over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. this may seem hard to accept, but, as harari explains in his trademark style—thorough, yet riveting—famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. for the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. the average american is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at mcdonalds than from being blown up by al qaeda.what then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? as the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? homo deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. it asks the fundamental questions: where do we go from here? and how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? this is the next stage of evolution. this is homo deus.with the same insight and clarity that made sapiens an international hit and a new york times bestseller, harari maps out our future.

70,21,1400052173,the immortal life of henrietta lacks,4.1,rebeccaskloot,"her name was henrietta lacks, but scientists know her as hela. she was a poor southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. the first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. if you could pile all hela cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred empire state buildings. hela cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.yet henrietta lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.now rebecca skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored” ward of johns hopkins hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of hela cells; from henrietta’s small, dying hometown of clover, virginia — a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo — to east baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating hela began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. and though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. as rebecca skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on african americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.over the decade it took to uncover this story, rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the lacks family—especially henrietta’s daughter deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. she was consumed with questions: had scientists cloned her mother? did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? what happened to her sister, elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? and if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, the immortal life of henrietta lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.",nonfiction science history biography health medicine audiobook book club medical biography memoir historical,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12172417107054968,0.0,0.47721166019034955,0.0,0.0,0.4596318891364386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4596318891364386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21048600130814235,0.0,0.2916106344896937,0.12696714267921122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22681796330341294,0.22326058847983574,0.2762653928743547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07749622369987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07646976844326199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

105,6,0425181642,e=mc²: a biography of the world's most famous equation,4.1,davidbodanis,"e=mc². just about everyone has at least heard of albert einstein's formulation of 1905, which came into the world as something of an afterthought. but far fewer can explain his insightful linkage of energy to mass. david bodanis offers an easily grasped gloss on the equation. mass, he writes, ""is simply the ultimate type of condensed or concentrated energy,"" whereas energy ""is what billows out as an alternate form of mass under the right circumstances."" just what those circumstances are occupies much of bodanis's book, which pays homage to einstein and, just as important, to predecessors such as maxwell, faraday, and lavoisier, who are not as well known as einstein today. balancing writerly energy and scholarly weight, bodanis offers a primer in modern physics and cosmology, explaining that the universe today is an expression of mass that will, in some vastly distant future, one day slide back to the energy side of the equation, replacing the ""dominion of matter"" with ""a great stillness""--a vision that is at once lovely and profoundly frightening. without sliding into easy psychobiography, bodanis explores other circumstances as well; namely, einstein's background and character, which combined with a sterling intelligence to afford him an idiosyncratic view of the way things work--a view that would change the world. --gregory mcnamee",science nonfiction history science physics biography science popular science science mathematics science history of science audiobook historical,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1584102976719248,0.0,0.3105186113752737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3794983938484802,0.3304668693075007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2630566586014786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10085260599253833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19936219546605927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14444952111344625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6966175306698611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

114,15,0393314251,the mismeasure of man,4.0,stephenjaygould,"the definitive refutation to the argument of the bell curve.how smart are you? if that question doesn't spark a dozen more questions in your mind (like ""what do you mean by 'smart,'"" ""how do i measure it"" and ""who's asking?""), then the mismeasure of man, stephen jay gould's masterful demolition of the iq industry, should be required reading. gould's brilliant, funny, engaging prose dissects the motivations behind those who would judge intelligence, and hence worth, by cranial size, convolutions, or score on extremely narrow tests. how did scientists decide that intelligence was unipolar and quantifiable? why did the standard keep changing over time? gould's answer is clear and simple: power maintains itself. european men of the 19th century, even before darwin, saw themselves as the pinnacle of creation and sought to prove this assertion through hard measurement. when one measure was found to place members of some ""inferior"" group such as women or southeast asians over the supposedly rightful champions, it would be discarded and replaced with a new, more comfortable measure. the 20th-century obsession with numbers led to the institutionalization of iq testing and subsequent assignment to work (and rewards) commensurate with the score, shown by gould to be not simply misguided--for surely intelligence is multifactorial--but also regressive, creating a feedback loop rewarding the rich and powerful. the revised edition includes a scathing critique of herrnstein and murray's the bell curve, taking them to task for rehashing old arguments to exploit a new political wave of uncaring belt tightening. it might not make you any smarter, but the mismeasure of man will certainly make you think.--rob lightnerthis edition is revised and expanded, with a new introduction",science nonfiction history psychology anthropology science biology biology evolution sociology philosophy education,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41398017621285105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46652551405136644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4278952716392698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32040058933421456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2038674587310206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1244334388689839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20707771451592213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23840096653102497,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24557057886488884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3288718990285153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

126,27,1594200823,the omnivore's dilemma: a natural history of four meals,4.2,michaelpollan,"what should we have for dinner? for omnivore's like ourselves, this simple question has always posed a dilemma: when you can eat just about anything nature (or the supermarket) has to offer, deciding what you should eat will inevitably stir anxiety, especially when some of the foods on offer might shorten your life. today, buffeted by one food fad after another, america is suffering from what can only be described as a national eating disorder. the omnivore's dilemma has returned with a vengeance, as the cornucopia of the modern american supermarket and fast-food outlet confronts us with a bewildering and treacherous food landscape. what's at stake in our eating choices is not only our own and our children's health, but the health of the environment that sustains life on earth.the omnivore's dilemma is a groundbreaking book in which one of america's most fascinating, original, and elegant writers turns his own omnivorous mind to the seemingly straightforward question of what we should have for dinner. the question has confronted us since man discovered fire, but, according to michael pollan, the bestselling author of the botany of desire, how we answer it today, ath the dawn of the twenty-first century, may well determine our very survival as a species. should we eat a fast-food hamburger? something organic> or perhaps something we hunt, gather or grow ourselves?to find out, pollan follows each of the food chains that sustain us--industrial food, organic or alternative food, and food we forage ourselves--from the source to a final meal, and in the process develops a definitive account of the american way of eating. his absorbing narrative takes us from iowa cornfields to food laboratories, from feedlots and fast-food restaurants to organic farms and hunting grounds, always emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the handful of plant and animal species we depend on. each time pollan sits down to a meal, he deploys his unique blend of personal and investigative journalism to trace the origins of everything consumed, revealing what we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods and flavors reflects our evolutionary inheritance.the surprising answers pollan offers to the simple question posed by this book have profound political, economic, psychological, and even mortal implications for all of us. ultimately, this is a book as much about visionary solutions as it is about problems, and pollan contends that, when it comes to food, doing the right thing often turns out to be the tastiest thing an eater can do. beautifully written and thrillingly argued, the omnivore's dilemma promises to change the way we think about the politics and pleasure of eating. for anyone who reads it, dinner will never again look, or taste, quite the same.--jacket",nonfiction food and drink food science health history health nutrition environment food and drink cooking audiobook politics,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.074010868446399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2794659021414126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4737254979682351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.136816059091229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7105882469523526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2559598741255185,0.0,0.0,0.07719870598584672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04711934176178971,0.0,0.0,0.2606137065447821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15676231070104588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04649523527336762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

128,29,0,"scale: the universal laws of growth, innovation, sustainability, and the pace of life in organisms, cities, economies, and companies",4.1,geoffreyb.west,"the former head of the sante fe institute, visionary physicist geoffrey west is a pioneer in the field of complexity science, the science of emergent systems and networks. the term “complexity” can be misleading, however, because what makes west’s discoveries so beautiful is that he has found an underlying simplicity that unites the seemingly complex and diverse phenomena of living systems, including our bodies, our cities and our businesses.  fascinated by issues of aging and mortality, west applied the rigor of a physicist to the biological question of why we live as long as we do and no longer. the result was astonishing, and changed science, creating a new understanding of energy use and metabolism: west found that despite the riotous diversity in the sizes of mammals, they are all, to a large degree, scaled versions of each other. if you know the size of a mammal, you can use scaling laws to learn everything from how much food it eats per day, what its heart-rate is, how long it will take to mature, its lifespan, and so on. furthermore, the efficiency of the mammal’s circulatory systems scales up precisely based on weight: if you compare a mouse, a human and an elephant on a logarithmic graph, you find with every doubling of average weight, a species gets 25% more efficient—and lives 25% longer. this speaks to everything from how long we can expect to live to how many hours of sleep we need. fundamentally, he has proven, the issue has to do with the fractal geometry of the networks that supply energy and remove waste from the organism's body.  west's work has been game-changing for biologists, but then he made the even bolder move of exploring his work's applicability to cities. cities, too, are constellations of networks and laws of scalability relate with eerie precision to them. for every doubling in a city's size, the city needs 15% less road, electrical wire, and gas stations to support the same population. more amazingly, for every doubling in size, cities produce 15% more patents and more wealth, as well as 15% more crime and disease. this broad pattern lays the groundwork for a new science of cities. recently, west has applied his revolutionary work on cities and biological life to the business world. this investigation has led to powerful insights into why some companies thrive while others fail. the implications of these discoveries are far-reaching, and are just beginning to be explored.  scale is a thrilling scientific adventure story about the elemental natural laws that bind us together in simple but profound ways. through the brilliant mind of geoffrey west, we can envision how cities, companies and biological life alike are dancing to the same simple, powerful tune, however diverse and unrelated they are to each other.from the hardcover edition.",science nonfiction economics business science biology science physics science mathematics science popular science philosophy environment sustainability,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1823072568322541,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28017358047089674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31378013929472326,0.0,0.0,0.282379729062728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25366341214635624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09725135374229806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1618422527704831,0.19224335557125175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.139291507021134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5757794235447192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47137362908396957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

143,44,0525951334,from eternity to here: the quest for the ultimate theory of time,4.0,seancarroll,"a rising star in theoretical physics offers his awesome vision of our universe and beyond, all beginning with a simple question: why does time move forward? time moves forward, not backward, everyone knows you can’t unscramble an egg. in the hands of one of today’s hottest young physicists, that simple fact of breakfast becomes a doorway to understanding the big bang, the universe, and other universes, too. in from eternity to here, sean carroll argues that the arrow of time, pointing resolutely from the past to the future, owes its existence to conditions before the big bang itself, a period modern cosmology of which einstein never dreamed. increasingly, though, physicists are going out into realms that make the theory of relativity seem like child’s play. carroll’s scenario is not only elegant, it’s laid out in the same easy-to- understand language that has made his group blog, cosmic variance, the most popular physics blog on the net. from eternity to here uses ideas at the cutting edge of theoretical physics to explore how properties of spacetime before the big bang can explain the flow of time we experience in our everyday lives. carroll suggests that we live in a baby universe, part of a large family of universes in which many of our siblings experience an arrow of time running in the opposite direction. it’s an ambitious, fascinating picture of the universe on an ultra-large scale, one that will captivate fans of popular physics blockbusters like elegant universe and a brief history of time.",science nonfiction science physics philosophy science astronomy science popular science space history audiobook unfinished,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3292417563181716,0.0,0.194361258812042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20273289570891304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12374094199217386,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20592528578082767,0.2446071236515519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17723210656766464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6105098241779569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3433461067995807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4161168548692189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

168,19,1439171211,the moral landscape: how science can determine human values,3.9,samharris,"sam harris' first book, the end of faith, ignited a worldwide debate about the validity of religion. in the aftermath, harris discovered that most people - from religious fundamentalists to non-believing scientists - agree on one point: science has nothing to say on the subject of human values. indeed, our failure to address questions of meaning and morality through science has now become the most common justification for religious faith. it is also the primary reason why so many secularists and religious moderates feel obligated to ""respect"" the hardened superstitions of their more devout neighbors.in this explosive new book, sam harris tears down the wall between scientific facts and human values, arguing that most people are simply mistaken about the relationship between morality and the rest of human knowledge. harris urges us to think about morality in terms of human and animal well-being, viewing the experiences of conscious creatures as peaks and valleys on a ""moral landscape."" because there are definite facts to be known about where we fall on this landscape, harris foresees a time when science will no longer limit itself to merely describing what people do in the name of ""morality""; in principle, science should be able to tell us what we ought to do to live the best lives possible.bringing a fresh perspective to age-old questions of right and wrong and good and evil, harris demonstrates that we already know enough about the human brain and its relationship to events in the world to say that there are right and wrong answers to the most pressing questions of human life. because such answers exist, moral relativism is simply false - and comes at increasing cost to humanity. and the intrusions of religion into the sphere of human values can be finally repelled: for just as there is no such thing as christian physics or muslim algebra, there can be no christian or muslim morality.using his expertise in philosophy and neuroscience, along with his experience on the front lines of our ""culture wars,"" harris delivers a game-changing book about the future of science and about the real basis of human cooperation.",philosophy science nonfiction religion psychology religion atheism biology neuroscience sociology audiobook politics,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3660386692701093,0.1571333658188241,0.0,0.0,0.18753417780939768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2976149269202692,0.0,0.10003964176639439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16648242278177663,0.0,0.0,0.3328239491181123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19166509826701106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.672827932677419,0.0,0.0,0.09871459376717853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26440020676827214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

170,21,0061707803,sex at dawn: the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality,4.0,christopherryan,"since darwin's day, we've been told that sexual monogamy comes naturally to our species. mainstream science--as well as religious and cultural institutions--has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. but this narrative is collapsing. fewer and fewer couples are getting married, and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages.how can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? it can't be, according to renegade thinkers christopher ryan and cacilda jethá. while debunking almost everything we ""know"" about sex, they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book.ryan and jethá's central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food, child care, and, often, sexual partners. weaving together convergent, frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology, archaeology, primatology, anatomy, and psychosexuality, the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar, intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. the authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love, cooperation, and generosity.with intelligence, humor, and wonder, ryan and jethá show how our promiscuous past haunts our struggles over monogamy, sexual orientation, and family dynamics. they explore why long-term fidelity can be so difficult for so many; why sexual passion tends to fade even as love deepens; why many middle-aged men risk everything for transient affairs with younger women; why homosexuality persists in the face of standard evolutionary logic; and what the human body reveals about the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality.in the tradition of the best historical and scientific writing, sex at dawn unapologetically upends unwarranted assumptions and unfounded conclusions while offering a revolutionary understanding of why we live and love as we do.",nonfiction science history sexuality psychology anthropology relationships sociology biology evolution science biology,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31658245013640746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35676536891368127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24501947055653675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15590326130728846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09515780034787794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18231201984047238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5643831073543853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877948269157943,0.0,0.0,0.4783457776559586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2514977227361946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

173,24,074320011X,parasite rex: inside the bizarre world of nature's most dangerous creatures,4.2,carlzimmer,"for centuries, parasites have lived in nightmares, horror stories, and in the darkest shadows of science. now award-winning writer carl zimmer takes us on a fantastic voyage into the secret parasite universe we actually live in but haven't recognized. he reveals not only that parasites are the most successful life-forms on earth, but that they triggered the development of sex, shape ecosystems, and have driven the engine of evolution. in mapping the parasite universe, zimmer makes the astonishing observation that most species are parasites, and that almost every animal, including humans, will at one time or another become the home of a parasite. zimmer shows how highly evolved parasites are and describes the frightening and amazing ingenuity these commando invaders use to devour their hosts from the inside and control their behavior. the sinister sacculina carcini makes its home in an unlucky crab and proceeds to eat everything but what the crab needs to put food in its mouth, which sacculina then consumes. when sacculina finally reproduces, it places its young precisely where the crab would nurture its own progeny, and then has the crab nurture the foster family members. single-celled toxoplasma gondi has an even more insidious role, for it can invade the human brain. there it makes men distrustful and less willing to submit to social mores. women become more outgoing and warm-hearted. why would a parasite cause these particular personality changes? it seems toxoplasma wants its host to be less afraid, to be more prone to danger and a violent end -- so that, in the carnage, it will be able to move on to another host. from the steamy jungles of costa rica to the fetid parasite heaven of rebel-held southern sudan, zimmer tracks the genius of parasitic life and its impact on humanity. we hosts have developed remarkable defenses against the indomitable parasite: our mighty immune system, our culturally enforced habit of keeping clean, and, perhaps most intriguingly, sex. but this is not merely a book about the evil power of parasitism and how we must defend against it. on the contrary, zimmer concludes that humankind itself is a new kind of parasite, one that preys on the entire earth. if we are to achieve the sophistication of the parasites on display here in vivid detail, if we are to promote the flourishing of life in all its diversity as they do, we must learn the ways nature lives with itself, the laws of parasite rex.",science nonfiction science biology environment nature health medicine medical science popular science animals biology evolution health,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36919798696434425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34510972851178623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26727403321014825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2370146049246355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5000248388376137,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2694113025127756,0.26518590091411987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2572826789049369,0.0,0.0,0.0920489641240388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1318402103331861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36331901793140847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

189,40,0786884061,the man who loved only numbers: the story of  paul erdős and the search for mathematical truth,4.1,paulhoffman,"paul erdos was an amazing and prolific mathematician whose life as a world-wandering numerical nomad was legendary. he published almost 1500 scholarly papers before his death in 1996, and he probably thought more about math problems than anyone in history. like a traveling salesman offering his thoughts as wares, erdos would show up on the doorstep of one mathematician or another and announce, ""my brain is open."" after working through a problem, he'd move on to the next place, the next solution. hoffman's book, like sylvia nasar's biography of john nash, a beautiful mind, reveals a genius's life that transcended the merely quirky. but erdos's brand of madness was joyful, unlike nash's despairing schizophrenia. erdos never tried to dilute his obsessive passion for numbers with ordinary emotional interactions, thus avoiding hurting the people around him, as nash did. oliver sacks writes of erdos: ""a mathematical genius of the first order, paul erdos was totally obsessed with his subject--he thought and wrote mathematics for nineteen hours a day until the day he died. he traveled constantly, living out of a plastic bag, and had no interest in food, sex, companionship, art--all that is usually indispensable to a human life."" the man who loved only numbers is easy to love, despite his strangeness. it's hard not to have affection for someone who referred to children as ""epsilons,"" from the greek letter used to represent small quantities in mathematics; a man whose epitaph for himself read, ""finally i am becoming stupider no more""; and whose only really necessary tool to do his work was a quiet and open mind. hoffman, who followed and spoke with erdos over the last 10 years of his life, introduces us to an undeniably odd, yet pure and joyful, man who loved numbers more than he loved god--whom he referred to as sf, for supreme fascist. he was often misunderstood, and he certainly annoyed people sometimes, but paul erdos is no doubt missed. --therese littleton",biography science mathematics nonfiction science history biography memoir science popular science autobiography memoir biography autobiography humor,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4843918123542006,0.6114116694833659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10844830383239816,0.0,0.0,0.21357074082688396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17265300147593993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4719412067185222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06619298376195613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09480711689484858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26126497004286303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

192,43,0553418815,weapons of math destruction: how big data increases inequality and threatens democracy,3.9,"""cathyoneil""","a former wall street quant sounds an alarm on mathematical modeling—a pervasive new force in society that threatens to undermine democracy and widen inequality.   we live in the age of the algorithm. increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives—where we go to school, whether we get a car loan, how much we pay for health insurance—are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. in theory, this should lead to greater fairness: everyone is judged according to the same rules, and bias is eliminated. but as cathy o’neil reveals in this shocking book, the opposite is true. the models being used today are opaque, unregulated, and uncontestable, even when they’re wrong. most troubling, they reinforce discrimination: if a poor student can’t get a loan because a lending model deems him too risky (by virtue of his race or neighborhood), he’s then cut off from the kind of education that could pull him out of poverty, and a vicious spiral ensues. models are propping up the lucky and punishing the downtrodden, creating a “toxic cocktail for democracy.” welcome to the dark side of big data.   tracing the arc of a person’s life, from college to retirement, o’neil exposes the black box models that shape our future, both as individuals and as a society. models that score teachers and students, sort resumes, grant (or deny) loans, evaluate workers, target voters, set parole, and monitor our health—all have pernicious feedback loops. they don’t simply describe reality, as proponents claim, they change reality, by expanding or limiting the opportunities people have. o’neil calls on modelers to take more responsibility for how their algorithms are being used. but in the end, it’s up to us to become more savvy about the models that govern our lives. this important book empowers us to ask the tough questions, uncover the truth, and demand change.",nonfiction science politics science technology science mathematics business economics sociology audiobook science computer science,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15966479314204837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29284944282548886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4077118142484304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3279764594781597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26513987788362936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10165128599773486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3381857615774243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5015244570052273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2686597089064181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3102294440107533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
193,44,038535066X,the invention of nature: alexander von humboldt's new world,4.3,andreawulf,"the acclaimed author of founding gardeners reveals the forgotten life of alexander von humboldt, the visionary german naturalist whose ideas changed the way we see the natural world—and in the process created modern environmentalism. alexander von humboldt (1769 – 1859) was an intrepid explorer and the most famous scientist of his age. in north america, his name still graces four counties, thirteen towns, a river, parks, bays, lakes, and mountains. his restless life was packed with adventure and discovery, whether he was climbing the highest volcanoes in the world or racing through anthrax-infected siberia or translating his research into bestselling publications that changed science and thinking. among humboldt’s most revolutionary ideas was a radical vision of nature, that it is a complex and interconnected global force that does not exist for the use of humankind alone. now andrea wulf brings the man and his achievements back into focus: his daring expeditions and investigation of wild environments around the world and his discoveries of similarities between climate and vegetation zones on different continents. she also discusses his prediction of human-induced climate change, his remarkable ability to fashion poetic narrative out of scientific observation, and his relationships with iconic figures such as simón bolívar and thomas jefferson. wulf examines how humboldt’s writings inspired other naturalists and poets such as darwin, wordsworth, and goethe, and she makes the compelling case that it was humboldt’s influence that led john muir to his ideas of natural preservation and that shaped thoreau’s walden. with this brilliantly researched and compellingly written book, andrea wulf shows the myriad fundamental ways in which humboldt created our understanding of the natural world, and she champions a renewed interest in this vital and lost player in environmental history and science.",nonfiction science history biography environment nature science natural history environment science biology travel audiobook,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14820694498398823,0.0,0.29051782257180847,0.17688074985462604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.547948985555957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30918119489884593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36602095810495605,0.26373265897520476,0.0,0.0,0.09435659706153719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27932046687851814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4195912852981635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

209,10,0192880519,the extended phenotype: the long reach of the gene,4.1,richarddawkins,"people commonly view evolution as a process of competition between individuals—known as “survival of the fittest”—with the individual representing the “unit of selection.” richard dawkins offers a controversial reinterpretation of that idea in the extended phenotype, now being reissued to coincide with the publication of the second edition of his highly-acclaimed the selfish gene. he proposes that we look at evolution as a battle between genes instead of between whole organisms. we can then view changes in phenotypes—the end products of genes, like eye color or leaf shape, which are usually considered to increase the fitness of an individual—as serving the evolutionary interests of genes.dawkins makes a convincing case that considering one’s body, personality, and environment as a field of combat in a kind of “arms race” between genes fighting to express themselves on a strand of dna can clarify and extend the idea of survival of the fittest. this influential and controversial book illuminates the complex world of genetics in an engaging, lively manner.",science nonfiction science biology biology evolution biology genetics science popular science philosophy religion atheism psychology anthropology,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31203387812222577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3431738185238525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5274591891964144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24149909630261687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3582146725019303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09379059851023043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15608298668839612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13433472448643174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17969260947537477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3153996425115876,0.0,0.0,0.3701932820886242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

221,22,1594205078,behave: the biology of humans at our best and worst,4.4,robertm.sapolsky,"why do we do the things we do? more than a decade in the making, this game-changing book is robert sapolsky's genre-shattering attempt to answer that question as fully as perhaps only he could, looking at it from every angle. sapolsky's storytelling concept is delightful but it also has a powerful intrinsic logic: he starts by looking at the factors that bear on a person's reaction in the precise moment a behavior occurs, and then hops back in time from there, in stages, ultimately ending up at the deep history of our species and its evolutionary legacy. and so the first category of explanation is the neurobiological one. a behavior occurs--whether an example of humans at our best, worst, or somewhere in between. what went on in a person's brain a second before the behavior happened? then sapolsky pulls out to a slightly larger field of vision, a little earlier in time: what sight, sound, or smell caused the nervous system to produce that behavior? and then, what hormones acted hours to days earlier to change how responsive that individual is to the stimuli that triggered the nervous system? by now he has increased our field of vision so that we are thinking about neurobiology and the sensory world of our environment and endocrinology in trying to explain what happened. sapolsky keeps going: how was that behavior influenced by structural changes in the nervous system over the preceding months, by that person's adolescence, childhood, fetal life, and then back to his or her genetic makeup? finally, he expands the view to encompass factors larger than one individual. how did culture shape that individual's group, what ecological factors millennia old formed that culture? and on and on, back to evolutionary factors millions of years old. the result is one of the most dazzling tours d'horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, a majestic synthesis that harvests cutting-edge research across a range of disciplines to provide a subtle and nuanced perspective on why we ultimately do the things we do...for good and for ill. sapolsky builds on this understanding to wrestle with some of our deepest and thorniest questions relating to tribalism and xenophobia, hierarchy and competition, morality and free will, and war and peace. wise, humane, often very funny, behave is a towering achievement, powerfully humanizing, and downright heroic in its own right.",science nonfiction psychology science biology biology neuroscience philosophy audiobook sociology history biology evolution,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18696434530764108,0.0,0.0,0.6694097958297621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30649169463764414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19501737820701334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3541156244917886,0.0,0.11903166479123563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19808827373120486,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22805175354758134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23491012618249782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3145952567109904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

247,48,0393020185,the seven daughters of eve: the science that reveals our genetic ancestry,4.0,bryansykes,"one of the most dramatic stories of genetic discovery since james watson's the double helix—a work whose scientific and cultural reverberations will be discussed for years to come.in 1994 professor bryan sykes, a leading world authority on dna and human evolution, was called in to examine the frozen remains of a man trapped in glacial ice in northern italy. news of both the ice man's discovery and his age, which was put at over five thousand years, fascinated scientists and newspapers throughout the world. but what made sykes's story particularly revelatory was his successful identification of a genetic descendant of the ice man, a woman living in great britain today. how was sykes able to locate a living relative of a man who died thousands of years ago?in the seven daughters of eve, he gives us a firsthand account of his research into a remarkable gene, which passes undiluted from generation to generation through the maternal line. after plotting thousands of dna sequences from all over the world, sykes found that they clustered around a handful of distinct groups. among europeans and north american caucasians, there are, in fact, only seven. this conclusion was staggering: almost everyone of native european descent, wherever they may live throughout the world, can trace their ancestry back to one of seven women, the seven daughters of eve.naming them ursula, xenia, helena, velda, tara, katrine, and jasmine, sykes has created portraits of their disparate worlds by mapping the migratory patterns followed by millions of their ancestors. in reading the stories of these seven women, we learn exactly how our origins can be traced, how and where our ancient genetic ancestors lived, and how we are each living proof of the almost indestructible strands of dna, which have survived over so many thousands of years. indeed, the seven daughters of eve is filled with dramatic stories: from sykes's identification, using dna samples from two living relatives, of the remains of tsar nicholas and tsaress alexandra, to the caribbean woman whose family had been sold into slavery centuries before and whose ancestry sykes was able to trace back to the eastern coast of central africa. ultimately, sykes's investigation reveals that, as a race, what humans have in common is more deeply embedded than what separates us.",science nonfiction history biology genetics science biology biology evolution anthropology science popular science reference historical,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31885661469066406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5389922801548249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2467795636848902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3660471692812471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3606415881171468,0.15702318968804765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09584136476062073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13727200310079313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29508932570350144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3782876956128727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

261,12,0312427905,the world without us,3.8,alanweisman,"a penetrating, page-turning tour of a post-human earthin the world without us, alan weisman offers an utterly original approach to questions of humanity's impact on the planet: he asks us to envision our earth, without us. in this far-reaching narrative, weisman explains how our massive infrastructure would collapse and finally vanish without human presence; which everyday items may become immortalized as fossils; how copper pipes and wiring would be crushed into mere seams of reddish rock; why some of our earliest buildings might be the last architecture left; and how plastic, bronze sculpture, radio waves, and some man-made molecules may be our most lasting gifts to the universe.the world without us reveals how, just days after humans disappear, floods in new york's subways would start eroding the city's foundations, and how, as the world's cities crumble, asphalt jungles would give way to real ones. it describes the distinct ways that organic and chemically treated farms would revert to wild, how billions more birds would flourish, and how cockroaches in unheated cities would perish without us. drawing on the expertise of engineers, atmospheric scientists, art conservators, zoologists, oil refiners, marine biologists, astrophysicists, religious leaders from rabbis to the dalai lama, and paleontologists—who describe a prehuman world inhabited by megafauna like giant sloths that stood taller than mammoths—weisman illustrates what the planet might be like today, if not for us.from places already devoid of humans (a last fragment of primeval european forest; the korean dmz; chernobyl), weisman reveals earth's tremendous capacity for self-healing. as he shows which human devastations are indelible, and which examples of our highest art and culture would endure longest, weisman's narrative ultimately drives toward a radical but persuasive solution that needn't depend on our demise. it is narrative nonfiction at its finest, and in posing an irresistible concept with both gravity and a highly readable touch, it looks deeply at our effects on the planet in a way that no other book has.",nonfiction science environment environment nature history biology ecology apocalyptic post apocalyptic audiobook environment sustainability science popular science,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.655930383091775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08685492026221626,0.0,0.0,0.103658863126855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2680203484372728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48167849475643615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09059598398852771,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15455739316607883,0.0,0.0,0.0552965632945155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07920035390759363,0.3279651915458875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16369244289435775,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2680203484372728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
262,13,0307265633,the hidden reality: parallel universes and the deep laws of the cosmos,4.1,briangreene,"from the best-selling author of the elegant universe and the fabric of the cosmos comes his most expansive and accessible book to date—a book that takes on the grandest question: is ours the only universe?there was a time when “universe” meant all there is. everything. yet, in recent years discoveries in physics and cosmology have led a number of scientists to conclude that our universe may be one among many. with crystal-clear prose and inspired use of analogy, brian greene shows how a range of different “multiverse” proposals emerges from theories developed to explain the most refined observations of both subatomic particles and the dark depths of space: a multiverse in which you have an infinite number of doppelgängers, each reading this sentence in a distant universe; a multiverse comprising a vast ocean of bubble universes, of which ours is but one; a multiverse that endlessly cycles through time, or one that might be hovering millimeters away yet remains invisible; another in which every possibility allowed by quantum physics is brought to life. or, perhaps strangest of all, a multiverse made purely of math.greene, one of our foremost physicists and science writers, takes us on a captivating exploration of these parallel worlds and reveals how much of reality’s true nature may be deeply hidden within them. and, with his unrivaled ability to make the most challenging of material accessible and entertaining, greene tackles the core question: how can fundamental science progress if great swaths of reality lie beyond our reach?sparked by greene’s trademark wit and precision, the hidden reality is at once a far-reaching survey of cutting-edge physics and a remarkable journey to the very edge of reality—a journey grounded firmly in science and limited only by our imagination.",science nonfiction science physics philosophy science astronomy science popular science space audiobook unfinished physics quantum mechanics,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2636211071753095,0.0,0.15562342642378096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3675360402364953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09907833227377366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1648826456279526,0.39170973621993743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14190825818347605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3675360402364953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48883008519631604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2749143420659183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33318126844434115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

267,18,0385530803,physics of the future: how science will shape human destiny and our daily lives by the year 2100,4.0,michiokaku,"imagine, if you can, the world in the year 2100.in physics of the future, michio kaku—the new york times bestselling author of physics of the impossible—gives us a stunning, provocative, and exhilarating vision of the coming century based on interviews with over three hundred of the world's top scientists who are already inventing the future in their labs. the result is the most authoritative and scientifically accurate description of the revolutionary developments taking place in medicine, computers, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, energy production, and astronautics.in all likelihood, by 2100 we will control computers via tiny brain sensors and, like magicians, move objects around with the power of our minds. artificial intelligence will be dispersed throughout the environment, and internet-enabled contact lenses will allow us to access the world's information base or conjure up any image we desire in the blink of an eye.meanwhile, cars will drive themselves using gps, and if room-temperature superconductors are discovered, vehicles will effortlessly fly on a cushion of air, coasting on powerful magnetic fields and ushering in the age of magnetism.using molecular medicine, scientists will be able to grow almost every organ of the body and cure genetic diseases. millions of tiny dna sensors and nanoparticles patrolling our blood cells will silently scan our bodies for the first sign of illness, while rapid advances in genetic research will enable us to slow down or maybe even reverse the aging process, allowing human life spans to increase dramatically.in space, radically new ships—needle-sized vessels using laser propulsion—could replace the expensive chemical rockets of today and perhaps visit nearby stars. advances in nanotechnology may lead to the fabled space elevator, which would propel humans hundreds of miles above the earth's atmosphere at the push of a button.but these astonishing revelations are only the tip of the iceberg. kaku also discusses emotional robots, antimatter rockets, x-ray vision, and the ability to create new life-forms, and he considers the development of the world economy. he addresses the key questions: who are the winner and losers of the future? who will have jobs, and which nations will prosper?all the while, kaku illuminates the rigorous scientific principles, examining the rate at which certain technologies are likely to mature, how far they can advance, and what their ultimate limitations and hazards are. synthesizing a vast amount of information to construct an exciting look at the years leading up to 2100, physics of the future is a thrilling, wondrous ride through the next 100 years of breathtaking scientific revolution.

270,21,1400063515,the black swan: the impact of the highly improbable,3.9,nassimnicholastaleb,"a black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: it is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. the astonishing success of google was a black swan; so was 9/11. for nassim nicholas taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? part of the answer, according to taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. we concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. we are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”for years, taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. we restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. now, in this revelatory book, taleb explains everything we know about what we don’t know. he offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.elegant, startling, and universal in its applications the black swan will change the way you look at the world. taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. he has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. the black swan is a landmark book – itself a black swan.the book also contains a 4-page glossary; 19 pages of notes; and, a 28-page bibliography in addition to an index.",nonfiction economics business philosophy science psychology economics finance sociology history science mathematics,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2883953984721293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6459763133443766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46997939783766834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16400897245303972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26110727749844864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10010523785763391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1665915854697046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1917907732599575,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19755864204629034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26457357424321193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

(and why should we care?),4.0,briancox,"the most accessible, entertaining, and enlightening explanation of the best-known physics equation in the world, as rendered by two of today’s leading scientists.professor brian cox and professor jeff forshaw go on a journey to the frontier of 21st century science to consider the real meaning behind the iconic sequence of symbols that make up einstein’s most famous equation, e=mc2. breaking down the symbols themselves, they pose a series of questions: what is energy? what is mass? what has the speed of light got to do with energy and mass? in answering these questions, they take us to the site of one of the largest scientific experiments ever conducted. lying beneath the city of geneva, straddling the franco-swiss boarder, is a 27 km particle accelerator, known as the large hadron collider. using this gigantic machine—which can recreate conditions in the early universe fractions of a second after the big bang—cox and forshaw will describe the current theory behind the origin of mass.alongside questions of energy and mass, they will consider the third, and perhaps, most intriguing element of the equation: 'c' - or the speed of light. why is it that the speed of light is the exchange rate? answering this question is at the heart of the investigation as the authors demonstrate how, in order to truly understand why e=mc2, we first must understand why we must move forward in time and not backwards and how objects in our 3-dimensional world actually move in 4-dimensional space-time. in other words, how the very fabric of our world is constructed. a collaboration between two of the youngest professors in the uk, why does e=mc2? promises to be one of the most exciting and accessible explanations of the theory of relativity in recent years.",science nonfiction science physics science popular science science mathematics science astronomy audiobook space reference unfinished,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2855083880322547,0.0,0.16854414312417898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2798849555154501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10730436283919313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2121158213828496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1536902658385616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33038315089051823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.635298551659257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29773924968000254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.36084381821834316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

291,42,0618551050,"the trouble with physics: the rise of string theory, the fall of a science and what comes next",4.0,leesmolin,"in this groundbreaking book, the renowned theoretical physicist lee smolin argues that physics — the basis for all other sciences — has lost its way. for more than two centuries, our understanding of the laws of nature expanded rapidly. but today, despite our best efforts, we know nothing more about these laws than we knew in the 1970s. why is physics suddenly in trouble? and what can we do about it?one of the major problems, according to smolin, is string theory: an ambitious attempt to formulate a “theory of everything” that explains all the particles and forces of nature and how the universe came to be. with its exotic new particles and parallel universes, string theory has captured the public’s imagination and seduced many physicists.but as smolin reveals, there’s a deep flaw in the theory: no part of it has been tested, and no one knows how to test it. in fact, the theory appears to come in an infinite number of versions, meaning that no experiment will ever be able to prove it false. as a scientific theory, it fails. and because it has soaked up the lion’s share of funding, attracted some of the best minds, and effectively penalized young physicists for pursuing other avenues, it is dragging the rest of physics down with it.with clarity, passion, and authority, smolin charts the rise and fall of string theory and takes a fascinating look at what will replace it. a group of young theorists has begun to develop exciting ideas that, unlike string theory, are testable. smolin not only tells us who and what to watch for in the coming years, he offers novel solutions for seeking out and nurturing the best new talent—giving us a chance, at long last, of finding the next einstein.",science science physics nonfiction science popular science philosophy history sociology reference audiobook physics quantum mechanics,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16920870237827812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17649695429000065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39962040339811344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10772745738290243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17927621279478506,0.4259043622020187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15429625716246492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39962040339811344,0.33168583145985114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42520233001060376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28471875252383977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

294,45,0679601279,the character of physical law,4.3,richardp.feynman,"in the messenger lectures, originally delivered at cornell university & recorded for tv by the bbc, feynman offers an overview of selected physical laws & gathers their common features into one broad principle of invariance. he maintains at the outset that the importance of a physical law isn't ""how clever we are to have found it out, but...how clever nature is to pay attention to it"" & tends his discussions toward a final exposition of the elegance & simplicity of all scientific laws. rather than an essay on the most significant achievements in modern science, the character of physical law is a statement of what is most remarkable in nature. his enlightened approach, wit & enthusiasm make this a memorable exposition of the scientist's craft. the law of gravitation is the principal example. relating the details of its discovery & stressing its mathematical character, he uses it to demonstrate the essential interaction of mathematics & physics. he views mathematics as the key to any system of scientific laws, suggesting that if it were possible to fill out the structure of scientific theory completely, the result would be an integrated set of axioms. the principles of conservation, symmetry & time-irreversibility are then considered in relation to developments in classical & modern physics. in his final lecture he develops his own analysis of the process & future of scientific discovery. like any set of oral reflections, the character of physical law has value as a demonstration of a mind in action. the reader is particularly lucky in feynman. one of the most eminent & imaginative modern physicists, he was professor of theoretical physics at the california institute of technology until his death in 1988. he's best known for work on the quantum theory of the electromagnetic field, as well as for later research in the field of low-temperature physics. in 1954 he received the albert einstein award for an ""outstanding contribution to knowledge in mathematical & physical sciences""; in 1965 he was appointed to foreign membership in the royal society & was awarded the nobel prize.",science physics science nonfiction philosophy science popular science science mathematics biography writing essays nobel prize literature 20th century,0.0,0.374596110124955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2085286520197326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34045739796002505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2328979195712055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2877644287206299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1766555961977014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4016935304081783,0.06772752810904743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11270974955053042,0.13388160439114402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09700501940696694,0.0,0.4016935304081783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3341523073299159,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23027678121214676

296,47,0374227764,"other minds: the octopus, the sea, and the deep origins of consciousness",3.9,petergodfrey-smith,"although mammals and birds are widely regarded as the smartest creatures on earth, it has lately become clear that a very distant branch of the tree of life has also sprouted higher intelligence: the cephalopods, consisting of the squid, the cuttlefish, and above all the octopus. in captivity, octopuses have been known to identify individual human keepers, raid neighboring tanks for food, turn off lightbulbs by spouting jets of water, plug drains, and make daring escapes. how is it that a creature with such gifts evolved through an evolutionary lineage so radically distant from our own? what does it mean that evolution built minds not once but at least twice? the octopus is the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien. what can we learn from the encounter? in other minds, peter godfrey-smith, a distinguished philosopher of science and a skilled scuba diver, tells a bold new story of how subjective experience crept into being—how nature became aware of itself. as godfrey-smith stresses, it is a story that largely occurs in the ocean, where animals first appeared. tracking the mind’s fitful development, godfrey-smith shows how unruly clumps of seaborne cells began living together and became capable of sensing, acting, and signaling. as these primitive organisms became more entangled with others, they grew more complicated. the first nervous systems evolved, probably in ancient relatives of jellyfish; later on, the cephalopods, which began as inconspicuous mollusks, abandoned their shells and rose above the ocean floor, searching for prey and acquiring the greater intelligence needed to do so. taking an independent route, mammals and birds later began their own evolutionary journeys. but what kind of intelligence do cephalopods possess? drawing on the latest scientific research and his own scuba-diving adventures, godfrey-smith probes the many mysteries that surround the lineage. how did the octopus, a solitary creature with little social life, become so smart? what is it like to have eight tentacles that are so packed with neurons that they virtually “think for themselves”? what happens when some octopuses abandon their hermit-like ways and congregate, as they do in a unique location off the coast of australia?by tracing the question of inner life back to its roots and comparing human beings with our most remarkable animal relatives, godfrey-smith casts crucial new light on the octopus mind—and on our own.",nonfiction science philosophy animals environment nature psychology science biology audiobook biology neuroscience science natural history,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41898515227499217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16407956632528167,0.0,0.0,0.3916485388801876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3033165278729439,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17114689321885612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4052209569417518,0.2919778173360235,0.3107712221814966,0.0,0.10446197057404422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17384190549518344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20013780039309934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3092350434465393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
