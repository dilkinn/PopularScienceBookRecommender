0,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27488361-ahmed-samir,4,"So this was the true definition of a popular science book. From the get-go, Jim goes on to a number of very interesting examples to put the reader at bay with what lies ahead, and amazingly he moves from one paradox to the other very swiftly. Each paradox is discussed with the utmost care to be as clear as possible. Although I had to re-read some sections to make sure I understood, overall, it was a fantastic read. What I like most is how the author takes time to explain some scientific theories which serve the paradox in such brevity and conciseness that makes it just enough to understand the rest of the paradox (or the solutions he proposes). Good book, highly recommend. "
1,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is an entertaining book about seeming paradoxes in physics. I highly recommend the book to people interested in special relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and mathematics.Is time travel possible? That is covered in chapter 7, ""The Grandfather Paradox"", where Al-Khalili explains what might happen if you went back in time to murder your grandfather. Is it possible? I won't say right here, because it is definitely a spoiler. What about the so-called ""twins paradox"". One twin stays on Earth, while the other goes in a very fast space-ship near the speed of light to a nearby star. When the twin returns, he has hardly aged, while the stay-at-home twin is much older. How can this be? While the space-faring twin travelled fast compared to the stay-at-home twin, from the space-faring twin's point of view, his stay-at-home twin travelled just as fast in the opposite direction. Since everything is ""relative"" why did one twin age faster than the other? The situation sounds completely symmetric--but it isn't.If the universe is infinite in extent, and the density of stars and galaxies is approximately uniform everywhere, then why is the sky dark at night? This is Olber's paradox, and it is very subtle. While more distant stars are fainter (their radiance on Earth is inversely proportion to distance-squared), their numbers increase with distance-squared. Believe it or not, the correct explanation for this conundrum was first written by Edgar Allan Poe! He was not a scientist, and most of his ""science"" explanations were dead-wrong, but on this topic he got it right! Again, I don't want to give away spoilers, so I will refrain from explaining the paradox here.Suppose a runner holds a pole horizontally while running through a barn. The barn doors in the front and the back are both open. When the pole is at rest, its length is exactly the same as the distance between the front and back doors of the barn. Now, suppose the runner can reach a relativistic speed. From the point of view of someone standing at rest near the barn, the pole seems to be ""squashed"", so he could actually close both doors for a tiny fraction of a second, and the pole would fit in the barn. But from the runner's point of view the barn is squashed, so that when he is in the middle of the barn, both ends of his pole would stick out of the doors. How can this be? How can both points of view be correct, when you have such a symmetric scenario?Other paradoxes explained in the book are ""Maxwell's Demon"", ""Schrodinger's Cat', ""Laplace's Demon, and ""Fermi's Paradox"". Ahhh--Fermi's Paradox is so interesting. If the universe is so vast, and there are intelligent life forms out there that have advanced to a high stage of technology, why haven't we heard from any alien civilizations? Simply stated, ""where is everybody?""The book goes into considerable depth, and gives all the background you need to completely understand each paradox. The style is an easy banter, so it is a fun read, as well. If you would like to put on your thinking-cap and be stimulated as well as entertained, this would be a good book for you!"
2,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52763346-farhana,5,"Fascinating ! This book deals with 9 beautiful paradoxes and their explanations. The writer and physicist Jim has done really a good job. He unfolded the paradoxes and explained things so well. The smooth covering of all the details, explanations reveal his expertise on the topics. The writing is very fluent. I believe anyone will enjoy these beautiful paradoxes. O:)"
3,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6789591-retroj,2,"What do you do when a friend recommends a science book to you, and a few chapters in, you realise that it has nothing to teach you? ..and the writing style is bland, and the author is at one time skipping over important distinctions, and at another muddling simple ideas with rambling? You trudge on, and change your purpose from one of learning to one of gathering ammunition for a scathing book review! Let's go!As it turned out, I couldn't make myself finish this book in one effort. I made it all the way to chapter 9 before giving up in frustration — the chapter title was Laplace's Demon but the chapter had precious little to say about Laplace's original formulation, and instead skipped over into a modern reinterpretation, and discussed that instead. Did I mention the rambling? See also chapter 7. So I set the book down, marked it abandoned, and read some other stuff. After a few days, I finally decided to just finish it and put it behind me; only had a few chapters to go, anyway.If it had only been a matter of picking a book below my level of understanding, I would rate it three stars — that's not the book's fault afterall, and I did enjoy chapter 1, and did learn a couple of things here and there — but it wasn't just that. It was all-around mediocrity and wishy-washy writing. I've read clearer explications of most of the topics in this book elsewhere; James Coleman and Brian Greene both come to mind on the topic of relativity. Some instances of intellectual sloppiness stood out, too. In chapter 5, one of Einstein's famous thought experiments is confusingly retold: If you fly at the speed of light holding a mirror before you, can you see your reflection? The text then goes on to consider the question of flying near the speed of light, not at the speed of light, no mention of the discrepency. It might seem a quibble, but they are two different questions. An example of an outright error is in chapter 10, where in reference to infrared light, the parenthetical clarification ""(heat)"" is given. The conflated identification of infrared radiation as heat radiation has dogged popular understanding of physics for two centuries, and I was surprised to see a professional physicist commit the error. (All electromagnetic radiation transmits heat, not just infrared.)To quickly summarize, this is not a good book if your goal is a clarified understanding of physics. It skips, muddles, discurses. It is largely regurgitation of popular physics topics that have been explicated better by other authors in the past. "
4,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2620012-jim,5,"To earn an engineering degree many years ago, I took a lot of math and science courses. I struggled with the advanced mathematics, but I loved the sciences, especially physics, and I've been keen on science ever since. My home library includes many science books, running the gamut from cosmology to quantum mechanics. I don't always understand everything that I read, but I'm always fascinated by a well written book on science. And ""Paradox: The Nine Greatest Enigmas in Physics"" is a well written book. Author Jim Al-Khalili's writing style reminded me a bit of the old TV series ""Connections"" and ""The Day the Universe Changed,"" both hosted by science historian James Burke, who demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events were built from one another successively in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology. Paradox: The Nine Greatest Enigmas in Physics uses an analogous approach in presenting famous paradoxes by describing the background of the paradox, the personalities involved, and how the solutions to the paradox have evolved. It's a very effective approach that makes the book very readable, even for laymen.A few words about the writing style and technical level of the book: this isn't ""Paradoxes for Dummies,"" but it doesn't require a degree in physics to understand and enjoy, just a love of science and learning. The book begins by describing the different types of paradoxes, then focuses on paradoxes in physics which can be resolved with some fundamental scientific knowledge and basic mathematics. The first chapter includes some well known paradoxes that can be resolved without any science. Two of my favorites were the ""Riddle of the Missing Dollar,"" a brainteaser that has been forwarded in emails countless times; and the ""Monty Hall Paradox,"" which I've seen many times, but I'm still amazed at the answer, which is derived through simple logic (hint: if Monty offers you a trade, take it!).As much fun as the first chapter was, the real meat is in the remaining chapters, where the author presents famous paradoxes that have baffled people for years. As an example, one of my favorites is Chapter 3 - ""Olbers's Paradox."" The paradox is familiar to most people as ""Why does it get dark at night?"" The paradox is credited to 19th century German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, although Olbers was not the first to ask the question. The author takes us back to ancient Greece to describe the state of astronomy and the prevailing theories about the Earth's place in the universe, then progresses through the following centuries as knowledge of our universe increases. Olbers proposed an answer, which we now know was incorrect, but he had no way of knowing about the Big Bang and the subsequent expansion of the universe. Surprisingly, the first credible answer was proposed by American writer/poet Edgar Allan Poe in 1848!Another of my favorites was Chapter 7 - ""The Grandfather Paradox."" This chapter included one of the more readable discussions of time travel that I've read. And based on the latest theories of a Quantum Multiverse, you could actually go back in time and kill your grandfather, and not prevent your birth in your own time.Each chapter follows a similar format, with the background of a famous paradox receiving as much attention as the solution itself. The book is a goldmine of fascinating information that covers a broad range of the sciences, as it examines some of the major paradoxes and conundrums that have baffled people for years.Note: I received an advance reader copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for a fair and honest review, which I have done to the best of my ability."
5,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486977-themadhatter,4,"The title of the book I actually read was ""Paradox: The nine greatest enigmas in science"" by the same author. However, given they both have the same ISBN (So I can't add my copy) and the book I read was pretty much enigmas in physics, I am going to post here and assume this is just a publisher's discretion thingo between different country releases :-). Almost like Americans calling the first Harry Potter book a sorcerer's stone (rather than the philosopher's).I really enjoyed this book. I read the first 3/4 of the book before Xmas and then got caught up in the Xmas rush and the book unfortunately found its way under about 10 other books before I managed to find it again and finish it. And I am glad I did. The reason I mention this is that I don't want the duration it took me to finish this book to be indicative of the quality. This was a REALLY engaging book.I really struggle finding books I enjoy in this genre. They are either too simplistic and aimed at people with minimal physics knowledge or they are dry textbooks that don't capture the passion and enthusiasm and dare I say humor that encompasses my world of physics. This book though was perfect. It contained paradoxes that I was familiar with (Grandfather, Twin, Fermi's, Schrodinger's Cat, Monty Hall, Zeno's, my fave Olbers' and a few others) but gave each topic enough depth to convey the main message and the underlying physics. The writing style was easy to read and that was backed up by the credibility of the author as a particle physicist. I loved the humor in the book and actually annoyed my husband by reading out paragraphs to him during long holiday car trips (sucks to be him!). I will definitely be tracking down more of the author's work and hopefully some online lectures he has given. If he is as engaging in person as he is in the written form, then he has a new fan in me. This is a must read for anyone who has an interest in physics - from beginner to enthusiast. Even people with a sound knowledge of physics will find this a good refresher on the topic."
6,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7829591-deidre,3,"Probabilities, puzzles, and problems abound in Jim Al-Khalili's book Paradox: The Nine Great Enigmas is Physics. If ever there was a book to prompt your brain to run in circles it's this one which offers conundrum after conundrum, rapid fire. Your enjoyment of this book will likely depend on how interested in quantum mechanics, physics, philosophy, and metaphysics you are. I've read a bunch of different reviews of the British version, those who have a physics background find it too simplistic, those who have little interest in these matters find it a bit of a muddle. For me it was a slog at times but it's a short book with plenty of depth and fun for those who enjoy puzzling out riddles of logic.Full review over on Yahoo."
7,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47108351-anna-kaling,2,"I really like Jim Al-Khalili's writing style, and how he makes physics accessible without being condescending. But this book isn't really about paradoxes, as the author admits in the preface, just tricky questions that have been solved, and I found most of them uninteresting. There was too much focus on special relativity, so the explanations began to feel repetitive and I didn't learn much.I did really enjoy the chapters on the Game Show Paradox, Shrodinger's Cat, and Fermi's Paradox. I suppose I'm just more interested in probability, quantum mechanics, and aliens than I am in thermodynamics or special relativity. Although I'm also very interested in chaos theory and I didn't particularly enjoy Laplace's Demon so... yeah, I don't really know what my problem with this book was. It's all subjective. I will definitely read more Al-Khalili."
8,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"If you think this book is just a collection of physics paradoxes, you're wrong. In each chapter, Jim Al-Khalili, British theoretical physicist, delves into the real world of science, be it Einstein's theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, etc. The book starts with paradoxes that are less physics related and more probability-like. Then it moves on to more interesting dilemmas like Maxwell's demon and Shrodinger's cat. In the final chapter, Jim discusses the Fermi paradox. How likely is it for alien life forms, being intelligent or not, to exist somewhere in the vastness of space. Remember that some basic knowledge of special and general theories of relativity are required to grasp the concepts hidden behind each paradox. It's an easy read though. No mathematical equations are involved. I, as a science enthusiast, extremely enjoyed the book. I hope you like it too."
9,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10449878-naomi,5,"Excellent explanation of some quite difficult physics concepts, and really interesting paradoxes were explored. This book really makes you question human existence and the uniqueness of our universe. It wasn't too ""dumbed down"" as some popular science books tend to be. Would have liked to have seen some maths in there but one can only dream."
10,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79761603-joel-everett,4,"Great book with lots of great information in there, I’d recommend for GCSE age (about 15/16) because it gives enough information to peak interest but not in any difficult detail. Intriguing read all the same."
11,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3111883-evan,3,"Entertaining and interesting, though at times somewhat difficult to follow and a few parts required a re-listen in order to fully grasp what was being conveyed. Glad to have read it, but wouldn't rush to re-read or recommend..."
12,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"I love books that can get my brain firing and this one certainly did that!The book explained 9 of the greatest enigmas in science - paradoxes that seem inexplicable (could you go back in time and kill your grandfather? And if you did, how would you be here to go back and carry out the act) The Grandfather Paradox was just one of the paradoxes explained, my favourites discussed included Fermi’s Paradox, The Pole in the Barn Paradox, Schrodinger’s Cat (of course!), Maxwell’s and Laplace’s Demon and the Paradox of the Twins. The Game Show Paradox, Achilles and the Tortoise and Olber’s Paradox were also explained. Personally loved delving into the Quantum Multiverse theory and the theory of time in Einstein’s theory of general relativity with concept of lightspeed involved. Jim Al-Khalili is such a fantastic communicator of science, this book was brilliant. This is a book I would read, re-read and read again. A must for any science lover!"
13,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"There is something wonderful about paradoxes - and when I give talks to people about physics, I find it's the paradoxical bits, the ones that seriously bend your mind, that really get them going. That being the case, it's a no-brainer that Jim Al-Khalili's latest book is one to look out for. It's rather unfortunate that he defines paradox incorrectly at the start, saying it is 'a statement that leads to a circular and self-contradictory argument, or describes a situation that is logically impossible' - no, that's a fallacy. The OED defines a paradox as 'a statement or tenet contrary to received opinion or belief, especially one that is difficult to believe' - but there is no suggestion in the main definition that a paradox has to be logically impossible. And that's why they're such fun, because they challenge our beliefs, but they really can be true.What we get is nine fascinating paradoxes of science (mostly physics), with an gentle introduction using the famous Monty Hall problem (also known as Ferraris and Goats) and one or two other paradoxes of probability. Each chapter is based around one of these chunky paradoxes, but Al-Khalili uses the theme to lead us through all sorts of interesting background, either because we need it to understand the paradox itself, or simply because it's an opportunity to bring in some great material. So, for instance, we have the old infinite series paradox Achilles and the Tortoise as chapter 2, but we also discover the other known paradoxes of Zeno, including the delightful Arrow. Then there's Olber's Paradox - why is the night sky dark, Maxwell's Demon - opening up all the wonders of entropy, The Pole in the Barn for the spatial aspect of special relativity, The Twins Paradox for the time aspect of special relativity, The Grandfather Paradox if you can do backwards time travel, Laplace's Demon for determinism and chaos, Schrodinger's Cat (oh, how I hate that cat) - explained better than I've ever seen it, and Fermi's Paradox asking where all the aliens are. All in all, a great set, which uses these fascinating mind twisters to explore a lot of really interesting physics (and a spot of maths).As is almost inevitably the case, there were one or two factual eyebrow-lifters. We are told, for example, that the Andromeda Galaxy contains 500 million stars - I think we're talking hundreds of billions, not a mere half billion. And the explanation of Maxwell's demon seems to suggest that flipping bits takes energy as opposed to the actual cause, which is erasure of information. But my only real problem with Paradox is that Al-Khalili writes like a physics professor (which he is), rather than like a science writer. His style can be a little plodding, and definitely patronising. So for instance the 'explanation' of the quantum Zeno effect is in essence to smile and tell us not to worry our little heads about it: 'I don't think I will pursue this line of thought in any more detail here, just in case you are nervously wondering what you've let yourself in for.' In that case, why mention in in the first place?Again I would contrast Al-Khalili's suggestion that we leave thinking about quantum theory to the big boys: 'However carefully it is explained to the non-physicist, quantum mechanics will sound utterly baffling, even far-fetched.' with another physics professor, Richard Feynman: 'It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you don't understand it. You see, my physics students don't understand it either. That is because I don't understand it. Nobody does... The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it agrees fully with experiment. So I hope you can accept Nature as She is - absurd.' Feynman's version is inclusive; Al-Khalili emphasizes that there are physicists and there is you, the common herd of readers. This is even rubbed in on the cover of the book. It's not by Jim Al-Khalili, it's by Professor Jim Al-Khalili - a bit like those dubious medical books where the author always has M. D. after their name.Does the writing style spoil the content? Absolutely not. And I ought to stress that Paradox is by no means unreadable, just not in the professorial rank when it comes to science writing. The fact remains that the idea of building the book around paradoxes is great, the subject matter is excellent and the exploration of different aspects of physics is fascinating. This is a book that many popular science enthusiasts will lap up.Review first published on www.popularscience.co.uk and reproduced with permission"
14,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,3,"Ever wonder if it is possible to time-travel, why the night sky is not brighter, why it is impossible to build a perpetual motion machine, or why we have not had any communication from intelligent beings from other planets? This little book by Jim Al-Khalili, a quantum physicist at the University of Surrey, answers these and several other difficult questions in easy to read language with no equations. Paradoxes are puzzles that are logical brainteasers, and the author utilizes them in his effort to bring physics to a broader audience; that is, to show that not only can physics be fun, but that once you understand the nature of a paradox, everything becomes much more clear.The author treats nine classic physics quandaries and a few more philosophical conundrums with comprehensible analysis, showing that they are not actually unresolveable, but merely difficult problems subject to resolution with careful thinking. His explanations, such as why you can’t go back to the past and kill your grandfather, are witty as well as illuminating. (Like other physics popularizers, he includes the wonderful 1923 limerick by Reginald Buller in his text), viz:There was a young lady named BrightWho traveled far faster than light.She went out one dayIn a relative wayAnd returned the previous night.”The author's musings on the tension between determinism and free will are especially enlightening. As a special bonus, he also provides an intelligible solution to the famous “Monte Hall” problem that bothered game show fans for years, in the process giving us a painless lesson in probability calculation. Evaluation: This book is deceptively profound, appearing simple because the writing is so lucid. The author, in addition to having a resume that would make most scientists blush, is a regular radio and television science commentator - not surprising given his flair for rendering the abstruse lively and accessible. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the philosophy of science. Rating: 3.5/5"
15,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14011226-rob-slaven,3,"As I've said countless times lately, I received this book in a GoodReads giveaway. With the popularity of shows like ""The Big Bang Theory"" it's not surprising that books of this sort are making their way increasingly into the awareness of the reading public. In a nutshell, I think this book tries to cover too much ground in too little time. For most of the topics covered a 300-page book just for one topic is not usually sufficient so to attempt to summarize this much material in 220 pages for 9 such topics is a breathtakingly complex undertaking. That said, it is reasonably executed given the Herculean nature of the task. Rather than critique further let me try to guide the reader part by part.Chapter 1 is rather an outlier. Potentially interesting but with a distinct mathematical bent that will leave many readers scratching their heads. Do NOT judge the book based on the first chapter. Just politely skip it if it gives you flashbacks to statistics class.Chapters 2-4 work together as examples from classical physics. They stand alone but comprise a skippable grouping of their own if they don't sit well with you.Chapters 5-7 represent Einstein's General and Special Relativity. As concepts they are massively intriguing but again, if they don't appeal then they are a skippable grouping.Chapter 8 is really more philosophical than physical.Chapter 9 is the most referred to bit of physics in the past 50 years in popular culture. If you read nothing else then read this.Chapter 10 is for the UFO crowd.Chapter 11 is a bit of a throw away. Perhaps a tease for a next book.In summation, I think that like any book of this type it's straddling a fine line. As someone who has been reading books of this ilk since he was 10 it's just a rehash of topics I've read half a dozen times before. There's no new information here. For the uninitiated I think it tries to be too broad in scope and will leave a lot of head scratching. I will say though that with the exception of the first chapter the author has successfully eradicated the mathematics from these topics. That in itself is an accomplishment not to be sneezed at."
16,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9651231-laura-zimmerman,2,"I received this book through a Goodreads giveaway. I am NOT a physics or math sort of person and I entered the drawing because I hoped the book would be a Physics Made Easy sort of read.Probably because I'm not a physics or math person, it was difficult for me to read this book and stay interested. Rather than staying engaged I found myself nodding off as I read. My hope of having these concepts in physics explained in a way that made sense to me was unfulfilled, which resulted in quickly losing interest in reading any further. My fiance also read the book. Because he's much more oriented to physics and math than I, the concepts were not new to him and he felt he didn't learn anything new from this book. Granted, he has been reading this sort of thing for the past 30 years so he has quite a head start on me.I will say that the author's writing skills are solid. My lack of comprehension has nothing to do with the author's style and I give him credit for the efforts he put forth in his book. I was impressed by the lack of typos or other errors that often show up in uncorrected proofs--had I not known it was an uncorrected proof I would have thought I was reading the final product.Ultimately, I'd say this book is not for everyone. However, it's probably very informative for those readers who are more familiar with the concepts or for those who can more easily comprehend somewhat incomprehensible (to me) concepts. To those readers I recommend giving this book a try."
17,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54823671-kaleb-bierstedt,4,"I found this book to be very interesting, and often times found myself taking breaks during the book to sort out some the ideas that Jim Al-Khalili brings up because some of the paradoxes have such odd logic to them. Also at the time of reading this book we were learning about similar mathematical concepts that could be applied in the Achilles and the Tortoise section in my AP Calc class, so that also helped spark my interest in the book. Although this was a good book, the use of math and physics in this book may make it difficult for some to understand so I would recommend having at least some basic understanding of physics before reading this book as there are a few points where Al-Khalili skips over some of the more basic math and physics behind the paradox, but most of the time Al-Khalili does a decent job of thoroughly explaining the flaws in thinking behind the problem. Overall it was an entertaining book that I would recommend to anyone interested in reading about math, physic or even brain teasers because there are quite a few in this book. "
18,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,3," a passable intro to weird paradoxes in physics. It talks about Olbers paradox of the dark night sky, If the universe is infinite and stars are randomly distributed there should be stars in every direction and the night sky should be blazingly bright it is not because even if the universe is infinite we can only see a finite part of it because of the big bang light hasn't reached us from parts of the universe. the book goes on with zeno's paradox, relativity and time travel paradoxes, Schroedinger's cat and the impossibility of perpetual motion machines. Good ideas for a person who wants to become familiar with the stranger aspects of physics but I have seen this stuff before still it is not bad."

I was expecting a much more technical treatment of its chosen topics but only got a notional awareness. Having studied these various paradoxes in college physics ill just have to go back and revisit this material mathematically. Readers should expect only superficial coverage of topics in laymen's terms wrapped in TV courtroom strength logic. Understanding imparted by this book may provide fodder for coffeeshop conversation but could not fuel a 10+ minute conversation on any paradox.Particularly galling was the foray into philosophical saws such as ""are we alone?"". "

The author often comes across as elitist, always jumping at the chance to remind the reader he's a physicist, and you are not. However, I did enjoy the fact that he wasn't afraid to offer his personal opinion on scientific mysteries, but always made sure to preface them as his own subjective opinions. I really enjoyed that personal element.All in all there were some elements I quite enjoyed, others not so much. Not quite a paradox, but close enough to be a little ironic."

The book claims to show the nine greatest enigmas in physics and it does a pretty good job of that. That is not to say that the Paradoxes shown are all unsolved, far from it; it merely means that the paradoxes are ones that have baffled people for a long time.Each of the paradoxes starts out the same way; Al-Khalili introduces the problem and then goes on to state how it was put forward and why it was confusing. If he knows how it was muted for a while, he explains that too. Then, if the paradox was resolved he goes on to explain how it was done and what tools or logic were used.The book includes some other things too, mainly to show how spurious intuition can be. This one is the famous “Monty Hall Problem.” You might have heard of it if you are into mathematical puzzles like I am, but if you are not then here is my take on it from memory.You are on a Game Show in the final round. You are presented with three doors, let us call them “A”, “B”, and “C.” Monty Hall or the host or whoever tells you that you must pick a door from the three choices. Behind one door is a brand new car, and behind the other two doors are goats. You pick a door and Monty Hall opens another door that you did not choose, showing a goat. He then offers a deal; you can switch doors, or you can remain with the door you originally chose. Simple enough so far, but here’s the quandary; is it to your advantage to switch doors? The surprising answer to many is yes. Now at first glance, you might think that switching the doors doesn’t matter since you should have a one in two chance since there are now only two doors, but that is incorrect. Since the host KNOWS which one has the car, this changes the outcome of the game and the probability stays at one in three for each door. So that means that switching offers you a two in three chance to get the car rather than a one in two. Even professional mathematicians thought that this was the wrong answer and wrote angry letters to the editor that the author of the column was forced to respond to.Some of the other ones are also interesting historically. Take the paradoxes from Zeno of Elea for example. His paradoxes stated that motion was impossible, yet people and things move. They weren’t resolved rigorously until calculus was invented. In the same vein is Olbers Paradox. This might seem like a silly idea too, but it isn’t in the frame of the original problem. There should be stars in every direction from the Earth, right? Regardless of how far away they are, there should be a star there, providing light from that particular point. If that is the case, why is the night sky dark rather than filled with light? The answer to that didn’t come until Einstein put forth his General Theory of Relativity. The reason the sky is dark is that the Universe has a beginning and because there is a speed of light.Anyway, I had a grand old time with this book. All of the problems were interesting and explained in a manner that people should be able to understand. The book doesn’t contain any heavy math, so you won’t find field equations or anything too complicated."

That's simply not true and he does us avid readers—sons of Asimov and Sagan—a disservice: I've not only heard, but been on top of all the paradoxes listed for quite some years now. I even found a couple of (maybe) mistakes, told him on Twitter of one, he says in the Multiverse traveling back in time does not break the 1st law of thermodynamics, because mass and energy suddenly appearing don't alter the whole of m and e in all the Multiverses, but that's the same as saying that m and e appearing on a single universe do not change the total m and e of that single universe, particularly when considering the block universe in which all times are laid out. It seems he's just pushing the problem back a level. Another one is his opinion that science will be able to know what's outside the universe: that is impossible by definition. And also he mentions science will also know what's on the other side of a black hole: science understands black holes now, enough to realize they're not magical gates to another dimension, or whatever nonsense.All in all, an entertaining and informative read. A must if you want to understand what modern science has to say about the universe and how does it works.It's not without its faults, the errors mentioned (which really undermine the whole book), some minor discrepancies here and there (all electromagnetic radiation transfers heat, not only infrared), but in general good enough for the broad populace that has no clue of anything physics related."

Jim is smooth and direct in his explanation through out the book; this is is my first hardcore physics book and it was hard for a mediocre mind like mine despite the fact that Jim did his best to engulf all as his audience not only physicists or physics university students.I have wet dreams about space exploration - this is why i preferred the 2 paradoxes that Jim explored space rather than the 7 Quantum physics paradoxes. Why it's dark at night??? Never thought this would be a paradox, I ignorantly thought that this is what would be the case forever.. No i was wrong.It is a beautiful feeling when Jim expand about his quantum and space knowledge to us earthlings. I felt sure about the information spread out to me with the self assurance of Jim's style in writing. You can sense well when a guy know what he is talking about.How can a cat be alive and dead at the same time? How can someone arrive back to earth and find her twin brother older than her in 10 years?? And most important how can we make sure we ""earthlings"" are alone in the universe? Scary enough?? I bet it is more scary than if we weren't the only ones out there. Have a good read and enjoyable space ride through the big bang, multiverse, and time travel with such a geeky nerdy piece of physics book."
34,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62600339-ankit-gupta,4,"3.5/5A very interesting book which took me back to many years ago when I was studying physics and also propelled me to thinking about what future has/might have in store for us as humanity. It made me appreciate science even more as I today, after studying science, is doing a corporate business management job. 😊 I love what I do but the science geek inside me is happy and content and excited about the book I just read. The author does a good job in explaining all the scientific concepts in as simple a language as possible. He talks about their practical implications too rather than just theories. And lastly, he calls a spade a spade; doesn’t sugarcoat what might be bullshit. I would recommend picking this book to relive your science nerd inside you and also simultaneously feel good about the presence of science, and more importantly about the scientists who keep asking and trying to answer the very difficult questions!"
35,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182695-james-morrison,5,"Jim Al-Khalili wrote a book that goes from funny to profound. He starts with some entertaining puzzles from the past I had previously known about of, but does it in a fresh way that kept my interest. Later in the book some questions I have always wondered about are answered. Or at least explained given the current evidence. Are we alone in the universe? Are we unique? What is life? How big is the Universe? Is a time machine possible? These and many more engaging questions are examined and explained so people (like me) who are not physicists or mathematicians can at least get an inkling of the answer or to what extent an answer exists. It is all good, but I especially liked how he explained the Grandfather Paradox and Fermi's Paradox. I am always fascinated when an expert can take a deep subject and clarify it for the rest of us. I am recommending this book to my friends."
36,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14421553-randal,2,Not a favorite. I took 3-4 runs at this one and abandoned it with a chapter or so to go. Eventually I figured out why it doesn't work for me: It's no damned fun.Paradoxes are a source of wonder and some amusement for me: There's a sense of delight in how two seemingly contradictory things come together. That's missing from this book. The author seems much more concerned with reassuring the reader that the paradox is resolvable without violating the basic laws of physics than he does with laying out the paradox in the first place. Some readers might like this approach but for me it was backwards and robbed the book of any charm. 
37,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61898144-diocletian,4,"""He's quite a man, he is. In his spare time he studies the universe."" - Sid Waddell on Raymond Van Barneveld.I used to find this funny, then I realised it was me too. Paradox, a great read that leaves you begging for more. Al-Khalili explains complicated scientific concepts without patronising.The first chapter wasn't really about paradoxes at all, more counter-intuitive mathematical problems which I have read about umpteenth times elsewhere, so I skipped through them. I didn't like the second chapter, it was about Zeno's so called paradoxes. Read: silly ideas that do not represent the world but take a bit of reasoning to disprove. They do have their own place in the world - think ""The Quantum Zeno effect"" (observation can affect particle state), I just didn't enjoy reading about them.Obler's paradox was my favourite chapter. Why does it get dark at night, given that there an infinite number of stars and galaxies? I reasoned it was the inverse square law. Al-Khalili counters, if there are an infinite number of stars, then that wouldn't matter. Turns out, it is due to the expansion of the universe, and light from distant stars has not yet reached us and perhaps never will. I really liked the chapter on time travel too. Einstein's theory predicts wormholes, so time travel is theoretically possible. How do we consummate the paradox of going back in time and killing your grandfather? Or the fact that we have never met any time travellers? Multiverse theory plays the deus ex machine here. I'm not a fan of this theory, but I have to admit it ties things up quite nicely. The chapter on Fermi's paradox is also excellent. My criticism of this book, is that the author never explains why time dilation or length contraction occur at or near the speed of light. He only says, that this has been seen experimentally. Al-Khalili shows us his brazen anti-semitism, when he titles a section ""What's the final solution?""  I think this was an innocent mistake."
38,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11700174-julia,5,"This was my first book by Jim Al-Khalili and after finishing this, I cant wait to read more of his work.If you've always reached for fiction in lieu of books that bring back flashbacks from high school, you can rest assured, this book is more like a fun conversation with a friend, who just so happens to know a lot about physics and paradoxes. Not only was this book entertaining and easy to read, but it was informative and captivating. I would normally stay away from anything related to science as I was never interested in the topic, but now I feel I have the courage to approach science with a sense of excitement. "
39,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49149258-blair-mackinnon,4,"Reading through the paradoxes in this book was a bit like reading a Philip K Dick novel - nothing is the way you think it should be. The answers to the paradoxes seem counterintuitive and illogical but this just shows how the mind can trick itself into believing something that on the surface seems logical, and possibly even self-evident, but is in reality a logical and contradictory paradox. I'm still getting my head around the Game Show Paradox.This is a mindbending fun book and I really enjoyed reading it."
40,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12788229-christopher,3," The title of this book is hugely misleading, since most of these paradoxes have been resolved. Still, its an interesting trip through how seemingly counter-intuitive concepts can be worked out in science. I thought about putting this on my philosophy shelf too, because there certainly is a good deal of philosophy here, but while the author understands the history of the concepts he is talking about he tends to give very pat answers to any philosophical questions that come up in this book. So overall, this book is a fun breezy little read, but not something of any great substance. "

In certain places I found the physics too difficult to follow, and I fear that this was (in some cases) a result of the author trying to dumb it down. There is a certain brilliance to being able to explain extremely difficult concepts in a way that a lay person can understand them. (See Feynman.) I don't think that the author of Paradox has that skill."

The answers to the paradoxes seem counterintuitive and illogical but this just shows how the mind can trick itself into believing something that on the surface seems logical, and possibly even self-evident, but is in reality a logical and contradictory paradox. I'm still getting my head around the Game Show Paradox.This is a mindbending fun book and I really enjoyed reading it."
70,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12788229-christopher,3," The title of this book is hugely misleading, since most of these paradoxes have been resolved. Still, its an interesting trip through how seemingly counter-intuitive concepts can be worked out in science. I thought about putting this on my philosophy shelf too, because there certainly is a good deal of philosophy here, but while the author understands the history of the concepts he is talking about he tends to give very pat answers to any philosophical questions that come up in this book.

90,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"We’ve all heard of the concept of Paradox before, but in case you haven’t, I think this is one;The sentence below is true.The sentence above is false.Now it could also be just a word puzzle of some kind, but that is the kind of thing to expect from this offering by Jim Al-Khalili. The book claims to show the nine greatest enigmas in physics and it does a pretty good job of that. That is not to say that the Paradoxes shown are all unsolved, far from it; it merely means that the paradoxes are ones that have baffled people for a long time.Each of the paradoxes starts out the same way; Al-Khalili introduces the problem and then goes on to state how it was put forward and why it was confusing. If he knows how it was muted for a while, he explains that too. Then, if the paradox was resolved he goes on to explain how it was done and what tools or logic were used.The book includes some other things too, mainly to show how spurious intuition can be. This one is the famous “Monty Hall Problem.” You might have heard of it if you are into mathematical puzzles like I am, but if you are not then here is my take on it from memory.You are on a Game Show in the final round. You are presented with three doors, let us call them “A”, “B”, and “C.” Monty Hall or the host or whoever tells you that you must pick a door from the three choices. Behind one door is a brand new car, and behind the other two doors are goats. You pick a door and Monty Hall opens another door that you did not choose, showing a goat. He then offers a deal; you can switch doors, or you can remain with the door you originally chose. Simple enough so far, but here’s the quandary; is it to your advantage to switch doors? The surprising answer to many is yes. Now at first glance, you might think that switching the doors doesn’t matter since you should have a one in two chance since there are now only two doors, but that is incorrect. Since the host KNOWS which one has the car, this changes the outcome of the game and the probability stays at one in three for each door. So that means that switching offers you a two in three chance to get the car rather than a one in two. Even professional mathematicians thought that this was the wrong answer and wrote angry letters to the editor that the author of the column was forced to respond to.Some of the other ones are also interesting historically. Take the paradoxes from Zeno of Elea for example. His paradoxes stated that motion was impossible, yet people and things move. They weren’t resolved rigorously until calculus was invented. In the same vein is Olbers Paradox. This might seem like a silly idea too, but it isn’t in the frame of the original problem. There should be stars in every direction from the Earth, right? Regardless of how far away they are, there should be a star there, providing light from that particular point. If that is the case, why is the night sky dark rather than filled with light? The answer to that didn’t come until Einstein put forth his General Theory of Relativity. The reason the sky is dark is that the Universe has a beginning and because there is a speed of light.Anyway, I had a grand old time with this book. All of the problems were interesting and explained in a manner that people should be able to understand. The book doesn’t contain any heavy math, so you won’t find field equations or anything too complicated."

Go read The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World. Let me know how this compares to that.Go read The Fabric of the Heavens: The Development of Astronomy and Dynamics. Let me know how this compares to that.Rubbish book I didn't like it at all. There's repetition, cladding out the pages with bland restatements of earlier, dull statements. I'd prefer not to compare across genres but I have to say that reading The Man Who Was Thursday coeval with this, and it shames this book. Mr. Khalili wrote to fill a page-count, no doubt. Constant refreshing of origin of the inquiry does dull one's curiosity.I have read a lot of 'Classic Logic Puzzles' and their ilk, maybe if I had not this book would contain novel material & be written in plain language that anyone can understand. But I have, it's not & if you haven't, & it is, I really do believe you could enjoy the books at top & bottom. The Beginning of Infinity is a better book, as far as shared objective go, Mr. Deutsch gives the paradox between mind & body the mad, searching intensity it deserves although really the 2 books don't share an objective. I expect Beauty to be one of the secret's of the universe, the paradox of metamorphosis where opposites swap, from Ugly comes Beauty & vice versa. Well you might learn more about the natural laws in Paradox, but not the best concatenation. The triple point of water seems a paradox, when the 3 (parochially exclusive) forms co-exist. Physics, being the laws of nature, had a paradox solved by germ theory. Something came from nothing, without microscopes this was soluble by (one of the) God's Will alone. You want 7 more? Nah, pay me.The Monty Hall paradox was the last section I read in full, after which I began to skim read. I tried, I really did, beginning in sober earnest at the start of each chapter, reading fully at least the first page. But what's the good of the Pole in the Barn paradox? It is entirely devoid of context, the terrain described is massively different from the manifest occurrence. Attempting to describe extreme possibilities of best-yet physics as though in an incompatible, mundane situation is Absurd. In my opinion, posit the metaphor / analogy as the clay from which to sculpt by removal of the cladding to leave the actual facts of the case. Mr. Khalili did not break the fantastic beginnings for the mystifying truth, not on the early chapters & later pages I read. I repeat, go read Free Radicals: The Secret Anarchy of Science.

120,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"We’ve all heard of the concept of Paradox before, but in case you haven’t, I think this is one;The sentence below is true.The sentence above is false.Now it could also be just a word puzzle of some kind, but that is the kind of thing to expect from this offering by Jim Al-Khalili. The book claims to show the nine greatest enigmas in physics and it does a pretty good job of that. That is not to say that the Paradoxes shown are all unsolved, far from it; it merely means that the paradoxes are ones that have baffled people for a long time.Each of the paradoxes starts out the same way; Al-Khalili introduces the problem and then goes on to state how it was put forward and why it was confusing. If he knows how it was muted for a while, he explains that too. Then, if the paradox was resolved he goes on to explain how it was done and what tools or logic were used.The book includes some other things too, mainly to show how spurious intuition can be. This one is the famous “Monty Hall Problem.” You might have heard of it if you are into mathematical puzzles like I am, but if you are not then here is my take on it from memory.You are on a Game Show in the final round. You are presented with three doors, let us call them “A”, “B”, and “C.” Monty Hall or the host or whoever tells you that you must pick a door from the three choices. Behind one door is a brand new car, and behind the other two doors are goats. You pick a door and Monty Hall opens another door that you did not choose, showing a goat. He then offers a deal; you can switch doors, or you can remain with the door you originally chose. Simple enough so far, but here’s the quandary; is it to your advantage to switch doors? The surprising answer to many is yes. Now at first glance, you might think that switching the doors doesn’t matter since you should have a one in two chance since there are now only two doors, but that is incorrect. Since the host KNOWS which one has the car, this changes the outcome of the game and the probability stays at one in three for each door. So that means that switching offers you a two in three chance to get the car rather than a one in two. Even professional mathematicians thought that this was the wrong answer and wrote angry letters to the editor that the author of the column was forced to respond to.Some of the other ones are also interesting historically. Take the paradoxes from Zeno of Elea for example. His paradoxes stated that motion was impossible, yet people and things move. They weren’t resolved rigorously until calculus was invented. In the same vein is Olbers Paradox. This might seem like a silly idea too, but it isn’t in the frame of the original problem. There should be stars in every direction from the Earth, right? Regardless of how far away they are, there should be a star there, providing light from that particular point. If that is the case, why is the night sky dark rather than filled with light? The answer to that didn’t come until Einstein put forth his General Theory of Relativity. The reason the sky is dark is that the Universe has a beginning and because there is a speed of light.Anyway, I had a grand old time with this book. All of the problems were interesting and explained in a manner that people should be able to understand. The book doesn’t contain any heavy math, so you won’t find field equations or anything too complicated."

Go read The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World. Let me know how this compares to that.Go read The Fabric of the Heavens: The Development of Astronomy and Dynamics. Let me know how this compares to that.Rubbish book I didn't like it at all. There's repetition, cladding out the pages with bland restatements of earlier, dull statements. I'd prefer not to compare across genres but I have to say that reading The Man Who Was Thursday coeval with this, and it shames this book. Mr. Khalili wrote to fill a page-count, no doubt. Constant refreshing of origin of the inquiry does dull one's curiosity.I have read a lot of 'Classic Logic Puzzles' and their ilk, maybe if I had not this book would contain novel material & be written in plain language that anyone can understand. But I have, it's not & if you haven't, & it is, I really do believe you could enjoy the books at top & bottom. The Beginning of Infinity is a better book, as far as shared objective go, Mr. Deutsch gives the paradox between mind & body the mad, searching intensity it deserves although really the 2 books don't share an objective. I expect Beauty to be one of the secret's of the universe, the paradox of metamorphosis where opposites swap, from Ugly comes Beauty & vice versa. Well you might learn more about the natural laws in Paradox, but not the best concatenation. The triple point of water seems a paradox, when the 3 (parochially exclusive) forms co-exist. Physics, being the laws of nature, had a paradox solved by germ theory. Something came from nothing, without microscopes this was soluble by (one of the) God's Will alone. You want 7 more? Nah, pay me.The Monty Hall paradox was the last section I read in full, after which I began to skim read. I tried, I really did, beginning in sober earnest at the start of each chapter, reading fully at least the first page. But what's the good of the Pole in the Barn paradox? It is entirely devoid of context, the terrain described is massively different from the manifest occurrence. Attempting to describe extreme possibilities of best-yet physics as though in an incompatible, mundane situation is Absurd. In my opinion, posit the metaphor / analogy as the clay from which to sculpt by removal of the cladding to leave the actual facts of the case. Mr. Khalili did not break the fantastic beginnings for the mystifying truth, not on the early chapters & later pages I read. I repeat, go read Free Radicals: The Secret Anarchy of Science. Let me know how this compares to that. Go read The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World. Let me know how this compares to that.

That's simply not true and he does us avid readers—sons of Asimov and Sagan—a disservice: I've not only heard, but been on top of all the paradoxes listed for quite some years now. I even found a couple of (maybe) mistakes, told him on Twitter of one, he says in the Multiverse traveling back in time does not break the 1st law of thermodynamics, because mass and energy suddenly appearing don't alter the whole of m and e in all the Multiverses, but that's the same as saying that m and e appearing on a single universe do not change the total m and e of that single universe, particularly when considering the block universe in which all times are laid out. It seems he's just pushing the problem back a level. Another one is his opinion that science will be able to know what's outside the universe: that is impossible by definition. And also he mentions science will also know what's on the other side of a black hole: science understands black holes now, enough to realize they're not magical gates to another dimension, or whatever nonsense.All in all, an entertaining and informative read. A must if you want to understand what modern science has to say about the universe and how does it works.It's not without its faults, the errors mentioned (which really undermine the whole book), some minor discrepancies here and there (all electromagnetic radiation transfers heat, not only infrared), but in general good enough for the broad populace that has no clue of anything physics related."

Jim is smooth and direct in his explanation through out the book; this is is my first hardcore physics book and it was hard for a mediocre mind like mine despite the fact that Jim did his best to engulf all as his audience not only physicists or physics university students.I have wet dreams about space exploration - this is why i preferred the 2 paradoxes that Jim explored space rather than the 7 Quantum physics paradoxes. Why it's dark at night??? Never thought this would be a paradox, I ignorantly thought that this is what would be the case forever.. No i was wrong.It is a beautiful feeling when Jim expand about his quantum and space knowledge to us earthlings. I felt sure about the information spread out to me with the self assurance of Jim's style in writing. You can sense well when a guy know what he is talking about.How can a cat be alive and dead at the same time? How can someone arrive back to earth and find her twin brother older than her in 10 years?? And most important how can we make sure we ""earthlings"" are alone in the universe? Scary enough?? I bet it is more scary than if we weren't the only ones out there.

It made me appreciate science even more as I today, after studying science, is doing a corporate business management job. 😊 I love what I do but the science geek inside me is happy and content and excited about the book I just read. The author does a good job in explaining all the scientific concepts in as simple a language as possible. He talks about their practical implications too rather than just theories. And lastly, he calls a spade a spade; doesn’t sugarcoat what might be bullshit. I would recommend picking this book to relive your science nerd inside you and also simultaneously feel good about the presence of science, and more importantly about the scientists who keep asking and trying to answer the very difficult questions!"
125,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182695-james-morrison,5,"Jim Al-Khalili wrote a book that goes from funny to profound. He starts with some entertaining puzzles from the past I had previously known about of, but does it in a fresh way that kept my interest. Later in the book some questions I have always wondered about are answered. Or at least explained given the current evidence. Are we alone in the universe? Are we unique? What is life? How big is the Universe? Is a time machine possible? These and many more engaging questions are examined and explained so people (like me) who are not physicists or mathematicians can at least get an inkling of the answer or to what extent an answer exists. It is all good, but I especially liked how he explained the Grandfather Paradox and Fermi's Paradox. I am always fascinated when an expert can take a deep subject and clarify it for the rest of us. I am recommending this book to my friends."
126,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14421553-randal,2,Not a favorite. I took 3-4 runs at this one and abandoned it with a chapter or so to go. Eventually I figured out why it doesn't work for me: It's no damned fun.Paradoxes are a source of wonder and some amusement for me: There's a sense of delight in how two seemingly contradictory things come together. That's missing from this book. The author seems much more concerned with reassuring the reader that the paradox is resolvable without violating the basic laws of physics than he does with laying out the paradox in the first place. Some readers might like this approach but for me it was backwards and robbed the book of any charm.

In his spare time he studies the universe."" - Sid Waddell on Raymond Van Barneveld.I used to find this funny, then I realised it was me too. Paradox, a great read that leaves you begging for more. Al-Khalili explains complicated scientific concepts without patronising.The first chapter wasn't really about paradoxes at all, more counter-intuitive mathematical problems which I have read about umpteenth times elsewhere, so I skipped through them. I didn't like the second chapter, it was about Zeno's so called paradoxes. Read: silly ideas that do not represent the world but take a bit of reasoning to disprove. They do have their own place in the world - think ""The Quantum Zeno effect"" (observation can affect particle state), I just didn't enjoy reading about them.Obler's paradox was my favourite chapter. Why does it get dark at night, given that there an infinite number of stars and galaxies? I reasoned it was the inverse square law. Al-Khalili counters, if there are an infinite number of stars, then that wouldn't matter. Turns out, it is due to the expansion of the universe, and light from distant stars has not yet reached us and perhaps never will. I really liked the chapter on time travel too. Einstein's theory predicts wormholes, so time travel is theoretically possible. How do we consummate the paradox of going back in time and killing your grandfather? Or the fact that we have never met any time travellers? Multiverse theory plays the deus ex machine here. I'm not a fan of this theory, but I have to admit it ties things up quite nicely. The chapter on Fermi's paradox is also excellent. My criticism of this book, is that the author never explains why time dilation or length contraction occur at or near the speed of light. He only says, that this has been seen experimentally. Al-Khalili shows us his brazen anti-semitism, when he titles a section ""What's the final solution?""  I think this was an innocent mistake."

Behind one door is a brand new car, and behind the other two doors are goats. You pick a door and Monty Hall opens another door that you did not choose, showing a goat. He then offers a deal; you can switch doors, or you can remain with the door you originally chose. Simple enough so far, but here’s the quandary; is it to your advantage to switch doors? The surprising answer to many is yes. Now at first glance, you might think that switching the doors doesn’t matter since you should have a one in two chance since there are now only two doors, but that is incorrect. Since the host KNOWS which one has the car, this changes the outcome of the game and the probability stays at one in three for each door.

Jim is smooth and direct in his explanation through out the book; this is is my first hardcore physics book and it was hard for a mediocre mind like mine despite the fact that Jim did his best to engulf all as his audience not only physicists or physics university students.I have wet dreams about space exploration - this is why i preferred the 2 paradoxes that Jim explored space rather than the 7 Quantum physics paradoxes. Why it's dark at night??? Never thought this would be a paradox, I ignorantly thought that this is what would be the case forever.. No i was wrong.It is a beautiful feeling when Jim expand about his quantum and space knowledge to us earthlings. I felt sure about the information spread out to me with the self assurance of Jim's style in writing. You can sense well when a guy know what he is talking about.How can a cat be alive and dead at the same time? How can someone arrive back to earth and find her twin brother older than her in 10 years?? And most important how can we make sure we ""earthlings"" are alone in the universe? Scary enough?? I bet it is more scary than if we weren't the only ones out there. Have a good read and enjoyable space ride through the big bang, multiverse, and time travel with such a geeky nerdy piece of physics book."
154,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62600339-ankit-gupta,4,"3.5/5A very interesting book which took me back to many years ago when I was studying physics and also propelled me to thinking about what future has/might have in store for us as humanity. It made me appreciate science even more as I today, after studying science, is doing a corporate business management job. 😊 I love what I do but the science geek inside me is happy and content and excited about the book I just read. The author does a good job in explaining all the scientific concepts in as simple a language as possible. He talks about their practical implications too rather than just theories. And lastly, he calls a spade a spade; doesn’t sugarcoat what might be bullshit. I would recommend picking this book to relive your science nerd inside you and also simultaneously feel good about the presence of science, and more importantly about the scientists who keep asking and trying to answer the very difficult questions!"
155,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182695-james-morrison,5,"Jim Al-Khalili wrote a book that goes from funny to profound. He starts with some entertaining puzzles from the past I had previously known about of, but does it in a fresh way that kept my interest. Later in the book some questions I have always wondered about are answered. Or at least explained given the current evidence. Are we alone in the universe? Are we unique? What is life? How big is the Universe? Is a time machine possible? These and many more engaging questions are examined and explained so people (like me) who are not physicists or mathematicians can at least get an inkling of the answer or to what extent an answer exists. It is all good, but I especially liked how he explained the Grandfather Paradox and Fermi's Paradox. I am always fascinated when an expert can take a deep subject and clarify it for the rest of us. I am recommending this book to my friends."
156,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14421553-randal,2,Not a favorite. I took 3-4 runs at this one and abandoned it with a chapter or so to go. Eventually I figured out why it doesn't work for me: It's no damned fun.Paradoxes are a source of wonder and some amusement for me: There's a sense of delight in how two seemingly contradictory things come together. That's missing from this book. The author seems much more concerned with reassuring the reader that the paradox is resolvable without violating the basic laws of physics than he does with laying out the paradox in the first place. Some readers might like this approach but for me it was backwards and robbed the book of any charm. 
157,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61898144-diocletian,4,"""He's quite a man, he is. In his spare time he studies the universe."" - Sid Waddell on Raymond Van Barneveld.I used to find this funny, then I realised it was me too. Paradox, a great read that leaves you begging for more. Al-Khalili explains complicated scientific concepts without patronising.The first chapter wasn't really about paradoxes at all, more counter-intuitive mathematical problems which I have read about umpteenth times elsewhere, so I skipped through them. I didn't like the second chapter, it was about Zeno's so called paradoxes. Read: silly ideas that do not represent the world but take a bit of reasoning to disprove. They do have their own place in the world - think ""The Quantum Zeno effect"" (observation can affect particle state), I just didn't enjoy reading about them.Obler's paradox was my favourite chapter. Why does it get dark at night, given that there an infinite number of stars and galaxies? I reasoned it was the inverse square law. Al-Khalili counters, if there are an infinite number of stars, then that wouldn't matter. Turns out, it is due to the expansion of the universe, and light from distant stars has not yet reached us and perhaps never will. I really liked the chapter on time travel too. Einstein's theory predicts wormholes, so time travel is theoretically possible. How do we consummate the paradox of going back in time and killing your grandfather? Or the fact that we have never met any time travellers? Multiverse theory plays the deus ex machine here. I'm not a fan of this theory, but I have to admit it ties things up quite nicely. The chapter on Fermi's paradox is also excellent. My criticism of this book, is that the author never explains why time dilation or length contraction occur at or near the speed of light. He only says, that this has been seen experimentally. Al-Khalili shows us his brazen anti-semitism, when he titles a section ""What's the final solution?""  I think this was an innocent mistake."
158,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11700174-julia,5,"This was my first book by Jim Al-Khalili and after finishing this, I cant wait to read more of his work.If you've always reached for fiction in lieu of books that bring back flashbacks from high school, you can rest assured, this book is more like a fun conversation with a friend, who just so happens to know a lot about physics and paradoxes. Not only was this book entertaining and easy to read, but it was informative and captivating. I would normally stay away from anything related to science as I was never interested in the topic, but now I feel I have the courage to approach science with a sense of excitement. "
159,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49149258-blair-mackinnon,4,"Reading through the paradoxes in this book was a bit like reading a Philip K Dick novel - nothing is the way you think it should be. The answers to the paradoxes seem counterintuitive and illogical but this just shows how the mind can trick itself into believing something that on the surface seems logical, and possibly even self-evident, but is in reality a logical and contradictory paradox. I'm still getting my head around the Game Show Paradox.This is a mindbending fun book and I really enjoyed reading it."
160,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12788229-christopher,3," The title of this book is hugely misleading, since most of these paradoxes have been resolved. Still, its an interesting trip through how seemingly counter-intuitive concepts can be worked out in science. I thought about putting this on my philosophy shelf too, because there certainly is a good deal of philosophy here, but while the author understands the history of the concepts he is talking about he tends to give very pat answers to any philosophical questions that come up in this book. So overall, this book is a fun breezy little read, but not something of any great substance. "

A good introduction to making people actually think about physics, some of the more important laws, and what they imply.

163,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15560373-elliot-chalom,3,"Interesting book, and I certainly learned a few things. Nevertheless, not one of my favorite popular science reads. In certain places I found the physics too difficult to follow, and I fear that this was (in some cases) a result of the author trying to dumb it down. There is a certain brilliance to being able to explain extremely difficult concepts in a way that a lay person can understand them. (See Feynman.) I don't think that the author of Paradox has that skill."

166,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91482716-diana-prentice,4,"I enjoyed the book, but I agree it’s not about paradoxes. Rather, the nine “paradoxes” in the book are more like intriguing physics problems. A few of them are just counter-intuitive observations in quantum mechanics and theory of relativity. Nonetheless, it’s a fun read and a refresher to college level physics."
167,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111579972-ash-dean,3,"Nice book, was inspired to read this after watching the TV show Devs. The book is definitely accessible for everyone regardless of prior physics knowledge. Most interesting new concepts were Maxwell's demon, and an explanation of how half-life is just a average sum of radioactive decay (a quantumly random process)."
168,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/559251-terry,3,"While I thoroughly enjoy the weirdness embodied in elements of modern physics, I now understand more clearly why I am not a quantum physicist.

210,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"We’ve all heard of the concept of Paradox before, but in case you haven’t, I think this is one;The sentence below is true.The sentence above is false.Now it could also be just a word puzzle of some kind, but that is the kind of thing to expect from this offering by Jim Al-Khalili. The book claims to show the nine greatest enigmas in physics and it does a pretty good job of that. That is not to say that the Paradoxes shown are all unsolved, far from it; it merely means that the paradoxes are ones that have baffled people for a long time.Each of the paradoxes starts out the same way; Al-Khalili introduces the problem and then goes on to state how it was put forward and why it was confusing. If he knows how it was muted for a while, he explains that too. Then, if the paradox was resolved he goes on to explain how it was done and what tools or logic were used.The book includes some other things too, mainly to show how spurious intuition can be. This one is the famous “Monty Hall Problem.” You might have heard of it if you are into mathematical puzzles like I am, but if you are not then here is my take on it from memory.You are on a Game Show in the final round. You are presented with three doors, let us call them “A”, “B”, and “C.” Monty Hall or the host or whoever tells you that you must pick a door from the three choices. Behind one door is a brand new car, and behind the other two doors are goats. You pick a door and Monty Hall opens another door that you did not choose, showing a goat. He then offers a deal; you can switch doors, or you can remain with the door you originally chose. Simple enough so far, but here’s the quandary; is it to your advantage to switch doors? The surprising answer to many is yes. Now at first glance, you might think that switching the doors doesn’t matter since you should have a one in two chance since there are now only two doors, but that is incorrect. Since the host KNOWS which one has the car, this changes the outcome of the game and the probability stays at one in three for each door. So that means that switching offers you a two in three chance to get the car rather than a one in two. Even professional mathematicians thought that this was the wrong answer and wrote angry letters to the editor that the author of the column was forced to respond to.Some of the other ones are also interesting historically. Take the paradoxes from Zeno of Elea for example. His paradoxes stated that motion was impossible, yet people and things move. They weren’t resolved rigorously until calculus was invented. In the same vein is Olbers Paradox. This might seem like a silly idea too, but it isn’t in the frame of the original problem. There should be stars in every direction from the Earth, right? Regardless of how far away they are, there should be a star there, providing light from that particular point. If that is the case, why is the night sky dark rather than filled with light? The answer to that didn’t come until Einstein put forth his General Theory of Relativity. The reason the sky is dark is that the Universe has a beginning and because there is a speed of light.Anyway, I had a grand old time with this book. All of the problems were interesting and explained in a manner that people should be able to understand. The book doesn’t contain any heavy math, so you won’t find field equations or anything too complicated."

Go read The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World. Let me know how this compares to that.Go read The Fabric of the Heavens: The Development of Astronomy and Dynamics. Let me know how this compares to that.Rubbish book I didn't like it at all. There's repetition, cladding out the pages with bland restatements of earlier, dull statements. I'd prefer not to compare across genres but I have to say that reading The Man Who Was Thursday coeval with this, and it shames this book. Mr. Khalili wrote to fill a page-count, no doubt. Constant refreshing of origin of the inquiry does dull one's curiosity.I have read a lot of 'Classic Logic Puzzles' and their ilk, maybe if I had not this book would contain novel material & be written in plain language that anyone can understand. But I have, it's not & if you haven't, & it is, I really do believe you could enjoy the books at top & bottom. The Beginning of Infinity is a better book, as far as shared objective go, Mr. Deutsch gives the paradox between mind & body the mad, searching intensity it deserves although really the 2 books don't share an objective. I expect Beauty to be one of the secret's of the universe, the paradox of metamorphosis where opposites swap, from Ugly comes Beauty & vice versa. Well you might learn more about the natural laws in Paradox, but not the best concatenation. The triple point of water seems a paradox, when the 3 (parochially exclusive) forms co-exist. Physics, being the laws of nature, had a paradox solved by germ theory. Something came from nothing, without microscopes this was soluble by (one of the) God's Will alone. You want 7 more? Nah, pay me.The Monty Hall paradox was the last section I read in full, after which I began to skim read. I tried, I really did, beginning in sober earnest at the start of each chapter, reading fully at least the first page. But what's the good of the Pole in the Barn paradox? It is entirely devoid of context, the terrain described is massively different from the manifest occurrence. Attempting to describe extreme possibilities of best-yet physics as though in an incompatible, mundane situation is Absurd. In my opinion, posit the metaphor / analogy as the clay from which to sculpt by removal of the cladding to leave the actual facts of the case. Mr. Khalili did not break the fantastic beginnings for the mystifying truth, not on the early chapters & later pages I read. I repeat, go read Free Radicals: The Secret Anarchy of Science.

That's simply not true and he does us avid readers—sons of Asimov and Sagan—a disservice: I've not only heard, but been on top of all the paradoxes listed for quite some years now. I even found a couple of (maybe) mistakes, told him on Twitter of one, he says in the Multiverse traveling back in time does not break the 1st law of thermodynamics, because mass and energy suddenly appearing don't alter the whole of m and e in all the Multiverses, but that's the same as saying that m and e appearing on a single universe do not change the total m and e of that single universe, particularly when considering the block universe in which all times are laid out. It seems he's just pushing the problem back a level. Another one is his opinion that science will be able to know what's outside the universe: that is impossible by definition. And also he mentions science will also know what's on the other side of a black hole: science understands black holes now, enough to realize they're not magical gates to another dimension, or whatever nonsense.All in all, an entertaining and informative read.

240,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"We’ve all heard of the concept of Paradox before, but in case you haven’t, I think this is one;The sentence below is true.The sentence above is false.Now it could also be just a word puzzle of some kind, but that is the kind of thing to expect from this offering by Jim Al-Khalili. The book claims to show the nine greatest enigmas in physics and it does a pretty good job of that. That is not to say that the Paradoxes shown are all unsolved, far from it; it merely means that the paradoxes are ones that have baffled people for a long time.Each of the paradoxes starts out the same way; Al-Khalili introduces the problem and then goes on to state how it was put forward and why it was confusing. If he knows how it was muted for a while, he explains that too. Then, if the paradox was resolved he goes on to explain how it was done and what tools or logic were used.The book includes some other things too, mainly to show how spurious intuition can be. This one is the famous “Monty Hall Problem.” You might have heard of it if you are into mathematical puzzles like I am, but if you are not then here is my take on it from memory.You are on a Game Show in the final round. You are presented with three doors, let us call them “A”, “B”, and “C.” Monty Hall or the host or whoever tells you that you must pick a door from the three choices. Behind one door is a brand new car, and behind the other two doors are goats. You pick a door and Monty Hall opens another door that you did not choose, showing a goat. He then offers a deal; you can switch doors, or you can remain with the door you originally chose. Simple enough so far, but here’s the quandary; is it to your advantage to switch doors? The surprising answer to many is yes. Now at first glance, you might think that switching the doors doesn’t matter since you should have a one in two chance since there are now only two doors, but that is incorrect. Since the host KNOWS which one has the car, this changes the outcome of the game and the probability stays at one in three for each door. So that means that switching offers you a two in three chance to get the car rather than a one in two. Even professional mathematicians thought that this was the wrong answer and wrote angry letters to the editor that the author of the column was forced to respond to.Some of the other ones are also interesting historically. Take the paradoxes from Zeno of Elea for example. His paradoxes stated that motion was impossible, yet people and things move. They weren’t resolved rigorously until calculus was invented. In the same vein is Olbers Paradox. This might seem like a silly idea too, but it isn’t in the frame of the original problem. There should be stars in every direction from the Earth, right? Regardless of how far away they are, there should be a star there, providing light from that particular point. If that is the case, why is the night sky dark rather than filled with light? The answer to that didn’t come until Einstein put forth his General Theory of Relativity. The reason the sky is dark is that the Universe has a beginning and because there is a speed of light.Anyway, I had a grand old time with this book. All of the problems were interesting and explained in a manner that people should be able to understand. The book doesn’t contain any heavy math, so you won’t find field equations or anything too complicated."
241,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52931852-abraham-lewik,1,"Go read Free Radicals: The Secret Anarchy of Science. Let me know how this compares to that. Go read The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World. Let me know how this compares to that.Go read The Fabric of the Heavens: The Development of Astronomy and Dynamics. Let me know how this compares to that.Rubbish book I didn't like it at all. There's repetition, cladding out the pages with bland restatements of earlier, dull statements. I'd prefer not to compare across genres but I have to say that reading The Man Who Was Thursday coeval with this, and it shames this book. Mr. Khalili wrote to fill a page-count, no doubt. Constant refreshing of origin of the inquiry does dull one's curiosity.I have read a lot of 'Classic Logic Puzzles' and their ilk, maybe if I had not this book would contain novel material & be written in plain language that anyone can understand. But I have, it's not & if you haven't, & it is, I really do believe you could enjoy the books at top & bottom. The Beginning of Infinity is a better book, as far as shared objective go, Mr. Deutsch gives the paradox between mind & body the mad, searching intensity it deserves although really the 2 books don't share an objective. I expect Beauty to be one of the secret's of the universe, the paradox of metamorphosis where opposites swap, from Ugly comes Beauty & vice versa. Well you might learn more about the natural laws in Paradox, but not the best concatenation. The triple point of water seems a paradox, when the 3 (parochially exclusive) forms co-exist. Physics, being the laws of nature, had a paradox solved by germ theory. Something came from nothing, without microscopes this was soluble by (one of the) God's Will alone. You want 7 more? Nah, pay me.The Monty Hall paradox was the last section I read in full, after which I began to skim read. I tried, I really did, beginning in sober earnest at the start of each chapter, reading fully at least the first page. But what's the good of the Pole in the Barn paradox? It is entirely devoid of context, the terrain described is massively different from the manifest occurrence. Attempting to describe extreme possibilities of best-yet physics as though in an incompatible, mundane situation is Absurd. In my opinion, posit the metaphor / analogy as the clay from which to sculpt by removal of the cladding to leave the actual facts of the case. Mr. Khalili did not break the fantastic beginnings for the mystifying truth, not on the early chapters & later pages I read. I repeat, go read Free Radicals: The Secret Anarchy of Science. Let me know how this compares to that. Go read The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World. Let me know how this compares to that.

That's simply not true and he does us avid readers—sons of Asimov and Sagan—a disservice: I've not only heard, but been on top of all the paradoxes listed for quite some years now. I even found a couple of (maybe) mistakes, told him on Twitter of one, he says in the Multiverse traveling back in time does not break the 1st law of thermodynamics, because mass and energy suddenly appearing don't alter the whole of m and e in all the Multiverses, but that's the same as saying that m and e appearing on a single universe do not change the total m and e of that single universe, particularly when considering the block universe in which all times are laid out. It seems he's just pushing the problem back a level. Another one is his opinion that science will be able to know what's outside the universe: that is impossible by definition. And also he mentions science will also know what's on the other side of a black hole: science understands black holes now, enough to realize they're not magical gates to another dimension, or whatever nonsense.All in all, an entertaining and informative read. A must if you want to understand what modern science has to say about the universe and how does it works.It's not without its faults, the errors mentioned (which really undermine the whole book), some minor discrepancies here and there (all electromagnetic radiation transfers heat, not only infrared), but in general good enough for the broad populace that has no clue of anything physics related."

Jim is smooth and direct in his explanation through out the book; this is is my first hardcore physics book and it was hard for a mediocre mind like mine despite the fact that Jim did his best to engulf all as his audience not only physicists or physics university students.I have wet dreams about space exploration - this is why i preferred the 2 paradoxes that Jim explored space rather than the 7 Quantum physics paradoxes. Why it's dark at night??? Never thought this would be a paradox, I ignorantly thought that this is what would be the case forever.. No i was wrong.It is a beautiful feeling when Jim expand about his quantum and space knowledge to us earthlings. I felt sure about the information spread out to me with the self assurance of Jim's style in writing. You can sense well when a guy know what he is talking about.How can a cat be alive and dead at the same time? How can someone arrive back to earth and find her twin brother older than her in 10 years?? And most important how can we make sure we ""earthlings"" are alone in the universe? Scary enough?? I bet it is more scary than if we weren't the only ones out there. Have a good read and enjoyable space ride through the big bang, multiverse, and time travel with such a geeky nerdy piece of physics book."

It made me appreciate science even more as I today, after studying science, is doing a corporate business management job. 😊 I love what I do but the science geek inside me is happy and content and excited about the book I just read. The author does a good job in explaining all the scientific concepts in as simple a language as possible. He talks about their practical implications too rather than just theories. And lastly, he calls a spade a spade; doesn’t sugarcoat what might be bullshit. I would recommend picking this book to relive your science nerd inside you and also simultaneously feel good about the presence of science, and more importantly about the scientists who keep asking and trying to answer the very difficult questions!"
245,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182695-james-morrison,5,"Jim Al-Khalili wrote a book that goes from funny to profound. He starts with some entertaining puzzles from the past I had previously known about of, but does it in a fresh way that kept my interest. Later in the book some questions I have always wondered about are answered. Or at least explained given the current evidence. Are we alone in the universe? Are we unique? What is life? How big is the Universe? Is a time machine possible? These and many more engaging questions are examined and explained so people (like me) who are not physicists or mathematicians can at least get an inkling of the answer or to what extent an answer exists. It is all good, but I especially liked how he explained the Grandfather Paradox and Fermi's Paradox. I am always fascinated when an expert can take a deep subject and clarify it for the rest of us. I am recommending this book to my friends."
246,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14421553-randal,2,Not a favorite. I took 3-4 runs at this one and abandoned it with a chapter or so to go. Eventually I figured out why it doesn't work for me: It's no damned fun.Paradoxes are a source of wonder and some amusement for me: There's a sense of delight in how two seemingly contradictory things come together. That's missing from this book. The author seems much more concerned with reassuring the reader that the paradox is resolvable without violating the basic laws of physics than he does with laying out the paradox in the first place. Some readers might like this approach but for me it was backwards and robbed the book of any charm.

In his spare time he studies the universe."" - Sid Waddell on Raymond Van Barneveld.I used to find this funny, then I realised it was me too. Paradox, a great read that leaves you begging for more. Al-Khalili explains complicated scientific concepts without patronising.The first chapter wasn't really about paradoxes at all, more counter-intuitive mathematical problems which I have read about umpteenth times elsewhere, so I skipped through them. I didn't like the second chapter, it was about Zeno's so called paradoxes. Read: silly ideas that do not represent the world but take a bit of reasoning to disprove. They do have their own place in the world - think ""The Quantum Zeno effect"" (observation can affect particle state), I just didn't enjoy reading about them.Obler's paradox was my favourite chapter. Why does it get dark at night, given that there an infinite number of stars and galaxies? I reasoned it was the inverse square law. Al-Khalili counters, if there are an infinite number of stars, then that wouldn't matter. Turns out, it is due to the expansion of the universe, and light from distant stars has not yet reached us and perhaps never will. I really liked the chapter on time travel too. Einstein's theory predicts wormholes, so time travel is theoretically possible. How do we consummate the paradox of going back in time and killing your grandfather? Or the fact that we have never met any time travellers? Multiverse theory plays the deus ex machine here. I'm not a fan of this theory, but I have to admit it ties things up quite nicely. The chapter on Fermi's paradox is also excellent. My criticism of this book, is that the author never explains why time dilation or length contraction occur at or near the speed of light. He only says, that this has been seen experimentally. Al-Khalili shows us his brazen anti-semitism, when he titles a section ""What's the final solution?""  I think this was an innocent mistake."

Not only was this book entertaining and easy to read, but it was informative and captivating.

I'm still getting my head around the Game Show Paradox.This is a mindbending fun book and I really enjoyed reading it."

Then, if the paradox was resolved he goes on to explain how it was done and what tools or logic were used.The book includes some other things too, mainly to show how spurious intuition can be. This one is the famous “Monty Hall Problem.” You might have heard of it if you are into mathematical puzzles like I am, but if you are not then here is my take on it from memory.You are on a Game Show in the final round. You are presented with three doors, let us call them “A”, “B”, and “C.” Monty Hall or the host or whoever tells you that you must pick a door from the three choices. Behind one door is a brand new car, and behind the other two doors are goats. You pick a door and Monty Hall opens another door that you did not choose, showing a goat. He then offers a deal; you can switch doors, or you can remain with the door you originally chose. Simple enough so far, but here’s the quandary; is it to your advantage to switch doors? The surprising answer to many is yes. Now at first glance, you might think that switching the doors doesn’t matter since you should have a one in two chance since there are now only two doors, but that is incorrect. Since the host KNOWS which one has the car, this changes the outcome of the game and the probability stays at one in three for each door. So that means that switching offers you a two in three chance to get the car rather than a one in two. Even professional mathematicians thought that this was the wrong answer and wrote angry letters to the editor that the author of the column was forced to respond to.Some of the other ones are also interesting historically. Take the paradoxes from Zeno of Elea for example. His paradoxes stated that motion was impossible, yet people and things move. They weren’t resolved rigorously until calculus was invented. In the same vein is Olbers Paradox. This might seem like a silly idea too, but it isn’t in the frame of the original problem. There should be stars in every direction from the Earth, right? Regardless of how far away they are, there should be a star there, providing light from that particular point. If that is the case, why is the night sky dark rather than filled with light? The answer to that didn’t come until Einstein put forth his General Theory of Relativity. The reason the sky is dark is that the Universe has a beginning and because there is a speed of light.Anyway, I had a grand old time with this book. All of the problems were interesting and explained in a manner that people should be able to understand. The book doesn’t contain any heavy math, so you won’t find field equations or anything too complicated."

Go read The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World. Let me know how this compares to that.Go read The Fabric of the Heavens: The Development of Astronomy and Dynamics. Let me know how this compares to that.Rubbish book I didn't like it at all. There's repetition, cladding out the pages with bland restatements of earlier, dull statements. I'd prefer not to compare across genres but I have to say that reading The Man Who Was Thursday coeval with this, and it shames this book. Mr. Khalili wrote to fill a page-count, no doubt. Constant refreshing of origin of the inquiry does dull one's curiosity.I have read a lot of 'Classic Logic Puzzles' and their ilk, maybe if I had not this book would contain novel material & be written in plain language that anyone can understand. But I have, it's not & if you haven't, & it is, I really do believe you could enjoy the books at top & bottom. The Beginning of Infinity is a better book, as far as shared objective go, Mr. Deutsch gives the paradox between mind & body the mad, searching intensity it deserves although really the 2 books don't share an objective. I expect Beauty to be one of the secret's of the universe, the paradox of metamorphosis where opposites swap, from Ugly comes Beauty & vice versa. Well you might learn more about the natural laws in Paradox, but not the best concatenation. The triple point of water seems a paradox, when the 3 (parochially exclusive) forms co-exist. Physics, being the laws of nature, had a paradox solved by germ theory. Something came from nothing, without microscopes this was soluble by (one of the) God's Will alone. You want 7 more? Nah, pay me.The Monty Hall paradox was the last section I read in full, after which I began to skim read. I tried, I really did, beginning in sober earnest at the start of each chapter, reading fully at least the first page. But what's the good of the Pole in the Barn paradox? It is entirely devoid of context, the terrain described is massively different from the manifest occurrence. Attempting to describe extreme possibilities of best-yet physics as though in an incompatible, mundane situation is Absurd. In my opinion, posit the metaphor / analogy as the clay from which to sculpt by removal of the cladding to leave the actual facts of the case. Mr. Khalili did not break the fantastic beginnings for the mystifying truth, not on the early chapters & later pages I read. I repeat, go read Free Radicals: The Secret Anarchy of Science. Let me know how this compares to that. Go read The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World. Let me know how this compares to that.

272,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14918035-esteban-lv,3,"Of all the books about physics for plebs (that is, without equations), I've read, this is one of the best.Professor Al-Khalili writes light and fast, keeping a brisk pace throughout the book; you can even go back an re-read a chapter that you still don't quite wrap around your head, and lose almost no time at all (see what I did there?)I was surprised of his opinion—stated a few times—that you ""most likely won't have heard of this and that unless you're a physics student"". That's simply not true and he does us avid readers—sons of Asimov and Sagan—a disservice: I've not only heard, but been on top of all the paradoxes listed for quite some years now. I even found a couple of (maybe) mistakes, told him on Twitter of one, he says in the Multiverse traveling back in time does not break the 1st law of thermodynamics, because mass and energy suddenly appearing don't alter the whole of m and e in all the Multiverses, but that's the same as saying that m and e appearing on a single universe do not change the total m and e of that single universe, particularly when considering the block universe in which all times are laid out. It seems he's just pushing the problem back a level. Another one is his opinion that science will be able to know what's outside the universe: that is impossible by definition. And also he mentions science will also know what's on the other side of a black hole: science understands black holes now, enough to realize they're not magical gates to another dimension, or whatever nonsense.All in all, an entertaining and informative read. A must if you want to understand what modern science has to say about the universe and how does it works.It's not without its faults, the errors mentioned (which really undermine the whole book), some minor discrepancies here and there (all electromagnetic radiation transfers heat, not only infrared), but in general good enough for the broad populace that has no clue of anything physics related."

Jim is smooth and direct in his explanation through out the book; this is is my first hardcore physics book and it was hard for a mediocre mind like mine despite the fact that Jim did his best to engulf all as his audience not only physicists or physics university students.I have wet dreams about space exploration - this is why i preferred the 2 paradoxes that Jim explored space rather than the 7 Quantum physics paradoxes. Why it's dark at night??? Never thought this would be a paradox, I ignorantly thought that this is what would be the case forever.. No i was wrong.It is a beautiful feeling when Jim expand about his quantum and space knowledge to us earthlings. I felt sure about the information spread out to me with the self assurance of Jim's style in writing. You can sense well when a guy know what he is talking about.How can a cat be alive and dead at the same time? How can someone arrive back to earth and find her twin brother older than her in 10 years?? And most important how can we make sure we ""earthlings"" are alone in the universe? Scary enough?? I bet it is more scary than if we weren't the only ones out there. Have a good read and enjoyable space ride through the big bang, multiverse, and time travel with such a geeky nerdy piece of physics book."
274,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62600339-ankit-gupta,4,"3.5/5A very interesting book which took me back to many years ago when I was studying physics and also propelled me to thinking about what future has/might have in store for us as humanity. It made me appreciate science even more as I today, after studying science, is doing a corporate business management job. 😊 I love what I do but the science geek inside me is happy and content and excited about the book I just read. The author does a good job in explaining all the scientific concepts in as simple a language as possible. He talks about their practical implications too rather than just theories. And lastly, he calls a spade a spade; doesn’t sugarcoat what might be bullshit. I would recommend picking this book to relive your science nerd inside you and also simultaneously feel good about the presence of science, and more importantly about the scientists who keep asking and trying to answer the very difficult questions!"
275,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182695-james-morrison,5,"Jim Al-Khalili wrote a book that goes from funny to profound. He starts with some entertaining puzzles from the past I had previously known about of, but does it in a fresh way that kept my interest. Later in the book some questions I have always wondered about are answered. Or at least explained given the current evidence. Are we alone in the universe? Are we unique? What is life? How big is the Universe? Is a time machine possible? These and many more engaging questions are examined and explained so people (like me) who are not physicists or mathematicians can at least get an inkling of the answer or to what extent an answer exists. It is all good, but I especially liked how he explained the Grandfather Paradox and Fermi's Paradox. I am always fascinated when an expert can take a deep subject and clarify it for the rest of us. I am recommending this book to my friends."
276,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14421553-randal,2,Not a favorite. I took 3-4 runs at this one and abandoned it with a chapter or so to go. Eventually I figured out why it doesn't work for me: It's no damned fun.Paradoxes are a source of wonder and some amusement for me: There's a sense of delight in how two seemingly contradictory things come together. That's missing from this book. The author seems much more concerned with reassuring the reader that the paradox is resolvable without violating the basic laws of physics than he does with laying out the paradox in the first place. Some readers might like this approach but for me it was backwards and robbed the book of any charm. 
277,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61898144-diocletian,4,"""He's quite a man, he is. In his spare time he studies the universe."" - Sid Waddell on Raymond Van Barneveld.I used to find this funny, then I realised it was me too. Paradox, a great read that leaves you begging for more. Al-Khalili explains complicated scientific concepts without patronising.The first chapter wasn't really about paradoxes at all, more counter-intuitive mathematical problems which I have read about umpteenth times elsewhere, so I skipped through them. I didn't like the second chapter, it was about Zeno's so called paradoxes. Read: silly ideas that do not represent the world but take a bit of reasoning to disprove. They do have their own place in the world - think ""The Quantum Zeno effect"" (observation can affect particle state), I just didn't enjoy reading about them.Obler's paradox was my favourite chapter. Why does it get dark at night, given that there an infinite number of stars and galaxies? I reasoned it was the inverse square law. Al-Khalili counters, if there are an infinite number of stars, then that wouldn't matter. Turns out, it is due to the expansion of the universe, and light from distant stars has not yet reached us and perhaps never will. I really liked the chapter on time travel too. Einstein's theory predicts wormholes, so time travel is theoretically possible. How do we consummate the paradox of going back in time and killing your grandfather? Or the fact that we have never met any time travellers? Multiverse theory plays the deus ex machine here. I'm not a fan of this theory, but I have to admit it ties things up quite nicely. The chapter on Fermi's paradox is also excellent. My criticism of this book, is that the author never explains why time dilation or length contraction occur at or near the speed of light. He only says, that this has been seen experimentally. Al-Khalili shows us his brazen anti-semitism, when he titles a section ""What's the final solution?""  I think this was an innocent mistake."
278,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11700174-julia,5,"This was my first book by Jim Al-Khalili and after finishing this, I cant wait to read more of his work.If you've always reached for fiction in lieu of books that bring back flashbacks from high school, you can rest assured, this book is more like a fun conversation with a friend, who just so happens to know a lot about physics and paradoxes. Not only was this book entertaining and easy to read, but it was informative and captivating. I would normally stay away from anything related to science as I was never interested in the topic, but now I feel I have the courage to approach science with a sense of excitement. "
279,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49149258-blair-mackinnon,4,"Reading through the paradoxes in this book was a bit like reading a Philip K Dick novel - nothing is the way you think it should be. The answers to the paradoxes seem counterintuitive and illogical but this just shows how the mind can trick itself into believing something that on the surface seems logical, and possibly even self-evident, but is in reality a logical and contradictory paradox. I'm still getting my head around the Game Show Paradox.This is a mindbending fun book and I really enjoyed reading it."
280,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12788229-christopher,3," The title of this book is hugely misleading, since most of these paradoxes have been resolved. Still, its an interesting trip through how seemingly counter-intuitive concepts can be worked out in science. I thought about putting this on my philosophy shelf too, because there certainly is a good deal of philosophy here, but while the author understands the history of the concepts he is talking about he tends to give very pat answers to any philosophical questions that come up in this book. So overall, this book is a fun breezy little read, but not something of any great substance. "

A good introduction to making people actually think about physics, some of the more important laws, and what they imply.

In certain places I found the physics too difficult to follow, and I fear that this was (in some cases) a result of the author trying to dumb it down. There is a certain brilliance to being able to explain extremely difficult concepts in a way that a lay person can understand them. (See Feynman.)
