0,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46878-james,1,"Too much of this book is fiction, and what isn't fiction is sometimes plain wrong. On p26 he claims that Watson & Crick used X-rays to calculate the positions of atoms within DNA. This is totally untrue. Watson & Crick did NO experimental work on DNA,an English woman did the X-ray work and watson & crick ""borrowed"" her work.  And borrowed much more from others. He also claims there was a ""general lack of interest in  by most of their contemporaries"" Again, FALSE, in the 1930's an american scientist proved that genetic information was passed on by DNA instead of proteins, and there was great interest in knowing the structure of DNA and how it worked. Many scientists including Linus Pauling were working on this. All watson & crick did was to go around and pick the brains of these other scientists and put things together. Everyone knew finding out how DNA worked would be worth a Nobel prize so they didn't share their experimental findings with each other. Watson & crick played the ""I'm just a schoolboy"" act to perfection and were able to get the others to open up to them. They should have gotten a prize for deceiving others,that was their real genius.  He spends a lot of time proving that the Polynesians came from Taiwan. This was proved long ago by language analysis, something he ""forgets"" to mention.Or didn't know. He didn't discover anything new here, merely added another layer of evidence. Why 7 daughters?Just a writers trick.Personally I think it would be more informative to have 100 or more. And spending a half page talking about his car problems in Wales?boringggg. Other writers have done a much better job writing about this subject."
1,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/403873-lissa,3,"The first half of this book gives an excellent and detailed description of Bryan Sykes’ thrilling investigative journey whereby he uncovers findings and develops his theory regarding mitochondrial DNA, DNA that is passed down from mother to child that, according to Sykes, can give us a record back through our mothers due to measurable degrees of mutation.While reading this book, keep in mind that, according to the author himself, the fictitious representations of the ""Seven Daughters of Eve"" are just that, fictitious. Sykes is not saying that DNA can tell us anything nearly so detailed as the daily life of an individual who lived thousands of years ago. Bill Bryson, in his book ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" appeared to be under an opposite impression that belied his ever having read Sykes’ work. In fact, if you so desire, you may simply ignore the second half of this book as unnecessary filler, an act I wish I had done myself. Had the book lacked this superfluous section, I would have given it four stars instead of three."
2,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24237425-james-hartley,4,"This is a good read, fascinating and well told. Who wouldn´t be interested to know that everyone in modern day Europe was born of seven mothers: seven clan heads who had no idea they were mothering the entire continent?The hows and whys of why of this are answered in the book, told in a kind of grandfatherly, gentle, humble way by Sykes. Included in the ride is a debunking of the Kon Tiki explanation of the populating of the South Sea islands and a fairly simple to understand background in what exactly DNA is and why we can use it to gain an amazing insight into history. Truly, there are great changes coming in how we understand ourselves thanks to the ability to now know, for certain, the early story of our violent, incredible species. Throughout the book are little knockout nuggest: it might have been one woman who walked out of Africa, for example, and populated the rest of the world. How mind boggling is that?But it´s four stars instead of five for me because of the structure of the book. It begins perfectly and reaches halfway with barely a glitch, but then, once the main theory is outlined, becomes padded out near the end. My feeling is the publishers thought there wasn´t enough information in the first book - the discovery part - to leave it as a standalone. Instead we get interesting but jarring chapters on each ""daughter of Eve"" and a conclusion which reads more like journalism. There are really two books here - the history of Europe and the history of the World told through DNA - but that can´t be summed up and sold so snappily.""There is no such thing as a genetically pure classification into different races,"" Sykes notes near the end. None of us are different, genetically speaking. We might ""believe"" in religions, money or countries, but they are artifical, imaginary constructs. At bottom, despite walls, wars, bans, divisions, cars, houses, guns, colours, flags and all the other bullshit, we´re all just one big squabbling family. And that´s a scientific fact."
3,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"First half is fascinating science, second half speculative fictionBryan Sykes, a geneticist at the University of Oxford, has specialized in the study of mitochondrial DNA through the matriarchal side to explore human evolution and the origins of different human populations. He began by extracting and multiplying ancient DNA samples from fossil bones, and then was involved with mapping the genome for the prehistoric Otzi the Ice Man, discovered perfectly preserved in the Italian alps, who lived around the third millennium BC. This first half of this book is a fascinating explanation of DNA, RNA, chromosomes, and the human genome in the context of our earliest origins, and with a focus on the seven major mitochondrial haplogroups that can be traced back to seven clan members and that form the original female ancestors of all modern Europeans. It's a daring premise, but as he sticks to the science of genetics and explains it very clearly for the layman science enthusiast, I felt like I understood it during the course of the book. He talks about the efforts to determine if the final remains of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia of the Romanovs, murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, were actually legitimate, and delves into a number of other examples to illustrate the power of mitochondrial DNA to reveal the true origins of various European ethnic groups over time.The second half is quite a departure, as he names the seven ""clan mothers"" Ursula, Xenia, Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine, and Jasmine and then imagines what their lives would have been like in early prehistory. It wasn't what I was expecting from this book on human genetics, as it is largely speculative although based on all the archeological evidence of the living conditions and artifacts and flora and fauna prevailing at those time, along with their likely cultural and social group behavior based on what we know of prehistorical tribes. Again, it was interesting but a much weaker part of the book, and when you consider how important the science of genetics is, I would have preferred that he focus his book on that. It's still a very interesting book and fit well with my recent reading in the area of evolutionary biology and prehistory. "
4,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1207684-bruce,3,"I picked up this book because I was interested in learning more about mitochondrial DNA and its inheritance patterns. In the first part of the book Sykes, a primary researcher in this field, does a solid job about explaining mitochondrial DNA and the history and process of how he used it in his research, tracing the questions he was asking and the methods that he and his team used. In the second part of the book, he “names” several ancestral women, all identified by their individual DNA sequences, whom he suggests are common ancestors of identifiable modern groups, imaginatively describing what their lives might have been and indicating where their descendents ended up first in Europe and then beyond. The final, shortest section of the book explores the some of the “soft” implications of his work.Sykes’s writing is unremarkable in terms of syntax and diction. It is usually straightforward and is most effective in the first part of the book. He does overly indulge in describing personality conflicts between himself and fellow scientists, but this is a minor issue. Basically, this section of the book adequately addressed the questions that I had at the beginning and was clear and interesting from a scientific perspective. His scientific explanations were sound.The second part is sometimes extremely speculative. Bryan tries to incorporate archaeological and anthropological findings into his renditions, but his fictional journey through the lives of his seven key women becomes tedious and repetitious. Why did this section seem relatively unsuccessful? Because Sykes tried to create a clumsy kind of historical fiction without being able to craft characters who were other than stiff and cardboard, characters with whom the reader could identify or sympathize. Consequently, the result seemed stilted and artificial. He might have done better simply to describe postulated historical conditions without trying to personalize them. I had the sense that his book was originally too short and this section was expanded beyond its necessary length to act more or less as filler.The final section is a romanticized emotional presentation of how wonderful it is that we are all at some level related to one another, that we are each a link in a chain going back thousands of years and are at some level kin. To my mind this section added little to the import of Sykes work and made it less scientific, a mere gesture to enhance the work’s popularity for what Sykes or his publisher felt to be the general reading public. They would have done better, in my opinion, just to present the facts of the method and their implications.Popularizations of science can be a tricky genre. It is necessary for an author to simply without oversimplifying, and that can be difficult. He or she must generalize without distorting, and creative use of metaphor is often required and effective, even as it must be made clear when and where the metaphor is imprecise. Brian Greene’s books on physics and cosmology are examples of superb presentation. Sykes’s book, while useful, suffers by comparison."
5,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2532254-karen,5,"I have been reading Saxons, Vikings, and Celts by the same author but have put it aside so that I can finish this book!!!I am a Sociologist by training with an emphasis on Anthropology so this is of real interest to me. Sykes writes for the average person but is of great interest to the professional.As some of the reviewers noted, the last half of the book is what the author imagines the lives of these ""clan mothers"" must have been like. Personally, it helps the non-scientific reader understand the concepts.I am not a ""science snob"" and read this book because of a personal interest, not scientific research information."
6,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"Brilliantly written and fascinating book. I guess the science is getting quite old by now, as it was written in 2001, but it was a wonderful account of how mitochondrial DNA developed. I thought that Bryan Sykes made a very complex topic extremely relatable for somebody that knows little about DNA and gene structures. I only picked this up as my daughter borrowed a selection of science books for her studies, but I read the synopsis and thought it sounded intriguing myself. I was definitely not disappointed and highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in science, or for that matter anyone with a curiosity about human evolution, family history, world migration and settlement, or even archeology. Great stuff and a reminder that we are all closely related, no matter where in the world we currently reside. "
7,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9573719-lisa-dunckley,5,"Bryan Sykes has written a supremely fascinating book. If you are interested in DNA or genetics or ancestry or science at all, you will love this book. If you've ever HEARD of DNA or genetics or science, or tried to trace your family tree, you will love this book :) Dr Sykes is one of the progenitors of modern DNA research. He was the first to propose that the mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited in an unbroken line from our mothers (and they from their mothers, etc), can be used to trace ancestry.The book starts with the discovery of a frozen corpse, dabbles in hamster breeding, segues into royalty, and ends with the knowledge of the maternal legacies worldwide.The frozen corpse is dubbed, appropriately, The Iceman. In 1991, two climbers come across a body in the Italian Alps. While everyone at first thinks it's perhaps the discovery of a missing climber, the primitive ice pick and other tools start the slow dawning of realization that this is a find of international importance—the body of a man who is thousands of years old. Eventually carbon dating put the Iceman at 5000-5350 years old. DNA was extracted and analyzed, and it was the same as modern Europeans. In fact, the mDNA was precisely the same as one of the samples Sykes had taken from a friend during his mDNA studies. This meant that Marie, his friend, had an unbroken genetic link between her and the Iceman (or technically with his mother). Sykes was fascinated by the ability to find this connection, and by the fact that the mDNA stayed intact through thousands of years of descendants. He decided to collect as many samples as possible from all over the world to see if there were maternal lines that modern people descended from, and if so, where, and how many.In the initial mDNA studies, the golden hamster was used as a test. Supposedly, ALL the golden hamsters on earth descend from one female. Golden hamsters are the breed of those popular pet hamsters, and also are the ones used in laboratories. If they all truly come from one female, they should all have the same mDNA, and it should be intact through the many many MANY generations of hamsters we have now. This turned out to be in fact 100% accurate. All the golden hamsters on earth are closely related through their mothers. All the golden hamsters that have ever been have descended from ONE female hamster.The mDNA of Pacific Islanders was used to finally solve an old argument--did Pacific Islanders migrate from the Americas, and go Westward? or did they originate from the far East of Asia and come East? There was evidence to support both theories, but the Mitochondrial DNA revealed the truth.It was instrumental in the mystery of the bodies discovered in Russia, that were thought to be the last of the Romanovs, the Tsar Nicholas II and his family, who were executed in 1918.Another puzzle that Sykes' studies figured out was whether modern Europeans came from the original hunters and gatherers, or from the later farming peoples. I went to flip through this book when I started this review, and ended up reading it cover to cover AGAIN. It is one of my favorite science books, and riveting is truly the best word to describe it. It reads like a suspense thriller! Highly recommend to everyone!"
8,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3745086-jayesh-shah,5,"This is a very interesting book. It is very well written. Bryan Sykes explains the science involved in his story in a very interesting fashion.It is fascinating and mind-boggling to imagine that as few as seven women could be ancestors of a whole continent of Europe. The author makes it clear in his book, that these seven women were not the only women of their times. Also, he explains that they were ancestors by maternal lineages only. There must be many other women who are ancestors of millions of people living today but they are not linked to them by maternal lineages only. In last 50, 000 years some women in their family trees may have had only male children and thereby maternal mitochondrial DNA would not recognize them. The title of the book uses the word `EVE' which may prevent many people from understanding this concept and they may not differentiate this idea from the biblical `EVE'.I wish the author had given some details about the mutations in the mitochondrial DNA in these seven `Eve's. I would like to know at what levels these mutations had occurred and how many mutations each one carried. He has given those details for Polynesian people. But, the book's title deals with seven women who are the ancestors of European people and the mutations in the mitochondrial DNA in these women 'is' the central part of the story. He has, unfortunately, not given those details. Simply stating that the mutations occur once every 10 thousands years is not sufficient.It is still a fascinating work and makes us think how genetics can help archeology in reconstructing our past. "
9,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7279850-belle,2,"After enjoying DNA USA so much, this was disappointing. I loved the stories, research hurdles, and data of the first portion, but the rest went down in a mudslide. The amount of speculation was enormous especially in origin of Polynesians, movement of neo-paleolithic peoples, and dating of the clusters. What made it worse is that he later referred to these conclusions like 'clearly,' 'as we now know,' 'without a doubt,' without furthur support, data, research, or reasoning. These footings were shaky at best, if not biased. The seven fictionalized chapters on the 'Daughters' were a waste of paper. I was mildly affronted by the trite narratives and cultural inaccuracies they presented. Really? They all had to be troubled teenagers or Mary Sue's? I was planning to read the rest of Sykes' accounts but not so sure now."
10,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26573870-feisty-harriet,3,"I snatched this book up in a used book store specifically to learn more about mitochondrial DNA, tiny little packets of genes inside a cell that are passed down the maternal line with a mutation only once in every 10,000 years or so. What does this mean? It means that my siblings and I all share the exact same mitochondrial DNA as my mother, and her mother, and her mother's mother's mother. My brothers did not pass that little M-DNA packet to their children as it is only in the egg, not the sperm; M-DNA is not swished around when a sperm and egg combine (X and Y chromosomes recombine, but M-DNA does not) as there is no sperm-M-DNA to recombine with, so that little packet of history remains practically identical for thousands of years. One of my favorite chapters was how using this brand-new testing (in the 1990s') for M-DNA from bones helped determine the final resting place of the Russian Romanov family who were murdered in 1918 and left in a hole in the Siberian forest. By extracting DNA from the bones, and then testing for mitochondrial DNA, scientists discovered that there was, indeed, a family. A mother and 3 daughters, the father of those 3 daughters, and 3 unrelated adults (doctor and 2 servants). By testing living relatives of Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna (meaning, living descendants of her SISTER), and testing other living relatives of Tsar Nicholas' MOTHER (Maria/Dagmar of Denmark), they were able to determine that yes, this family was the Romanovs. ISN'T THAT SO FASCINATING! I think it's fascinating. The idea that I am carrying history from my mother's mother's mother's mother's mother, back hundreds of generations, sends my feminist heart all a flutter.So, I *loved* learning more about M-DNA, how it was discovered, the studies and testing that have happened in my lifetime to figure out what exactly it is and how we can trace it. However, ""The Seven Daughters of Eve"" is SUPER misleading, because Sykes is really only talking about the seven matriarchs whose M-DNA has populated the majority of EUROPE. Throughout the world, there are just about 30 different ""clans"" of M-DNA that have survived. So, that was annoying. The very last chapter Sykes talks a little more about those other lines and how they may have spread. But the vast majority of his book is about the M-DNA of the 7 women who, anywhere from 10,000 to 45,000 years ago, were the head of surviving dynastic maternal lines which have thrived and are currently found in the vast majority of Europeans (and sometimes, only in Europeans)."
11,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4984449-cyndi,4,"One of the earlier books that started the genetic genealogy revolution. Most of the book is an insider's look at the process of making scientific discoveries, getting funding, publishing, and dealing with critics. A process that, in this case, quite happily ended up at full acceptance. Mitochondrial DNA illuminates the maternal line and gives us strong evidence both for relatedness of different populations and human migration over tens of thousands of years.The seven daughters of Eve are not sisters or even contemporaries. They are the names given to the seven women whose specific mtDNA mutations passed on to their daughters who went on to populate 95% of Europe. Deep Ancestry by Spencer Wells has a much better description of each mtDNA grouping (named by letters; the ""daughters"" were names that began with the standard letter) and gives them for the entire planet, not just for Europe.So-called Mitochondrial Eve is the single woman who lived in Africa about 150 thousand years ago (some accounts say 200 thousand) who is the maternal ancestor of every human being alive today. As mutations developed in her descendants, and those descendents separated and moved around the globe, they split into different mtDNA groups (haplogroups). Of the 30+ global haplogroups, a mere seven moved into Europe (and didn't die out) and they represent the maternal lines of nearly every native European.Skyes' book is well worth reading for anyone interested not just in what all these things mean but in how scientists come to these conclusions and how sure they are or aren't about each part. The first 2/3 of the book is about the process of discovery. The last 1/3 is a fanciful account of each of the seven daughters' lives, based on the time and place that they lived.Don't let this be the only book you read about genetic genealogy. I found it excellent for filling in gaps and understanding some of the history of this amazing field."
12,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7793277-neal,3,"Interesting science, which I don't totally understand but it goes something like this. Since we all have 50% DNA from father, 50% from mother, there's no way to trace back via DNA to see if somebody today is related to, say, DNA from a body found frozen in the ice of Italy from 20,000 years ago, since every generation back, our DNA would get more and more mixed and jumbled. BUT, there's a certain piece of DNA called Mitochondrial DNA that is passed on from the mother and never changes. Apparently, it's kind of a filler strand of DNA with not much of a specific purpose, but it's there nevertheless. Author of this book used Mitochondrial DNA to show that, for example, the people who live in the islands in the Pacific, like New Guinea, Polynesia, etc., came from Asia first, and migrated east. Or that there were two separate movements of people from Siberia into North America, at different times. Not earthshaking stuff, but interesting nevertheless. Then the book veers into the author creating imagined scenarios for 7 ""Eves'' whose DNA can be traced to from 7 different groups of current humans, which the author calls clans. Here it gets a little less satisfying because he's making stuff up but overall a good read. "
13,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1858310-emilie,2,"Big fat meh. I didn't find it particularly well-written or engrossing and I really didn't enjoy the fictional bits. I know Sykes was trying to make the 7 daughters of Eve more real, easier to relate to, but I found it trite and a little nauseating. I've read other books on genetics and found them much more interesting and informative, for some reason this one just slid off my face. The only thing I found truly interesting was the mention of race at the end (literally 5 pages before the end!) and I do wish there had been much more about the concept of race and the role the mitochondrial DNA and genetics in general could have in order to dispel this myth of race as skin colour/ethnicity/anything easily identifiable. The implications of that are much more interesting in my opinion than these ancestors of ours coming out of the woodwork and feeling a sense of identity with some woman from 30,000 years ago. My apologies, I just don't feel it. I appreciate Sykes' passion for his work and science but I didn't enjoy his writing much."
14,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14423679-maja,5,"Very interesting science book considering that it was written in 2001. Fast paced book that is very easy to read even for non-science people, like myself. First half of the book I read pretty fast on my summer vacation, second half took some time. Perfect introduction into popular science books."
15,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2039269-sheila,5,"Science moves on quickly in the world of genetics, and in that sense, Bryan Sykes’ Seven Daughters of Eve might soon be outdated. But there’s another sense in which this science book is bound to remain timeless, as it gives the very personal account of a life in science. The author conveys an enthralling sense of excitement, tying it delightfully to the everyday—what color’s your golden hamster perhaps?—and tying that all to the mysteries of DNA.The author’s search starts with fossils and centers on Europeans. The wonders of history and inheritance, and the happy accident of mitochondrial DNA are delightful explained. And as families of change are matched together, solving an eon-bending mystery, so the seven daughters appear.Combining hard and soft science, the author ends the book by describing the possible lives of these seven ancestors, bringing them to life, and rewarding that search for evidence with evidence of humanity. It’s a truly absorbing journey, told in an enjoyably conversational style, and a highly recommended read.Disclosure: A friend recommended it to me."
16,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62760666-sam-wilkinson,4,"This is a really interesting read. due to the science content (bearing in mind the time that has elapsed since my biology A'Level) it tool longer than I would have liked to read it, but I enjoyed it. The first 250pages are the non-fiction journey to the discovery, where the author discusses the research, the journey, publication and having to defend the research against critics and newer studies, and it's a fascinating insight into the world of scientific research. Then there are imagined storied of the lives of the 7 women. I actually enjoyed these, although I think I would have preferred more details about the research that shows what their lives may have been like. The final chapter, was more of an opinion piece than a summary and was my least favourite chapter of the book."
17,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48570258-kathleen,3,"My neighbor (an extremely smart Dr) recommended this book to me after learning I was interested in my ancestry & had done a DNA test. The concept of the book fascinated me ~ that all of us can trace our roots back to Seven Women who lived thousands and thousands of years ago. My neighbor said she was the daughter of ""Jasmine"" and she thought our ""mothers"" might be the same. Of course I jumped straight in, curiosity getting the better of me to find out if that was true or not. It didn't take two pages for me to realize I might be in over my head. She either over-estimated my intelligence or thought I was up to the challenge! ha Maybe the word ""science"" in the title should have been my first clue?This book is the closest thing I've read to a textbook since college. What does that say about my usual reading choices?? The first two hundred pages felt like taking (and basically were) a genetics course. I did get thru it, learning about proteins, collagen, chromosomes, DNA sequences, etc., plus the most important part, the piece of us that has remained unchanged from the beginning of mankind ~ the mitochondrial DNA. In a nutshell, that's the DNA we only get from our Mothers. I always knew ""Moms"" were the most pivotal part of our universe & this book, in a much more complex way, confirms that! The last 150 pages were the most interesting to me but because they were imaginary stories of each of the seven daughters depicting what their lives were most likely like & thus much easier reading. The women lived during different periods of time in history but all of them (amazingly enough to a non-scientific person) still genetically identical to people living in Europe today! At the end of each daughters story, the author gives the regions of Europe where their mitochondrial DNA shows up most frequently now. I need to talk to my neighbor about how she is so certain she is a daughter of ""Jasmine"" because I cannot tell (just from comparing my little Ancestry DNA test to the regions given in the book) from which daughter I get my lineage. It could be ""Jasmine"" but it could be ""Tara"" or ""Helena"" or even ""Ursula."" So, as interested as I was in the concept, the big revelation I was hoping for is still ambiguous to me. Reading 'The Seven Daughters of Eve' was a good stretch for my brain & most certainly not ""light reading."" I will retain some things from the book and like in college, I could regurgitate more talking to you the day after (like taking a test) but not sure the details will stick long term or that it matters in my day-to-day life. I'm glad there are people in this world whose brains work as well as this authors and who can unravel the mysteries of life & explain them in a way regular people can understand. We owe them a lot when it comes to cures, inventions, etc. Unfortunately that is not one of my gifts but I am proud of myself for reading the book! Next time this neighbor recommends a book to me tho, I will have to take a closer look before I rush to order it! ha ha"
18,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51447976-ramon4,3,"An interesting but weak book. Published in 2001, most of the information presented is no longer new. I bought the book in 2013, but it sat in my book shelf unread all this time. With the high price of new books, I’ve decided to read the many unread books in my library, and this was one.The author presents his scientific journey in studying mitochondrial DNA. It began for him when the ‘Iceman’ was discovered in 1991 in the Italian Alps. Iceman was dated to be between 5,000 and 5,300 years old. Professor Skyes was invited to join a scientific study team to see what could be learned from the Iceman. Professor Skyes was an expert on DNA, and he was able to extract and amplify some of the Iceman’s DNA.From a DNA analysis of the mitochondrial DNA, Professor Skyes determined that Iceman was related to today’s modern man, and in fact, had some direct decedents living in Italy.Professor Skyes explains how the mitochondria is a part of the animal cell. It exists not inside the nucleus, but in the cell. It also contains a single strand of DNA. Now the interesting thing about this DNA, is that from a genetic point-of-view, mitochondrial DNA is passed to the next generation only through the female. Only the female egg has mitochondria DNA; the male sperm has no mitochondria. This means the mitochondria in you comes unchanged from your mother.Professor Skyes goes on to explain that mutations in mitochondrial DNA occur only very rarely, like once every 2,000 years. So by examining large samples of mitochondrial DNA, it is possible to group type this DNA, and determine families and clans.Professor Skyes next studied large samples of Polynesian DNA and helped settle the question of the origin of the Polynesian people: they originated in Asia.Professor Skyes next studied large samples of European DNA. His findings there indicate that the mitochondrial DNA European people can be grouped into seven different types, which are descended from a common ancestor. It is here That Professor Skyes drifts into fiction. These seven types have been given letter names for scientific study. In the last chapters of his book, he gives these seven different types women’s names, and calls them the Seven Daughters of Eve. He devotes a chapter to each woman, explaining the age she lived in, and what type of life she led.Professor Skyes explains that he is only gathering the known data known from the different sciences and constructing a fictional story so that we may identify with each daughter.I say the book is weak because I think there is only enough good information here to fill a good multi-page article in a scientific magazine, but stretching it into a book seems like overreach."
19,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"It’s been a while since this book was published, of course, and the science of investigating ancient mitochondrial DNA has been going from strength to strength, but this is still a good book on the background of that research, the importance of mitochondrial DNA, and the idea that we can trace our lineage back through the female line to just a few specific women. (Actually, this is very Europe-centric, a fact that becomes clear when you read the whole book: the seven ‘clan mothers’ mentioned are only the last common ancestors of European mitochondrial lines.)Sykes writes clearly and well, and the only bit I wasn’t happy with as popular science writing is the little fake histories of the seven women. He tries to put flesh on the bones of what the women might have been like, the environment and social situations they would have encountered, but it’s really far too much like pure fiction for me. If he’d even included some more perhapses and maybes and alternative scenarios, I might have been more comfortable with it. As it is, it gives us a false idea that there were seven such knowable women.Still, it’s fascinating stuff and I do love reading about this kind of genetic detective work."

The pace is slow and often digressive, the real point of the book could have been achieved in half the length and been much stronger for it. The writing drove me crazy…I got tired of the personal travelogue and the personal feuds and experiments, which became repetitive. The author seemed more concerned with his memoir than the actual science of the field. In short, this book was more subjective than objective and really, highlights why I don’t read memoirs or autobiographies. I wanted a book about the science of genetics leading to the seven daughters, not a personal account of the author and his opinions and personal journey.  So, I give this one a 3 upon reread. I liked the science part and the witty British writing. I detested the lack of objectivity and the way the book was mostly personal memoir not about the science per se. "
21,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7470972-bel-n,3,"Credit where credit's due, the age of this book must be considered because 18 years is an eternity in a field like population genetics. As an example of this, a paper that could possibly throw all of Syke's work overboard was just published last month.This book was misleading at best and straight-up reification of abstract concepts at worst. Misunderstandings surrounding mitochondrial ""Eve"" and Y- chromosomal ""Adam"" come to mind as well.For that, and for not giving my ancestor Ina (""mother"" of mitochondrial haplogroup B) a cool backstory to match her descendants' amazing feat of sailing the south Pacific and, eventually, the coast of the Americas, three stars. Just kidding.Or not."

Maximal story about what goes on in the lab and in the archeological dig and in the scientific confab.It's a tough sell, but once you GET IT, that all Europeans go back to the same seven ladies and fourteen men, it's GREAT!

24,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61557581-behrooz-parhami,4,"Named Helena, Jasmine, Kathrine, Tara, Ursula, Velda, and Xenia, the seven daughters of the book’s title are women who lived some 10,000 to 45,000 years ago, with nearly every European genetically linked to one of them. Figure 6 of the book, reproduced below, depicts the seven daughters (dark circles), along with their age and relationships. The map (not from the book) shows where the seven women lived and what percentage of modern Europeans are descendants of each.Link to Figure 6:https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fb...Link to map and table:https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fb...Tracing of a human’s female ancestors is easier than male ancestors, because of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) being passed from a mother to her daughters with very little error or modification. Because of this reliable and relatively error-free transmission of genes, it is possible to verify genetic relatedness over hundreds or even thousands of generations of maternal succession with near certainty. Mutations along this line of succession are rare, occuring roughtly once every 200+ generations, a fact that can be used to date mtDNA samples in a probabilistic sense. Through this method, all human beings in the world have been linked to the so-called “mitochondrial Eve,” a female ancestor of all of humanity who lived 150,000 years ago.Before the research described in this book, the prevailing theory about the ancestery of Europeans was the so-called “wave of advance” [p. 153], which suggests that Europeans are by and large descendants of Near-Eastern farmers who moved westward and dominated (genetically) the former residents of the continent. The first known domestication occurred about 11,000 years ago in the Near East [p. 135]. So, if the wave-of-advance theory were correct, nearly all European genes should be traceable to ancestors living after the end of the last Ice Age. Yet, only Jasmine, the maternal ancestor of only 17% of Europeans, supports this theory. Ancestors of a vast majority of Europeans were already living in Europe well before the advent of farming [p. 184].Sykes got a lucky break that helped him prove his theory regarding the reliable transmission of mtDNA. When the frozen remains of a 5000-year-old Ice Man were discovered in Italy in the 1990s, Sykes was called to examine them. He was able to extract genetic material from the long-dead body and eventually located one of his living descendants in Great Britain. An amazing feat, when one thinks about it. Many of us struggle to find our ancestors of a few generations ago, and this woman by sheer luck, found her Ice-Man ancestor from some 200 generations ago!In studying the human pre-history, genetics is only one of the available tools. Genetic deductions can be combined with linguistic and archaeological discoveries to make more accurate connections. The developments in genetics are exciting, but there are also down sides. A vigorous battle is raging among corporations to patent genes in order to facilitate and attract investments. This is very troubling, as such patents may impede scientific research.An unfortunate roadblock in tracing a person’s female ancestery, which would lead to a maternal family tree [p. 291], is the practice of women adopting their husbands' surnames. So, when going generations back, it is common to lose the thread due to name changes. If we had the complementary practice of passing a woman’s surname (what we now call maiden name) to children, following the lineage via mtDNA would have been much simpler [p. 291].More than two dozen other daughters of eve have been discovered that are responsible for populations on other continents. While the author focuses on mtDNA, there is also a parallel paternal pathway through past generations via the SRY gene that one might say leads to “sons of Adam” [p. 187].In the book’s penultimate paragraph [pp. 296-297], the author philosophizes thus: “An electronic board in the lobby continuously flashed up the DNA sequences as they came off the machines. Before my very eyes the details of the genome that had been hidden for the whole of evolution were marching across the screen. Was this, the reduction of the human condition to a string of chemical letters, the ultimate expression of the Age of Reason that first began to separate our minds from our intuition and to distance us from nature and our ancestors? How ironic that DNA should also be the very instrument that reconnects us to the mysteries of our deep past and enhances rather than diminishes our sense of self.”Let me end my review by relating a few interesting tidbits from the book.- Two fishermen on a small island in Scotland had ancestors in Portugal and Finland, respectively, with those ancestors related through someone in Siberia [p. 295]. The magic of genetics discovered this relationship that would have remained hidden otherwise.- The world’s most prolific male was Moulay Ismail, Emperor of Morocco, father to 700 sons at age 49 in 1721 (and perhaps as many daughters, but in those days, daughters weren’t all that important, so no one kept track of the numbers). Moulay Ismail died in 1727, so he may have had many more children.- The world’s most prolific female was Mrs. Fedora Vassilyev of Russia who produced 69 children from 1725 to 1765. They were all multiple births: 6 pairs of twins, 7 sets of triplets, and 4 lots of quadruplets."
25,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61015108-tricia,4,I found this book incredibly fascinating. Using DNA sequencing they have determined that all of the people in Europe are descended from seven women. These seven women developed a genetic mutation in their mitochondrial DNA that has been passed down to their children through the female line. They can even determine approximately where and when they lived. The book does get a bit heavy in places as it goes through the DNA but it is told in a way that is not overbearing.The book ends on a bit of a fictional narrative of what the woman's life would have been like living in that period.
26,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/244753-lia,4,"I was already fascinated with haplogroups before picking this up, and genetics is always an interesting field, so this was an enjoyable book. I thought I was waiting to get to the profiles of the named clan mothers, but all of the preceding chapters about the Polynesian origins and ancient remains research and rival-scientists/theories woes were really fun! It was especially interesting that his research reversed the prevailing theory that modern Europeans were mostly descended from the people from the Fertile Crescent who brought farming to Europe... but it was farming as an idea that spread through Europe, and a significant amount of farmers came, too, but mostly, modern Europeans are descendants of the paleolithic European foragers (hunter-gatherers is the outdated term). (80% foragers to 20% farmers)I was actually disappointed when I got to the clan mother stories and had to roll my anthropology-major eyes at the awful inaccuracies in each one (he's a geneticist, not an anthropologist). For instance, he had the women being in serious trouble if their man died and they had mouths to feed, but tribes don't often function as groupings of nuclear families, where only the father provides meat for those children, and they'd become a burden on someone else if he (or their mother) was gone. In reality, the tribe would fairly easily take care of all members, and these ancient tribes were more likely to be matrilineal, and not tracking whom was the father of particular children, and making him ultimately responsible for their survival. So that was a very modern, patrilineal, Western way of imagining the situation. They were certainly entertaining little tales, and Sykes is a good storyteller, and a good writer in general, as well as a lucky geneticist to have been in the center of the ancient mitochondrial DNA work. The chapter that covered Neanderthals is out of date, since it concludes that Neanderthals went extinct when modern humans replaced them. We know, now, that modern Europeans (and their diaspora) carry up to 4% Neanderthal DNA, so we are what became of them.I loved that he pointed out that race is not a biological fact, and shot down the concept of racial purity - no such thing. Every grouping of humans that we think of as a race has a mixture of several strains of mtDNA and yDNA from migrations and blending. (The same goes for cultures and religions, BTW.)I enjoyed reading this book! Couldn't put it down! The ending was especially touching. If you've had your DNA analyzed, and you're in Ursula's clan, too, say hello! :)"
27,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"How genetic knowledge is rewriting the prehistoryThis is a popular book of scientific discovery written in an affecting and engaging style by a geneticist who has the all too rare gift of writing extremely readable prose.Professor Bryan Sykes draws the reader into his story as easily as a best-selling novelist. And this is just the ""science"" part of the book which lasts for fourteen chapters. Then come the fictional chapters about the seven daughters and their imagined stories, so touching and so full of the very human struggle to survive in the prehistory that I could not read them without misting up. (But then I tend to the sentimental.)Sykes begins with the story of how he was able to identify a living descendant of the five-thousand year old ""ice man"" found in northern Italy in 1994 by comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences. Mitochondrial DNA is contained only in egg cells (thus, ""Eve"" and her daughters), not in sperm cells, and transmitted without recombination so that the changes are all the result of mutations that occur at a predictable rate over time. Then he tells the story of how the bodies of the murdered Romanovs, the last of the Russian Tsarist families, were identified through DNA fingerprinting. Both of these stories are more about media events and ventures in forensics than original scientific work. But then comes the story of where the Pacific Islanders originated.When I was young I read the engaging story of Thor Heyerdahl in his book Kon-Tiki in which he attempted to prove that the Polynesians originated in the Americas by sailing west into the Pacific. This beguiling theory is demolished once and for all by the DNA evidence that Sykes presents. He shows that the Polynesians were originally from Southeast Asia and made all their great ocean discoveries by sailing against the prevailing winds, going east toward the Americas.Sykes notes that because this was the prevailing scientific opinion his work met with mostly agreement. However when he and other geneticists were able to show that the current population of Europe is mainly descended from the original hunters and gathers that lived there prior to the arrival of the farmers who brought agriculture from the Middle East roughly ten thousand years ago, they ran into resistence. The prevailing scientific opinion was that the farmers overwhelmed the hunters and that most of today's Europeans are descended from those farmers. Sykes relates the story of the scientific controversy and how the genetic proof finally prevailed against entrenched opinion. Incidentally, to me the intriguing thing about this discovery is the question, not addressed in the book: What, if any, conclusions can we draw from the fact that 80% of our European genes came from hunters and gathers and only 20% from Middle Eastern farmers?There is also the story of the ""Cheddar Man"" and how Sykes learned to extract DNA from the bones of people dead tens of thousands of years. Finally there is his argument for all people of European descent coming from just seven women who lived ten thousand to forty thousand years ago, the so-called, ""Seven Daughters of Eve."" (World-wide Sykes identifies 33 ""daughters of Eve."")To round out the book, Sykes writes an imaginative chapter about each one of the seven daughters. Here is where some readers are displeased, claiming that Sykes's imaginings are unscientific and even slanted. One reader complained about the men out hunting and the women remaining behind in caves as a kind of stereotype that has been overcome. But remember Sykes is writing in six cases out of seven about European peoples who made their living primarily from hunting during the ice ages, not from gathering. Think about how much ""gathering"" the Inuit do and you can see why he emphasized hunting. In the seventh case, about Jasmine, whom he sees as being from the birthplace of agriculture in modern Syria, his story is different. Indeed he has Jasmine and her non-hunting mate inventing agriculture! I might also point out for those who skimmed the ""daughters of Eve"" chapters, that he also has a woman playing a major part in the invention of water-going craft.If I were to criticize this book I would say he was too generous in his depiction of human beings in the prehistory. He describes their lives as hunters and gathers, their hardships and their short and difficult lives with an emphasis on their humanity and how that helped them to survive. He downplays any part humans may have had in the extinction of the Neanderthal. He relates no rapes or murders or tribal wars, and de-emphasizes tribal sexism. He shows the beginnings of trade and cooperation. The result is so warm and touching I'm surprised that Stephen Spielberg hasn't taken out an option on the book. (Maybe he has!)Finally, this is not an academic tome. It is a popular science book meant for educated lay persons. There are no learned academics writing glowing blurbs on the cover. Most academics would be afraid to write a book like this because of the imaginative chapters which are quasi-scientific and can be so easily criticized.In short Professor Sykes is a tremendously engaging writer (with guts) who happens to be a world-class scientist. His goal was to communicate something about what he has learned to a wide readership, and I think he did a good job. If you can read this book without feeling better about humanity, maybe you should read it again. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

Bryan Sykers does a brilliant job of bringing to life the thousands of ancestors that stand behind us and build up a picture of who we are. Favourite chaper is A sense of self. ""DNA is the messanger which illuminates that connection, handed down from generation to generation, carried, literally, in the bodies of our ancestors. Each message traces a journey through time and space, a journey made by the long lines that spring from the ancestral mothers. We will never know all the details of these journeys over thousands of years and thousands of miles, but we can at least imagine them. I am on a stage. Before me, in the dim light, all the people who have ever lived are lined up, rank upon rank, stretching far into the distance. They make no sound that I can hear, but they are talking to each other. I have in my hand the end of the thread which connects me to my ancestral mother way at the back. I pull on the thread and one womans face in every generation, feeling the tug, looks up at me. Their faces stand out from the crowd and they are illuminated by a strange light.

33,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51196399-gary,5,"I found this book compelling, fascinating, an enjoyable read and an education in itself. What is wonderful about this book is that Bryan Sykes explains and teaches us about DNA and his own research and conclusions into mitochondria and the origins of humankind and it's ancestry through DNA research in way those of us without science degrees can understand.  It is a narrative of our common heritage and our shared forebears. The author explains to us in a way that is easy to understand what is DNA and what it is does. How we can trace common ancestry to people in other parts of the world, and his theory that all indigenous Europeans are descended from seven common female ancestors who he refers to as 'the seven daughters of Eve'  His research gives us much genuine food for though, he remarks how in centuries past , how many women who were made to suffer for not producing male heirs would have loved to know that the truth is only the male sperm cells that determine whether the child conceived will be a male or female. It is the Y chromosome that makes a child a male, without which the child will be a female.  He draws us to the interesting fact that one in every 20 000 female children have a Y chromosome, and these girls look normal and have normal intelligence, though the tend to be a little taller than average. but when they reach puberty their uterus and ovaries do not develop properly and they do not produce children.  Sykes uses mitochondrial DNA evidence from the remains of the Romanov Russian imperial family to cast serious doubt on the theory that when Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, one or two of his daughters survived. According to Sykes DNA proves all of the Tsar's children were murdered.  He also proves that almost of Native Europeans are descended from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers who were in Europe 50 000 years ago and not as some theorists have told us from Neolithic farmers who migrated to Europe some 10 000 years ago, and diluted the European gene pool-they did not.  The last part of the books gives seven semi-fictional stories of the seven matriarchal ancestress of modern indigenous Europeans. These were real people with almost identical DNA to their modern descendants but living in very different circumstances to them. Ursula , Xenia , Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine and Jasmine. I would also recommend the work by Rabbi Yaakov Kleinman 'Tradition and DNA' which traces the ancestry of modern day Jews to ancient Israel."
34,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2560917-kara,3,"The first three quarters of this book were packed full of genetics, human biology, anthropology, and even a little archeology and geography. If you ask me (and I guess you are), that is way too much scientific -ology. Unless you really like that stuff. I've heard there are people that do.Anyway, I liked the book because I appreciated the authors humor and I found the whole idea of tracing our genealogy back so far extremely interesting. I especially liked his analogy of all of his ancestors holding onto a thread.I did have a couple problems - first, was the time line. I have been informed that there is no way that even Adam and Eve lived as long ago as Bryan Sykes is saying these people were living, so that throws a big wrench in this for me. I am very uncomfortable with science and the the bible not meshing. I can't help but think we must be missing something and that if we would just do it right science would support the bible. But people, he has DNA! However, despite the DNA for the record and for all heaven to hear - I will take the side of the Bible. Big can of worms though. Very big. I will just pretend in my own little dillusional world that all of his science is correct but the timing is wrong and my Grandma is a direct maternal descendent of Tara, darn it! (Ooops! Can we say the d word on this site?)My second problem was with the last quarter of the book where Bryan introduced us to his own dillusional world. It was very odd and a bit disconcerting to go from all of that scientfic jargon to fiction. It didn't even really seem like fiction. It was kind of weird. I think that the idea behind it was interesting and would have been useful if he had described what we know to be true about those times through all the stupid -ologies in a different way and left what he imagined out. Although, I did get a kick out of him describing Tara as a woman with straight brown hair and blue eyes that loved the ocean. I could be Tara reincarnated! Just kidding. That would be another can of worms."
35,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies,3,"This book by the great pioneer of genetic archaeology and Oxford professor is at times rather dreadful. Many readers have been appalled by the fictional biographies of the individual women at the origin of the seven ""maternal"" clans to which 95% of Europe's population belonged at the end of the 20th century. I can hardly disagree. Syke's story of his research and his elucidation of the basics of mitochondrial DNA basis make for fascinating reading. Syke's yarn-spinning is as tedious as it is uninformative. Syke's greatest sin in my view is his public gloating over his academic rivals that he bested in his long and distinguished career. Nonetheless his venom and spite may be the most entertaining part of this book.Syke's big point is that he believes he demonstrated that 75% of the current European gene pool dates from the paleolithic era (1.8 million years ago to 10,000) AD. This would suggest that the diffusion of technology, the introduction of new agriculture methods and the changes in the linguistic profile of the Europe over the last 12,000 years were not the result of population movements. Rather the various peoples of Europe either invented new techniques on their own or simply adopted them as they became aware of them. This is a very major point as it had long assumed that the innovations had arrived with migrations of peoples.Sykes simply allows his major thesis to get submerged in a great deal of anecdotes and somewhat pointless fictionalizing. Nonetheless this book still merits being read as it provides considerable insight into genetic archaeology which is now yielding very interesting results from the four corners of the world. However, the reader should first read Sykes ""Blood of the Isles"" which is vastly superior in every way."
36,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1738417-ronda,3,"Interesting and thought-provoking read, but there were a few things that I found distracting. Early on, Sykes mentions some tension between himself and one of his co-workers. Later, he addresses events around this same person, who is involved in research and a paper that has devastating potential toward the research on mitochondrial DNA. Sykes' description of the events and final outcome come off as a ""nyah nyah"" thumbing of his nose at this person and ended up making me feel less sympathetic to him and his efforts--regardless of the truth or non-truth of his interpretation of the events. His handling of this could easily have been handled differently, to the benefit of the story he is presenting. The other distraction was the rather abrupt launch into the stories of the seven daughters' lives. I enjoyed his interpretations of their lives, but would have appreciated more of a lead-in of some sort to explain how he came up with these stories. Now, complaints aside, I found this book to be thought-provoking on many levels. It reinforced for me the idea that each new 'discovery' opens so many more paths to be explored and that those lead to yet others perhaps not yet dreamt of. It also helped me put some science behind my own personal musings about similarities in appearance between people who are, ostensibly, not related--either genealogically or biologically--combinations of nose shapes, hair colors/textures, body builds. The book was easy to read (which I mention b/c I had feared that it would not be lay-person friendly) and, ultimately, I was glad that I finally took the plunge and read it. "
37,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45388112-andrew,4,"This was a really fascinating read. I knew only a very little bit about genetics and ancient human history going in, but Sykes writes in a way that feels entry-level understandable AND useful. In other words, I didn't feel like I was being talked down to but I did feel like I understood all of the important mechanisms described in the book. This is much easier said than done, I'm sure.The book is about the way a particular kind of DNA is used to trace the maternal lineage of people over the course of many thousands of years. Incredibly, this enables us to approximate seven women in ancient history whose descendants make up every single modern human of European descent. In so doing, we can understand with some measure of accuracy where each of our ancestors lived, what groups they may have belonged to, the path humanity took as it traveled out of Africa and populated the world, etc. Besides being an actual ground-breaking scientist, Sykes has a real talent for storytelling. For much of the book it's the sort of story he might tell over drinks to his friends, about a funny thing that happened between himself and a professional rival, about an exciting new discovery a peer made, about the modern implications of his work. He draws connections that are genuinely thrilling: what it means to have a scientific ancestry that depends entirely on women, not the manual ones drawn up by and for men. A history that cannot be erased by oppressors and those who would destroy someone's culture. He is able to put across the excitement he surely must have felt first-hand while making these connections and discoveries."
38,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"Sykes traces the history of most Europeans back to 7 women through an examination of mitochondrial DNA. I love the science behind this book. An examination of the DNA shows how very related most people are. Would love to see this done for places like India where caste differences make people treat each other badly. Wouldn't it also be cool to take it even further and relate the Europeans back to say the Africans and show how related blacks and whites might be. Sykes shows how he may be related to the last Tsar through his mitochondrial DNA. I did not give this book 5 stars because much of the book is not about the 7 women but rather about the science and Sykes' quest. The chapters about the 7 women are in some ways the least interesting as they are mainly conjecture about the kind of world they may have lived in and Sykes is not good at fiction as the women don't really come alive in these chapters. However, his scientific journey is extremely interesting and intriguing. There are times when personality clashes take up room and still seem to rankle to Sykes but I suppose that's his writing style. He is not as smooth or accomplished a pop science book as say Bryson but I'm glad he wrote this book for mass consumption because this story (about mitochondrial DNA and what it can tell us) certainly needed telling."
39,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/725357-nate,4,"Although this book was written in 2001, it is still a useful introduction to the study of human genetic ancestry for the layperson like me. Sykes is unique for having been at the forefront of major discoveries in genetics, such as sequencing the Iceman (Otzi)'s genome and finding modern descendants, helping to identify the bodies of most of the members of the massacred Russian royal family, and tracing 95% of Europeans' female ancestors to just seven women who lived between 45,000 and 10,000 years ago. Sykes' writing style is engaging, especially considering his background as a scientific researcher. I would wonder if it was ghost-written, except for his background in journalism. Most of the book is not about the ""Seven Daughters of Eve""; however, the background information is just as interesting. It takes a good portion of the book to build up to the fictionalized vignettes of these women at the end. Although the stories seem contrived, they do humanize these women and offer insight into the everyday challenges for people in prehistoric Europe, especially during the last ice ages. I wonder if one of my mitochondrial ancestors was one of these women. There's a 95% chance that this is the case. "
40,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"Were Polynesian islands peopled by Asians or American Indians? Are the skeletons found at Iekaterinburg the ones of the Romanov family? Is Neanderthal really extincted or, does he have any descendants? What about the Europeans? Do they have Croc-Magnon for ancestor or, farmers coming from the Middle-East? Bryan Sykes tells us the discoveries made by genetics thanks to mitochondrial DNA, a bacteria passing from generation to generation through the maternal line only.Enthusiast, he is like a kid in a sweetshop. His writing style for instance reflects very well his fascination and excitement -it is actually so accessible that, we sometimes have the feeling of reading a novel! This will be a bit puzzling to whose used to science books but, the others will thus find him easier to understand.I just think the last chapters (the reconstitutions of the seven Eves' lives) are completely useless. I understand they are a very easy way of describing nomadic life, the birth of agriculture, the first villages and so on but, are such fictions not ridiculous in a non-fiction book? Why not using an Appendix? Well, as it is targeted for a very wide audience...Still a good read."

I've now read several books on tracing human orgins through DNA, but this was the first one and it's the one that really got me to thinking about who these women really were. I really had to stretch my mind back and realize that one of the seven daughters is my ancestor! It rekindled my desire to do genealogical/family history research, especially on my mother's side back through all the women. It's difficult, because women's identities become subsumed in with their husbands. The maiden names become difficult to track. I have moved my search to Belgium and found my great grandmother's parents. Of my four lines, this is the first to go back to Europe as they were the most recent immigrants to the States. The writing is clear and interesting and Sykes gets you so interested, you find yourself with a pencil in your hand to be sure to mark the really good stuff. I made a multiribbon book mark to place the passages that really intrigued me. "
42,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2684619-reiden,4,"I heard about this book in a geography class I took a few years ago, and I thought it did a good job explaining how matrilineal lineages can be traced using mitochondrial DNA. I do agree with several of the other reviews which state that there was a little too much of the book spent on European decent and the fictional narratives of the Seven Daughters, but other than that it was a great book. As much as I wanted to get back to the science of the genetic testing described in the first half of the book, the narrative in the second half did provide a glimpse into the lives of people who we will probably never hear much about without the use of some imagination combined with the knowledge based on the limited supply of archeological and genetic evidence that we have from our distant ancestors. I can only hope that as more light is shed on this area of science, humans will begin to realize the deeper connection that we all have to one another via our common ancestors. "
43,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/200881-william-ramsay,3,"This is a very interesting book that does damage to any lingering ideas of racial superiority. By genetic testing of thousands of people, Sykes has show that everyone of European extraction can trace his or her ancestry to just seven women who lived between 10 and 45 thousand years ago. Not only that, but DNA testing and archeology have shown that we are all Africans at the core. All I could think of while reading this is that so much blood has been spilled because one man thinks he's superior to another when there is no scientific basis for it at all. I think the book slowed a bit in the middle and his description of the lives of the seven women are the root of our ancestry was a bit speculative for a scientific work. But I enjoyed reading it. The actual science of DNA is unbelievably fascinating. "
44,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12609637-s,1,"Hmm The first part of the book is OK. However, the third part really lets it down. While there is absolutely no doubt that people's mtDNA can be traced back to one of several haplotypes, there is debate of how many unique haplotypes there are. Why should a descendent become a new haplotype and another not? Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to believe that haplotype and fictional lifestyle in the past has any effect on anyone's current personality or lifestyle proclivities. I would definitely not pay to test my DNA for a just-so story as this.I worked in the same Dept as the author for a few years and found the business he set up around testing people's mtDNA and then presenting them with a preprinted certificate about their clan ancestry close to charlatanry. "
45,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"I enjoyed this look into the evidence of mitochondrial DNA. The first 2/3's concentrates on the discovery that mitochondrial DNA can be used to look at family trees into the far past and the establishment of the science behind the theory. The author has an ""everyday"" voice that is easy to follow and understand.The last third of the book gives each ""daughter"" a chapter and gives a romanticized account of their life. The topography, animals, living conditions, tools, etc. that is described in these chapters are historically correct but, of course, the actual women's lives aren't. It's a fun way to end the book.I found this to be a very interesting book. "
46,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44237-janel,5,"This book really was amazing. It answered questions I had from other books (which continent did the Polynesians come from. When did the native Australians arrive). It answered questions I didn't even know enough about the subject to have before (What is the difference between a Paleolithic modern human and a Neanderthal). I learned a lot about genetics and how they can answer those questions. Plus, he's a great storyteller. It was fascinating to read the narratives he wrote about the lives of the Seven Eves.I wasn't really hooked until Chapter 6, though I was interested enough to keep reading until there.

It's interesting, compelling, and thought provoking.But then, and I can't be the only one to think this, when he starts describing the lives of the seven daughters, it gets weird.

58,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,4,"I heard about Sykes' book in a footnote to Kevin MacDonald's Culture of Critique: ""Current data indicate that around 80% of European genes are derived from people who settled in Europe 30–40,000 years ago and therefore persisted through the Ice Ages (Sykes 2001). This is sufficient time for the adverse ecology of the north to have had a powerful shaping influence on European psychological and cultural tendencies."" MacDonald was making the argument that north-west European people have uniquely low ethnocentrism due to environmental challenges being the most important factor in evolving group strategies as opposed to competition with other groups, which MacDonald holds creates more ethnocentric cultures, such as in the Middle East. To be clear, Sykes' book is a book of popular science and isn't political, that's just what motivated me to read it. Sykes' work is a genetic history of modern Europeans traced back to seven mothers 40-10,000 years ago, from the last ice age to the arrival of agriculture. The method Sykes presents is mitochondrial DNA traced through the mother. Mitochondrial DNA exists outside of the cell nucleus and so doesn't go through the same recombination mutations like sexual gametes and so changes much slower, allowing us to measure the time between individual mutations to locate the difference from an ancestor without the mutation. For this mtDNA to be traced, a mother has to have more than one child so her genes will be shared by future generations. Because these genes are traced through one parent, the genetic lineages are called haplogroups as opposed to diplogroups. A single mutation occurs about every 10,000 years, and so these mutations are a measure for how many years separate genetic lines. The story goes that the Homo sapiens left Africa 100-70,000 years ago probably via the Arabian peninsula to spread to Eurasia and Oceania and eventually the Americas. Some earlier went along the coast of Southeast Asia all the way to Australia 50,000 years ago. Later on Homo sapiens arrived in Europe through Central Asia and split off genetically with mongoloids 30-40,000 years ago. There were other hominids in Eurasia long before Homo sapiens however; Neanderthals in Europe and Homo Erectus in Asia. The first Europeans are called Cro-Magnons who are known to us through their famous cave art. Eventually the Neanderthals died out around 30,000 years ago. The popular argument goes that Neanderthals weren't as creative as Homo sapiens despite having large brains (and bodies) who could create and pass on their knowledge. The Cro-Magnons also had large brains, larger than Europeans today which shows up the cave art they have left. Now these Cro-Magnons don't look exactly like Europeans today. They originally had darker skin. The genes for lighter skin became prevalent relatively recently in evolutionary history, in both the near east and the reaches of Northern Europe. It is to thought that light skin began evolving after 40,000 years ago to synthesize more vitamin D given less sun. What is interesting is that current Scandinavians are the most related to the early Europeans, and so it could have been that the earliest Europeans had darker skin, while Scandanavians and Siberians having light skin and colored eyes. So it seems modern European traits are the product of two general groups: the hunter-gatherers migrated from Africa 40,000 years ago who had darker skin and perhaps colored eyes who remained on the continent, Nordic and Siberians who had light skin and colored eyes. ""All modern Europeans must today trace their ancestry back to much more recent arrivals- to the Cro-Magnons, with their lighter skeleton, their much improved flint technology and their wonderful art. This was an absolute replacement of one human species by another...It is clear from the fossil record that the Neanderthals hung on for at least fifteen thousand years after the first Cro-Magnons reached Western Europe some forty to fifty thousand years ago. When the last Neanderthal expired-probably in southern Spain, where the most recent skeletons have been found-his or her death drew a line under another phase in the human occupation of Europe. An era that lasted for a quarter of a million years ended, finally and irreversibly, in a cave in southern Spain about twenty-eight thousand years ago.""Sykes does not think that Homo sapiens in Eurasia interbred with other hominids. This is the multi-regional hypothesis which doesn't necessarily mean that humans evolved independently on several continents, but after leaving Africa evolved for different environments interbreeding both with other Homo sapiens as well as hominids, Neanderthals in Europe and H Erectus in Asia. This means that humans evolved on different continents, rather than all in Africa and then leaving to the rest of the world recently. Put simply, gene flow between geographically separated populations prevented greater speciation but also meant regional variation and interbreeding with other hominids outside Africa. ""When the last Neanderthal died, twenty eight thousand years ago, there was only one human species left to rule the planet. Ours.""Since Sykes' book, the Neanderthal Genome has been sequenced in 2010, and it turns out that Europeans and Asians do share at least 1-5%. This 1-5% is supposedly total shared DNA unique to Neanderthals, and given that we are 99% similar to chimpanzees genetically, this is actually a lot and could upend the entire out of Africa hypothesis Whatever interbreeding probably began soon after leaving Africa in the Middle East. These genes do matter; they affect circadian rhythm, mood, and the immune system, adapted for the ice age environment. So the multi-regional hypothesis has something to it. Now, the seven clans which altogether 95% of current European DNA can be traced back to. * Ursula: corresponds to Haplogroup U which comprised the DNA of 11% of Europeans direct descendants. 45,000 years ago. * Xenia corresponds to Haplogroup X 25,000 years ago. 6% of current European population, 1% of native Americans * Helena corresponds to Haplogroup H 20,000 years ago. Most successful clan, all over Europe, 47% of European DNA. * Velda corresponds to Haplogroup V. 17,000 years ago. 5% of Europeans * Tara corresponds to Haplogroup T. 17,000 years ago. 9% * Katrine corresponds to Haplogroup K. 15,000 years ago, 6%* Jasmine. corresponds to Haplogroup J 17% 10,000 years ago. Haplogroup U which is the earliest haplogroup for Europeans is shared by 15% of caste Indian DNA and 8% of tribal Indians. U is supposed to have been the dominant mtDNA until the spread of agriculture and the presence of Indo-Europeans. The two dominant language groups in India are Aryan and Dravidian which are respectively associated with the north and the south. So India's population two is likely the source of two general migrations; one earlier from Africa or possibly Asia into southern India and a later migration(s) of caucasians. It turns out that native Americans have more European DNA than was thought, both haplogroup x and haplogroup u which amounts to at least a third of DNA shared with Europeans. Amerindians it turns out are both caucasoid and mongoloid, which explains the European head shape of Kennewick man. There is also the hypothesis that European Cro-Magnons, called the Solutrean culture, migrated to North America first before the American Indians from Europe during the ice age. The evidence is two things: the similarity of stone tools in Solutrean Europe and the North American Clovis culture and haplogroup x. Haplogroup x it turns out is highest in Anatolia near the Caucuses and in north North America. This is a heterodox position, but does connect with one of the seven daughters of Eve. Tara, Haplogroup T, is shared by many prominent European nobles, including Nicholas II the last Tsar of Russia. Tara may be the ancestor of the proto-Indo-Europeans as it is very common around the Black Sea where the Indo-Euorpeans are supposed to have originated, as well as in the Caucuses. T is also linked to haplogroup J, Jasmine whose genes spread with agriculture. The most interesting daughter of the book for me is of course Jasmine who I have mentioned several times already. This is the ancestor associated with the spread agriculture throughout Europe. With this came lactose tolerance which is prevalent among Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Central Asia but not with East Asians or Africans. Its interesting that northern India, where the ""Aryan invasion"" or diffusion from which the Aryan (meaning noble in Sanskrit) language and religion is supposed to have spread from 4,000 years ago, is far more lactose tolerant than southern India. This Jasmine may be the ancestor for whom the Indo-European languages shared by almost all Europeans with ancient Sanskrit was spread by, the Aryans. ""The Indo-element in Indo-European is there because there is a strong connection, again visible only to linguists, between the European languages and Sanskrit. This link was discovered by William Jones in 1786 while he was working as a judge for the British Raj. It was an amazing piece of amateur scholarship; indeed, Jones invented the concept of language families that is still a feature of comparative linguistics today. The essential idea of a language family is that all the different languages within it have evolved from a common root, almost certainly a language that is now extinct. This raises the question of where the original Indo-European language was spoken and importantly, how it spread out from there. Renfrew deduced that the original Indo-European language was spoken in Anatolia in central Turkey, and was then spread to Europe by the first farmers. A massive replacement of the hunter-gatherers by the the agricultural ""wave of advance"""" So 80% of modern European DNA can be traced back to the ice age, and the remaining 10-20% can be traced to the Near East/Central Asia, other Caucasoids. This group seems to be the unifier of European and maybe Caucasian people, providing agriculture and possibly languages and at least one source of light skin. (Back to MacDonald's thesis of lower ethnocentrism for Europeans relative to those of the Middle East: it is this 80% of DNA from the last ice age going back 40,000 years which is responsible for the difference. The later 20% is a later addition which coincides with agriculture. Groups in the Middle East had pastoralism as a way of life and developed it in competition with other groups. Europeans would have spent most of their evolutionary history on the continent as hunter gatherers, rather than as pastoralists. Being a pastoralist meant having to protect herds from other groups, which would explain higher ethnocentrism. Such resources would be kept within the family, consanguinity, endogamy, the extended family, and also enable polygamy which would altogether make individuals in the group more related. European people would have a lifestyle more dependent on the environment, with a basic division of labor between men and women who would both cooperate as their respective roles hunting and gathering. The changing climate and migration of game would be the challenges to overcome. Monogamy, exogamy, and more of a simple nuclear household would be the norm which mean less genetic relatedness and less ethnocentrism. The Indo-Europeans are the ones who brought pastoralism to Europeans evolved evolved for the environment of the central Asian steppe. Their own kinship and property systems would be transplanted over the hunter gatherers and their evolutionary heritage.)"
59,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15649779-orville-jenkins,5,"Bryan Sykes is one of the world's leading genetic anthropologists, working with DNA identification and comparison to understand the biological history of the human race. He has been part of a growing worldwide coordinated effort in DNA gathering and comparison, and worked with various other specialists to reconstruct the migration and cultural portraits of humans.Since 2000, our understanding has accelerated and skyrocketed into a burgeoning, exciting body of knowledge about human prehistory and the genetic character of modern populations. Sykes is a skilled storyteller and analyst, resulting in a well-crafted true tale of who we are and how we got to where we are in the world today, and how the innermost being of our every individual cell carries the story in our genes!The ongoing DNA comparisons all over the world began to fill out a picture of the kinship of all modern humans and their migrations all over the world. In 2001, Brian Sykes reported on his DNA studies in Europe and the Polynesian Islands and related, with careful comparisons to the studies by others on Hawaii and the Americas.In reporting his comprehensive and extensive DNA reconstruction for the people of Europe, Sykes detailed his DNA findings and presented a delightful historical and cultural history of Europe comparing the DNA reconstruction for Europe with related findings from Archaeology, paleoanthropology, and especially the lifestyle of each era. Important for this was the movement of agriculture across the world and its arrival in Europe.As his comparisons for Europe progressed, collecting or comparing samples from all over the UK locales, Sykes actually found a modern Irish woman who had the exact same mtDNA sequence as Ötzi, the 5000-year-old Alps Ice Man. The Ice man, found in 1991, was a mummified man found in a melting Alps glacier. This ancient European had been preserved by a glacial freeze and was determined to be 5200 or 5300 years old, determined by DNA study of grains in his leather bag carrying his tools and other paraphernalia.Similar information from pollen found in or on Ötzi providing additional insights into Ötzi's historical period. The viable DNA recovered from the Ice Man, with related findings from various disciplines of study and investigation reconstructed Ötzi's diet and likely family history. These insights into Ötzi's life and times shed additional light on Sykes' study of the origins and migrations of the streams of indigenous settlement and the much later movement of agriculture into Europe.The exciting upshot of this particular part of Sykes' study and reconstruction was the discovery of a modern current Irish woman with the same exact mitochondrial DNA sequence as the Ice Man!After analyzing the DNA patterns of thousands of subjects all across Europe, Sykes realized they all fell into a pattern of 7 groups, thus deriving from only 7 ancestral women for about 95% of the population of current Europe. These he dubs the Seven Daughters of Eve. After recounting the saga of the investigations, the puzzles, the disappointments and the breakthroughs that finally led to the final schema explaining the genetic relationship of thousand so Europeans, Sykes rounds out the story by providing a fictionalized account of the life of these seven women and their families.Sykes constructs his portraits by weaving in the knowledge from multiple disciplines like archaeology, geology, animal and plant DNA comparisons, and the toolsets associated with various eras of prehistory and history, including the advent of agriculture and its move into Europe. He outlines the movement of the human race across the world millennia by millennia to people all the continents.You will find this a fascinating novelesque saga that is our story, the human story, with particular attention to how all these factors came together in the population of the continent of Europe."

63,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51196399-gary,5,"I found this book compelling, fascinating, an enjoyable read and an education in itself. What is wonderful about this book is that Bryan Sykes explains and teaches us about DNA and his own research and conclusions into mitochondria and the origins of humankind and it's ancestry through DNA research in way those of us without science degrees can understand.  It is a narrative of our common heritage and our shared forebears. The author explains to us in a way that is easy to understand what is DNA and what it is does. How we can trace common ancestry to people in other parts of the world, and his theory that all indigenous Europeans are descended from seven common female ancestors who he refers to as 'the seven daughters of Eve'  His research gives us much genuine food for though, he remarks how in centuries past , how many women who were made to suffer for not producing male heirs would have loved to know that the truth is only the male sperm cells that determine whether the child conceived will be a male or female. It is the Y chromosome that makes a child a male, without which the child will be a female.  He draws us to the interesting fact that one in every 20 000 female children have a Y chromosome, and these girls look normal and have normal intelligence, though the tend to be a little taller than average. but when they reach puberty their uterus and ovaries do not develop properly and they do not produce children.  Sykes uses mitochondrial DNA evidence from the remains of the Romanov Russian imperial family to cast serious doubt on the theory that when Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, one or two of his daughters survived. According to Sykes DNA proves all of the Tsar's children were murdered.  He also proves that almost of Native Europeans are descended from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers who were in Europe 50 000 years ago and not as some theorists have told us from Neolithic farmers who migrated to Europe some 10 000 years ago, and diluted the European gene pool-they did not.  The last part of the books gives seven semi-fictional stories of the seven matriarchal ancestress of modern indigenous Europeans. These were real people with almost identical DNA to their modern descendants but living in very different circumstances to them. Ursula , Xenia , Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine and Jasmine. I would also recommend the work by Rabbi Yaakov Kleinman 'Tradition and DNA' which traces the ancestry of modern day Jews to ancient Israel."
64,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2560917-kara,3,"The first three quarters of this book were packed full of genetics, human biology, anthropology, and even a little archeology and geography. If you ask me (and I guess you are), that is way too much scientific -ology. Unless you really like that stuff. I've heard there are people that do.Anyway, I liked the book because I appreciated the authors humor and I found the whole idea of tracing our genealogy back so far extremely interesting. I especially liked his analogy of all of his ancestors holding onto a thread.I did have a couple problems - first, was the time line. I have been informed that there is no way that even Adam and Eve lived as long ago as Bryan Sykes is saying these people were living, so that throws a big wrench in this for me. I am very uncomfortable with science and the the bible not meshing. I can't help but think we must be missing something and that if we would just do it right science would support the bible. But people, he has DNA! However, despite the DNA for the record and for all heaven to hear - I will take the side of the Bible. Big can of worms though. Very big. I will just pretend in my own little dillusional world that all of his science is correct but the timing is wrong and my Grandma is a direct maternal descendent of Tara, darn it! (Ooops! Can we say the d word on this site?)My second problem was with the last quarter of the book where Bryan introduced us to his own dillusional world. It was very odd and a bit disconcerting to go from all of that scientfic jargon to fiction. It didn't even really seem like fiction. It was kind of weird. I think that the idea behind it was interesting and would have been useful if he had described what we know to be true about those times through all the stupid -ologies in a different way and left what he imagined out. Although, I did get a kick out of him describing Tara as a woman with straight brown hair and blue eyes that loved the ocean. I could be Tara reincarnated! Just kidding. That would be another can of worms."
65,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies,3,"This book by the great pioneer of genetic archaeology and Oxford professor is at times rather dreadful. Many readers have been appalled by the fictional biographies of the individual women at the origin of the seven ""maternal"" clans to which 95% of Europe's population belonged at the end of the 20th century. I can hardly disagree. Syke's story of his research and his elucidation of the basics of mitochondrial DNA basis make for fascinating reading. Syke's yarn-spinning is as tedious as it is uninformative. Syke's greatest sin in my view is his public gloating over his academic rivals that he bested in his long and distinguished career. Nonetheless his venom and spite may be the most entertaining part of this book.Syke's big point is that he believes he demonstrated that 75% of the current European gene pool dates from the paleolithic era (1.8 million years ago to 10,000) AD. This would suggest that the diffusion of technology, the introduction of new agriculture methods and the changes in the linguistic profile of the Europe over the last 12,000 years were not the result of population movements. Rather the various peoples of Europe either invented new techniques on their own or simply adopted them as they became aware of them. This is a very major point as it had long assumed that the innovations had arrived with migrations of peoples.Sykes simply allows his major thesis to get submerged in a great deal of anecdotes and somewhat pointless fictionalizing. Nonetheless this book still merits being read as it provides considerable insight into genetic archaeology which is now yielding very interesting results from the four corners of the world. However, the reader should first read Sykes ""Blood of the Isles"" which is vastly superior in every way."
66,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1738417-ronda,3,"Interesting and thought-provoking read, but there were a few things that I found distracting. Early on, Sykes mentions some tension between himself and one of his co-workers. Later, he addresses events around this same person, who is involved in research and a paper that has devastating potential toward the research on mitochondrial DNA. Sykes' description of the events and final outcome come off as a ""nyah nyah"" thumbing of his nose at this person and ended up making me feel less sympathetic to him and his efforts--regardless of the truth or non-truth of his interpretation of the events. His handling of this could easily have been handled differently, to the benefit of the story he is presenting. The other distraction was the rather abrupt launch into the stories of the seven daughters' lives. I enjoyed his interpretations of their lives, but would have appreciated more of a lead-in of some sort to explain how he came up with these stories. Now, complaints aside, I found this book to be thought-provoking on many levels. It reinforced for me the idea that each new 'discovery' opens so many more paths to be explored and that those lead to yet others perhaps not yet dreamt of. It also helped me put some science behind my own personal musings about similarities in appearance between people who are, ostensibly, not related--either genealogically or biologically--combinations of nose shapes, hair colors/textures, body builds. The book was easy to read (which I mention b/c I had feared that it would not be lay-person friendly) and, ultimately, I was glad that I finally took the plunge and read it. "
67,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45388112-andrew,4,"This was a really fascinating read. I knew only a very little bit about genetics and ancient human history going in, but Sykes writes in a way that feels entry-level understandable AND useful. In other words, I didn't feel like I was being talked down to but I did feel like I understood all of the important mechanisms described in the book. This is much easier said than done, I'm sure.The book is about the way a particular kind of DNA is used to trace the maternal lineage of people over the course of many thousands of years. Incredibly, this enables us to approximate seven women in ancient history whose descendants make up every single modern human of European descent. In so doing, we can understand with some measure of accuracy where each of our ancestors lived, what groups they may have belonged to, the path humanity took as it traveled out of Africa and populated the world, etc. Besides being an actual ground-breaking scientist, Sykes has a real talent for storytelling. For much of the book it's the sort of story he might tell over drinks to his friends, about a funny thing that happened between himself and a professional rival, about an exciting new discovery a peer made, about the modern implications of his work. He draws connections that are genuinely thrilling: what it means to have a scientific ancestry that depends entirely on women, not the manual ones drawn up by and for men. A history that cannot be erased by oppressors and those who would destroy someone's culture. He is able to put across the excitement he surely must have felt first-hand while making these connections and discoveries."
68,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"Sykes traces the history of most Europeans back to 7 women through an examination of mitochondrial DNA. I love the science behind this book. An examination of the DNA shows how very related most people are. Would love to see this done for places like India where caste differences make people treat each other badly. Wouldn't it also be cool to take it even further and relate the Europeans back to say the Africans and show how related blacks and whites might be. Sykes shows how he may be related to the last Tsar through his mitochondrial DNA. I did not give this book 5 stars because much of the book is not about the 7 women but rather about the science and Sykes' quest. The chapters about the 7 women are in some ways the least interesting as they are mainly conjecture about the kind of world they may have lived in and Sykes is not good at fiction as the women don't really come alive in these chapters. However, his scientific journey is extremely interesting and intriguing. There are times when personality clashes take up room and still seem to rankle to Sykes but I suppose that's his writing style. He is not as smooth or accomplished a pop science book as say Bryson but I'm glad he wrote this book for mass consumption because this story (about mitochondrial DNA and what it can tell us) certainly needed telling."
69,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/725357-nate,4,"Although this book was written in 2001, it is still a useful introduction to the study of human genetic ancestry for the layperson like me. Sykes is unique for having been at the forefront of major discoveries in genetics, such as sequencing the Iceman (Otzi)'s genome and finding modern descendants, helping to identify the bodies of most of the members of the massacred Russian royal family, and tracing 95% of Europeans' female ancestors to just seven women who lived between 45,000 and 10,000 years ago. Sykes' writing style is engaging, especially considering his background as a scientific researcher. I would wonder if it was ghost-written, except for his background in journalism. Most of the book is not about the ""Seven Daughters of Eve""; however, the background information is just as interesting. It takes a good portion of the book to build up to the fictionalized vignettes of these women at the end. Although the stories seem contrived, they do humanize these women and offer insight into the everyday challenges for people in prehistoric Europe, especially during the last ice ages. I wonder if one of my mitochondrial ancestors was one of these women. There's a 95% chance that this is the case. "

Are the skeletons found at Iekaterinburg the ones of the Romanov family? Is Neanderthal really extincted or, does he have any descendants? What about the Europeans? Do they have Croc-Magnon for ancestor or, farmers coming from the Middle-East? Bryan Sykes tells us the discoveries made by genetics thanks to mitochondrial DNA, a bacteria passing from generation to generation through the maternal line only.Enthusiast, he is like a kid in a sweetshop. His writing style for instance reflects very well his fascination and excitement -it is actually so accessible that, we sometimes have the feeling of reading a novel! This will be a bit puzzling to whose used to science books but, the others will thus find him easier to understand.I just think the last chapters (the reconstitutions of the seven Eves' lives) are completely useless. I understand they are a very easy way of describing nomadic life, the birth of agriculture, the first villages and so on but, are such fictions not ridiculous in a non-fiction book? Why not using an Appendix? Well, as it is targeted for a very wide audience...Still a good read."

I've now read several books on tracing human orgins through DNA, but this was the first one and it's the one that really got me to thinking about who these women really were. I really had to stretch my mind back and realize that one of the seven daughters is my ancestor! It rekindled my desire to do genealogical/family history research, especially on my mother's side back through all the women. It's difficult, because women's identities become subsumed in with their husbands. The maiden names become difficult to track. I have moved my search to Belgium and found my great grandmother's parents. Of my four lines, this is the first to go back to Europe as they were the most recent immigrants to the States. The writing is clear and interesting and Sykes gets you so interested, you find yourself with a pencil in your hand to be sure to mark the really good stuff. I made a multiribbon book mark to place the passages that really intrigued me. "
72,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2684619-reiden,4,"I heard about this book in a geography class I took a few years ago, and I thought it did a good job explaining how matrilineal lineages can be traced using mitochondrial DNA. I do agree with several of the other reviews which state that there was a little too much of the book spent on European decent and the fictional narratives of the Seven Daughters, but other than that it was a great book. As much as I wanted to get back to the science of the genetic testing described in the first half of the book, the narrative in the second half did provide a glimpse into the lives of people who we will probably never hear much about without the use of some imagination combined with the knowledge based on the limited supply of archeological and genetic evidence that we have from our distant ancestors. I can only hope that as more light is shed on this area of science, humans will begin to realize the deeper connection that we all have to one another via our common ancestors. "
73,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/200881-william-ramsay,3,"This is a very interesting book that does damage to any lingering ideas of racial superiority. By genetic testing of thousands of people, Sykes has show that everyone of European extraction can trace his or her ancestry to just seven women who lived between 10 and 45 thousand years ago. Not only that, but DNA testing and archeology have shown that we are all Africans at the core. All I could think of while reading this is that so much blood has been spilled because one man thinks he's superior to another when there is no scientific basis for it at all. I think the book slowed a bit in the middle and his description of the lives of the seven women are the root of our ancestry was a bit speculative for a scientific work. But I enjoyed reading it. The actual science of DNA is unbelievably fascinating. "
74,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12609637-s,1,"Hmm The first part of the book is OK. However, the third part really lets it down. While there is absolutely no doubt that people's mtDNA can be traced back to one of several haplotypes, there is debate of how many unique haplotypes there are. Why should a descendent become a new haplotype and another not? Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to believe that haplotype and fictional lifestyle in the past has any effect on anyone's current personality or lifestyle proclivities. I would definitely not pay to test my DNA for a just-so story as this.I worked in the same Dept as the author for a few years and found the business he set up around testing people's mtDNA and then presenting them with a preprinted certificate about their clan ancestry close to charlatanry. "
75,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"I enjoyed this look into the evidence of mitochondrial DNA. The first 2/3's concentrates on the discovery that mitochondrial DNA can be used to look at family trees into the far past and the establishment of the science behind the theory. The author has an ""everyday"" voice that is easy to follow and understand.The last third of the book gives each ""daughter"" a chapter and gives a romanticized account of their life. The topography, animals, living conditions, tools, etc. that is described in these chapters are historically correct but, of course, the actual women's lives aren't. It's a fun way to end the book.I found this to be a very interesting book. "

When did the native Australians arrive). It answered questions I didn't even know enough about the subject to have before (What is the difference between a Paleolithic modern human and a Neanderthal). I learned a lot about genetics and how they can answer those questions. Plus, he's a great storyteller. It was fascinating to read the narratives he wrote about the lives of the Seven Eves.I wasn't really hooked until Chapter 6, though I was interested enough to keep reading until there.

It's interesting, compelling, and thought provoking.But then, and I can't be the only one to think this, when he starts describing the lives of the seven daughters, it gets weird.

88,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,4,"I heard about Sykes' book in a footnote to Kevin MacDonald's Culture of Critique: ""Current data indicate that around 80% of European genes are derived from people who settled in Europe 30–40,000 years ago and therefore persisted through the Ice Ages (Sykes 2001). This is sufficient time for the adverse ecology of the north to have had a powerful shaping influence on European psychological and cultural tendencies."" MacDonald was making the argument that north-west European people have uniquely low ethnocentrism due to environmental challenges being the most important factor in evolving group strategies as opposed to competition with other groups, which MacDonald holds creates more ethnocentric cultures, such as in the Middle East. To be clear, Sykes' book is a book of popular science and isn't political, that's just what motivated me to read it. Sykes' work is a genetic history of modern Europeans traced back to seven mothers 40-10,000 years ago, from the last ice age to the arrival of agriculture. The method Sykes presents is mitochondrial DNA traced through the mother. Mitochondrial DNA exists outside of the cell nucleus and so doesn't go through the same recombination mutations like sexual gametes and so changes much slower, allowing us to measure the time between individual mutations to locate the difference from an ancestor without the mutation. For this mtDNA to be traced, a mother has to have more than one child so her genes will be shared by future generations. Because these genes are traced through one parent, the genetic lineages are called haplogroups as opposed to diplogroups. A single mutation occurs about every 10,000 years, and so these mutations are a measure for how many years separate genetic lines. The story goes that the Homo sapiens left Africa 100-70,000 years ago probably via the Arabian peninsula to spread to Eurasia and Oceania and eventually the Americas. Some earlier went along the coast of Southeast Asia all the way to Australia 50,000 years ago. Later on Homo sapiens arrived in Europe through Central Asia and split off genetically with mongoloids 30-40,000 years ago. There were other hominids in Eurasia long before Homo sapiens however; Neanderthals in Europe and Homo Erectus in Asia. The first Europeans are called Cro-Magnons who are known to us through their famous cave art. Eventually the Neanderthals died out around 30,000 years ago. The popular argument goes that Neanderthals weren't as creative as Homo sapiens despite having large brains (and bodies) who could create and pass on their knowledge. The Cro-Magnons also had large brains, larger than Europeans today which shows up the cave art they have left. Now these Cro-Magnons don't look exactly like Europeans today. They originally had darker skin. The genes for lighter skin became prevalent relatively recently in evolutionary history, in both the near east and the reaches of Northern Europe. It is to thought that light skin began evolving after 40,000 years ago to synthesize more vitamin D given less sun. What is interesting is that current Scandinavians are the most related to the early Europeans, and so it could have been that the earliest Europeans had darker skin, while Scandanavians and Siberians having light skin and colored eyes. So it seems modern European traits are the product of two general groups: the hunter-gatherers migrated from Africa 40,000 years ago who had darker skin and perhaps colored eyes who remained on the continent, Nordic and Siberians who had light skin and colored eyes. ""All modern Europeans must today trace their ancestry back to much more recent arrivals- to the Cro-Magnons, with their lighter skeleton, their much improved flint technology and their wonderful art. This was an absolute replacement of one human species by another...It is clear from the fossil record that the Neanderthals hung on for at least fifteen thousand years after the first Cro-Magnons reached Western Europe some forty to fifty thousand years ago. When the last Neanderthal expired-probably in southern Spain, where the most recent skeletons have been found-his or her death drew a line under another phase in the human occupation of Europe. An era that lasted for a quarter of a million years ended, finally and irreversibly, in a cave in southern Spain about twenty-eight thousand years ago.""Sykes does not think that Homo sapiens in Eurasia interbred with other hominids. This is the multi-regional hypothesis which doesn't necessarily mean that humans evolved independently on several continents, but after leaving Africa evolved for different environments interbreeding both with other Homo sapiens as well as hominids, Neanderthals in Europe and H Erectus in Asia. This means that humans evolved on different continents, rather than all in Africa and then leaving to the rest of the world recently. Put simply, gene flow between geographically separated populations prevented greater speciation but also meant regional variation and interbreeding with other hominids outside Africa. ""When the last Neanderthal died, twenty eight thousand years ago, there was only one human species left to rule the planet. Ours.""Since Sykes' book, the Neanderthal Genome has been sequenced in 2010, and it turns out that Europeans and Asians do share at least 1-5%. This 1-5% is supposedly total shared DNA unique to Neanderthals, and given that we are 99% similar to chimpanzees genetically, this is actually a lot and could upend the entire out of Africa hypothesis Whatever interbreeding probably began soon after leaving Africa in the Middle East. These genes do matter; they affect circadian rhythm, mood, and the immune system, adapted for the ice age environment. So the multi-regional hypothesis has something to it. Now, the seven clans which altogether 95% of current European DNA can be traced back to. * Ursula: corresponds to Haplogroup U which comprised the DNA of 11% of Europeans direct descendants. 45,000 years ago. * Xenia corresponds to Haplogroup X 25,000 years ago. 6% of current European population, 1% of native Americans * Helena corresponds to Haplogroup H 20,000 years ago. Most successful clan, all over Europe, 47% of European DNA. * Velda corresponds to Haplogroup V. 17,000 years ago. 5% of Europeans * Tara corresponds to Haplogroup T. 17,000 years ago. 9% * Katrine corresponds to Haplogroup K. 15,000 years ago, 6%* Jasmine. corresponds to Haplogroup J 17% 10,000 years ago. Haplogroup U which is the earliest haplogroup for Europeans is shared by 15% of caste Indian DNA and 8% of tribal Indians. U is supposed to have been the dominant mtDNA until the spread of agriculture and the presence of Indo-Europeans. The two dominant language groups in India are Aryan and Dravidian which are respectively associated with the north and the south. So India's population two is likely the source of two general migrations; one earlier from Africa or possibly Asia into southern India and a later migration(s) of caucasians. It turns out that native Americans have more European DNA than was thought, both haplogroup x and haplogroup u which amounts to at least a third of DNA shared with Europeans. Amerindians it turns out are both caucasoid and mongoloid, which explains the European head shape of Kennewick man. There is also the hypothesis that European Cro-Magnons, called the Solutrean culture, migrated to North America first before the American Indians from Europe during the ice age. The evidence is two things: the similarity of stone tools in Solutrean Europe and the North American Clovis culture and haplogroup x. Haplogroup x it turns out is highest in Anatolia near the Caucuses and in north North America. This is a heterodox position, but does connect with one of the seven daughters of Eve. Tara, Haplogroup T, is shared by many prominent European nobles, including Nicholas II the last Tsar of Russia. Tara may be the ancestor of the proto-Indo-Europeans as it is very common around the Black Sea where the Indo-Euorpeans are supposed to have originated, as well as in the Caucuses. T is also linked to haplogroup J, Jasmine whose genes spread with agriculture. The most interesting daughter of the book for me is of course Jasmine who I have mentioned several times already. This is the ancestor associated with the spread agriculture throughout Europe. With this came lactose tolerance which is prevalent among Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Central Asia but not with East Asians or Africans. Its interesting that northern India, where the ""Aryan invasion"" or diffusion from which the Aryan (meaning noble in Sanskrit) language and religion is supposed to have spread from 4,000 years ago, is far more lactose tolerant than southern India. This Jasmine may be the ancestor for whom the Indo-European languages shared by almost all Europeans with ancient Sanskrit was spread by, the Aryans. ""The Indo-element in Indo-European is there because there is a strong connection, again visible only to linguists, between the European languages and Sanskrit. This link was discovered by William Jones in 1786 while he was working as a judge for the British Raj. It was an amazing piece of amateur scholarship; indeed, Jones invented the concept of language families that is still a feature of comparative linguistics today. The essential idea of a language family is that all the different languages within it have evolved from a common root, almost certainly a language that is now extinct. This raises the question of where the original Indo-European language was spoken and importantly, how it spread out from there. Renfrew deduced that the original Indo-European language was spoken in Anatolia in central Turkey, and was then spread to Europe by the first farmers. A massive replacement of the hunter-gatherers by the the agricultural ""wave of advance"""" So 80% of modern European DNA can be traced back to the ice age, and the remaining 10-20% can be traced to the Near East/Central Asia, other Caucasoids. This group seems to be the unifier of European and maybe Caucasian people, providing agriculture and possibly languages and at least one source of light skin. (Back to MacDonald's thesis of lower ethnocentrism for Europeans relative to those of the Middle East: it is this 80% of DNA from the last ice age going back 40,000 years which is responsible for the difference. The later 20% is a later addition which coincides with agriculture. Groups in the Middle East had pastoralism as a way of life and developed it in competition with other groups. Europeans would have spent most of their evolutionary history on the continent as hunter gatherers, rather than as pastoralists. Being a pastoralist meant having to protect herds from other groups, which would explain higher ethnocentrism. Such resources would be kept within the family, consanguinity, endogamy, the extended family, and also enable polygamy which would altogether make individuals in the group more related. European people would have a lifestyle more dependent on the environment, with a basic division of labor between men and women who would both cooperate as their respective roles hunting and gathering. The changing climate and migration of game would be the challenges to overcome. Monogamy, exogamy, and more of a simple nuclear household would be the norm which mean less genetic relatedness and less ethnocentrism. The Indo-Europeans are the ones who brought pastoralism to Europeans evolved evolved for the environment of the central Asian steppe. Their own kinship and property systems would be transplanted over the hunter gatherers and their evolutionary heritage.)"
89,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15649779-orville-jenkins,5,"Bryan Sykes is one of the world's leading genetic anthropologists, working with DNA identification and comparison to understand the biological history of the human race. He has been part of a growing worldwide coordinated effort in DNA gathering and comparison, and worked with various other specialists to reconstruct the migration and cultural portraits of humans.Since 2000, our understanding has accelerated and skyrocketed into a burgeoning, exciting body of knowledge about human prehistory and the genetic character of modern populations. Sykes is a skilled storyteller and analyst, resulting in a well-crafted true tale of who we are and how we got to where we are in the world today, and how the innermost being of our every individual cell carries the story in our genes!The ongoing DNA comparisons all over the world began to fill out a picture of the kinship of all modern humans and their migrations all over the world. In 2001, Brian Sykes reported on his DNA studies in Europe and the Polynesian Islands and related, with careful comparisons to the studies by others on Hawaii and the Americas.In reporting his comprehensive and extensive DNA reconstruction for the people of Europe, Sykes detailed his DNA findings and presented a delightful historical and cultural history of Europe comparing the DNA reconstruction for Europe with related findings from Archaeology, paleoanthropology, and especially the lifestyle of each era. Important for this was the movement of agriculture across the world and its arrival in Europe.As his comparisons for Europe progressed, collecting or comparing samples from all over the UK locales, Sykes actually found a modern Irish woman who had the exact same mtDNA sequence as Ötzi, the 5000-year-old Alps Ice Man. The Ice man, found in 1991, was a mummified man found in a melting Alps glacier. This ancient European had been preserved by a glacial freeze and was determined to be 5200 or 5300 years old, determined by DNA study of grains in his leather bag carrying his tools and other paraphernalia.Similar information from pollen found in or on Ötzi providing additional insights into Ötzi's historical period. The viable DNA recovered from the Ice Man, with related findings from various disciplines of study and investigation reconstructed Ötzi's diet and likely family history. These insights into Ötzi's life and times shed additional light on Sykes' study of the origins and migrations of the streams of indigenous settlement and the much later movement of agriculture into Europe.The exciting upshot of this particular part of Sykes' study and reconstruction was the discovery of a modern current Irish woman with the same exact mitochondrial DNA sequence as the Ice Man!After analyzing the DNA patterns of thousands of subjects all across Europe, Sykes realized they all fell into a pattern of 7 groups, thus deriving from only 7 ancestral women for about 95% of the population of current Europe. These he dubs the Seven Daughters of Eve. After recounting the saga of the investigations, the puzzles, the disappointments and the breakthroughs that finally led to the final schema explaining the genetic relationship of thousand so Europeans, Sykes rounds out the story by providing a fictionalized account of the life of these seven women and their families.Sykes constructs his portraits by weaving in the knowledge from multiple disciplines like archaeology, geology, animal and plant DNA comparisons, and the toolsets associated with various eras of prehistory and history, including the advent of agriculture and its move into Europe. He outlines the movement of the human race across the world millennia by millennia to people all the continents.You will find this a fascinating novelesque saga that is our story, the human story, with particular attention to how all these factors came together in the population of the continent of Europe."

How we can trace common ancestry to people in other parts of the world, and his theory that all indigenous Europeans are descended from seven common female ancestors who he refers to as 'the seven daughters of Eve'  His research gives us much genuine food for though, he remarks how in centuries past , how many women who were made to suffer for not producing male heirs would have loved to know that the truth is only the male sperm cells that determine whether the child conceived will be a male or female. It is the Y chromosome that makes a child a male, without which the child will be a female.  He draws us to the interesting fact that one in every 20 000 female children have a Y chromosome, and these girls look normal and have normal intelligence, though the tend to be a little taller than average. but when they reach puberty their uterus and ovaries do not develop properly and they do not produce children.  Sykes uses mitochondrial DNA evidence from the remains of the Romanov Russian imperial family to cast serious doubt on the theory that when Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, one or two of his daughters survived. According to Sykes DNA proves all of the Tsar's children were murdered.  He also proves that almost of Native Europeans are descended from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers who were in Europe 50 000 years ago and not as some theorists have told us from Neolithic farmers who migrated to Europe some 10 000 years ago, and diluted the European gene pool-they did not.  The last part of the books gives seven semi-fictional stories of the seven matriarchal ancestress of modern indigenous Europeans. These were real people with almost identical DNA to their modern descendants but living in very different circumstances to them. Ursula , Xenia , Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine and Jasmine. I would also recommend the work by Rabbi Yaakov Kleinman 'Tradition and DNA' which traces the ancestry of modern day Jews to ancient Israel."
94,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2560917-kara,3,"The first three quarters of this book were packed full of genetics, human biology, anthropology, and even a little archeology and geography. If you ask me (and I guess you are), that is way too much scientific -ology. Unless you really like that stuff. I've heard there are people that do.Anyway, I liked the book because I appreciated the authors humor and I found the whole idea of tracing our genealogy back so far extremely interesting. I especially liked his analogy of all of his ancestors holding onto a thread.I did have a couple problems - first, was the time line. I have been informed that there is no way that even Adam and Eve lived as long ago as Bryan Sykes is saying these people were living, so that throws a big wrench in this for me. I am very uncomfortable with science and the the bible not meshing. I can't help but think we must be missing something and that if we would just do it right science would support the bible. But people, he has DNA! However, despite the DNA for the record and for all heaven to hear - I will take the side of the Bible. Big can of worms though. Very big. I will just pretend in my own little dillusional world that all of his science is correct but the timing is wrong and my Grandma is a direct maternal descendent of Tara, darn it! (Ooops! Can we say the d word on this site?)My second problem was with the last quarter of the book where Bryan introduced us to his own dillusional world. It was very odd and a bit disconcerting to go from all of that scientfic jargon to fiction. It didn't even really seem like fiction. It was kind of weird. I think that the idea behind it was interesting and would have been useful if he had described what we know to be true about those times through all the stupid -ologies in a different way and left what he imagined out. Although, I did get a kick out of him describing Tara as a woman with straight brown hair and blue eyes that loved the ocean. I could be Tara reincarnated! Just kidding. That would be another can of worms."
95,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies,3,"This book by the great pioneer of genetic archaeology and Oxford professor is at times rather dreadful. Many readers have been appalled by the fictional biographies of the individual women at the origin of the seven ""maternal"" clans to which 95% of Europe's population belonged at the end of the 20th century. I can hardly disagree. Syke's story of his research and his elucidation of the basics of mitochondrial DNA basis make for fascinating reading. Syke's yarn-spinning is as tedious as it is uninformative. Syke's greatest sin in my view is his public gloating over his academic rivals that he bested in his long and distinguished career. Nonetheless his venom and spite may be the most entertaining part of this book.Syke's big point is that he believes he demonstrated that 75% of the current European gene pool dates from the paleolithic era (1.8 million years ago to 10,000) AD. This would suggest that the diffusion of technology, the introduction of new agriculture methods and the changes in the linguistic profile of the Europe over the last 12,000 years were not the result of population movements. Rather the various peoples of Europe either invented new techniques on their own or simply adopted them as they became aware of them. This is a very major point as it had long assumed that the innovations had arrived with migrations of peoples.Sykes simply allows his major thesis to get submerged in a great deal of anecdotes and somewhat pointless fictionalizing. Nonetheless this book still merits being read as it provides considerable insight into genetic archaeology which is now yielding very interesting results from the four corners of the world. However, the reader should first read Sykes ""Blood of the Isles"" which is vastly superior in every way."
96,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1738417-ronda,3,"Interesting and thought-provoking read, but there were a few things that I found distracting. Early on, Sykes mentions some tension between himself and one of his co-workers. Later, he addresses events around this same person, who is involved in research and a paper that has devastating potential toward the research on mitochondrial DNA. Sykes' description of the events and final outcome come off as a ""nyah nyah"" thumbing of his nose at this person and ended up making me feel less sympathetic to him and his efforts--regardless of the truth or non-truth of his interpretation of the events. His handling of this could easily have been handled differently, to the benefit of the story he is presenting. The other distraction was the rather abrupt launch into the stories of the seven daughters' lives. I enjoyed his interpretations of their lives, but would have appreciated more of a lead-in of some sort to explain how he came up with these stories. Now, complaints aside, I found this book to be thought-provoking on many levels. It reinforced for me the idea that each new 'discovery' opens so many more paths to be explored and that those lead to yet others perhaps not yet dreamt of. It also helped me put some science behind my own personal musings about similarities in appearance between people who are, ostensibly, not related--either genealogically or biologically--combinations of nose shapes, hair colors/textures, body builds. The book was easy to read (which I mention b/c I had feared that it would not be lay-person friendly) and, ultimately, I was glad that I finally took the plunge and read it. "
97,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45388112-andrew,4,"This was a really fascinating read. I knew only a very little bit about genetics and ancient human history going in, but Sykes writes in a way that feels entry-level understandable AND useful. In other words, I didn't feel like I was being talked down to but I did feel like I understood all of the important mechanisms described in the book. This is much easier said than done, I'm sure.The book is about the way a particular kind of DNA is used to trace the maternal lineage of people over the course of many thousands of years. Incredibly, this enables us to approximate seven women in ancient history whose descendants make up every single modern human of European descent. In so doing, we can understand with some measure of accuracy where each of our ancestors lived, what groups they may have belonged to, the path humanity took as it traveled out of Africa and populated the world, etc. Besides being an actual ground-breaking scientist, Sykes has a real talent for storytelling. For much of the book it's the sort of story he might tell over drinks to his friends, about a funny thing that happened between himself and a professional rival, about an exciting new discovery a peer made, about the modern implications of his work. He draws connections that are genuinely thrilling: what it means to have a scientific ancestry that depends entirely on women, not the manual ones drawn up by and for men. A history that cannot be erased by oppressors and those who would destroy someone's culture. He is able to put across the excitement he surely must have felt first-hand while making these connections and discoveries."
98,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"Sykes traces the history of most Europeans back to 7 women through an examination of mitochondrial DNA. I love the science behind this book. An examination of the DNA shows how very related most people are. Would love to see this done for places like India where caste differences make people treat each other badly. Wouldn't it also be cool to take it even further and relate the Europeans back to say the Africans and show how related blacks and whites might be. Sykes shows how he may be related to the last Tsar through his mitochondrial DNA. I did not give this book 5 stars because much of the book is not about the 7 women but rather about the science and Sykes' quest. The chapters about the 7 women are in some ways the least interesting as they are mainly conjecture about the kind of world they may have lived in and Sykes is not good at fiction as the women don't really come alive in these chapters. However, his scientific journey is extremely interesting and intriguing. There are times when personality clashes take up room and still seem to rankle to Sykes but I suppose that's his writing style. He is not as smooth or accomplished a pop science book as say Bryson but I'm glad he wrote this book for mass consumption because this story (about mitochondrial DNA and what it can tell us) certainly needed telling."
99,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/725357-nate,4,"Although this book was written in 2001, it is still a useful introduction to the study of human genetic ancestry for the layperson like me. Sykes is unique for having been at the forefront of major discoveries in genetics, such as sequencing the Iceman (Otzi)'s genome and finding modern descendants, helping to identify the bodies of most of the members of the massacred Russian royal family, and tracing 95% of Europeans' female ancestors to just seven women who lived between 45,000 and 10,000 years ago. Sykes' writing style is engaging, especially considering his background as a scientific researcher. I would wonder if it was ghost-written, except for his background in journalism. Most of the book is not about the ""Seven Daughters of Eve""; however, the background information is just as interesting. It takes a good portion of the book to build up to the fictionalized vignettes of these women at the end. Although the stories seem contrived, they do humanize these women and offer insight into the everyday challenges for people in prehistoric Europe, especially during the last ice ages. I wonder if one of my mitochondrial ancestors was one of these women. There's a 95% chance that this is the case. "

Are the skeletons found at Iekaterinburg the ones of the Romanov family? Is Neanderthal really extincted or, does he have any descendants? What about the Europeans? Do they have Croc-Magnon for ancestor or, farmers coming from the Middle-East? Bryan Sykes tells us the discoveries made by genetics thanks to mitochondrial DNA, a bacteria passing from generation to generation through the maternal line only.Enthusiast, he is like a kid in a sweetshop. His writing style for instance reflects very well his fascination and excitement -it is actually so accessible that, we sometimes have the feeling of reading a novel! This will be a bit puzzling to whose used to science books but, the others will thus find him easier to understand.I just think the last chapters (the reconstitutions of the seven Eves' lives) are completely useless. I understand they are a very easy way of describing nomadic life, the birth of agriculture, the first villages and so on but, are such fictions not ridiculous in a non-fiction book? Why not using an Appendix? Well, as it is targeted for a very wide audience...Still a good read."
101,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1502451-angiea,5,"This is the book that started a love affair with DNA! I've now read several books on tracing human orgins through DNA, but this was the first one and it's the one that really got me to thinking about who these women really were. I really had to stretch my mind back and realize that one of the seven daughters is my ancestor! It rekindled my desire to do genealogical/family history research, especially on my mother's side back through all the women. It's difficult, because women's identities become subsumed in with their husbands. The maiden names become difficult to track. I have moved my search to Belgium and found my great grandmother's parents. Of my four lines, this is the first to go back to Europe as they were the most recent immigrants to the States. The writing is clear and interesting and Sykes gets you so interested, you find yourself with a pencil in your hand to be sure to mark the really good stuff. I made a multiribbon book mark to place the passages that really intrigued me. "
102,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2684619-reiden,4,"I heard about this book in a geography class I took a few years ago, and I thought it did a good job explaining how matrilineal lineages can be traced using mitochondrial DNA. I do agree with several of the other reviews which state that there was a little too much of the book spent on European decent and the fictional narratives of the Seven Daughters, but other than that it was a great book. As much as I wanted to get back to the science of the genetic testing described in the first half of the book, the narrative in the second half did provide a glimpse into the lives of people who we will probably never hear much about without the use of some imagination combined with the knowledge based on the limited supply of archeological and genetic evidence that we have from our distant ancestors. I can only hope that as more light is shed on this area of science, humans will begin to realize the deeper connection that we all have to one another via our common ancestors. "
103,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/200881-william-ramsay,3,"This is a very interesting book that does damage to any lingering ideas of racial superiority. By genetic testing of thousands of people, Sykes has show that everyone of European extraction can trace his or her ancestry to just seven women who lived between 10 and 45 thousand years ago. Not only that, but DNA testing and archeology have shown that we are all Africans at the core. All I could think of while reading this is that so much blood has been spilled because one man thinks he's superior to another when there is no scientific basis for it at all. I think the book slowed a bit in the middle and his description of the lives of the seven women are the root of our ancestry was a bit speculative for a scientific work. But I enjoyed reading it. The actual science of DNA is unbelievably fascinating. "
104,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12609637-s,1,"Hmm The first part of the book is OK. However, the third part really lets it down. While there is absolutely no doubt that people's mtDNA can be traced back to one of several haplotypes, there is debate of how many unique haplotypes there are. Why should a descendent become a new haplotype and another not? Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to believe that haplotype and fictional lifestyle in the past has any effect on anyone's current personality or lifestyle proclivities. I would definitely not pay to test my DNA for a just-so story as this.I worked in the same Dept as the author for a few years and found the business he set up around testing people's mtDNA and then presenting them with a preprinted certificate about their clan ancestry close to charlatanry.

105,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"I enjoyed this look into the evidence of mitochondrial DNA. The first 2/3's concentrates on the discovery that mitochondrial DNA can be used to look at family trees into the far past and the establishment of the science behind the theory. The author has an ""everyday"" voice that is easy to follow and understand.The last third of the book gives each ""daughter"" a chapter and gives a romanticized account of their life. The topography, animals, living conditions, tools, etc. that is described in these chapters are historically correct but, of course, the actual women's lives aren't. It's a fun way to end the book.I found this to be a very interesting book. "

When did the native Australians arrive). It answered questions I didn't even know enough about the subject to have before (What is the difference between a Paleolithic modern human and a Neanderthal). I learned a lot about genetics and how they can answer those questions. Plus, he's a great storyteller. It was fascinating to read the narratives he wrote about the lives of the Seven Eves.I wasn't really hooked until Chapter 6, though I was interested enough to keep reading until there.

It's interesting, compelling, and thought provoking.But then, and I can't be the only one to think this, when he starts describing the lives of the seven daughters, it gets weird.

118,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,4,"I heard about Sykes' book in a footnote to Kevin MacDonald's Culture of Critique: ""Current data indicate that around 80% of European genes are derived from people who settled in Europe 30–40,000 years ago and therefore persisted through the Ice Ages (Sykes 2001). This is sufficient time for the adverse ecology of the north to have had a powerful shaping influence on European psychological and cultural tendencies."" MacDonald was making the argument that north-west European people have uniquely low ethnocentrism due to environmental challenges being the most important factor in evolving group strategies as opposed to competition with other groups, which MacDonald holds creates more ethnocentric cultures, such as in the Middle East. To be clear, Sykes' book is a book of popular science and isn't political, that's just what motivated me to read it. Sykes' work is a genetic history of modern Europeans traced back to seven mothers 40-10,000 years ago, from the last ice age to the arrival of agriculture. The method Sykes presents is mitochondrial DNA traced through the mother. Mitochondrial DNA exists outside of the cell nucleus and so doesn't go through the same recombination mutations like sexual gametes and so changes much slower, allowing us to measure the time between individual mutations to locate the difference from an ancestor without the mutation. For this mtDNA to be traced, a mother has to have more than one child so her genes will be shared by future generations. Because these genes are traced through one parent, the genetic lineages are called haplogroups as opposed to diplogroups. A single mutation occurs about every 10,000 years, and so these mutations are a measure for how many years separate genetic lines. The story goes that the Homo sapiens left Africa 100-70,000 years ago probably via the Arabian peninsula to spread to Eurasia and Oceania and eventually the Americas. Some earlier went along the coast of Southeast Asia all the way to Australia 50,000 years ago. Later on Homo sapiens arrived in Europe through Central Asia and split off genetically with mongoloids 30-40,000 years ago. There were other hominids in Eurasia long before Homo sapiens however; Neanderthals in Europe and Homo Erectus in Asia. The first Europeans are called Cro-Magnons who are known to us through their famous cave art. Eventually the Neanderthals died out around 30,000 years ago. The popular argument goes that Neanderthals weren't as creative as Homo sapiens despite having large brains (and bodies) who could create and pass on their knowledge. The Cro-Magnons also had large brains, larger than Europeans today which shows up the cave art they have left. Now these Cro-Magnons don't look exactly like Europeans today. They originally had darker skin. The genes for lighter skin became prevalent relatively recently in evolutionary history, in both the near east and the reaches of Northern Europe. It is to thought that light skin began evolving after 40,000 years ago to synthesize more vitamin D given less sun. What is interesting is that current Scandinavians are the most related to the early Europeans, and so it could have been that the earliest Europeans had darker skin, while Scandanavians and Siberians having light skin and colored eyes. So it seems modern European traits are the product of two general groups: the hunter-gatherers migrated from Africa 40,000 years ago who had darker skin and perhaps colored eyes who remained on the continent, Nordic and Siberians who had light skin and colored eyes. ""All modern Europeans must today trace their ancestry back to much more recent arrivals- to the Cro-Magnons, with their lighter skeleton, their much improved flint technology and their wonderful art. This was an absolute replacement of one human species by another...It is clear from the fossil record that the Neanderthals hung on for at least fifteen thousand years after the first Cro-Magnons reached Western Europe some forty to fifty thousand years ago. When the last Neanderthal expired-probably in southern Spain, where the most recent skeletons have been found-his or her death drew a line under another phase in the human occupation of Europe. An era that lasted for a quarter of a million years ended, finally and irreversibly, in a cave in southern Spain about twenty-eight thousand years ago.""Sykes does not think that Homo sapiens in Eurasia interbred with other hominids. This is the multi-regional hypothesis which doesn't necessarily mean that humans evolved independently on several continents, but after leaving Africa evolved for different environments interbreeding both with other Homo sapiens as well as hominids, Neanderthals in Europe and H Erectus in Asia. This means that humans evolved on different continents, rather than all in Africa and then leaving to the rest of the world recently. Put simply, gene flow between geographically separated populations prevented greater speciation but also meant regional variation and interbreeding with other hominids outside Africa. ""When the last Neanderthal died, twenty eight thousand years ago, there was only one human species left to rule the planet. Ours.""Since Sykes' book, the Neanderthal Genome has been sequenced in 2010, and it turns out that Europeans and Asians do share at least 1-5%. This 1-5% is supposedly total shared DNA unique to Neanderthals, and given that we are 99% similar to chimpanzees genetically, this is actually a lot and could upend the entire out of Africa hypothesis Whatever interbreeding probably began soon after leaving Africa in the Middle East. These genes do matter; they affect circadian rhythm, mood, and the immune system, adapted for the ice age environment. So the multi-regional hypothesis has something to it. Now, the seven clans which altogether 95% of current European DNA can be traced back to. * Ursula: corresponds to Haplogroup U which comprised the DNA of 11% of Europeans direct descendants. 45,000 years ago. * Xenia corresponds to Haplogroup X 25,000 years ago. 6% of current European population, 1% of native Americans * Helena corresponds to Haplogroup H 20,000 years ago. Most successful clan, all over Europe, 47% of European DNA. * Velda corresponds to Haplogroup V. 17,000 years ago. 5% of Europeans * Tara corresponds to Haplogroup T. 17,000 years ago. 9% * Katrine corresponds to Haplogroup K. 15,000 years ago, 6%* Jasmine. corresponds to Haplogroup J 17% 10,000 years ago. Haplogroup U which is the earliest haplogroup for Europeans is shared by 15% of caste Indian DNA and 8% of tribal Indians. U is supposed to have been the dominant mtDNA until the spread of agriculture and the presence of Indo-Europeans. The two dominant language groups in India are Aryan and Dravidian which are respectively associated with the north and the south. So India's population two is likely the source of two general migrations; one earlier from Africa or possibly Asia into southern India and a later migration(s) of caucasians. It turns out that native Americans have more European DNA than was thought, both haplogroup x and haplogroup u which amounts to at least a third of DNA shared with Europeans. Amerindians it turns out are both caucasoid and mongoloid, which explains the European head shape of Kennewick man. There is also the hypothesis that European Cro-Magnons, called the Solutrean culture, migrated to North America first before the American Indians from Europe during the ice age. The evidence is two things: the similarity of stone tools in Solutrean Europe and the North American Clovis culture and haplogroup x. Haplogroup x it turns out is highest in Anatolia near the Caucuses and in north North America. This is a heterodox position, but does connect with one of the seven daughters of Eve. Tara, Haplogroup T, is shared by many prominent European nobles, including Nicholas II the last Tsar of Russia. Tara may be the ancestor of the proto-Indo-Europeans as it is very common around the Black Sea where the Indo-Euorpeans are supposed to have originated, as well as in the Caucuses. T is also linked to haplogroup J, Jasmine whose genes spread with agriculture. The most interesting daughter of the book for me is of course Jasmine who I have mentioned several times already. This is the ancestor associated with the spread agriculture throughout Europe. With this came lactose tolerance which is prevalent among Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Central Asia but not with East Asians or Africans. Its interesting that northern India, where the ""Aryan invasion"" or diffusion from which the Aryan (meaning noble in Sanskrit) language and religion is supposed to have spread from 4,000 years ago, is far more lactose tolerant than southern India. This Jasmine may be the ancestor for whom the Indo-European languages shared by almost all Europeans with ancient Sanskrit was spread by, the Aryans. ""The Indo-element in Indo-European is there because there is a strong connection, again visible only to linguists, between the European languages and Sanskrit. This link was discovered by William Jones in 1786 while he was working as a judge for the British Raj. It was an amazing piece of amateur scholarship; indeed, Jones invented the concept of language families that is still a feature of comparative linguistics today. The essential idea of a language family is that all the different languages within it have evolved from a common root, almost certainly a language that is now extinct. This raises the question of where the original Indo-European language was spoken and importantly, how it spread out from there. Renfrew deduced that the original Indo-European language was spoken in Anatolia in central Turkey, and was then spread to Europe by the first farmers. A massive replacement of the hunter-gatherers by the the agricultural ""wave of advance"""" So 80% of modern European DNA can be traced back to the ice age, and the remaining 10-20% can be traced to the Near East/Central Asia, other Caucasoids. This group seems to be the unifier of European and maybe Caucasian people, providing agriculture and possibly languages and at least one source of light skin. (Back to MacDonald's thesis of lower ethnocentrism for Europeans relative to those of the Middle East: it is this 80% of DNA from the last ice age going back 40,000 years which is responsible for the difference. The later 20% is a later addition which coincides with agriculture. Groups in the Middle East had pastoralism as a way of life and developed it in competition with other groups. Europeans would have spent most of their evolutionary history on the continent as hunter gatherers, rather than as pastoralists. Being a pastoralist meant having to protect herds from other groups, which would explain higher ethnocentrism. Such resources would be kept within the family, consanguinity, endogamy, the extended family, and also enable polygamy which would altogether make individuals in the group more related. European people would have a lifestyle more dependent on the environment, with a basic division of labor between men and women who would both cooperate as their respective roles hunting and gathering. The changing climate and migration of game would be the challenges to overcome. Monogamy, exogamy, and more of a simple nuclear household would be the norm which mean less genetic relatedness and less ethnocentrism. The Indo-Europeans are the ones who brought pastoralism to Europeans evolved evolved for the environment of the central Asian steppe. Their own kinship and property systems would be transplanted over the hunter gatherers and their evolutionary heritage.)"
119,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15649779-orville-jenkins,5,"Bryan Sykes is one of the world's leading genetic anthropologists, working with DNA identification and comparison to understand the biological history of the human race. He has been part of a growing worldwide coordinated effort in DNA gathering and comparison, and worked with various other specialists to reconstruct the migration and cultural portraits of humans.Since 2000, our understanding has accelerated and skyrocketed into a burgeoning, exciting body of knowledge about human prehistory and the genetic character of modern populations. Sykes is a skilled storyteller and analyst, resulting in a well-crafted true tale of who we are and how we got to where we are in the world today, and how the innermost being of our every individual cell carries the story in our genes!The ongoing DNA comparisons all over the world began to fill out a picture of the kinship of all modern humans and their migrations all over the world. In 2001, Brian Sykes reported on his DNA studies in Europe and the Polynesian Islands and related, with careful comparisons to the studies by others on Hawaii and the Americas.In reporting his comprehensive and extensive DNA reconstruction for the people of Europe, Sykes detailed his DNA findings and presented a delightful historical and cultural history of Europe comparing the DNA reconstruction for Europe with related findings from Archaeology, paleoanthropology, and especially the lifestyle of each era. Important for this was the movement of agriculture across the world and its arrival in Europe.As his comparisons for Europe progressed, collecting or comparing samples from all over the UK locales, Sykes actually found a modern Irish woman who had the exact same mtDNA sequence as Ötzi, the 5000-year-old Alps Ice Man. The Ice man, found in 1991, was a mummified man found in a melting Alps glacier. This ancient European had been preserved by a glacial freeze and was determined to be 5200 or 5300 years old, determined by DNA study of grains in his leather bag carrying his tools and other paraphernalia.Similar information from pollen found in or on Ötzi providing additional insights into Ötzi's historical period. The viable DNA recovered from the Ice Man, with related findings from various disciplines of study and investigation reconstructed Ötzi's diet and likely family history. These insights into Ötzi's life and times shed additional light on Sykes' study of the origins and migrations of the streams of indigenous settlement and the much later movement of agriculture into Europe.The exciting upshot of this particular part of Sykes' study and reconstruction was the discovery of a modern current Irish woman with the same exact mitochondrial DNA sequence as the Ice Man!After analyzing the DNA patterns of thousands of subjects all across Europe, Sykes realized they all fell into a pattern of 7 groups, thus deriving from only 7 ancestral women for about 95% of the population of current Europe. These he dubs the Seven Daughters of Eve. After recounting the saga of the investigations, the puzzles, the disappointments and the breakthroughs that finally led to the final schema explaining the genetic relationship of thousand so Europeans, Sykes rounds out the story by providing a fictionalized account of the life of these seven women and their families.Sykes constructs his portraits by weaving in the knowledge from multiple disciplines like archaeology, geology, animal and plant DNA comparisons, and the toolsets associated with various eras of prehistory and history, including the advent of agriculture and its move into Europe. He outlines the movement of the human race across the world millennia by millennia to people all the continents.You will find this a fascinating novelesque saga that is our story, the human story, with particular attention to how all these factors came together in the population of the continent of Europe."

121,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9373725-karin,5,"I loved reading this book. Fascinating and written with humour and not too much jargon. Bryan Sykers does a brilliant job of bringing to life the thousands of ancestors that stand behind us and build up a picture of who we are. Favourite chaper is A sense of self. ""DNA is the messanger which illuminates that connection, handed down from generation to generation, carried, literally, in the bodies of our ancestors. Each message traces a journey through time and space, a journey made by the long lines that spring from the ancestral mothers. We will never know all the details of these journeys over thousands of years and thousands of miles, but we can at least imagine them. I am on a stage. Before me, in the dim light, all the people who have ever lived are lined up, rank upon rank, stretching far into the distance. They make no sound that I can hear, but they are talking to each other. I have in my hand the end of the thread which connects me to my ancestral mother way at the back. I pull on the thread and one womans face in every generation, feeling the tug, looks up at me. Their faces stand out from the crowd and they are illuminated by a strange light. These are my ancestors.""I have done my DNA and ancestry testing with 23andme and discovered my maternal haplogrouping to be H1c, H is 20,000 years old. Reading this book has helped me to understand and think deeply of my roots.A very worthwhile read."

Those who are curious about, how science works, how human evolution could have progressed and how majority of humans can be linked to seven women, this book is a must read. The begining is a bit slow and for non-science people can be a bit boring but once that part is finished you can't keep the book down until you finish it. Brilliant book!😊"
123,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51196399-gary,5,"I found this book compelling, fascinating, an enjoyable read and an education in itself. What is wonderful about this book is that Bryan Sykes explains and teaches us about DNA and his own research and conclusions into mitochondria and the origins of humankind and it's ancestry through DNA research in way those of us without science degrees can understand.  It is a narrative of our common heritage and our shared forebears. The author explains to us in a way that is easy to understand what is DNA and what it is does. How we can trace common ancestry to people in other parts of the world, and his theory that all indigenous Europeans are descended from seven common female ancestors who he refers to as 'the seven daughters of Eve'  His research gives us much genuine food for though, he remarks how in centuries past , how many women who were made to suffer for not producing male heirs would have loved to know that the truth is only the male sperm cells that determine whether the child conceived will be a male or female. It is the Y chromosome that makes a child a male, without which the child will be a female.  He draws us to the interesting fact that one in every 20 000 female children have a Y chromosome, and these girls look normal and have normal intelligence, though the tend to be a little taller than average. but when they reach puberty their uterus and ovaries do not develop properly and they do not produce children.  Sykes uses mitochondrial DNA evidence from the remains of the Romanov Russian imperial family to cast serious doubt on the theory that when Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, one or two of his daughters survived. According to Sykes DNA proves all of the Tsar's children were murdered.  He also proves that almost of Native Europeans are descended from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers who were in Europe 50 000 years ago and not as some theorists have told us from Neolithic farmers who migrated to Europe some 10 000 years ago, and diluted the European gene pool-they did not.  The last part of the books gives seven semi-fictional stories of the seven matriarchal ancestress of modern indigenous Europeans. These were real people with almost identical DNA to their modern descendants but living in very different circumstances to them. Ursula , Xenia , Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine and Jasmine. I would also recommend the work by Rabbi Yaakov Kleinman 'Tradition and DNA' which traces the ancestry of modern day Jews to ancient Israel."
124,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2560917-kara,3,"The first three quarters of this book were packed full of genetics, human biology, anthropology, and even a little archeology and geography. If you ask me (and I guess you are), that is way too much scientific -ology. Unless you really like that stuff. I've heard there are people that do.Anyway, I liked the book because I appreciated the authors humor and I found the whole idea of tracing our genealogy back so far extremely interesting. I especially liked his analogy of all of his ancestors holding onto a thread.I did have a couple problems - first, was the time line. I have been informed that there is no way that even Adam and Eve lived as long ago as Bryan Sykes is saying these people were living, so that throws a big wrench in this for me. I am very uncomfortable with science and the the bible not meshing. I can't help but think we must be missing something and that if we would just do it right science would support the bible. But people, he has DNA! However, despite the DNA for the record and for all heaven to hear - I will take the side of the Bible. Big can of worms though. Very big. I will just pretend in my own little dillusional world that all of his science is correct but the timing is wrong and my Grandma is a direct maternal descendent of Tara, darn it! (Ooops! Can we say the d word on this site?)My second problem was with the last quarter of the book where Bryan introduced us to his own dillusional world. It was very odd and a bit disconcerting to go from all of that scientfic jargon to fiction. It didn't even really seem like fiction. It was kind of weird. I think that the idea behind it was interesting and would have been useful if he had described what we know to be true about those times through all the stupid -ologies in a different way and left what he imagined out. Although, I did get a kick out of him describing Tara as a woman with straight brown hair and blue eyes that loved the ocean. I could be Tara reincarnated! Just kidding. That would be another can of worms."
125,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies,3,"This book by the great pioneer of genetic archaeology and Oxford professor is at times rather dreadful. Many readers have been appalled by the fictional biographies of the individual women at the origin of the seven ""maternal"" clans to which 95% of Europe's population belonged at the end of the 20th century. I can hardly disagree. Syke's story of his research and his elucidation of the basics of mitochondrial DNA basis make for fascinating reading. Syke's yarn-spinning is as tedious as it is uninformative. Syke's greatest sin in my view is his public gloating over his academic rivals that he bested in his long and distinguished career. Nonetheless his venom and spite may be the most entertaining part of this book.Syke's big point is that he believes he demonstrated that 75% of the current European gene pool dates from the paleolithic era (1.8 million years ago to 10,000) AD. This would suggest that the diffusion of technology, the introduction of new agriculture methods and the changes in the linguistic profile of the Europe over the last 12,000 years were not the result of population movements. Rather the various peoples of Europe either invented new techniques on their own or simply adopted them as they became aware of them. This is a very major point as it had long assumed that the innovations had arrived with migrations of peoples.Sykes simply allows his major thesis to get submerged in a great deal of anecdotes and somewhat pointless fictionalizing. Nonetheless this book still merits being read as it provides considerable insight into genetic archaeology which is now yielding very interesting results from the four corners of the world. However, the reader should first read Sykes ""Blood of the Isles"" which is vastly superior in every way."
126,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1738417-ronda,3,"Interesting and thought-provoking read, but there were a few things that I found distracting. Early on, Sykes mentions some tension between himself and one of his co-workers. Later, he addresses events around this same person, who is involved in research and a paper that has devastating potential toward the research on mitochondrial DNA. Sykes' description of the events and final outcome come off as a ""nyah nyah"" thumbing of his nose at this person and ended up making me feel less sympathetic to him and his efforts--regardless of the truth or non-truth of his interpretation of the events. His handling of this could easily have been handled differently, to the benefit of the story he is presenting. The other distraction was the rather abrupt launch into the stories of the seven daughters' lives. I enjoyed his interpretations of their lives, but would have appreciated more of a lead-in of some sort to explain how he came up with these stories. Now, complaints aside, I found this book to be thought-provoking on many levels. It reinforced for me the idea that each new 'discovery' opens so many more paths to be explored and that those lead to yet others perhaps not yet dreamt of. It also helped me put some science behind my own personal musings about similarities in appearance between people who are, ostensibly, not related--either genealogically or biologically--combinations of nose shapes, hair colors/textures, body builds. The book was easy to read (which I mention b/c I had feared that it would not be lay-person friendly) and, ultimately, I was glad that I finally took the plunge and read it. "
127,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45388112-andrew,4,"This was a really fascinating read. I knew only a very little bit about genetics and ancient human history going in, but Sykes writes in a way that feels entry-level understandable AND useful. In other words, I didn't feel like I was being talked down to but I did feel like I understood all of the important mechanisms described in the book. This is much easier said than done, I'm sure.The book is about the way a particular kind of DNA is used to trace the maternal lineage of people over the course of many thousands of years. Incredibly, this enables us to approximate seven women in ancient history whose descendants make up every single modern human of European descent. In so doing, we can understand with some measure of accuracy where each of our ancestors lived, what groups they may have belonged to, the path humanity took as it traveled out of Africa and populated the world, etc. Besides being an actual ground-breaking scientist, Sykes has a real talent for storytelling. For much of the book it's the sort of story he might tell over drinks to his friends, about a funny thing that happened between himself and a professional rival, about an exciting new discovery a peer made, about the modern implications of his work. He draws connections that are genuinely thrilling: what it means to have a scientific ancestry that depends entirely on women, not the manual ones drawn up by and for men. A history that cannot be erased by oppressors and those who would destroy someone's culture. He is able to put across the excitement he surely must have felt first-hand while making these connections and discoveries."
128,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"Sykes traces the history of most Europeans back to 7 women through an examination of mitochondrial DNA. I love the science behind this book. An examination of the DNA shows how very related most people are. Would love to see this done for places like India where caste differences make people treat each other badly. Wouldn't it also be cool to take it even further and relate the Europeans back to say the Africans and show how related blacks and whites might be. Sykes shows how he may be related to the last Tsar through his mitochondrial DNA. I did not give this book 5 stars because much of the book is not about the 7 women but rather about the science and Sykes' quest. The chapters about the 7 women are in some ways the least interesting as they are mainly conjecture about the kind of world they may have lived in and Sykes is not good at fiction as the women don't really come alive in these chapters. However, his scientific journey is extremely interesting and intriguing. There are times when personality clashes take up room and still seem to rankle to Sykes but I suppose that's his writing style. He is not as smooth or accomplished a pop science book as say Bryson but I'm glad he wrote this book for mass consumption because this story (about mitochondrial DNA and what it can tell us) certainly needed telling."
129,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/725357-nate,4,"Although this book was written in 2001, it is still a useful introduction to the study of human genetic ancestry for the layperson like me. Sykes is unique for having been at the forefront of major discoveries in genetics, such as sequencing the Iceman (Otzi)'s genome and finding modern descendants, helping to identify the bodies of most of the members of the massacred Russian royal family, and tracing 95% of Europeans' female ancestors to just seven women who lived between 45,000 and 10,000 years ago. Sykes' writing style is engaging, especially considering his background as a scientific researcher. I would wonder if it was ghost-written, except for his background in journalism. Most of the book is not about the ""Seven Daughters of Eve""; however, the background information is just as interesting. It takes a good portion of the book to build up to the fictionalized vignettes of these women at the end. Although the stories seem contrived, they do humanize these women and offer insight into the everyday challenges for people in prehistoric Europe, especially during the last ice ages. I wonder if one of my mitochondrial ancestors was one of these women. There's a 95% chance that this is the case. "

Are the skeletons found at Iekaterinburg the ones of the Romanov family? Is Neanderthal really extincted or, does he have any descendants? What about the Europeans? Do they have Croc-Magnon for ancestor or, farmers coming from the Middle-East? Bryan Sykes tells us the discoveries made by genetics thanks to mitochondrial DNA, a bacteria passing from generation to generation through the maternal line only.Enthusiast, he is like a kid in a sweetshop. His writing style for instance reflects very well his fascination and excitement -it is actually so accessible that, we sometimes have the feeling of reading a novel! This will be a bit puzzling to whose used to science books but, the others will thus find him easier to understand.I just think the last chapters (the reconstitutions of the seven Eves' lives) are completely useless. I understand they are a very easy way of describing nomadic life, the birth of agriculture, the first villages and so on but, are such fictions not ridiculous in a non-fiction book? Why not using an Appendix? Well, as it is targeted for a very wide audience...Still a good read."
131,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1502451-angiea,5,"This is the book that started a love affair with DNA! I've now read several books on tracing human orgins through DNA, but this was the first one and it's the one that really got me to thinking about who these women really were. I really had to stretch my mind back and realize that one of the seven daughters is my ancestor! It rekindled my desire to do genealogical/family history research, especially on my mother's side back through all the women. It's difficult, because women's identities become subsumed in with their husbands. The maiden names become difficult to track. I have moved my search to Belgium and found my great grandmother's parents. Of my four lines, this is the first to go back to Europe as they were the most recent immigrants to the States. The writing is clear and interesting and Sykes gets you so interested, you find yourself with a pencil in your hand to be sure to mark the really good stuff. I made a multiribbon book mark to place the passages that really intrigued me. "
132,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2684619-reiden,4,"I heard about this book in a geography class I took a few years ago, and I thought it did a good job explaining how matrilineal lineages can be traced using mitochondrial DNA. I do agree with several of the other reviews which state that there was a little too much of the book spent on European decent and the fictional narratives of the Seven Daughters, but other than that it was a great book. As much as I wanted to get back to the science of the genetic testing described in the first half of the book, the narrative in the second half did provide a glimpse into the lives of people who we will probably never hear much about without the use of some imagination combined with the knowledge based on the limited supply of archeological and genetic evidence that we have from our distant ancestors. I can only hope that as more light is shed on this area of science, humans will begin to realize the deeper connection that we all have to one another via our common ancestors. "
133,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/200881-william-ramsay,3,"This is a very interesting book that does damage to any lingering ideas of racial superiority. By genetic testing of thousands of people, Sykes has show that everyone of European extraction can trace his or her ancestry to just seven women who lived between 10 and 45 thousand years ago. Not only that, but DNA testing and archeology have shown that we are all Africans at the core. All I could think of while reading this is that so much blood has been spilled because one man thinks he's superior to another when there is no scientific basis for it at all. I think the book slowed a bit in the middle and his description of the lives of the seven women are the root of our ancestry was a bit speculative for a scientific work. But I enjoyed reading it. The actual science of DNA is unbelievably fascinating. "
134,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12609637-s,1,"Hmm The first part of the book is OK. However, the third part really lets it down. While there is absolutely no doubt that people's mtDNA can be traced back to one of several haplotypes, there is debate of how many unique haplotypes there are. Why should a descendent become a new haplotype and another not? Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to believe that haplotype and fictional lifestyle in the past has any effect on anyone's current personality or lifestyle proclivities. I would definitely not pay to test my DNA for a just-so story as this.I worked in the same Dept as the author for a few years and found the business he set up around testing people's mtDNA and then presenting them with a preprinted certificate about their clan ancestry close to charlatanry. "
135,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"I enjoyed this look into the evidence of mitochondrial DNA. The first 2/3's concentrates on the discovery that mitochondrial DNA can be used to look at family trees into the far past and the establishment of the science behind the theory. The author has an ""everyday"" voice that is easy to follow and understand.The last third of the book gives each ""daughter"" a chapter and gives a romanticized account of their life. The topography, animals, living conditions, tools, etc. that is described in these chapters are historically correct but, of course, the actual women's lives aren't. It's a fun way to end the book.I found this to be a very interesting book. "
136,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44237-janel,5,"This book really was amazing. It answered questions I had from other books (which continent did the Polynesians come from. When did the native Australians arrive). It answered questions I didn't even know enough about the subject to have before (What is the difference between a Paleolithic modern human and a Neanderthal). I learned a lot about genetics and how they can answer those questions. Plus, he's a great storyteller. It was fascinating to read the narratives he wrote about the lives of the Seven Eves.I wasn't really hooked until Chapter 6, though I was interested enough to keep reading until there. But after that I didn't want to put it down."

I think the writing in the first parts is excellent, with care being taken to make complicated genetic science accessible to people without a science background. It's interesting, compelling, and thought provoking.But then, and I can't be the only one to think this, when he starts describing the lives of the seven daughters, it gets weird.

This is a pretty good primer of the methods and outcomes of the investigation into the genetic legacy of humanity. When combined with, say, Svante Paabo's memoir, you can get a pretty good picture of where we came from.

148,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,4,"I heard about Sykes' book in a footnote to Kevin MacDonald's Culture of Critique: ""Current data indicate that around 80% of European genes are derived from people who settled in Europe 30–40,000 years ago and therefore persisted through the Ice Ages (Sykes 2001). This is sufficient time for the adverse ecology of the north to have had a powerful shaping influence on European psychological and cultural tendencies."" MacDonald was making the argument that north-west European people have uniquely low ethnocentrism due to environmental challenges being the most important factor in evolving group strategies as opposed to competition with other groups, which MacDonald holds creates more ethnocentric cultures, such as in the Middle East. To be clear, Sykes' book is a book of popular science and isn't political, that's just what motivated me to read it. Sykes' work is a genetic history of modern Europeans traced back to seven mothers 40-10,000 years ago, from the last ice age to the arrival of agriculture. The method Sykes presents is mitochondrial DNA traced through the mother. Mitochondrial DNA exists outside of the cell nucleus and so doesn't go through the same recombination mutations like sexual gametes and so changes much slower, allowing us to measure the time between individual mutations to locate the difference from an ancestor without the mutation. For this mtDNA to be traced, a mother has to have more than one child so her genes will be shared by future generations. Because these genes are traced through one parent, the genetic lineages are called haplogroups as opposed to diplogroups. A single mutation occurs about every 10,000 years, and so these mutations are a measure for how many years separate genetic lines. The story goes that the Homo sapiens left Africa 100-70,000 years ago probably via the Arabian peninsula to spread to Eurasia and Oceania and eventually the Americas. Some earlier went along the coast of Southeast Asia all the way to Australia 50,000 years ago. Later on Homo sapiens arrived in Europe through Central Asia and split off genetically with mongoloids 30-40,000 years ago. There were other hominids in Eurasia long before Homo sapiens however; Neanderthals in Europe and Homo Erectus in Asia. The first Europeans are called Cro-Magnons who are known to us through their famous cave art. Eventually the Neanderthals died out around 30,000 years ago. The popular argument goes that Neanderthals weren't as creative as Homo sapiens despite having large brains (and bodies) who could create and pass on their knowledge. The Cro-Magnons also had large brains, larger than Europeans today which shows up the cave art they have left. Now these Cro-Magnons don't look exactly like Europeans today. They originally had darker skin. The genes for lighter skin became prevalent relatively recently in evolutionary history, in both the near east and the reaches of Northern Europe. It is to thought that light skin began evolving after 40,000 years ago to synthesize more vitamin D given less sun. What is interesting is that current Scandinavians are the most related to the early Europeans, and so it could have been that the earliest Europeans had darker skin, while Scandanavians and Siberians having light skin and colored eyes. So it seems modern European traits are the product of two general groups: the hunter-gatherers migrated from Africa 40,000 years ago who had darker skin and perhaps colored eyes who remained on the continent, Nordic and Siberians who had light skin and colored eyes. ""All modern Europeans must today trace their ancestry back to much more recent arrivals- to the Cro-Magnons, with their lighter skeleton, their much improved flint technology and their wonderful art. This was an absolute replacement of one human species by another...It is clear from the fossil record that the Neanderthals hung on for at least fifteen thousand years after the first Cro-Magnons reached Western Europe some forty to fifty thousand years ago. When the last Neanderthal expired-probably in southern Spain, where the most recent skeletons have been found-his or her death drew a line under another phase in the human occupation of Europe. An era that lasted for a quarter of a million years ended, finally and irreversibly, in a cave in southern Spain about twenty-eight thousand years ago.""Sykes does not think that Homo sapiens in Eurasia interbred with other hominids. This is the multi-regional hypothesis which doesn't necessarily mean that humans evolved independently on several continents, but after leaving Africa evolved for different environments interbreeding both with other Homo sapiens as well as hominids, Neanderthals in Europe and H Erectus in Asia. This means that humans evolved on different continents, rather than all in Africa and then leaving to the rest of the world recently. Put simply, gene flow between geographically separated populations prevented greater speciation but also meant regional variation and interbreeding with other hominids outside Africa. ""When the last Neanderthal died, twenty eight thousand years ago, there was only one human species left to rule the planet. Ours.""Since Sykes' book, the Neanderthal Genome has been sequenced in 2010, and it turns out that Europeans and Asians do share at least 1-5%. This 1-5% is supposedly total shared DNA unique to Neanderthals, and given that we are 99% similar to chimpanzees genetically, this is actually a lot and could upend the entire out of Africa hypothesis Whatever interbreeding probably began soon after leaving Africa in the Middle East. These genes do matter; they affect circadian rhythm, mood, and the immune system, adapted for the ice age environment. So the multi-regional hypothesis has something to it. Now, the seven clans which altogether 95% of current European DNA can be traced back to. * Ursula: corresponds to Haplogroup U which comprised the DNA of 11% of Europeans direct descendants. 45,000 years ago. * Xenia corresponds to Haplogroup X 25,000 years ago. 6% of current European population, 1% of native Americans * Helena corresponds to Haplogroup H 20,000 years ago. Most successful clan, all over Europe, 47% of European DNA. * Velda corresponds to Haplogroup V. 17,000 years ago. 5% of Europeans * Tara corresponds to Haplogroup T. 17,000 years ago. 9% * Katrine corresponds to Haplogroup K. 15,000 years ago, 6%* Jasmine. corresponds to Haplogroup J 17% 10,000 years ago. Haplogroup U which is the earliest haplogroup for Europeans is shared by 15% of caste Indian DNA and 8% of tribal Indians. U is supposed to have been the dominant mtDNA until the spread of agriculture and the presence of Indo-Europeans. The two dominant language groups in India are Aryan and Dravidian which are respectively associated with the north and the south. So India's population two is likely the source of two general migrations; one earlier from Africa or possibly Asia into southern India and a later migration(s) of caucasians. It turns out that native Americans have more European DNA than was thought, both haplogroup x and haplogroup u which amounts to at least a third of DNA shared with Europeans. Amerindians it turns out are both caucasoid and mongoloid, which explains the European head shape of Kennewick man. There is also the hypothesis that European Cro-Magnons, called the Solutrean culture, migrated to North America first before the American Indians from Europe during the ice age. The evidence is two things: the similarity of stone tools in Solutrean Europe and the North American Clovis culture and haplogroup x. Haplogroup x it turns out is highest in Anatolia near the Caucuses and in north North America. This is a heterodox position, but does connect with one of the seven daughters of Eve. Tara, Haplogroup T, is shared by many prominent European nobles, including Nicholas II the last Tsar of Russia. Tara may be the ancestor of the proto-Indo-Europeans as it is very common around the Black Sea where the Indo-Euorpeans are supposed to have originated, as well as in the Caucuses. T is also linked to haplogroup J, Jasmine whose genes spread with agriculture. The most interesting daughter of the book for me is of course Jasmine who I have mentioned several times already. This is the ancestor associated with the spread agriculture throughout Europe. With this came lactose tolerance which is prevalent among Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Central Asia but not with East Asians or Africans. Its interesting that northern India, where the ""Aryan invasion"" or diffusion from which the Aryan (meaning noble in Sanskrit) language and religion is supposed to have spread from 4,000 years ago, is far more lactose tolerant than southern India. This Jasmine may be the ancestor for whom the Indo-European languages shared by almost all Europeans with ancient Sanskrit was spread by, the Aryans. ""The Indo-element in Indo-European is there because there is a strong connection, again visible only to linguists, between the European languages and Sanskrit. This link was discovered by William Jones in 1786 while he was working as a judge for the British Raj. It was an amazing piece of amateur scholarship; indeed, Jones invented the concept of language families that is still a feature of comparative linguistics today. The essential idea of a language family is that all the different languages within it have evolved from a common root, almost certainly a language that is now extinct. This raises the question of where the original Indo-European language was spoken and importantly, how it spread out from there. Renfrew deduced that the original Indo-European language was spoken in Anatolia in central Turkey, and was then spread to Europe by the first farmers. A massive replacement of the hunter-gatherers by the the agricultural ""wave of advance"""" So 80% of modern European DNA can be traced back to the ice age, and the remaining 10-20% can be traced to the Near East/Central Asia, other Caucasoids. This group seems to be the unifier of European and maybe Caucasian people, providing agriculture and possibly languages and at least one source of light skin. (Back to MacDonald's thesis of lower ethnocentrism for Europeans relative to those of the Middle East: it is this 80% of DNA from the last ice age going back 40,000 years which is responsible for the difference. The later 20% is a later addition which coincides with agriculture. Groups in the Middle East had pastoralism as a way of life and developed it in competition with other groups. Europeans would have spent most of their evolutionary history on the continent as hunter gatherers, rather than as pastoralists. Being a pastoralist meant having to protect herds from other groups, which would explain higher ethnocentrism. Such resources would be kept within the family, consanguinity, endogamy, the extended family, and also enable polygamy which would altogether make individuals in the group more related. European people would have a lifestyle more dependent on the environment, with a basic division of labor between men and women who would both cooperate as their respective roles hunting and gathering. The changing climate and migration of game would be the challenges to overcome. Monogamy, exogamy, and more of a simple nuclear household would be the norm which mean less genetic relatedness and less ethnocentrism. The Indo-Europeans are the ones who brought pastoralism to Europeans evolved evolved for the environment of the central Asian steppe. Their own kinship and property systems would be transplanted over the hunter gatherers and their evolutionary heritage.)"
149,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15649779-orville-jenkins,5,"Bryan Sykes is one of the world's leading genetic anthropologists, working with DNA identification and comparison to understand the biological history of the human race. He has been part of a growing worldwide coordinated effort in DNA gathering and comparison, and worked with various other specialists to reconstruct the migration and cultural portraits of humans.Since 2000, our understanding has accelerated and skyrocketed into a burgeoning, exciting body of knowledge about human prehistory and the genetic character of modern populations. Sykes is a skilled storyteller and analyst, resulting in a well-crafted true tale of who we are and how we got to where we are in the world today, and how the innermost being of our every individual cell carries the story in our genes!The ongoing DNA comparisons all over the world began to fill out a picture of the kinship of all modern humans and their migrations all over the world. In 2001, Brian Sykes reported on his DNA studies in Europe and the Polynesian Islands and related, with careful comparisons to the studies by others on Hawaii and the Americas.In reporting his comprehensive and extensive DNA reconstruction for the people of Europe, Sykes detailed his DNA findings and presented a delightful historical and cultural history of Europe comparing the DNA reconstruction for Europe with related findings from Archaeology, paleoanthropology, and especially the lifestyle of each era. Important for this was the movement of agriculture across the world and its arrival in Europe.As his comparisons for Europe progressed, collecting or comparing samples from all over the UK locales, Sykes actually found a modern Irish woman who had the exact same mtDNA sequence as Ötzi, the 5000-year-old Alps Ice Man. The Ice man, found in 1991, was a mummified man found in a melting Alps glacier. This ancient European had been preserved by a glacial freeze and was determined to be 5200 or 5300 years old, determined by DNA study of grains in his leather bag carrying his tools and other paraphernalia.Similar information from pollen found in or on Ötzi providing additional insights into Ötzi's historical period. The viable DNA recovered from the Ice Man, with related findings from various disciplines of study and investigation reconstructed Ötzi's diet and likely family history. These insights into Ötzi's life and times shed additional light on Sykes' study of the origins and migrations of the streams of indigenous settlement and the much later movement of agriculture into Europe.The exciting upshot of this particular part of Sykes' study and reconstruction was the discovery of a modern current Irish woman with the same exact mitochondrial DNA sequence as the Ice Man!After analyzing the DNA patterns of thousands of subjects all across Europe, Sykes realized they all fell into a pattern of 7 groups, thus deriving from only 7 ancestral women for about 95% of the population of current Europe. These he dubs the Seven Daughters of Eve. After recounting the saga of the investigations, the puzzles, the disappointments and the breakthroughs that finally led to the final schema explaining the genetic relationship of thousand so Europeans, Sykes rounds out the story by providing a fictionalized account of the life of these seven women and their families.Sykes constructs his portraits by weaving in the knowledge from multiple disciplines like archaeology, geology, animal and plant DNA comparisons, and the toolsets associated with various eras of prehistory and history, including the advent of agriculture and its move into Europe. He outlines the movement of the human race across the world millennia by millennia to people all the continents.You will find this a fascinating novelesque saga that is our story, the human story, with particular attention to how all these factors came together in the population of the continent of Europe."

151,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9373725-karin,5,"I loved reading this book. Fascinating and written with humour and not too much jargon. Bryan Sykers does a brilliant job of bringing to life the thousands of ancestors that stand behind us and build up a picture of who we are. Favourite chaper is A sense of self. ""DNA is the messanger which illuminates that connection, handed down from generation to generation, carried, literally, in the bodies of our ancestors. Each message traces a journey through time and space, a journey made by the long lines that spring from the ancestral mothers. We will never know all the details of these journeys over thousands of years and thousands of miles, but we can at least imagine them. I am on a stage. Before me, in the dim light, all the people who have ever lived are lined up, rank upon rank, stretching far into the distance. They make no sound that I can hear, but they are talking to each other. I have in my hand the end of the thread which connects me to my ancestral mother way at the back. I pull on the thread and one womans face in every generation, feeling the tug, looks up at me. Their faces stand out from the crowd and they are illuminated by a strange light. These are my ancestors.""I have done my DNA and ancestry testing with 23andme and discovered my maternal haplogrouping to be H1c, H is 20,000 years old. Reading this book has helped me to understand and think deeply of my roots.A very worthwhile read."

Those who are curious about, how science works, how human evolution could have progressed and how majority of humans can be linked to seven women, this book is a must read. The begining is a bit slow and for non-science people can be a bit boring but once that part is finished you can't keep the book down until you finish it. Brilliant book!😊"
153,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51196399-gary,5,"I found this book compelling, fascinating, an enjoyable read and an education in itself. What is wonderful about this book is that Bryan Sykes explains and teaches us about DNA and his own research and conclusions into mitochondria and the origins of humankind and it's ancestry through DNA research in way those of us without science degrees can understand.  It is a narrative of our common heritage and our shared forebears. The author explains to us in a way that is easy to understand what is DNA and what it is does. How we can trace common ancestry to people in other parts of the world, and his theory that all indigenous Europeans are descended from seven common female ancestors who he refers to as 'the seven daughters of Eve'  His research gives us much genuine food for though, he remarks how in centuries past , how many women who were made to suffer for not producing male heirs would have loved to know that the truth is only the male sperm cells that determine whether the child conceived will be a male or female. It is the Y chromosome that makes a child a male, without which the child will be a female.  He draws us to the interesting fact that one in every 20 000 female children have a Y chromosome, and these girls look normal and have normal intelligence, though the tend to be a little taller than average. but when they reach puberty their uterus and ovaries do not develop properly and they do not produce children.  Sykes uses mitochondrial DNA evidence from the remains of the Romanov Russian imperial family to cast serious doubt on the theory that when Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, one or two of his daughters survived. According to Sykes DNA proves all of the Tsar's children were murdered.  He also proves that almost of Native Europeans are descended from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers who were in Europe 50 000 years ago and not as some theorists have told us from Neolithic farmers who migrated to Europe some 10 000 years ago, and diluted the European gene pool-they did not.  The last part of the books gives seven semi-fictional stories of the seven matriarchal ancestress of modern indigenous Europeans. These were real people with almost identical DNA to their modern descendants but living in very different circumstances to them. Ursula , Xenia , Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine and Jasmine. I would also recommend the work by Rabbi Yaakov Kleinman 'Tradition and DNA' which traces the ancestry of modern day Jews to ancient Israel."
154,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2560917-kara,3,"The first three quarters of this book were packed full of genetics, human biology, anthropology, and even a little archeology and geography. If you ask me (and I guess you are), that is way too much scientific -ology. Unless you really like that stuff. I've heard there are people that do.Anyway, I liked the book because I appreciated the authors humor and I found the whole idea of tracing our genealogy back so far extremely interesting. I especially liked his analogy of all of his ancestors holding onto a thread.I did have a couple problems - first, was the time line. I have been informed that there is no way that even Adam and Eve lived as long ago as Bryan Sykes is saying these people were living, so that throws a big wrench in this for me. I am very uncomfortable with science and the the bible not meshing. I can't help but think we must be missing something and that if we would just do it right science would support the bible. But people, he has DNA! However, despite the DNA for the record and for all heaven to hear - I will take the side of the Bible. Big can of worms though. Very big. I will just pretend in my own little dillusional world that all of his science is correct but the timing is wrong and my Grandma is a direct maternal descendent of Tara, darn it! (Ooops! Can we say the d word on this site?)My second problem was with the last quarter of the book where Bryan introduced us to his own dillusional world. It was very odd and a bit disconcerting to go from all of that scientfic jargon to fiction. It didn't even really seem like fiction. It was kind of weird. I think that the idea behind it was interesting and would have been useful if he had described what we know to be true about those times through all the stupid -ologies in a different way and left what he imagined out. Although, I did get a kick out of him describing Tara as a woman with straight brown hair and blue eyes that loved the ocean. I could be Tara reincarnated! Just kidding. That would be another can of worms."
155,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies,3,"This book by the great pioneer of genetic archaeology and Oxford professor is at times rather dreadful. Many readers have been appalled by the fictional biographies of the individual women at the origin of the seven ""maternal"" clans to which 95% of Europe's population belonged at the end of the 20th century. I can hardly disagree. Syke's story of his research and his elucidation of the basics of mitochondrial DNA basis make for fascinating reading. Syke's yarn-spinning is as tedious as it is uninformative. Syke's greatest sin in my view is his public gloating over his academic rivals that he bested in his long and distinguished career. Nonetheless his venom and spite may be the most entertaining part of this book.Syke's big point is that he believes he demonstrated that 75% of the current European gene pool dates from the paleolithic era (1.8 million years ago to 10,000) AD. This would suggest that the diffusion of technology, the introduction of new agriculture methods and the changes in the linguistic profile of the Europe over the last 12,000 years were not the result of population movements. Rather the various peoples of Europe either invented new techniques on their own or simply adopted them as they became aware of them. This is a very major point as it had long assumed that the innovations had arrived with migrations of peoples.Sykes simply allows his major thesis to get submerged in a great deal of anecdotes and somewhat pointless fictionalizing. Nonetheless this book still merits being read as it provides considerable insight into genetic archaeology which is now yielding very interesting results from the four corners of the world. However, the reader should first read Sykes ""Blood of the Isles"" which is vastly superior in every way."
156,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1738417-ronda,3,"Interesting and thought-provoking read, but there were a few things that I found distracting. Early on, Sykes mentions some tension between himself and one of his co-workers. Later, he addresses events around this same person, who is involved in research and a paper that has devastating potential toward the research on mitochondrial DNA. Sykes' description of the events and final outcome come off as a ""nyah nyah"" thumbing of his nose at this person and ended up making me feel less sympathetic to him and his efforts--regardless of the truth or non-truth of his interpretation of the events. His handling of this could easily have been handled differently, to the benefit of the story he is presenting. The other distraction was the rather abrupt launch into the stories of the seven daughters' lives. I enjoyed his interpretations of their lives, but would have appreciated more of a lead-in of some sort to explain how he came up with these stories. Now, complaints aside, I found this book to be thought-provoking on many levels. It reinforced for me the idea that each new 'discovery' opens so many more paths to be explored and that those lead to yet others perhaps not yet dreamt of. It also helped me put some science behind my own personal musings about similarities in appearance between people who are, ostensibly, not related--either genealogically or biologically--combinations of nose shapes, hair colors/textures, body builds. The book was easy to read (which I mention b/c I had feared that it would not be lay-person friendly) and, ultimately, I was glad that I finally took the plunge and read it. "
157,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45388112-andrew,4,"This was a really fascinating read. I knew only a very little bit about genetics and ancient human history going in, but Sykes writes in a way that feels entry-level understandable AND useful. In other words, I didn't feel like I was being talked down to but I did feel like I understood all of the important mechanisms described in the book. This is much easier said than done, I'm sure.The book is about the way a particular kind of DNA is used to trace the maternal lineage of people over the course of many thousands of years. Incredibly, this enables us to approximate seven women in ancient history whose descendants make up every single modern human of European descent. In so doing, we can understand with some measure of accuracy where each of our ancestors lived, what groups they may have belonged to, the path humanity took as it traveled out of Africa and populated the world, etc. Besides being an actual ground-breaking scientist, Sykes has a real talent for storytelling. For much of the book it's the sort of story he might tell over drinks to his friends, about a funny thing that happened between himself and a professional rival, about an exciting new discovery a peer made, about the modern implications of his work. He draws connections that are genuinely thrilling: what it means to have a scientific ancestry that depends entirely on women, not the manual ones drawn up by and for men. A history that cannot be erased by oppressors and those who would destroy someone's culture. He is able to put across the excitement he surely must have felt first-hand while making these connections and discoveries."
158,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"Sykes traces the history of most Europeans back to 7 women through an examination of mitochondrial DNA. I love the science behind this book. An examination of the DNA shows how very related most people are. Would love to see this done for places like India where caste differences make people treat each other badly. Wouldn't it also be cool to take it even further and relate the Europeans back to say the Africans and show how related blacks and whites might be. Sykes shows how he may be related to the last Tsar through his mitochondrial DNA. I did not give this book 5 stars because much of the book is not about the 7 women but rather about the science and Sykes' quest. The chapters about the 7 women are in some ways the least interesting as they are mainly conjecture about the kind of world they may have lived in and Sykes is not good at fiction as the women don't really come alive in these chapters. However, his scientific journey is extremely interesting and intriguing. There are times when personality clashes take up room and still seem to rankle to Sykes but I suppose that's his writing style. He is not as smooth or accomplished a pop science book as say Bryson but I'm glad he wrote this book for mass consumption because this story (about mitochondrial DNA and what it can tell us) certainly needed telling."
159,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/725357-nate,4,"Although this book was written in 2001, it is still a useful introduction to the study of human genetic ancestry for the layperson like me. Sykes is unique for having been at the forefront of major discoveries in genetics, such as sequencing the Iceman (Otzi)'s genome and finding modern descendants, helping to identify the bodies of most of the members of the massacred Russian royal family, and tracing 95% of Europeans' female ancestors to just seven women who lived between 45,000 and 10,000 years ago. Sykes' writing style is engaging, especially considering his background as a scientific researcher. I would wonder if it was ghost-written, except for his background in journalism. Most of the book is not about the ""Seven Daughters of Eve""; however, the background information is just as interesting. It takes a good portion of the book to build up to the fictionalized vignettes of these women at the end. Although the stories seem contrived, they do humanize these women and offer insight into the everyday challenges for people in prehistoric Europe, especially during the last ice ages. I wonder if one of my mitochondrial ancestors was one of these women. There's a 95% chance that this is the case. "

Are the skeletons found at Iekaterinburg the ones of the Romanov family? Is Neanderthal really extincted or, does he have any descendants? What about the Europeans? Do they have Croc-Magnon for ancestor or, farmers coming from the Middle-East? Bryan Sykes tells us the discoveries made by genetics thanks to mitochondrial DNA, a bacteria passing from generation to generation through the maternal line only.Enthusiast, he is like a kid in a sweetshop. His writing style for instance reflects very well his fascination and excitement -it is actually so accessible that, we sometimes have the feeling of reading a novel! This will be a bit puzzling to whose used to science books but, the others will thus find him easier to understand.I just think the last chapters (the reconstitutions of the seven Eves' lives) are completely useless. I understand they are a very easy way of describing nomadic life, the birth of agriculture, the first villages and so on but, are such fictions not ridiculous in a non-fiction book? Why not using an Appendix? Well, as it is targeted for a very wide audience...Still a good read."
161,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1502451-angiea,5,"This is the book that started a love affair with DNA! I've now read several books on tracing human orgins through DNA, but this was the first one and it's the one that really got me to thinking about who these women really were. I really had to stretch my mind back and realize that one of the seven daughters is my ancestor! It rekindled my desire to do genealogical/family history research, especially on my mother's side back through all the women. It's difficult, because women's identities become subsumed in with their husbands. The maiden names become difficult to track. I have moved my search to Belgium and found my great grandmother's parents. Of my four lines, this is the first to go back to Europe as they were the most recent immigrants to the States. The writing is clear and interesting and Sykes gets you so interested, you find yourself with a pencil in your hand to be sure to mark the really good stuff. I made a multiribbon book mark to place the passages that really intrigued me. "
162,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2684619-reiden,4,"I heard about this book in a geography class I took a few years ago, and I thought it did a good job explaining how matrilineal lineages can be traced using mitochondrial DNA. I do agree with several of the other reviews which state that there was a little too much of the book spent on European decent and the fictional narratives of the Seven Daughters, but other than that it was a great book. As much as I wanted to get back to the science of the genetic testing described in the first half of the book, the narrative in the second half did provide a glimpse into the lives of people who we will probably never hear much about without the use of some imagination combined with the knowledge based on the limited supply of archeological and genetic evidence that we have from our distant ancestors. I can only hope that as more light is shed on this area of science, humans will begin to realize the deeper connection that we all have to one another via our common ancestors. "
163,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/200881-william-ramsay,3,"This is a very interesting book that does damage to any lingering ideas of racial superiority. By genetic testing of thousands of people, Sykes has show that everyone of European extraction can trace his or her ancestry to just seven women who lived between 10 and 45 thousand years ago. Not only that, but DNA testing and archeology have shown that we are all Africans at the core. All I could think of while reading this is that so much blood has been spilled because one man thinks he's superior to another when there is no scientific basis for it at all. I think the book slowed a bit in the middle and his description of the lives of the seven women are the root of our ancestry was a bit speculative for a scientific work. But I enjoyed reading it. The actual science of DNA is unbelievably fascinating. "
164,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12609637-s,1,"Hmm The first part of the book is OK. However, the third part really lets it down. While there is absolutely no doubt that people's mtDNA can be traced back to one of several haplotypes, there is debate of how many unique haplotypes there are. Why should a descendent become a new haplotype and another not? Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to believe that haplotype and fictional lifestyle in the past has any effect on anyone's current personality or lifestyle proclivities. I would definitely not pay to test my DNA for a just-so story as this.I worked in the same Dept as the author for a few years and found the business he set up around testing people's mtDNA and then presenting them with a preprinted certificate about their clan ancestry close to charlatanry. "
165,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"I enjoyed this look into the evidence of mitochondrial DNA. The first 2/3's concentrates on the discovery that mitochondrial DNA can be used to look at family trees into the far past and the establishment of the science behind the theory. The author has an ""everyday"" voice that is easy to follow and understand.The last third of the book gives each ""daughter"" a chapter and gives a romanticized account of their life. The topography, animals, living conditions, tools, etc. that is described in these chapters are historically correct but, of course, the actual women's lives aren't. It's a fun way to end the book.I found this to be a very interesting book. "

When did the native Australians arrive). It answered questions I didn't even know enough about the subject to have before (What is the difference between a Paleolithic modern human and a Neanderthal). I learned a lot about genetics and how they can answer those questions. Plus, he's a great storyteller. It was fascinating to read the narratives he wrote about the lives of the Seven Eves.I wasn't really hooked until Chapter 6, though I was interested enough to keep reading until there. But after that I didn't want to put it down."

It's interesting, compelling, and thought provoking.But then, and I can't be the only one to think this, when he starts describing the lives of the seven daughters, it gets weird.

178,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,4,"I heard about Sykes' book in a footnote to Kevin MacDonald's Culture of Critique: ""Current data indicate that around 80% of European genes are derived from people who settled in Europe 30–40,000 years ago and therefore persisted through the Ice Ages (Sykes 2001). This is sufficient time for the adverse ecology of the north to have had a powerful shaping influence on European psychological and cultural tendencies."" MacDonald was making the argument that north-west European people have uniquely low ethnocentrism due to environmental challenges being the most important factor in evolving group strategies as opposed to competition with other groups, which MacDonald holds creates more ethnocentric cultures, such as in the Middle East. To be clear, Sykes' book is a book of popular science and isn't political, that's just what motivated me to read it. Sykes' work is a genetic history of modern Europeans traced back to seven mothers 40-10,000 years ago, from the last ice age to the arrival of agriculture. The method Sykes presents is mitochondrial DNA traced through the mother. Mitochondrial DNA exists outside of the cell nucleus and so doesn't go through the same recombination mutations like sexual gametes and so changes much slower, allowing us to measure the time between individual mutations to locate the difference from an ancestor without the mutation. For this mtDNA to be traced, a mother has to have more than one child so her genes will be shared by future generations. Because these genes are traced through one parent, the genetic lineages are called haplogroups as opposed to diplogroups. A single mutation occurs about every 10,000 years, and so these mutations are a measure for how many years separate genetic lines. The story goes that the Homo sapiens left Africa 100-70,000 years ago probably via the Arabian peninsula to spread to Eurasia and Oceania and eventually the Americas. Some earlier went along the coast of Southeast Asia all the way to Australia 50,000 years ago. Later on Homo sapiens arrived in Europe through Central Asia and split off genetically with mongoloids 30-40,000 years ago. There were other hominids in Eurasia long before Homo sapiens however; Neanderthals in Europe and Homo Erectus in Asia. The first Europeans are called Cro-Magnons who are known to us through their famous cave art. Eventually the Neanderthals died out around 30,000 years ago. The popular argument goes that Neanderthals weren't as creative as Homo sapiens despite having large brains (and bodies) who could create and pass on their knowledge. The Cro-Magnons also had large brains, larger than Europeans today which shows up the cave art they have left. Now these Cro-Magnons don't look exactly like Europeans today. They originally had darker skin. The genes for lighter skin became prevalent relatively recently in evolutionary history, in both the near east and the reaches of Northern Europe. It is to thought that light skin began evolving after 40,000 years ago to synthesize more vitamin D given less sun. What is interesting is that current Scandinavians are the most related to the early Europeans, and so it could have been that the earliest Europeans had darker skin, while Scandanavians and Siberians having light skin and colored eyes. So it seems modern European traits are the product of two general groups: the hunter-gatherers migrated from Africa 40,000 years ago who had darker skin and perhaps colored eyes who remained on the continent, Nordic and Siberians who had light skin and colored eyes. ""All modern Europeans must today trace their ancestry back to much more recent arrivals- to the Cro-Magnons, with their lighter skeleton, their much improved flint technology and their wonderful art. This was an absolute replacement of one human species by another...It is clear from the fossil record that the Neanderthals hung on for at least fifteen thousand years after the first Cro-Magnons reached Western Europe some forty to fifty thousand years ago. When the last Neanderthal expired-probably in southern Spain, where the most recent skeletons have been found-his or her death drew a line under another phase in the human occupation of Europe. An era that lasted for a quarter of a million years ended, finally and irreversibly, in a cave in southern Spain about twenty-eight thousand years ago.""Sykes does not think that Homo sapiens in Eurasia interbred with other hominids. This is the multi-regional hypothesis which doesn't necessarily mean that humans evolved independently on several continents, but after leaving Africa evolved for different environments interbreeding both with other Homo sapiens as well as hominids, Neanderthals in Europe and H Erectus in Asia. This means that humans evolved on different continents, rather than all in Africa and then leaving to the rest of the world recently. Put simply, gene flow between geographically separated populations prevented greater speciation but also meant regional variation and interbreeding with other hominids outside Africa. ""When the last Neanderthal died, twenty eight thousand years ago, there was only one human species left to rule the planet. Ours.""Since Sykes' book, the Neanderthal Genome has been sequenced in 2010, and it turns out that Europeans and Asians do share at least 1-5%. This 1-5% is supposedly total shared DNA unique to Neanderthals, and given that we are 99% similar to chimpanzees genetically, this is actually a lot and could upend the entire out of Africa hypothesis Whatever interbreeding probably began soon after leaving Africa in the Middle East. These genes do matter; they affect circadian rhythm, mood, and the immune system, adapted for the ice age environment. So the multi-regional hypothesis has something to it. Now, the seven clans which altogether 95% of current European DNA can be traced back to. * Ursula: corresponds to Haplogroup U which comprised the DNA of 11% of Europeans direct descendants. 45,000 years ago. * Xenia corresponds to Haplogroup X 25,000 years ago. 6% of current European population, 1% of native Americans * Helena corresponds to Haplogroup H 20,000 years ago. Most successful clan, all over Europe, 47% of European DNA. * Velda corresponds to Haplogroup V. 17,000 years ago. 5% of Europeans * Tara corresponds to Haplogroup T. 17,000 years ago. 9% * Katrine corresponds to Haplogroup K. 15,000 years ago, 6%* Jasmine. corresponds to Haplogroup J 17% 10,000 years ago. Haplogroup U which is the earliest haplogroup for Europeans is shared by 15% of caste Indian DNA and 8% of tribal Indians. U is supposed to have been the dominant mtDNA until the spread of agriculture and the presence of Indo-Europeans. The two dominant language groups in India are Aryan and Dravidian which are respectively associated with the north and the south. So India's population two is likely the source of two general migrations; one earlier from Africa or possibly Asia into southern India and a later migration(s) of caucasians. It turns out that native Americans have more European DNA than was thought, both haplogroup x and haplogroup u which amounts to at least a third of DNA shared with Europeans. Amerindians it turns out are both caucasoid and mongoloid, which explains the European head shape of Kennewick man. There is also the hypothesis that European Cro-Magnons, called the Solutrean culture, migrated to North America first before the American Indians from Europe during the ice age. The evidence is two things: the similarity of stone tools in Solutrean Europe and the North American Clovis culture and haplogroup x. Haplogroup x it turns out is highest in Anatolia near the Caucuses and in north North America. This is a heterodox position, but does connect with one of the seven daughters of Eve. Tara, Haplogroup T, is shared by many prominent European nobles, including Nicholas II the last Tsar of Russia. Tara may be the ancestor of the proto-Indo-Europeans as it is very common around the Black Sea where the Indo-Euorpeans are supposed to have originated, as well as in the Caucuses. T is also linked to haplogroup J, Jasmine whose genes spread with agriculture. The most interesting daughter of the book for me is of course Jasmine who I have mentioned several times already. This is the ancestor associated with the spread agriculture throughout Europe. With this came lactose tolerance which is prevalent among Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Central Asia but not with East Asians or Africans. Its interesting that northern India, where the ""Aryan invasion"" or diffusion from which the Aryan (meaning noble in Sanskrit) language and religion is supposed to have spread from 4,000 years ago, is far more lactose tolerant than southern India. This Jasmine may be the ancestor for whom the Indo-European languages shared by almost all Europeans with ancient Sanskrit was spread by, the Aryans. ""The Indo-element in Indo-European is there because there is a strong connection, again visible only to linguists, between the European languages and Sanskrit. This link was discovered by William Jones in 1786 while he was working as a judge for the British Raj. It was an amazing piece of amateur scholarship; indeed, Jones invented the concept of language families that is still a feature of comparative linguistics today. The essential idea of a language family is that all the different languages within it have evolved from a common root, almost certainly a language that is now extinct. This raises the question of where the original Indo-European language was spoken and importantly, how it spread out from there. Renfrew deduced that the original Indo-European language was spoken in Anatolia in central Turkey, and was then spread to Europe by the first farmers. A massive replacement of the hunter-gatherers by the the agricultural ""wave of advance"""" So 80% of modern European DNA can be traced back to the ice age, and the remaining 10-20% can be traced to the Near East/Central Asia, other Caucasoids. This group seems to be the unifier of European and maybe Caucasian people, providing agriculture and possibly languages and at least one source of light skin. (Back to MacDonald's thesis of lower ethnocentrism for Europeans relative to those of the Middle East: it is this 80% of DNA from the last ice age going back 40,000 years which is responsible for the difference. The later 20% is a later addition which coincides with agriculture. Groups in the Middle East had pastoralism as a way of life and developed it in competition with other groups. Europeans would have spent most of their evolutionary history on the continent as hunter gatherers, rather than as pastoralists. Being a pastoralist meant having to protect herds from other groups, which would explain higher ethnocentrism. Such resources would be kept within the family, consanguinity, endogamy, the extended family, and also enable polygamy which would altogether make individuals in the group more related. European people would have a lifestyle more dependent on the environment, with a basic division of labor between men and women who would both cooperate as their respective roles hunting and gathering. The changing climate and migration of game would be the challenges to overcome. Monogamy, exogamy, and more of a simple nuclear household would be the norm which mean less genetic relatedness and less ethnocentrism. The Indo-Europeans are the ones who brought pastoralism to Europeans evolved evolved for the environment of the central Asian steppe. Their own kinship and property systems would be transplanted over the hunter gatherers and their evolutionary heritage.)"
179,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15649779-orville-jenkins,5,"Bryan Sykes is one of the world's leading genetic anthropologists, working with DNA identification and comparison to understand the biological history of the human race. He has been part of a growing worldwide coordinated effort in DNA gathering and comparison, and worked with various other specialists to reconstruct the migration and cultural portraits of humans.Since 2000, our understanding has accelerated and skyrocketed into a burgeoning, exciting body of knowledge about human prehistory and the genetic character of modern populations. Sykes is a skilled storyteller and analyst, resulting in a well-crafted true tale of who we are and how we got to where we are in the world today, and how the innermost being of our every individual cell carries the story in our genes!The ongoing DNA comparisons all over the world began to fill out a picture of the kinship of all modern humans and their migrations all over the world. In 2001, Brian Sykes reported on his DNA studies in Europe and the Polynesian Islands and related, with careful comparisons to the studies by others on Hawaii and the Americas.In reporting his comprehensive and extensive DNA reconstruction for the people of Europe, Sykes detailed his DNA findings and presented a delightful historical and cultural history of Europe comparing the DNA reconstruction for Europe with related findings from Archaeology, paleoanthropology, and especially the lifestyle of each era. Important for this was the movement of agriculture across the world and its arrival in Europe.As his comparisons for Europe progressed, collecting or comparing samples from all over the UK locales, Sykes actually found a modern Irish woman who had the exact same mtDNA sequence as Ötzi, the 5000-year-old Alps Ice Man. The Ice man, found in 1991, was a mummified man found in a melting Alps glacier. This ancient European had been preserved by a glacial freeze and was determined to be 5200 or 5300 years old, determined by DNA study of grains in his leather bag carrying his tools and other paraphernalia.Similar information from pollen found in or on Ötzi providing additional insights into Ötzi's historical period. The viable DNA recovered from the Ice Man, with related findings from various disciplines of study and investigation reconstructed Ötzi's diet and likely family history. These insights into Ötzi's life and times shed additional light on Sykes' study of the origins and migrations of the streams of indigenous settlement and the much later movement of agriculture into Europe.The exciting upshot of this particular part of Sykes' study and reconstruction was the discovery of a modern current Irish woman with the same exact mitochondrial DNA sequence as the Ice Man!After analyzing the DNA patterns of thousands of subjects all across Europe, Sykes realized they all fell into a pattern of 7 groups, thus deriving from only 7 ancestral women for about 95% of the population of current Europe. These he dubs the Seven Daughters of Eve. After recounting the saga of the investigations, the puzzles, the disappointments and the breakthroughs that finally led to the final schema explaining the genetic relationship of thousand so Europeans, Sykes rounds out the story by providing a fictionalized account of the life of these seven women and their families.Sykes constructs his portraits by weaving in the knowledge from multiple disciplines like archaeology, geology, animal and plant DNA comparisons, and the toolsets associated with various eras of prehistory and history, including the advent of agriculture and its move into Europe. He outlines the movement of the human race across the world millennia by millennia to people all the continents.You will find this a fascinating novelesque saga that is our story, the human story, with particular attention to how all these factors came together in the population of the continent of Europe."

Before me, in the dim light, all the people who have ever lived are lined up, rank upon rank, stretching far into the distance. They make no sound that I can hear, but they are talking to each other. I have in my hand the end of the thread which connects me to my ancestral mother way at the back. I pull on the thread and one womans face in every generation, feeling the tug, looks up at me.

183,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51196399-gary,5,"I found this book compelling, fascinating, an enjoyable read and an education in itself. What is wonderful about this book is that Bryan Sykes explains and teaches us about DNA and his own research and conclusions into mitochondria and the origins of humankind and it's ancestry through DNA research in way those of us without science degrees can understand.  It is a narrative of our common heritage and our shared forebears. The author explains to us in a way that is easy to understand what is DNA and what it is does. How we can trace common ancestry to people in other parts of the world, and his theory that all indigenous Europeans are descended from seven common female ancestors who he refers to as 'the seven daughters of Eve'  His research gives us much genuine food for though, he remarks how in centuries past , how many women who were made to suffer for not producing male heirs would have loved to know that the truth is only the male sperm cells that determine whether the child conceived will be a male or female. It is the Y chromosome that makes a child a male, without which the child will be a female.  He draws us to the interesting fact that one in every 20 000 female children have a Y chromosome, and these girls look normal and have normal intelligence, though the tend to be a little taller than average. but when they reach puberty their uterus and ovaries do not develop properly and they do not produce children.  Sykes uses mitochondrial DNA evidence from the remains of the Romanov Russian imperial family to cast serious doubt on the theory that when Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, one or two of his daughters survived. According to Sykes DNA proves all of the Tsar's children were murdered.  He also proves that almost of Native Europeans are descended from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers who were in Europe 50 000 years ago and not as some theorists have told us from Neolithic farmers who migrated to Europe some 10 000 years ago, and diluted the European gene pool-they did not.  The last part of the books gives seven semi-fictional stories of the seven matriarchal ancestress of modern indigenous Europeans. These were real people with almost identical DNA to their modern descendants but living in very different circumstances to them. Ursula , Xenia , Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine and Jasmine. I would also recommend the work by Rabbi Yaakov Kleinman 'Tradition and DNA' which traces the ancestry of modern day Jews to ancient Israel."
184,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2560917-kara,3,"The first three quarters of this book were packed full of genetics, human biology, anthropology, and even a little archeology and geography. If you ask me (and I guess you are), that is way too much scientific -ology. Unless you really like that stuff. I've heard there are people that do.Anyway, I liked the book because I appreciated the authors humor and I found the whole idea of tracing our genealogy back so far extremely interesting. I especially liked his analogy of all of his ancestors holding onto a thread.I did have a couple problems - first, was the time line. I have been informed that there is no way that even Adam and Eve lived as long ago as Bryan Sykes is saying these people were living, so that throws a big wrench in this for me. I am very uncomfortable with science and the the bible not meshing. I can't help but think we must be missing something and that if we would just do it right science would support the bible. But people, he has DNA! However, despite the DNA for the record and for all heaven to hear - I will take the side of the Bible. Big can of worms though. Very big. I will just pretend in my own little dillusional world that all of his science is correct but the timing is wrong and my Grandma is a direct maternal descendent of Tara, darn it! (Ooops! Can we say the d word on this site?)My second problem was with the last quarter of the book where Bryan introduced us to his own dillusional world. It was very odd and a bit disconcerting to go from all of that scientfic jargon to fiction. It didn't even really seem like fiction. It was kind of weird. I think that the idea behind it was interesting and would have been useful if he had described what we know to be true about those times through all the stupid -ologies in a different way and left what he imagined out. Although, I did get a kick out of him describing Tara as a woman with straight brown hair and blue eyes that loved the ocean. I could be Tara reincarnated! Just kidding. That would be another can of worms."
185,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies,3,"This book by the great pioneer of genetic archaeology and Oxford professor is at times rather dreadful. Many readers have been appalled by the fictional biographies of the individual women at the origin of the seven ""maternal"" clans to which 95% of Europe's population belonged at the end of the 20th century. I can hardly disagree. Syke's story of his research and his elucidation of the basics of mitochondrial DNA basis make for fascinating reading. Syke's yarn-spinning is as tedious as it is uninformative. Syke's greatest sin in my view is his public gloating over his academic rivals that he bested in his long and distinguished career. Nonetheless his venom and spite may be the most entertaining part of this book.Syke's big point is that he believes he demonstrated that 75% of the current European gene pool dates from the paleolithic era (1.8 million years ago to 10,000) AD. This would suggest that the diffusion of technology, the introduction of new agriculture methods and the changes in the linguistic profile of the Europe over the last 12,000 years were not the result of population movements. Rather the various peoples of Europe either invented new techniques on their own or simply adopted them as they became aware of them. This is a very major point as it had long assumed that the innovations had arrived with migrations of peoples.Sykes simply allows his major thesis to get submerged in a great deal of anecdotes and somewhat pointless fictionalizing. Nonetheless this book still merits being read as it provides considerable insight into genetic archaeology which is now yielding very interesting results from the four corners of the world. However, the reader should first read Sykes ""Blood of the Isles"" which is vastly superior in every way."
186,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1738417-ronda,3,"Interesting and thought-provoking read, but there were a few things that I found distracting. Early on, Sykes mentions some tension between himself and one of his co-workers. Later, he addresses events around this same person, who is involved in research and a paper that has devastating potential toward the research on mitochondrial DNA. Sykes' description of the events and final outcome come off as a ""nyah nyah"" thumbing of his nose at this person and ended up making me feel less sympathetic to him and his efforts--regardless of the truth or non-truth of his interpretation of the events. His handling of this could easily have been handled differently, to the benefit of the story he is presenting. The other distraction was the rather abrupt launch into the stories of the seven daughters' lives. I enjoyed his interpretations of their lives, but would have appreciated more of a lead-in of some sort to explain how he came up with these stories. Now, complaints aside, I found this book to be thought-provoking on many levels. It reinforced for me the idea that each new 'discovery' opens so many more paths to be explored and that those lead to yet others perhaps not yet dreamt of. It also helped me put some science behind my own personal musings about similarities in appearance between people who are, ostensibly, not related--either genealogically or biologically--combinations of nose shapes, hair colors/textures, body builds. The book was easy to read (which I mention b/c I had feared that it would not be lay-person friendly) and, ultimately, I was glad that I finally took the plunge and read it. "
187,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45388112-andrew,4,"This was a really fascinating read. I knew only a very little bit about genetics and ancient human history going in, but Sykes writes in a way that feels entry-level understandable AND useful. In other words, I didn't feel like I was being talked down to but I did feel like I understood all of the important mechanisms described in the book. This is much easier said than done, I'm sure.The book is about the way a particular kind of DNA is used to trace the maternal lineage of people over the course of many thousands of years. Incredibly, this enables us to approximate seven women in ancient history whose descendants make up every single modern human of European descent. In so doing, we can understand with some measure of accuracy where each of our ancestors lived, what groups they may have belonged to, the path humanity took as it traveled out of Africa and populated the world, etc. Besides being an actual ground-breaking scientist, Sykes has a real talent for storytelling. For much of the book it's the sort of story he might tell over drinks to his friends, about a funny thing that happened between himself and a professional rival, about an exciting new discovery a peer made, about the modern implications of his work. He draws connections that are genuinely thrilling: what it means to have a scientific ancestry that depends entirely on women, not the manual ones drawn up by and for men. A history that cannot be erased by oppressors and those who would destroy someone's culture. He is able to put across the excitement he surely must have felt first-hand while making these connections and discoveries."
188,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"Sykes traces the history of most Europeans back to 7 women through an examination of mitochondrial DNA. I love the science behind this book. An examination of the DNA shows how very related most people are. Would love to see this done for places like India where caste differences make people treat each other badly. Wouldn't it also be cool to take it even further and relate the Europeans back to say the Africans and show how related blacks and whites might be. Sykes shows how he may be related to the last Tsar through his mitochondrial DNA. I did not give this book 5 stars because much of the book is not about the 7 women but rather about the science and Sykes' quest. The chapters about the 7 women are in some ways the least interesting as they are mainly conjecture about the kind of world they may have lived in and Sykes is not good at fiction as the women don't really come alive in these chapters. However, his scientific journey is extremely interesting and intriguing. There are times when personality clashes take up room and still seem to rankle to Sykes but I suppose that's his writing style. He is not as smooth or accomplished a pop science book as say Bryson but I'm glad he wrote this book for mass consumption because this story (about mitochondrial DNA and what it can tell us) certainly needed telling."
189,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/725357-nate,4,"Although this book was written in 2001, it is still a useful introduction to the study of human genetic ancestry for the layperson like me. Sykes is unique for having been at the forefront of major discoveries in genetics, such as sequencing the Iceman (Otzi)'s genome and finding modern descendants, helping to identify the bodies of most of the members of the massacred Russian royal family, and tracing 95% of Europeans' female ancestors to just seven women who lived between 45,000 and 10,000 years ago. Sykes' writing style is engaging, especially considering his background as a scientific researcher. I would wonder if it was ghost-written, except for his background in journalism. Most of the book is not about the ""Seven Daughters of Eve""; however, the background information is just as interesting. It takes a good portion of the book to build up to the fictionalized vignettes of these women at the end. Although the stories seem contrived, they do humanize these women and offer insight into the everyday challenges for people in prehistoric Europe, especially during the last ice ages. I wonder if one of my mitochondrial ancestors was one of these women. There's a 95% chance that this is the case. "

His writing style for instance reflects very well his fascination and excitement -it is actually so accessible that, we sometimes have the feeling of reading a novel! This will be a bit puzzling to whose used to science books but, the others will thus find him easier to understand.I just think the last chapters (the reconstitutions of the seven Eves' lives) are completely useless. I understand they are a very easy way of describing nomadic life, the birth of agriculture, the first villages and so on but, are such fictions not ridiculous in a non-fiction book? Why not using an Appendix? Well, as it is targeted for a very wide audience...Still a good read."
191,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1502451-angiea,5,"This is the book that started a love affair with DNA! I've now read several books on tracing human orgins through DNA, but this was the first one and it's the one that really got me to thinking about who these women really were. I really had to stretch my mind back and realize that one of the seven daughters is my ancestor! It rekindled my desire to do genealogical/family history research, especially on my mother's side back through all the women. It's difficult, because women's identities become subsumed in with their husbands. The maiden names become difficult to track. I have moved my search to Belgium and found my great grandmother's parents. Of my four lines, this is the first to go back to Europe as they were the most recent immigrants to the States. The writing is clear and interesting and Sykes gets you so interested, you find yourself with a pencil in your hand to be sure to mark the really good stuff. I made a multiribbon book mark to place the passages that really intrigued me. "
192,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2684619-reiden,4,"I heard about this book in a geography class I took a few years ago, and I thought it did a good job explaining how matrilineal lineages can be traced using mitochondrial DNA. I do agree with several of the other reviews which state that there was a little too much of the book spent on European decent and the fictional narratives of the Seven Daughters, but other than that it was a great book. As much as I wanted to get back to the science of the genetic testing described in the first half of the book, the narrative in the second half did provide a glimpse into the lives of people who we will probably never hear much about without the use of some imagination combined with the knowledge based on the limited supply of archeological and genetic evidence that we have from our distant ancestors. I can only hope that as more light is shed on this area of science, humans will begin to realize the deeper connection that we all have to one another via our common ancestors. "
193,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/200881-william-ramsay,3,"This is a very interesting book that does damage to any lingering ideas of racial superiority. By genetic testing of thousands of people, Sykes has show that everyone of European extraction can trace his or her ancestry to just seven women who lived between 10 and 45 thousand years ago. Not only that, but DNA testing and archeology have shown that we are all Africans at the core. All I could think of while reading this is that so much blood has been spilled because one man thinks he's superior to another when there is no scientific basis for it at all. I think the book slowed a bit in the middle and his description of the lives of the seven women are the root of our ancestry was a bit speculative for a scientific work. But I enjoyed reading it. The actual science of DNA is unbelievably fascinating. "
194,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12609637-s,1,"Hmm The first part of the book is OK. However, the third part really lets it down. While there is absolutely no doubt that people's mtDNA can be traced back to one of several haplotypes, there is debate of how many unique haplotypes there are. Why should a descendent become a new haplotype and another not? Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to believe that haplotype and fictional lifestyle in the past has any effect on anyone's current personality or lifestyle proclivities. I would definitely not pay to test my DNA for a just-so story as this.I worked in the same Dept as the author for a few years and found the business he set up around testing people's mtDNA and then presenting them with a preprinted certificate about their clan ancestry close to charlatanry. "
195,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"I enjoyed this look into the evidence of mitochondrial DNA. The first 2/3's concentrates on the discovery that mitochondrial DNA can be used to look at family trees into the far past and the establishment of the science behind the theory. The author has an ""everyday"" voice that is easy to follow and understand.The last third of the book gives each ""daughter"" a chapter and gives a romanticized account of their life. The topography, animals, living conditions, tools, etc. that is described in these chapters are historically correct but, of course, the actual women's lives aren't. It's a fun way to end the book.I found this to be a very interesting book. "

When did the native Australians arrive). It answered questions I didn't even know enough about the subject to have before (What is the difference between a Paleolithic modern human and a Neanderthal). I learned a lot about genetics and how they can answer those questions. Plus, he's a great storyteller. It was fascinating to read the narratives he wrote about the lives of the Seven Eves.I wasn't really hooked until Chapter 6, though I was interested enough to keep reading until there.

I think the writing in the first parts is excellent, with care being taken to make complicated genetic science accessible to people without a science background. It's interesting, compelling, and thought provoking.But then, and I can't be the only one to think this, when he starts describing the lives of the seven daughters, it gets weird.

208,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,4,"I heard about Sykes' book in a footnote to Kevin MacDonald's Culture of Critique: ""Current data indicate that around 80% of European genes are derived from people who settled in Europe 30–40,000 years ago and therefore persisted through the Ice Ages (Sykes 2001). This is sufficient time for the adverse ecology of the north to have had a powerful shaping influence on European psychological and cultural tendencies."" MacDonald was making the argument that north-west European people have uniquely low ethnocentrism due to environmental challenges being the most important factor in evolving group strategies as opposed to competition with other groups, which MacDonald holds creates more ethnocentric cultures, such as in the Middle East. To be clear, Sykes' book is a book of popular science and isn't political, that's just what motivated me to read it. Sykes' work is a genetic history of modern Europeans traced back to seven mothers 40-10,000 years ago, from the last ice age to the arrival of agriculture. The method Sykes presents is mitochondrial DNA traced through the mother. Mitochondrial DNA exists outside of the cell nucleus and so doesn't go through the same recombination mutations like sexual gametes and so changes much slower, allowing us to measure the time between individual mutations to locate the difference from an ancestor without the mutation. For this mtDNA to be traced, a mother has to have more than one child so her genes will be shared by future generations. Because these genes are traced through one parent, the genetic lineages are called haplogroups as opposed to diplogroups. A single mutation occurs about every 10,000 years, and so these mutations are a measure for how many years separate genetic lines. The story goes that the Homo sapiens left Africa 100-70,000 years ago probably via the Arabian peninsula to spread to Eurasia and Oceania and eventually the Americas. Some earlier went along the coast of Southeast Asia all the way to Australia 50,000 years ago. Later on Homo sapiens arrived in Europe through Central Asia and split off genetically with mongoloids 30-40,000 years ago. There were other hominids in Eurasia long before Homo sapiens however; Neanderthals in Europe and Homo Erectus in Asia. The first Europeans are called Cro-Magnons who are known to us through their famous cave art. Eventually the Neanderthals died out around 30,000 years ago. The popular argument goes that Neanderthals weren't as creative as Homo sapiens despite having large brains (and bodies) who could create and pass on their knowledge. The Cro-Magnons also had large brains, larger than Europeans today which shows up the cave art they have left. Now these Cro-Magnons don't look exactly like Europeans today. They originally had darker skin. The genes for lighter skin became prevalent relatively recently in evolutionary history, in both the near east and the reaches of Northern Europe. It is to thought that light skin began evolving after 40,000 years ago to synthesize more vitamin D given less sun. What is interesting is that current Scandinavians are the most related to the early Europeans, and so it could have been that the earliest Europeans had darker skin, while Scandanavians and Siberians having light skin and colored eyes. So it seems modern European traits are the product of two general groups: the hunter-gatherers migrated from Africa 40,000 years ago who had darker skin and perhaps colored eyes who remained on the continent, Nordic and Siberians who had light skin and colored eyes. ""All modern Europeans must today trace their ancestry back to much more recent arrivals- to the Cro-Magnons, with their lighter skeleton, their much improved flint technology and their wonderful art. This was an absolute replacement of one human species by another...It is clear from the fossil record that the Neanderthals hung on for at least fifteen thousand years after the first Cro-Magnons reached Western Europe some forty to fifty thousand years ago. When the last Neanderthal expired-probably in southern Spain, where the most recent skeletons have been found-his or her death drew a line under another phase in the human occupation of Europe. An era that lasted for a quarter of a million years ended, finally and irreversibly, in a cave in southern Spain about twenty-eight thousand years ago.""Sykes does not think that Homo sapiens in Eurasia interbred with other hominids. This is the multi-regional hypothesis which doesn't necessarily mean that humans evolved independently on several continents, but after leaving Africa evolved for different environments interbreeding both with other Homo sapiens as well as hominids, Neanderthals in Europe and H Erectus in Asia. This means that humans evolved on different continents, rather than all in Africa and then leaving to the rest of the world recently. Put simply, gene flow between geographically separated populations prevented greater speciation but also meant regional variation and interbreeding with other hominids outside Africa. ""When the last Neanderthal died, twenty eight thousand years ago, there was only one human species left to rule the planet. Ours.""Since Sykes' book, the Neanderthal Genome has been sequenced in 2010, and it turns out that Europeans and Asians do share at least 1-5%. This 1-5% is supposedly total shared DNA unique to Neanderthals, and given that we are 99% similar to chimpanzees genetically, this is actually a lot and could upend the entire out of Africa hypothesis Whatever interbreeding probably began soon after leaving Africa in the Middle East. These genes do matter; they affect circadian rhythm, mood, and the immune system, adapted for the ice age environment. So the multi-regional hypothesis has something to it. Now, the seven clans which altogether 95% of current European DNA can be traced back to. * Ursula: corresponds to Haplogroup U which comprised the DNA of 11% of Europeans direct descendants. 45,000 years ago. * Xenia corresponds to Haplogroup X 25,000 years ago. 6% of current European population, 1% of native Americans * Helena corresponds to Haplogroup H 20,000 years ago. Most successful clan, all over Europe, 47% of European DNA. * Velda corresponds to Haplogroup V. 17,000 years ago. 5% of Europeans * Tara corresponds to Haplogroup T. 17,000 years ago. 9% * Katrine corresponds to Haplogroup K. 15,000 years ago, 6%* Jasmine. corresponds to Haplogroup J 17% 10,000 years ago. Haplogroup U which is the earliest haplogroup for Europeans is shared by 15% of caste Indian DNA and 8% of tribal Indians. U is supposed to have been the dominant mtDNA until the spread of agriculture and the presence of Indo-Europeans. The two dominant language groups in India are Aryan and Dravidian which are respectively associated with the north and the south. So India's population two is likely the source of two general migrations; one earlier from Africa or possibly Asia into southern India and a later migration(s) of caucasians. It turns out that native Americans have more European DNA than was thought, both haplogroup x and haplogroup u which amounts to at least a third of DNA shared with Europeans. Amerindians it turns out are both caucasoid and mongoloid, which explains the European head shape of Kennewick man. There is also the hypothesis that European Cro-Magnons, called the Solutrean culture, migrated to North America first before the American Indians from Europe during the ice age. The evidence is two things: the similarity of stone tools in Solutrean Europe and the North American Clovis culture and haplogroup x. Haplogroup x it turns out is highest in Anatolia near the Caucuses and in north North America. This is a heterodox position, but does connect with one of the seven daughters of Eve. Tara, Haplogroup T, is shared by many prominent European nobles, including Nicholas II the last Tsar of Russia. Tara may be the ancestor of the proto-Indo-Europeans as it is very common around the Black Sea where the Indo-Euorpeans are supposed to have originated, as well as in the Caucuses. T is also linked to haplogroup J, Jasmine whose genes spread with agriculture. The most interesting daughter of the book for me is of course Jasmine who I have mentioned several times already. This is the ancestor associated with the spread agriculture throughout Europe. With this came lactose tolerance which is prevalent among Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Central Asia but not with East Asians or Africans. Its interesting that northern India, where the ""Aryan invasion"" or diffusion from which the Aryan (meaning noble in Sanskrit) language and religion is supposed to have spread from 4,000 years ago, is far more lactose tolerant than southern India. This Jasmine may be the ancestor for whom the Indo-European languages shared by almost all Europeans with ancient Sanskrit was spread by, the Aryans. ""The Indo-element in Indo-European is there because there is a strong connection, again visible only to linguists, between the European languages and Sanskrit. This link was discovered by William Jones in 1786 while he was working as a judge for the British Raj. It was an amazing piece of amateur scholarship; indeed, Jones invented the concept of language families that is still a feature of comparative linguistics today. The essential idea of a language family is that all the different languages within it have evolved from a common root, almost certainly a language that is now extinct. This raises the question of where the original Indo-European language was spoken and importantly, how it spread out from there. Renfrew deduced that the original Indo-European language was spoken in Anatolia in central Turkey, and was then spread to Europe by the first farmers. A massive replacement of the hunter-gatherers by the the agricultural ""wave of advance"""" So 80% of modern European DNA can be traced back to the ice age, and the remaining 10-20% can be traced to the Near East/Central Asia, other Caucasoids. This group seems to be the unifier of European and maybe Caucasian people, providing agriculture and possibly languages and at least one source of light skin. (Back to MacDonald's thesis of lower ethnocentrism for Europeans relative to those of the Middle East: it is this 80% of DNA from the last ice age going back 40,000 years which is responsible for the difference. The later 20% is a later addition which coincides with agriculture. Groups in the Middle East had pastoralism as a way of life and developed it in competition with other groups. Europeans would have spent most of their evolutionary history on the continent as hunter gatherers, rather than as pastoralists. Being a pastoralist meant having to protect herds from other groups, which would explain higher ethnocentrism. Such resources would be kept within the family, consanguinity, endogamy, the extended family, and also enable polygamy which would altogether make individuals in the group more related. European people would have a lifestyle more dependent on the environment, with a basic division of labor between men and women who would both cooperate as their respective roles hunting and gathering. The changing climate and migration of game would be the challenges to overcome. Monogamy, exogamy, and more of a simple nuclear household would be the norm which mean less genetic relatedness and less ethnocentrism. The Indo-Europeans are the ones who brought pastoralism to Europeans evolved evolved for the environment of the central Asian steppe. Their own kinship and property systems would be transplanted over the hunter gatherers and their evolutionary heritage.)"
209,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15649779-orville-jenkins,5,"Bryan Sykes is one of the world's leading genetic anthropologists, working with DNA identification and comparison to understand the biological history of the human race. He has been part of a growing worldwide coordinated effort in DNA gathering and comparison, and worked with various other specialists to reconstruct the migration and cultural portraits of humans.Since 2000, our understanding has accelerated and skyrocketed into a burgeoning, exciting body of knowledge about human prehistory and the genetic character of modern populations. Sykes is a skilled storyteller and analyst, resulting in a well-crafted true tale of who we are and how we got to where we are in the world today, and how the innermost being of our every individual cell carries the story in our genes!The ongoing DNA comparisons all over the world began to fill out a picture of the kinship of all modern humans and their migrations all over the world. In 2001, Brian Sykes reported on his DNA studies in Europe and the Polynesian Islands and related, with careful comparisons to the studies by others on Hawaii and the Americas.In reporting his comprehensive and extensive DNA reconstruction for the people of Europe, Sykes detailed his DNA findings and presented a delightful historical and cultural history of Europe comparing the DNA reconstruction for Europe with related findings from Archaeology, paleoanthropology, and especially the lifestyle of each era. Important for this was the movement of agriculture across the world and its arrival in Europe.As his comparisons for Europe progressed, collecting or comparing samples from all over the UK locales, Sykes actually found a modern Irish woman who had the exact same mtDNA sequence as Ötzi, the 5000-year-old Alps Ice Man. The Ice man, found in 1991, was a mummified man found in a melting Alps glacier. This ancient European had been preserved by a glacial freeze and was determined to be 5200 or 5300 years old, determined by DNA study of grains in his leather bag carrying his tools and other paraphernalia.Similar information from pollen found in or on Ötzi providing additional insights into Ötzi's historical period. The viable DNA recovered from the Ice Man, with related findings from various disciplines of study and investigation reconstructed Ötzi's diet and likely family history. These insights into Ötzi's life and times shed additional light on Sykes' study of the origins and migrations of the streams of indigenous settlement and the much later movement of agriculture into Europe.The exciting upshot of this particular part of Sykes' study and reconstruction was the discovery of a modern current Irish woman with the same exact mitochondrial DNA sequence as the Ice Man!After analyzing the DNA patterns of thousands of subjects all across Europe, Sykes realized they all fell into a pattern of 7 groups, thus deriving from only 7 ancestral women for about 95% of the population of current Europe. These he dubs the Seven Daughters of Eve. After recounting the saga of the investigations, the puzzles, the disappointments and the breakthroughs that finally led to the final schema explaining the genetic relationship of thousand so Europeans, Sykes rounds out the story by providing a fictionalized account of the life of these seven women and their families.Sykes constructs his portraits by weaving in the knowledge from multiple disciplines like archaeology, geology, animal and plant DNA comparisons, and the toolsets associated with various eras of prehistory and history, including the advent of agriculture and its move into Europe. He outlines the movement of the human race across the world millennia by millennia to people all the continents.You will find this a fascinating novelesque saga that is our story, the human story, with particular attention to how all these factors came together in the population of the continent of Europe."

Bryan Sykers does a brilliant job of bringing to life the thousands of ancestors that stand behind us and build up a picture of who we are. Favourite chaper is A sense of self. ""DNA is the messanger which illuminates that connection, handed down from generation to generation, carried, literally, in the bodies of our ancestors. Each message traces a journey through time and space, a journey made by the long lines that spring from the ancestral mothers. We will never know all the details of these journeys over thousands of years and thousands of miles, but we can at least imagine them. I am on a stage. Before me, in the dim light, all the people who have ever lived are lined up, rank upon rank, stretching far into the distance. They make no sound that I can hear, but they are talking to each other. I have in my hand the end of the thread which connects me to my ancestral mother way at the back. I pull on the thread and one womans face in every generation, feeling the tug, looks up at me.

213,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51196399-gary,5,"I found this book compelling, fascinating, an enjoyable read and an education in itself. What is wonderful about this book is that Bryan Sykes explains and teaches us about DNA and his own research and conclusions into mitochondria and the origins of humankind and it's ancestry through DNA research in way those of us without science degrees can understand.  It is a narrative of our common heritage and our shared forebears. The author explains to us in a way that is easy to understand what is DNA and what it is does. How we can trace common ancestry to people in other parts of the world, and his theory that all indigenous Europeans are descended from seven common female ancestors who he refers to as 'the seven daughters of Eve'  His research gives us much genuine food for though, he remarks how in centuries past , how many women who were made to suffer for not producing male heirs would have loved to know that the truth is only the male sperm cells that determine whether the child conceived will be a male or female. It is the Y chromosome that makes a child a male, without which the child will be a female.  He draws us to the interesting fact that one in every 20 000 female children have a Y chromosome, and these girls look normal and have normal intelligence, though the tend to be a little taller than average. but when they reach puberty their uterus and ovaries do not develop properly and they do not produce children.  Sykes uses mitochondrial DNA evidence from the remains of the Romanov Russian imperial family to cast serious doubt on the theory that when Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, one or two of his daughters survived. According to Sykes DNA proves all of the Tsar's children were murdered.  He also proves that almost of Native Europeans are descended from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers who were in Europe 50 000 years ago and not as some theorists have told us from Neolithic farmers who migrated to Europe some 10 000 years ago, and diluted the European gene pool-they did not.  The last part of the books gives seven semi-fictional stories of the seven matriarchal ancestress of modern indigenous Europeans. These were real people with almost identical DNA to their modern descendants but living in very different circumstances to them. Ursula , Xenia , Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine and Jasmine. I would also recommend the work by Rabbi Yaakov Kleinman 'Tradition and DNA' which traces the ancestry of modern day Jews to ancient Israel."
214,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2560917-kara,3,"The first three quarters of this book were packed full of genetics, human biology, anthropology, and even a little archeology and geography. If you ask me (and I guess you are), that is way too much scientific -ology. Unless you really like that stuff. I've heard there are people that do.Anyway, I liked the book because I appreciated the authors humor and I found the whole idea of tracing our genealogy back so far extremely interesting. I especially liked his analogy of all of his ancestors holding onto a thread.I did have a couple problems - first, was the time line. I have been informed that there is no way that even Adam and Eve lived as long ago as Bryan Sykes is saying these people were living, so that throws a big wrench in this for me. I am very uncomfortable with science and the the bible not meshing. I can't help but think we must be missing something and that if we would just do it right science would support the bible. But people, he has DNA! However, despite the DNA for the record and for all heaven to hear - I will take the side of the Bible. Big can of worms though. Very big. I will just pretend in my own little dillusional world that all of his science is correct but the timing is wrong and my Grandma is a direct maternal descendent of Tara, darn it! (Ooops! Can we say the d word on this site?)My second problem was with the last quarter of the book where Bryan introduced us to his own dillusional world. It was very odd and a bit disconcerting to go from all of that scientfic jargon to fiction. It didn't even really seem like fiction. It was kind of weird. I think that the idea behind it was interesting and would have been useful if he had described what we know to be true about those times through all the stupid -ologies in a different way and left what he imagined out. Although, I did get a kick out of him describing Tara as a woman with straight brown hair and blue eyes that loved the ocean. I could be Tara reincarnated! Just kidding. That would be another can of worms."
215,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies,3,"This book by the great pioneer of genetic archaeology and Oxford professor is at times rather dreadful. Many readers have been appalled by the fictional biographies of the individual women at the origin of the seven ""maternal"" clans to which 95% of Europe's population belonged at the end of the 20th century. I can hardly disagree. Syke's story of his research and his elucidation of the basics of mitochondrial DNA basis make for fascinating reading. Syke's yarn-spinning is as tedious as it is uninformative. Syke's greatest sin in my view is his public gloating over his academic rivals that he bested in his long and distinguished career. Nonetheless his venom and spite may be the most entertaining part of this book.Syke's big point is that he believes he demonstrated that 75% of the current European gene pool dates from the paleolithic era (1.8 million years ago to 10,000) AD. This would suggest that the diffusion of technology, the introduction of new agriculture methods and the changes in the linguistic profile of the Europe over the last 12,000 years were not the result of population movements. Rather the various peoples of Europe either invented new techniques on their own or simply adopted them as they became aware of them. This is a very major point as it had long assumed that the innovations had arrived with migrations of peoples.Sykes simply allows his major thesis to get submerged in a great deal of anecdotes and somewhat pointless fictionalizing. Nonetheless this book still merits being read as it provides considerable insight into genetic archaeology which is now yielding very interesting results from the four corners of the world. However, the reader should first read Sykes ""Blood of the Isles"" which is vastly superior in every way."
216,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1738417-ronda,3,"Interesting and thought-provoking read, but there were a few things that I found distracting. Early on, Sykes mentions some tension between himself and one of his co-workers. Later, he addresses events around this same person, who is involved in research and a paper that has devastating potential toward the research on mitochondrial DNA. Sykes' description of the events and final outcome come off as a ""nyah nyah"" thumbing of his nose at this person and ended up making me feel less sympathetic to him and his efforts--regardless of the truth or non-truth of his interpretation of the events. His handling of this could easily have been handled differently, to the benefit of the story he is presenting. The other distraction was the rather abrupt launch into the stories of the seven daughters' lives. I enjoyed his interpretations of their lives, but would have appreciated more of a lead-in of some sort to explain how he came up with these stories. Now, complaints aside, I found this book to be thought-provoking on many levels. It reinforced for me the idea that each new 'discovery' opens so many more paths to be explored and that those lead to yet others perhaps not yet dreamt of. It also helped me put some science behind my own personal musings about similarities in appearance between people who are, ostensibly, not related--either genealogically or biologically--combinations of nose shapes, hair colors/textures, body builds. The book was easy to read (which I mention b/c I had feared that it would not be lay-person friendly) and, ultimately, I was glad that I finally took the plunge and read it. "
217,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45388112-andrew,4,"This was a really fascinating read. I knew only a very little bit about genetics and ancient human history going in, but Sykes writes in a way that feels entry-level understandable AND useful. In other words, I didn't feel like I was being talked down to but I did feel like I understood all of the important mechanisms described in the book. This is much easier said than done, I'm sure.The book is about the way a particular kind of DNA is used to trace the maternal lineage of people over the course of many thousands of years. Incredibly, this enables us to approximate seven women in ancient history whose descendants make up every single modern human of European descent. In so doing, we can understand with some measure of accuracy where each of our ancestors lived, what groups they may have belonged to, the path humanity took as it traveled out of Africa and populated the world, etc. Besides being an actual ground-breaking scientist, Sykes has a real talent for storytelling. For much of the book it's the sort of story he might tell over drinks to his friends, about a funny thing that happened between himself and a professional rival, about an exciting new discovery a peer made, about the modern implications of his work. He draws connections that are genuinely thrilling: what it means to have a scientific ancestry that depends entirely on women, not the manual ones drawn up by and for men. A history that cannot be erased by oppressors and those who would destroy someone's culture. He is able to put across the excitement he surely must have felt first-hand while making these connections and discoveries."
218,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"Sykes traces the history of most Europeans back to 7 women through an examination of mitochondrial DNA. I love the science behind this book. An examination of the DNA shows how very related most people are. Would love to see this done for places like India where caste differences make people treat each other badly. Wouldn't it also be cool to take it even further and relate the Europeans back to say the Africans and show how related blacks and whites might be. Sykes shows how he may be related to the last Tsar through his mitochondrial DNA. I did not give this book 5 stars because much of the book is not about the 7 women but rather about the science and Sykes' quest. The chapters about the 7 women are in some ways the least interesting as they are mainly conjecture about the kind of world they may have lived in and Sykes is not good at fiction as the women don't really come alive in these chapters. However, his scientific journey is extremely interesting and intriguing. There are times when personality clashes take up room and still seem to rankle to Sykes but I suppose that's his writing style. He is not as smooth or accomplished a pop science book as say Bryson but I'm glad he wrote this book for mass consumption because this story (about mitochondrial DNA and what it can tell us) certainly needed telling."
219,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/725357-nate,4,"Although this book was written in 2001, it is still a useful introduction to the study of human genetic ancestry for the layperson like me. Sykes is unique for having been at the forefront of major discoveries in genetics, such as sequencing the Iceman (Otzi)'s genome and finding modern descendants, helping to identify the bodies of most of the members of the massacred Russian royal family, and tracing 95% of Europeans' female ancestors to just seven women who lived between 45,000 and 10,000 years ago. Sykes' writing style is engaging, especially considering his background as a scientific researcher. I would wonder if it was ghost-written, except for his background in journalism. Most of the book is not about the ""Seven Daughters of Eve""; however, the background information is just as interesting. It takes a good portion of the book to build up to the fictionalized vignettes of these women at the end. Although the stories seem contrived, they do humanize these women and offer insight into the everyday challenges for people in prehistoric Europe, especially during the last ice ages. I wonder if one of my mitochondrial ancestors was one of these women. There's a 95% chance that this is the case. "

Are the skeletons found at Iekaterinburg the ones of the Romanov family? Is Neanderthal really extincted or, does he have any descendants? What about the Europeans? Do they have Croc-Magnon for ancestor or, farmers coming from the Middle-East? Bryan Sykes tells us the discoveries made by genetics thanks to mitochondrial DNA, a bacteria passing from generation to generation through the maternal line only.Enthusiast, he is like a kid in a sweetshop. His writing style for instance reflects very well his fascination and excitement -it is actually so accessible that, we sometimes have the feeling of reading a novel! This will be a bit puzzling to whose used to science books but, the others will thus find him easier to understand.I just think the last chapters (the reconstitutions of the seven Eves' lives) are completely useless. I understand they are a very easy way of describing nomadic life, the birth of agriculture, the first villages and so on but, are such fictions not ridiculous in a non-fiction book? Why not using an Appendix? Well, as it is targeted for a very wide audience...Still a good read."
221,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1502451-angiea,5,"This is the book that started a love affair with DNA! I've now read several books on tracing human orgins through DNA, but this was the first one and it's the one that really got me to thinking about who these women really were. I really had to stretch my mind back and realize that one of the seven daughters is my ancestor! It rekindled my desire to do genealogical/family history research, especially on my mother's side back through all the women. It's difficult, because women's identities become subsumed in with their husbands. The maiden names become difficult to track. I have moved my search to Belgium and found my great grandmother's parents. Of my four lines, this is the first to go back to Europe as they were the most recent immigrants to the States. The writing is clear and interesting and Sykes gets you so interested, you find yourself with a pencil in your hand to be sure to mark the really good stuff. I made a multiribbon book mark to place the passages that really intrigued me. "
222,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2684619-reiden,4,"I heard about this book in a geography class I took a few years ago, and I thought it did a good job explaining how matrilineal lineages can be traced using mitochondrial DNA. I do agree with several of the other reviews which state that there was a little too much of the book spent on European decent and the fictional narratives of the Seven Daughters, but other than that it was a great book. As much as I wanted to get back to the science of the genetic testing described in the first half of the book, the narrative in the second half did provide a glimpse into the lives of people who we will probably never hear much about without the use of some imagination combined with the knowledge based on the limited supply of archeological and genetic evidence that we have from our distant ancestors. I can only hope that as more light is shed on this area of science, humans will begin to realize the deeper connection that we all have to one another via our common ancestors. "
223,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/200881-william-ramsay,3,"This is a very interesting book that does damage to any lingering ideas of racial superiority. By genetic testing of thousands of people, Sykes has show that everyone of European extraction can trace his or her ancestry to just seven women who lived between 10 and 45 thousand years ago. Not only that, but DNA testing and archeology have shown that we are all Africans at the core. All I could think of while reading this is that so much blood has been spilled because one man thinks he's superior to another when there is no scientific basis for it at all. I think the book slowed a bit in the middle and his description of the lives of the seven women are the root of our ancestry was a bit speculative for a scientific work. But I enjoyed reading it. The actual science of DNA is unbelievably fascinating. "
224,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12609637-s,1,"Hmm The first part of the book is OK. However, the third part really lets it down. While there is absolutely no doubt that people's mtDNA can be traced back to one of several haplotypes, there is debate of how many unique haplotypes there are. Why should a descendent become a new haplotype and another not? Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to believe that haplotype and fictional lifestyle in the past has any effect on anyone's current personality or lifestyle proclivities. I would definitely not pay to test my DNA for a just-so story as this.I worked in the same Dept as the author for a few years and found the business he set up around testing people's mtDNA and then presenting them with a preprinted certificate about their clan ancestry close to charlatanry. "
225,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"I enjoyed this look into the evidence of mitochondrial DNA. The first 2/3's concentrates on the discovery that mitochondrial DNA can be used to look at family trees into the far past and the establishment of the science behind the theory. The author has an ""everyday"" voice that is easy to follow and understand.The last third of the book gives each ""daughter"" a chapter and gives a romanticized account of their life. The topography, animals, living conditions, tools, etc. that is described in these chapters are historically correct but, of course, the actual women's lives aren't. It's a fun way to end the book.I found this to be a very interesting book. "

When did the native Australians arrive). It answered questions I didn't even know enough about the subject to have before (What is the difference between a Paleolithic modern human and a Neanderthal). I learned a lot about genetics and how they can answer those questions. Plus, he's a great storyteller. It was fascinating to read the narratives he wrote about the lives of the Seven Eves.I wasn't really hooked until Chapter 6, though I was interested enough to keep reading until there.

It's interesting, compelling, and thought provoking.But then, and I can't be the only one to think this, when he starts describing the lives of the seven daughters, it gets weird.

238,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,4,"I heard about Sykes' book in a footnote to Kevin MacDonald's Culture of Critique: ""Current data indicate that around 80% of European genes are derived from people who settled in Europe 30–40,000 years ago and therefore persisted through the Ice Ages (Sykes 2001). This is sufficient time for the adverse ecology of the north to have had a powerful shaping influence on European psychological and cultural tendencies."" MacDonald was making the argument that north-west European people have uniquely low ethnocentrism due to environmental challenges being the most important factor in evolving group strategies as opposed to competition with other groups, which MacDonald holds creates more ethnocentric cultures, such as in the Middle East. To be clear, Sykes' book is a book of popular science and isn't political, that's just what motivated me to read it. Sykes' work is a genetic history of modern Europeans traced back to seven mothers 40-10,000 years ago, from the last ice age to the arrival of agriculture. The method Sykes presents is mitochondrial DNA traced through the mother. Mitochondrial DNA exists outside of the cell nucleus and so doesn't go through the same recombination mutations like sexual gametes and so changes much slower, allowing us to measure the time between individual mutations to locate the difference from an ancestor without the mutation. For this mtDNA to be traced, a mother has to have more than one child so her genes will be shared by future generations. Because these genes are traced through one parent, the genetic lineages are called haplogroups as opposed to diplogroups. A single mutation occurs about every 10,000 years, and so these mutations are a measure for how many years separate genetic lines. The story goes that the Homo sapiens left Africa 100-70,000 years ago probably via the Arabian peninsula to spread to Eurasia and Oceania and eventually the Americas. Some earlier went along the coast of Southeast Asia all the way to Australia 50,000 years ago. Later on Homo sapiens arrived in Europe through Central Asia and split off genetically with mongoloids 30-40,000 years ago. There were other hominids in Eurasia long before Homo sapiens however; Neanderthals in Europe and Homo Erectus in Asia. The first Europeans are called Cro-Magnons who are known to us through their famous cave art. Eventually the Neanderthals died out around 30,000 years ago. The popular argument goes that Neanderthals weren't as creative as Homo sapiens despite having large brains (and bodies) who could create and pass on their knowledge. The Cro-Magnons also had large brains, larger than Europeans today which shows up the cave art they have left. Now these Cro-Magnons don't look exactly like Europeans today. They originally had darker skin. The genes for lighter skin became prevalent relatively recently in evolutionary history, in both the near east and the reaches of Northern Europe. It is to thought that light skin began evolving after 40,000 years ago to synthesize more vitamin D given less sun. What is interesting is that current Scandinavians are the most related to the early Europeans, and so it could have been that the earliest Europeans had darker skin, while Scandanavians and Siberians having light skin and colored eyes. So it seems modern European traits are the product of two general groups: the hunter-gatherers migrated from Africa 40,000 years ago who had darker skin and perhaps colored eyes who remained on the continent, Nordic and Siberians who had light skin and colored eyes. ""All modern Europeans must today trace their ancestry back to much more recent arrivals- to the Cro-Magnons, with their lighter skeleton, their much improved flint technology and their wonderful art. This was an absolute replacement of one human species by another...It is clear from the fossil record that the Neanderthals hung on for at least fifteen thousand years after the first Cro-Magnons reached Western Europe some forty to fifty thousand years ago. When the last Neanderthal expired-probably in southern Spain, where the most recent skeletons have been found-his or her death drew a line under another phase in the human occupation of Europe. An era that lasted for a quarter of a million years ended, finally and irreversibly, in a cave in southern Spain about twenty-eight thousand years ago.""Sykes does not think that Homo sapiens in Eurasia interbred with other hominids. This is the multi-regional hypothesis which doesn't necessarily mean that humans evolved independently on several continents, but after leaving Africa evolved for different environments interbreeding both with other Homo sapiens as well as hominids, Neanderthals in Europe and H Erectus in Asia. This means that humans evolved on different continents, rather than all in Africa and then leaving to the rest of the world recently. Put simply, gene flow between geographically separated populations prevented greater speciation but also meant regional variation and interbreeding with other hominids outside Africa. ""When the last Neanderthal died, twenty eight thousand years ago, there was only one human species left to rule the planet. Ours.""Since Sykes' book, the Neanderthal Genome has been sequenced in 2010, and it turns out that Europeans and Asians do share at least 1-5%. This 1-5% is supposedly total shared DNA unique to Neanderthals, and given that we are 99% similar to chimpanzees genetically, this is actually a lot and could upend the entire out of Africa hypothesis Whatever interbreeding probably began soon after leaving Africa in the Middle East. These genes do matter; they affect circadian rhythm, mood, and the immune system, adapted for the ice age environment. So the multi-regional hypothesis has something to it. Now, the seven clans which altogether 95% of current European DNA can be traced back to. * Ursula: corresponds to Haplogroup U which comprised the DNA of 11% of Europeans direct descendants. 45,000 years ago. * Xenia corresponds to Haplogroup X 25,000 years ago. 6% of current European population, 1% of native Americans * Helena corresponds to Haplogroup H 20,000 years ago. Most successful clan, all over Europe, 47% of European DNA. * Velda corresponds to Haplogroup V. 17,000 years ago. 5% of Europeans * Tara corresponds to Haplogroup T. 17,000 years ago. 9% * Katrine corresponds to Haplogroup K. 15,000 years ago, 6%* Jasmine. corresponds to Haplogroup J 17% 10,000 years ago. Haplogroup U which is the earliest haplogroup for Europeans is shared by 15% of caste Indian DNA and 8% of tribal Indians. U is supposed to have been the dominant mtDNA until the spread of agriculture and the presence of Indo-Europeans. The two dominant language groups in India are Aryan and Dravidian which are respectively associated with the north and the south. So India's population two is likely the source of two general migrations; one earlier from Africa or possibly Asia into southern India and a later migration(s) of caucasians. It turns out that native Americans have more European DNA than was thought, both haplogroup x and haplogroup u which amounts to at least a third of DNA shared with Europeans. Amerindians it turns out are both caucasoid and mongoloid, which explains the European head shape of Kennewick man. There is also the hypothesis that European Cro-Magnons, called the Solutrean culture, migrated to North America first before the American Indians from Europe during the ice age. The evidence is two things: the similarity of stone tools in Solutrean Europe and the North American Clovis culture and haplogroup x. Haplogroup x it turns out is highest in Anatolia near the Caucuses and in north North America. This is a heterodox position, but does connect with one of the seven daughters of Eve. Tara, Haplogroup T, is shared by many prominent European nobles, including Nicholas II the last Tsar of Russia. Tara may be the ancestor of the proto-Indo-Europeans as it is very common around the Black Sea where the Indo-Euorpeans are supposed to have originated, as well as in the Caucuses. T is also linked to haplogroup J, Jasmine whose genes spread with agriculture. The most interesting daughter of the book for me is of course Jasmine who I have mentioned several times already. This is the ancestor associated with the spread agriculture throughout Europe. With this came lactose tolerance which is prevalent among Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Central Asia but not with East Asians or Africans. Its interesting that northern India, where the ""Aryan invasion"" or diffusion from which the Aryan (meaning noble in Sanskrit) language and religion is supposed to have spread from 4,000 years ago, is far more lactose tolerant than southern India. This Jasmine may be the ancestor for whom the Indo-European languages shared by almost all Europeans with ancient Sanskrit was spread by, the Aryans. ""The Indo-element in Indo-European is there because there is a strong connection, again visible only to linguists, between the European languages and Sanskrit. This link was discovered by William Jones in 1786 while he was working as a judge for the British Raj. It was an amazing piece of amateur scholarship; indeed, Jones invented the concept of language families that is still a feature of comparative linguistics today. The essential idea of a language family is that all the different languages within it have evolved from a common root, almost certainly a language that is now extinct. This raises the question of where the original Indo-European language was spoken and importantly, how it spread out from there. Renfrew deduced that the original Indo-European language was spoken in Anatolia in central Turkey, and was then spread to Europe by the first farmers. A massive replacement of the hunter-gatherers by the the agricultural ""wave of advance"""" So 80% of modern European DNA can be traced back to the ice age, and the remaining 10-20% can be traced to the Near East/Central Asia, other Caucasoids. This group seems to be the unifier of European and maybe Caucasian people, providing agriculture and possibly languages and at least one source of light skin. (Back to MacDonald's thesis of lower ethnocentrism for Europeans relative to those of the Middle East: it is this 80% of DNA from the last ice age going back 40,000 years which is responsible for the difference. The later 20% is a later addition which coincides with agriculture. Groups in the Middle East had pastoralism as a way of life and developed it in competition with other groups. Europeans would have spent most of their evolutionary history on the continent as hunter gatherers, rather than as pastoralists. Being a pastoralist meant having to protect herds from other groups, which would explain higher ethnocentrism. Such resources would be kept within the family, consanguinity, endogamy, the extended family, and also enable polygamy which would altogether make individuals in the group more related. European people would have a lifestyle more dependent on the environment, with a basic division of labor between men and women who would both cooperate as their respective roles hunting and gathering. The changing climate and migration of game would be the challenges to overcome. Monogamy, exogamy, and more of a simple nuclear household would be the norm which mean less genetic relatedness and less ethnocentrism. The Indo-Europeans are the ones who brought pastoralism to Europeans evolved evolved for the environment of the central Asian steppe. Their own kinship and property systems would be transplanted over the hunter gatherers and their evolutionary heritage.)"
239,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15649779-orville-jenkins,5,"Bryan Sykes is one of the world's leading genetic anthropologists, working with DNA identification and comparison to understand the biological history of the human race. He has been part of a growing worldwide coordinated effort in DNA gathering and comparison, and worked with various other specialists to reconstruct the migration and cultural portraits of humans.Since 2000, our understanding has accelerated and skyrocketed into a burgeoning, exciting body of knowledge about human prehistory and the genetic character of modern populations. Sykes is a skilled storyteller and analyst, resulting in a well-crafted true tale of who we are and how we got to where we are in the world today, and how the innermost being of our every individual cell carries the story in our genes!The ongoing DNA comparisons all over the world began to fill out a picture of the kinship of all modern humans and their migrations all over the world. In 2001, Brian Sykes reported on his DNA studies in Europe and the Polynesian Islands and related, with careful comparisons to the studies by others on Hawaii and the Americas.In reporting his comprehensive and extensive DNA reconstruction for the people of Europe, Sykes detailed his DNA findings and presented a delightful historical and cultural history of Europe comparing the DNA reconstruction for Europe with related findings from Archaeology, paleoanthropology, and especially the lifestyle of each era. Important for this was the movement of agriculture across the world and its arrival in Europe.As his comparisons for Europe progressed, collecting or comparing samples from all over the UK locales, Sykes actually found a modern Irish woman who had the exact same mtDNA sequence as Ötzi, the 5000-year-old Alps Ice Man. The Ice man, found in 1991, was a mummified man found in a melting Alps glacier. This ancient European had been preserved by a glacial freeze and was determined to be 5200 or 5300 years old, determined by DNA study of grains in his leather bag carrying his tools and other paraphernalia.Similar information from pollen found in or on Ötzi providing additional insights into Ötzi's historical period. The viable DNA recovered from the Ice Man, with related findings from various disciplines of study and investigation reconstructed Ötzi's diet and likely family history. These insights into Ötzi's life and times shed additional light on Sykes' study of the origins and migrations of the streams of indigenous settlement and the much later movement of agriculture into Europe.The exciting upshot of this particular part of Sykes' study and reconstruction was the discovery of a modern current Irish woman with the same exact mitochondrial DNA sequence as the Ice Man!After analyzing the DNA patterns of thousands of subjects all across Europe, Sykes realized they all fell into a pattern of 7 groups, thus deriving from only 7 ancestral women for about 95% of the population of current Europe. These he dubs the Seven Daughters of Eve. After recounting the saga of the investigations, the puzzles, the disappointments and the breakthroughs that finally led to the final schema explaining the genetic relationship of thousand so Europeans, Sykes rounds out the story by providing a fictionalized account of the life of these seven women and their families.Sykes constructs his portraits by weaving in the knowledge from multiple disciplines like archaeology, geology, animal and plant DNA comparisons, and the toolsets associated with various eras of prehistory and history, including the advent of agriculture and its move into Europe. He outlines the movement of the human race across the world millennia by millennia to people all the continents.You will find this a fascinating novelesque saga that is our story, the human story, with particular attention to how all these factors came together in the population of the continent of Europe."

We will never know all the details of these journeys over thousands of years and thousands of miles, but we can at least imagine them. I am on a stage. Before me, in the dim light, all the people who have ever lived are lined up, rank upon rank, stretching far into the distance. They make no sound that I can hear, but they are talking to each other. I have in my hand the end of the thread which connects me to my ancestral mother way at the back. I pull on the thread and one womans face in every generation, feeling the tug, looks up at me. Their faces stand out from the crowd and they are illuminated by a strange light. These are my ancestors.""I have done my DNA and ancestry testing with 23andme and discovered my maternal haplogrouping to be H1c, H is 20,000 years old. Reading this book has helped me to understand and think deeply of my roots.A very worthwhile read."

Those who are curious about, how science works, how human evolution could have progressed and how majority of humans can be linked to seven women, this book is a must read. The begining is a bit slow and for non-science people can be a bit boring but once that part is finished you can't keep the book down until you finish it. Brilliant book!😊"
243,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51196399-gary,5,"I found this book compelling, fascinating, an enjoyable read and an education in itself. What is wonderful about this book is that Bryan Sykes explains and teaches us about DNA and his own research and conclusions into mitochondria and the origins of humankind and it's ancestry through DNA research in way those of us without science degrees can understand.  It is a narrative of our common heritage and our shared forebears. The author explains to us in a way that is easy to understand what is DNA and what it is does. How we can trace common ancestry to people in other parts of the world, and his theory that all indigenous Europeans are descended from seven common female ancestors who he refers to as 'the seven daughters of Eve'  His research gives us much genuine food for though, he remarks how in centuries past , how many women who were made to suffer for not producing male heirs would have loved to know that the truth is only the male sperm cells that determine whether the child conceived will be a male or female. It is the Y chromosome that makes a child a male, without which the child will be a female.  He draws us to the interesting fact that one in every 20 000 female children have a Y chromosome, and these girls look normal and have normal intelligence, though the tend to be a little taller than average. but when they reach puberty their uterus and ovaries do not develop properly and they do not produce children.  Sykes uses mitochondrial DNA evidence from the remains of the Romanov Russian imperial family to cast serious doubt on the theory that when Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, one or two of his daughters survived. According to Sykes DNA proves all of the Tsar's children were murdered.  He also proves that almost of Native Europeans are descended from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers who were in Europe 50 000 years ago and not as some theorists have told us from Neolithic farmers who migrated to Europe some 10 000 years ago, and diluted the European gene pool-they did not.  The last part of the books gives seven semi-fictional stories of the seven matriarchal ancestress of modern indigenous Europeans. These were real people with almost identical DNA to their modern descendants but living in very different circumstances to them. Ursula , Xenia , Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine and Jasmine. I would also recommend the work by Rabbi Yaakov Kleinman 'Tradition and DNA' which traces the ancestry of modern day Jews to ancient Israel."
244,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2560917-kara,3,"The first three quarters of this book were packed full of genetics, human biology, anthropology, and even a little archeology and geography. If you ask me (and I guess you are), that is way too much scientific -ology. Unless you really like that stuff. I've heard there are people that do.Anyway, I liked the book because I appreciated the authors humor and I found the whole idea of tracing our genealogy back so far extremely interesting. I especially liked his analogy of all of his ancestors holding onto a thread.I did have a couple problems - first, was the time line. I have been informed that there is no way that even Adam and Eve lived as long ago as Bryan Sykes is saying these people were living, so that throws a big wrench in this for me. I am very uncomfortable with science and the the bible not meshing. I can't help but think we must be missing something and that if we would just do it right science would support the bible. But people, he has DNA! However, despite the DNA for the record and for all heaven to hear - I will take the side of the Bible. Big can of worms though. Very big. I will just pretend in my own little dillusional world that all of his science is correct but the timing is wrong and my Grandma is a direct maternal descendent of Tara, darn it! (Ooops! Can we say the d word on this site?)My second problem was with the last quarter of the book where Bryan introduced us to his own dillusional world. It was very odd and a bit disconcerting to go from all of that scientfic jargon to fiction. It didn't even really seem like fiction. It was kind of weird. I think that the idea behind it was interesting and would have been useful if he had described what we know to be true about those times through all the stupid -ologies in a different way and left what he imagined out. Although, I did get a kick out of him describing Tara as a woman with straight brown hair and blue eyes that loved the ocean. I could be Tara reincarnated! Just kidding. That would be another can of worms."
245,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies,3,"This book by the great pioneer of genetic archaeology and Oxford professor is at times rather dreadful. Many readers have been appalled by the fictional biographies of the individual women at the origin of the seven ""maternal"" clans to which 95% of Europe's population belonged at the end of the 20th century. I can hardly disagree. Syke's story of his research and his elucidation of the basics of mitochondrial DNA basis make for fascinating reading. Syke's yarn-spinning is as tedious as it is uninformative. Syke's greatest sin in my view is his public gloating over his academic rivals that he bested in his long and distinguished career. Nonetheless his venom and spite may be the most entertaining part of this book.Syke's big point is that he believes he demonstrated that 75% of the current European gene pool dates from the paleolithic era (1.8 million years ago to 10,000) AD. This would suggest that the diffusion of technology, the introduction of new agriculture methods and the changes in the linguistic profile of the Europe over the last 12,000 years were not the result of population movements. Rather the various peoples of Europe either invented new techniques on their own or simply adopted them as they became aware of them. This is a very major point as it had long assumed that the innovations had arrived with migrations of peoples.Sykes simply allows his major thesis to get submerged in a great deal of anecdotes and somewhat pointless fictionalizing. Nonetheless this book still merits being read as it provides considerable insight into genetic archaeology which is now yielding very interesting results from the four corners of the world. However, the reader should first read Sykes ""Blood of the Isles"" which is vastly superior in every way."
246,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1738417-ronda,3,"Interesting and thought-provoking read, but there were a few things that I found distracting. Early on, Sykes mentions some tension between himself and one of his co-workers. Later, he addresses events around this same person, who is involved in research and a paper that has devastating potential toward the research on mitochondrial DNA. Sykes' description of the events and final outcome come off as a ""nyah nyah"" thumbing of his nose at this person and ended up making me feel less sympathetic to him and his efforts--regardless of the truth or non-truth of his interpretation of the events. His handling of this could easily have been handled differently, to the benefit of the story he is presenting. The other distraction was the rather abrupt launch into the stories of the seven daughters' lives. I enjoyed his interpretations of their lives, but would have appreciated more of a lead-in of some sort to explain how he came up with these stories. Now, complaints aside, I found this book to be thought-provoking on many levels. It reinforced for me the idea that each new 'discovery' opens so many more paths to be explored and that those lead to yet others perhaps not yet dreamt of. It also helped me put some science behind my own personal musings about similarities in appearance between people who are, ostensibly, not related--either genealogically or biologically--combinations of nose shapes, hair colors/textures, body builds. The book was easy to read (which I mention b/c I had feared that it would not be lay-person friendly) and, ultimately, I was glad that I finally took the plunge and read it. "
247,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45388112-andrew,4,"This was a really fascinating read. I knew only a very little bit about genetics and ancient human history going in, but Sykes writes in a way that feels entry-level understandable AND useful. In other words, I didn't feel like I was being talked down to but I did feel like I understood all of the important mechanisms described in the book. This is much easier said than done, I'm sure.The book is about the way a particular kind of DNA is used to trace the maternal lineage of people over the course of many thousands of years. Incredibly, this enables us to approximate seven women in ancient history whose descendants make up every single modern human of European descent. In so doing, we can understand with some measure of accuracy where each of our ancestors lived, what groups they may have belonged to, the path humanity took as it traveled out of Africa and populated the world, etc. Besides being an actual ground-breaking scientist, Sykes has a real talent for storytelling. For much of the book it's the sort of story he might tell over drinks to his friends, about a funny thing that happened between himself and a professional rival, about an exciting new discovery a peer made, about the modern implications of his work. He draws connections that are genuinely thrilling: what it means to have a scientific ancestry that depends entirely on women, not the manual ones drawn up by and for men. A history that cannot be erased by oppressors and those who would destroy someone's culture. He is able to put across the excitement he surely must have felt first-hand while making these connections and discoveries."
248,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"Sykes traces the history of most Europeans back to 7 women through an examination of mitochondrial DNA. I love the science behind this book. An examination of the DNA shows how very related most people are. Would love to see this done for places like India where caste differences make people treat each other badly. Wouldn't it also be cool to take it even further and relate the Europeans back to say the Africans and show how related blacks and whites might be. Sykes shows how he may be related to the last Tsar through his mitochondrial DNA. I did not give this book 5 stars because much of the book is not about the 7 women but rather about the science and Sykes' quest. The chapters about the 7 women are in some ways the least interesting as they are mainly conjecture about the kind of world they may have lived in and Sykes is not good at fiction as the women don't really come alive in these chapters. However, his scientific journey is extremely interesting and intriguing. There are times when personality clashes take up room and still seem to rankle to Sykes but I suppose that's his writing style. He is not as smooth or accomplished a pop science book as say Bryson but I'm glad he wrote this book for mass consumption because this story (about mitochondrial DNA and what it can tell us) certainly needed telling."
249,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/725357-nate,4,"Although this book was written in 2001, it is still a useful introduction to the study of human genetic ancestry for the layperson like me. Sykes is unique for having been at the forefront of major discoveries in genetics, such as sequencing the Iceman (Otzi)'s genome and finding modern descendants, helping to identify the bodies of most of the members of the massacred Russian royal family, and tracing 95% of Europeans' female ancestors to just seven women who lived between 45,000 and 10,000 years ago. Sykes' writing style is engaging, especially considering his background as a scientific researcher. I would wonder if it was ghost-written, except for his background in journalism. Most of the book is not about the ""Seven Daughters of Eve""; however, the background information is just as interesting. It takes a good portion of the book to build up to the fictionalized vignettes of these women at the end. Although the stories seem contrived, they do humanize these women and offer insight into the everyday challenges for people in prehistoric Europe, especially during the last ice ages. I wonder if one of my mitochondrial ancestors was one of these women. There's a 95% chance that this is the case. "

Are the skeletons found at Iekaterinburg the ones of the Romanov family? Is Neanderthal really extincted or, does he have any descendants? What about the Europeans? Do they have Croc-Magnon for ancestor or, farmers coming from the Middle-East? Bryan Sykes tells us the discoveries made by genetics thanks to mitochondrial DNA, a bacteria passing from generation to generation through the maternal line only.Enthusiast, he is like a kid in a sweetshop. His writing style for instance reflects very well his fascination and excitement -it is actually so accessible that, we sometimes have the feeling of reading a novel! This will be a bit puzzling to whose used to science books but, the others will thus find him easier to understand.I just think the last chapters (the reconstitutions of the seven Eves' lives) are completely useless. I understand they are a very easy way of describing nomadic life, the birth of agriculture, the first villages and so on but, are such fictions not ridiculous in a non-fiction book? Why not using an Appendix? Well, as it is targeted for a very wide audience...Still a good read."
251,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1502451-angiea,5,"This is the book that started a love affair with DNA! I've now read several books on tracing human orgins through DNA, but this was the first one and it's the one that really got me to thinking about who these women really were. I really had to stretch my mind back and realize that one of the seven daughters is my ancestor! It rekindled my desire to do genealogical/family history research, especially on my mother's side back through all the women. It's difficult, because women's identities become subsumed in with their husbands. The maiden names become difficult to track. I have moved my search to Belgium and found my great grandmother's parents. Of my four lines, this is the first to go back to Europe as they were the most recent immigrants to the States. The writing is clear and interesting and Sykes gets you so interested, you find yourself with a pencil in your hand to be sure to mark the really good stuff. I made a multiribbon book mark to place the passages that really intrigued me. "
252,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2684619-reiden,4,"I heard about this book in a geography class I took a few years ago, and I thought it did a good job explaining how matrilineal lineages can be traced using mitochondrial DNA. I do agree with several of the other reviews which state that there was a little too much of the book spent on European decent and the fictional narratives of the Seven Daughters, but other than that it was a great book. As much as I wanted to get back to the science of the genetic testing described in the first half of the book, the narrative in the second half did provide a glimpse into the lives of people who we will probably never hear much about without the use of some imagination combined with the knowledge based on the limited supply of archeological and genetic evidence that we have from our distant ancestors. I can only hope that as more light is shed on this area of science, humans will begin to realize the deeper connection that we all have to one another via our common ancestors. "
253,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/200881-william-ramsay,3,"This is a very interesting book that does damage to any lingering ideas of racial superiority. By genetic testing of thousands of people, Sykes has show that everyone of European extraction can trace his or her ancestry to just seven women who lived between 10 and 45 thousand years ago. Not only that, but DNA testing and archeology have shown that we are all Africans at the core. All I could think of while reading this is that so much blood has been spilled because one man thinks he's superior to another when there is no scientific basis for it at all. I think the book slowed a bit in the middle and his description of the lives of the seven women are the root of our ancestry was a bit speculative for a scientific work. But I enjoyed reading it. The actual science of DNA is unbelievably fascinating. "
254,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12609637-s,1,"Hmm The first part of the book is OK. However, the third part really lets it down. While there is absolutely no doubt that people's mtDNA can be traced back to one of several haplotypes, there is debate of how many unique haplotypes there are. Why should a descendent become a new haplotype and another not? Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to believe that haplotype and fictional lifestyle in the past has any effect on anyone's current personality or lifestyle proclivities. I would definitely not pay to test my DNA for a just-so story as this.I worked in the same Dept as the author for a few years and found the business he set up around testing people's mtDNA and then presenting them with a preprinted certificate about their clan ancestry close to charlatanry. "
255,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"I enjoyed this look into the evidence of mitochondrial DNA. The first 2/3's concentrates on the discovery that mitochondrial DNA can be used to look at family trees into the far past and the establishment of the science behind the theory. The author has an ""everyday"" voice that is easy to follow and understand.The last third of the book gives each ""daughter"" a chapter and gives a romanticized account of their life. The topography, animals, living conditions, tools, etc. that is described in these chapters are historically correct but, of course, the actual women's lives aren't. It's a fun way to end the book.I found this to be a very interesting book. "
256,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44237-janel,5,"This book really was amazing. It answered questions I had from other books (which continent did the Polynesians come from. When did the native Australians arrive). It answered questions I didn't even know enough about the subject to have before (What is the difference between a Paleolithic modern human and a Neanderthal). I learned a lot about genetics and how they can answer those questions. Plus, he's a great storyteller. It was fascinating to read the narratives he wrote about the lives of the Seven Eves.I wasn't really hooked until Chapter 6, though I was interested enough to keep reading until there. But after that I didn't want to put it down."

I think the writing in the first parts is excellent, with care being taken to make complicated genetic science accessible to people without a science background. It's interesting, compelling, and thought provoking.But then, and I can't be the only one to think this, when he starts describing the lives of the seven daughters, it gets weird.

268,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,4,"I heard about Sykes' book in a footnote to Kevin MacDonald's Culture of Critique: ""Current data indicate that around 80% of European genes are derived from people who settled in Europe 30–40,000 years ago and therefore persisted through the Ice Ages (Sykes 2001). This is sufficient time for the adverse ecology of the north to have had a powerful shaping influence on European psychological and cultural tendencies."" MacDonald was making the argument that north-west European people have uniquely low ethnocentrism due to environmental challenges being the most important factor in evolving group strategies as opposed to competition with other groups, which MacDonald holds creates more ethnocentric cultures, such as in the Middle East. To be clear, Sykes' book is a book of popular science and isn't political, that's just what motivated me to read it. Sykes' work is a genetic history of modern Europeans traced back to seven mothers 40-10,000 years ago, from the last ice age to the arrival of agriculture. The method Sykes presents is mitochondrial DNA traced through the mother. Mitochondrial DNA exists outside of the cell nucleus and so doesn't go through the same recombination mutations like sexual gametes and so changes much slower, allowing us to measure the time between individual mutations to locate the difference from an ancestor without the mutation. For this mtDNA to be traced, a mother has to have more than one child so her genes will be shared by future generations. Because these genes are traced through one parent, the genetic lineages are called haplogroups as opposed to diplogroups. A single mutation occurs about every 10,000 years, and so these mutations are a measure for how many years separate genetic lines. The story goes that the Homo sapiens left Africa 100-70,000 years ago probably via the Arabian peninsula to spread to Eurasia and Oceania and eventually the Americas. Some earlier went along the coast of Southeast Asia all the way to Australia 50,000 years ago. Later on Homo sapiens arrived in Europe through Central Asia and split off genetically with mongoloids 30-40,000 years ago. There were other hominids in Eurasia long before Homo sapiens however; Neanderthals in Europe and Homo Erectus in Asia. The first Europeans are called Cro-Magnons who are known to us through their famous cave art. Eventually the Neanderthals died out around 30,000 years ago. The popular argument goes that Neanderthals weren't as creative as Homo sapiens despite having large brains (and bodies) who could create and pass on their knowledge. The Cro-Magnons also had large brains, larger than Europeans today which shows up the cave art they have left. Now these Cro-Magnons don't look exactly like Europeans today. They originally had darker skin. The genes for lighter skin became prevalent relatively recently in evolutionary history, in both the near east and the reaches of Northern Europe. It is to thought that light skin began evolving after 40,000 years ago to synthesize more vitamin D given less sun. What is interesting is that current Scandinavians are the most related to the early Europeans, and so it could have been that the earliest Europeans had darker skin, while Scandanavians and Siberians having light skin and colored eyes. So it seems modern European traits are the product of two general groups: the hunter-gatherers migrated from Africa 40,000 years ago who had darker skin and perhaps colored eyes who remained on the continent, Nordic and Siberians who had light skin and colored eyes. ""All modern Europeans must today trace their ancestry back to much more recent arrivals- to the Cro-Magnons, with their lighter skeleton, their much improved flint technology and their wonderful art. This was an absolute replacement of one human species by another...It is clear from the fossil record that the Neanderthals hung on for at least fifteen thousand years after the first Cro-Magnons reached Western Europe some forty to fifty thousand years ago. When the last Neanderthal expired-probably in southern Spain, where the most recent skeletons have been found-his or her death drew a line under another phase in the human occupation of Europe. An era that lasted for a quarter of a million years ended, finally and irreversibly, in a cave in southern Spain about twenty-eight thousand years ago.""Sykes does not think that Homo sapiens in Eurasia interbred with other hominids. This is the multi-regional hypothesis which doesn't necessarily mean that humans evolved independently on several continents, but after leaving Africa evolved for different environments interbreeding both with other Homo sapiens as well as hominids, Neanderthals in Europe and H Erectus in Asia. This means that humans evolved on different continents, rather than all in Africa and then leaving to the rest of the world recently. Put simply, gene flow between geographically separated populations prevented greater speciation but also meant regional variation and interbreeding with other hominids outside Africa. ""When the last Neanderthal died, twenty eight thousand years ago, there was only one human species left to rule the planet. Ours.""Since Sykes' book, the Neanderthal Genome has been sequenced in 2010, and it turns out that Europeans and Asians do share at least 1-5%. This 1-5% is supposedly total shared DNA unique to Neanderthals, and given that we are 99% similar to chimpanzees genetically, this is actually a lot and could upend the entire out of Africa hypothesis Whatever interbreeding probably began soon after leaving Africa in the Middle East. These genes do matter; they affect circadian rhythm, mood, and the immune system, adapted for the ice age environment. So the multi-regional hypothesis has something to it. Now, the seven clans which altogether 95% of current European DNA can be traced back to. * Ursula: corresponds to Haplogroup U which comprised the DNA of 11% of Europeans direct descendants. 45,000 years ago. * Xenia corresponds to Haplogroup X 25,000 years ago. 6% of current European population, 1% of native Americans * Helena corresponds to Haplogroup H 20,000 years ago. Most successful clan, all over Europe, 47% of European DNA. * Velda corresponds to Haplogroup V. 17,000 years ago. 5% of Europeans * Tara corresponds to Haplogroup T. 17,000 years ago. 9% * Katrine corresponds to Haplogroup K. 15,000 years ago, 6%* Jasmine. corresponds to Haplogroup J 17% 10,000 years ago. Haplogroup U which is the earliest haplogroup for Europeans is shared by 15% of caste Indian DNA and 8% of tribal Indians. U is supposed to have been the dominant mtDNA until the spread of agriculture and the presence of Indo-Europeans. The two dominant language groups in India are Aryan and Dravidian which are respectively associated with the north and the south. So India's population two is likely the source of two general migrations; one earlier from Africa or possibly Asia into southern India and a later migration(s) of caucasians. It turns out that native Americans have more European DNA than was thought, both haplogroup x and haplogroup u which amounts to at least a third of DNA shared with Europeans. Amerindians it turns out are both caucasoid and mongoloid, which explains the European head shape of Kennewick man. There is also the hypothesis that European Cro-Magnons, called the Solutrean culture, migrated to North America first before the American Indians from Europe during the ice age. The evidence is two things: the similarity of stone tools in Solutrean Europe and the North American Clovis culture and haplogroup x. Haplogroup x it turns out is highest in Anatolia near the Caucuses and in north North America. This is a heterodox position, but does connect with one of the seven daughters of Eve. Tara, Haplogroup T, is shared by many prominent European nobles, including Nicholas II the last Tsar of Russia. Tara may be the ancestor of the proto-Indo-Europeans as it is very common around the Black Sea where the Indo-Euorpeans are supposed to have originated, as well as in the Caucuses. T is also linked to haplogroup J, Jasmine whose genes spread with agriculture. The most interesting daughter of the book for me is of course Jasmine who I have mentioned several times already. This is the ancestor associated with the spread agriculture throughout Europe. With this came lactose tolerance which is prevalent among Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Central Asia but not with East Asians or Africans. Its interesting that northern India, where the ""Aryan invasion"" or diffusion from which the Aryan (meaning noble in Sanskrit) language and religion is supposed to have spread from 4,000 years ago, is far more lactose tolerant than southern India. This Jasmine may be the ancestor for whom the Indo-European languages shared by almost all Europeans with ancient Sanskrit was spread by, the Aryans. ""The Indo-element in Indo-European is there because there is a strong connection, again visible only to linguists, between the European languages and Sanskrit. This link was discovered by William Jones in 1786 while he was working as a judge for the British Raj. It was an amazing piece of amateur scholarship; indeed, Jones invented the concept of language families that is still a feature of comparative linguistics today. The essential idea of a language family is that all the different languages within it have evolved from a common root, almost certainly a language that is now extinct. This raises the question of where the original Indo-European language was spoken and importantly, how it spread out from there. Renfrew deduced that the original Indo-European language was spoken in Anatolia in central Turkey, and was then spread to Europe by the first farmers. A massive replacement of the hunter-gatherers by the the agricultural ""wave of advance"""" So 80% of modern European DNA can be traced back to the ice age, and the remaining 10-20% can be traced to the Near East/Central Asia, other Caucasoids. This group seems to be the unifier of European and maybe Caucasian people, providing agriculture and possibly languages and at least one source of light skin. (Back to MacDonald's thesis of lower ethnocentrism for Europeans relative to those of the Middle East: it is this 80% of DNA from the last ice age going back 40,000 years which is responsible for the difference. The later 20% is a later addition which coincides with agriculture. Groups in the Middle East had pastoralism as a way of life and developed it in competition with other groups. Europeans would have spent most of their evolutionary history on the continent as hunter gatherers, rather than as pastoralists. Being a pastoralist meant having to protect herds from other groups, which would explain higher ethnocentrism. Such resources would be kept within the family, consanguinity, endogamy, the extended family, and also enable polygamy which would altogether make individuals in the group more related. European people would have a lifestyle more dependent on the environment, with a basic division of labor between men and women who would both cooperate as their respective roles hunting and gathering. The changing climate and migration of game would be the challenges to overcome. Monogamy, exogamy, and more of a simple nuclear household would be the norm which mean less genetic relatedness and less ethnocentrism. The Indo-Europeans are the ones who brought pastoralism to Europeans evolved evolved for the environment of the central Asian steppe. Their own kinship and property systems would be transplanted over the hunter gatherers and their evolutionary heritage.)"
269,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15649779-orville-jenkins,5,"Bryan Sykes is one of the world's leading genetic anthropologists, working with DNA identification and comparison to understand the biological history of the human race. He has been part of a growing worldwide coordinated effort in DNA gathering and comparison, and worked with various other specialists to reconstruct the migration and cultural portraits of humans.Since 2000, our understanding has accelerated and skyrocketed into a burgeoning, exciting body of knowledge about human prehistory and the genetic character of modern populations. Sykes is a skilled storyteller and analyst, resulting in a well-crafted true tale of who we are and how we got to where we are in the world today, and how the innermost being of our every individual cell carries the story in our genes!The ongoing DNA comparisons all over the world began to fill out a picture of the kinship of all modern humans and their migrations all over the world. In 2001, Brian Sykes reported on his DNA studies in Europe and the Polynesian Islands and related, with careful comparisons to the studies by others on Hawaii and the Americas.In reporting his comprehensive and extensive DNA reconstruction for the people of Europe, Sykes detailed his DNA findings and presented a delightful historical and cultural history of Europe comparing the DNA reconstruction for Europe with related findings from Archaeology, paleoanthropology, and especially the lifestyle of each era. Important for this was the movement of agriculture across the world and its arrival in Europe.As his comparisons for Europe progressed, collecting or comparing samples from all over the UK locales, Sykes actually found a modern Irish woman who had the exact same mtDNA sequence as Ötzi, the 5000-year-old Alps Ice Man. The Ice man, found in 1991, was a mummified man found in a melting Alps glacier. This ancient European had been preserved by a glacial freeze and was determined to be 5200 or 5300 years old, determined by DNA study of grains in his leather bag carrying his tools and other paraphernalia.Similar information from pollen found in or on Ötzi providing additional insights into Ötzi's historical period. The viable DNA recovered from the Ice Man, with related findings from various disciplines of study and investigation reconstructed Ötzi's diet and likely family history. These insights into Ötzi's life and times shed additional light on Sykes' study of the origins and migrations of the streams of indigenous settlement and the much later movement of agriculture into Europe.The exciting upshot of this particular part of Sykes' study and reconstruction was the discovery of a modern current Irish woman with the same exact mitochondrial DNA sequence as the Ice Man!After analyzing the DNA patterns of thousands of subjects all across Europe, Sykes realized they all fell into a pattern of 7 groups, thus deriving from only 7 ancestral women for about 95% of the population of current Europe. These he dubs the Seven Daughters of Eve. After recounting the saga of the investigations, the puzzles, the disappointments and the breakthroughs that finally led to the final schema explaining the genetic relationship of thousand so Europeans, Sykes rounds out the story by providing a fictionalized account of the life of these seven women and their families.Sykes constructs his portraits by weaving in the knowledge from multiple disciplines like archaeology, geology, animal and plant DNA comparisons, and the toolsets associated with various eras of prehistory and history, including the advent of agriculture and its move into Europe. He outlines the movement of the human race across the world millennia by millennia to people all the continents.You will find this a fascinating novelesque saga that is our story, the human story, with particular attention to how all these factors came together in the population of the continent of Europe."

271,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9373725-karin,5,"I loved reading this book. Fascinating and written with humour and not too much jargon. Bryan Sykers does a brilliant job of bringing to life the thousands of ancestors that stand behind us and build up a picture of who we are. Favourite chaper is A sense of self. ""DNA is the messanger which illuminates that connection, handed down from generation to generation, carried, literally, in the bodies of our ancestors. Each message traces a journey through time and space, a journey made by the long lines that spring from the ancestral mothers. We will never know all the details of these journeys over thousands of years and thousands of miles, but we can at least imagine them. I am on a stage. Before me, in the dim light, all the people who have ever lived are lined up, rank upon rank, stretching far into the distance. They make no sound that I can hear, but they are talking to each other. I have in my hand the end of the thread which connects me to my ancestral mother way at the back. I pull on the thread and one womans face in every generation, feeling the tug, looks up at me. Their faces stand out from the crowd and they are illuminated by a strange light. These are my ancestors.""I have done my DNA and ancestry testing with 23andme and discovered my maternal haplogrouping to be H1c, H is 20,000 years old. Reading this book has helped me to understand and think deeply of my roots.A very worthwhile read."

Those who are curious about, how science works, how human evolution could have progressed and how majority of humans can be linked to seven women, this book is a must read. The begining is a bit slow and for non-science people can be a bit boring but once that part is finished you can't keep the book down until you finish it. Brilliant book!😊"
273,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51196399-gary,5,"I found this book compelling, fascinating, an enjoyable read and an education in itself. What is wonderful about this book is that Bryan Sykes explains and teaches us about DNA and his own research and conclusions into mitochondria and the origins of humankind and it's ancestry through DNA research in way those of us without science degrees can understand.  It is a narrative of our common heritage and our shared forebears. The author explains to us in a way that is easy to understand what is DNA and what it is does. How we can trace common ancestry to people in other parts of the world, and his theory that all indigenous Europeans are descended from seven common female ancestors who he refers to as 'the seven daughters of Eve'  His research gives us much genuine food for though, he remarks how in centuries past , how many women who were made to suffer for not producing male heirs would have loved to know that the truth is only the male sperm cells that determine whether the child conceived will be a male or female. It is the Y chromosome that makes a child a male, without which the child will be a female.  He draws us to the interesting fact that one in every 20 000 female children have a Y chromosome, and these girls look normal and have normal intelligence, though the tend to be a little taller than average. but when they reach puberty their uterus and ovaries do not develop properly and they do not produce children.  Sykes uses mitochondrial DNA evidence from the remains of the Romanov Russian imperial family to cast serious doubt on the theory that when Tsar Nicholas II and his family were murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, one or two of his daughters survived. According to Sykes DNA proves all of the Tsar's children were murdered.  He also proves that almost of Native Europeans are descended from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers who were in Europe 50 000 years ago and not as some theorists have told us from Neolithic farmers who migrated to Europe some 10 000 years ago, and diluted the European gene pool-they did not.  The last part of the books gives seven semi-fictional stories of the seven matriarchal ancestress of modern indigenous Europeans. These were real people with almost identical DNA to their modern descendants but living in very different circumstances to them. Ursula , Xenia , Helena, Velda, Tara, Katrine and Jasmine. I would also recommend the work by Rabbi Yaakov Kleinman 'Tradition and DNA' which traces the ancestry of modern day Jews to ancient Israel."
274,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2560917-kara,3,"The first three quarters of this book were packed full of genetics, human biology, anthropology, and even a little archeology and geography. If you ask me (and I guess you are), that is way too much scientific -ology. Unless you really like that stuff. I've heard there are people that do.Anyway, I liked the book because I appreciated the authors humor and I found the whole idea of tracing our genealogy back so far extremely interesting. I especially liked his analogy of all of his ancestors holding onto a thread.I did have a couple problems - first, was the time line. I have been informed that there is no way that even Adam and Eve lived as long ago as Bryan Sykes is saying these people were living, so that throws a big wrench in this for me. I am very uncomfortable with science and the the bible not meshing. I can't help but think we must be missing something and that if we would just do it right science would support the bible. But people, he has DNA! However, despite the DNA for the record and for all heaven to hear - I will take the side of the Bible. Big can of worms though. Very big. I will just pretend in my own little dillusional world that all of his science is correct but the timing is wrong and my Grandma is a direct maternal descendent of Tara, darn it! (Ooops! Can we say the d word on this site?)My second problem was with the last quarter of the book where Bryan introduced us to his own dillusional world. It was very odd and a bit disconcerting to go from all of that scientfic jargon to fiction. It didn't even really seem like fiction. It was kind of weird. I think that the idea behind it was interesting and would have been useful if he had described what we know to be true about those times through all the stupid -ologies in a different way and left what he imagined out. Although, I did get a kick out of him describing Tara as a woman with straight brown hair and blue eyes that loved the ocean. I could be Tara reincarnated! Just kidding. That would be another can of worms."
275,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29160274-czarny-pies,3,"This book by the great pioneer of genetic archaeology and Oxford professor is at times rather dreadful. Many readers have been appalled by the fictional biographies of the individual women at the origin of the seven ""maternal"" clans to which 95% of Europe's population belonged at the end of the 20th century. I can hardly disagree. Syke's story of his research and his elucidation of the basics of mitochondrial DNA basis make for fascinating reading. Syke's yarn-spinning is as tedious as it is uninformative. Syke's greatest sin in my view is his public gloating over his academic rivals that he bested in his long and distinguished career. Nonetheless his venom and spite may be the most entertaining part of this book.Syke's big point is that he believes he demonstrated that 75% of the current European gene pool dates from the paleolithic era (1.8 million years ago to 10,000) AD. This would suggest that the diffusion of technology, the introduction of new agriculture methods and the changes in the linguistic profile of the Europe over the last 12,000 years were not the result of population movements. Rather the various peoples of Europe either invented new techniques on their own or simply adopted them as they became aware of them. This is a very major point as it had long assumed that the innovations had arrived with migrations of peoples.Sykes simply allows his major thesis to get submerged in a great deal of anecdotes and somewhat pointless fictionalizing. Nonetheless this book still merits being read as it provides considerable insight into genetic archaeology which is now yielding very interesting results from the four corners of the world. However, the reader should first read Sykes ""Blood of the Isles"" which is vastly superior in every way."
276,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1738417-ronda,3,"Interesting and thought-provoking read, but there were a few things that I found distracting. Early on, Sykes mentions some tension between himself and one of his co-workers. Later, he addresses events around this same person, who is involved in research and a paper that has devastating potential toward the research on mitochondrial DNA. Sykes' description of the events and final outcome come off as a ""nyah nyah"" thumbing of his nose at this person and ended up making me feel less sympathetic to him and his efforts--regardless of the truth or non-truth of his interpretation of the events. His handling of this could easily have been handled differently, to the benefit of the story he is presenting. The other distraction was the rather abrupt launch into the stories of the seven daughters' lives. I enjoyed his interpretations of their lives, but would have appreciated more of a lead-in of some sort to explain how he came up with these stories. Now, complaints aside, I found this book to be thought-provoking on many levels. It reinforced for me the idea that each new 'discovery' opens so many more paths to be explored and that those lead to yet others perhaps not yet dreamt of. It also helped me put some science behind my own personal musings about similarities in appearance between people who are, ostensibly, not related--either genealogically or biologically--combinations of nose shapes, hair colors/textures, body builds. The book was easy to read (which I mention b/c I had feared that it would not be lay-person friendly) and, ultimately, I was glad that I finally took the plunge and read it. "
277,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45388112-andrew,4,"This was a really fascinating read. I knew only a very little bit about genetics and ancient human history going in, but Sykes writes in a way that feels entry-level understandable AND useful. In other words, I didn't feel like I was being talked down to but I did feel like I understood all of the important mechanisms described in the book. This is much easier said than done, I'm sure.The book is about the way a particular kind of DNA is used to trace the maternal lineage of people over the course of many thousands of years. Incredibly, this enables us to approximate seven women in ancient history whose descendants make up every single modern human of European descent. In so doing, we can understand with some measure of accuracy where each of our ancestors lived, what groups they may have belonged to, the path humanity took as it traveled out of Africa and populated the world, etc. Besides being an actual ground-breaking scientist, Sykes has a real talent for storytelling. For much of the book it's the sort of story he might tell over drinks to his friends, about a funny thing that happened between himself and a professional rival, about an exciting new discovery a peer made, about the modern implications of his work. He draws connections that are genuinely thrilling: what it means to have a scientific ancestry that depends entirely on women, not the manual ones drawn up by and for men. A history that cannot be erased by oppressors and those who would destroy someone's culture. He is able to put across the excitement he surely must have felt first-hand while making these connections and discoveries."
278,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"Sykes traces the history of most Europeans back to 7 women through an examination of mitochondrial DNA. I love the science behind this book. An examination of the DNA shows how very related most people are. Would love to see this done for places like India where caste differences make people treat each other badly. Wouldn't it also be cool to take it even further and relate the Europeans back to say the Africans and show how related blacks and whites might be. Sykes shows how he may be related to the last Tsar through his mitochondrial DNA. I did not give this book 5 stars because much of the book is not about the 7 women but rather about the science and Sykes' quest. The chapters about the 7 women are in some ways the least interesting as they are mainly conjecture about the kind of world they may have lived in and Sykes is not good at fiction as the women don't really come alive in these chapters. However, his scientific journey is extremely interesting and intriguing. There are times when personality clashes take up room and still seem to rankle to Sykes but I suppose that's his writing style. He is not as smooth or accomplished a pop science book as say Bryson but I'm glad he wrote this book for mass consumption because this story (about mitochondrial DNA and what it can tell us) certainly needed telling."
279,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/725357-nate,4,"Although this book was written in 2001, it is still a useful introduction to the study of human genetic ancestry for the layperson like me. Sykes is unique for having been at the forefront of major discoveries in genetics, such as sequencing the Iceman (Otzi)'s genome and finding modern descendants, helping to identify the bodies of most of the members of the massacred Russian royal family, and tracing 95% of Europeans' female ancestors to just seven women who lived between 45,000 and 10,000 years ago. Sykes' writing style is engaging, especially considering his background as a scientific researcher. I would wonder if it was ghost-written, except for his background in journalism. Most of the book is not about the ""Seven Daughters of Eve""; however, the background information is just as interesting. It takes a good portion of the book to build up to the fictionalized vignettes of these women at the end. Although the stories seem contrived, they do humanize these women and offer insight into the everyday challenges for people in prehistoric Europe, especially during the last ice ages. I wonder if one of my mitochondrial ancestors was one of these women. There's a 95% chance that this is the case. "

Are the skeletons found at Iekaterinburg the ones of the Romanov family? Is Neanderthal really extincted or, does he have any descendants? What about the Europeans? Do they have Croc-Magnon for ancestor or, farmers coming from the Middle-East? Bryan Sykes tells us the discoveries made by genetics thanks to mitochondrial DNA, a bacteria passing from generation to generation through the maternal line only.Enthusiast, he is like a kid in a sweetshop. His writing style for instance reflects very well his fascination and excitement -it is actually so accessible that, we sometimes have the feeling of reading a novel! This will be a bit puzzling to whose used to science books but, the others will thus find him easier to understand.I just think the last chapters (the reconstitutions of the seven Eves' lives) are completely useless. I understand they are a very easy way of describing nomadic life, the birth of agriculture, the first villages and so on but, are such fictions not ridiculous in a non-fiction book? Why not using an Appendix? Well, as it is targeted for a very wide audience...Still a good read."
281,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1502451-angiea,5,"This is the book that started a love affair with DNA! I've now read several books on tracing human orgins through DNA, but this was the first one and it's the one that really got me to thinking about who these women really were. I really had to stretch my mind back and realize that one of the seven daughters is my ancestor! It rekindled my desire to do genealogical/family history research, especially on my mother's side back through all the women. It's difficult, because women's identities become subsumed in with their husbands. The maiden names become difficult to track. I have moved my search to Belgium and found my great grandmother's parents. Of my four lines, this is the first to go back to Europe as they were the most recent immigrants to the States. The writing is clear and interesting and Sykes gets you so interested, you find yourself with a pencil in your hand to be sure to mark the really good stuff. I made a multiribbon book mark to place the passages that really intrigued me. "
282,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2684619-reiden,4,"I heard about this book in a geography class I took a few years ago, and I thought it did a good job explaining how matrilineal lineages can be traced using mitochondrial DNA. I do agree with several of the other reviews which state that there was a little too much of the book spent on European decent and the fictional narratives of the Seven Daughters, but other than that it was a great book. As much as I wanted to get back to the science of the genetic testing described in the first half of the book, the narrative in the second half did provide a glimpse into the lives of people who we will probably never hear much about without the use of some imagination combined with the knowledge based on the limited supply of archeological and genetic evidence that we have from our distant ancestors. I can only hope that as more light is shed on this area of science, humans will begin to realize the deeper connection that we all have to one another via our common ancestors. "
283,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/200881-william-ramsay,3,"This is a very interesting book that does damage to any lingering ideas of racial superiority. By genetic testing of thousands of people, Sykes has show that everyone of European extraction can trace his or her ancestry to just seven women who lived between 10 and 45 thousand years ago. Not only that, but DNA testing and archeology have shown that we are all Africans at the core. All I could think of while reading this is that so much blood has been spilled because one man thinks he's superior to another when there is no scientific basis for it at all. I think the book slowed a bit in the middle and his description of the lives of the seven women are the root of our ancestry was a bit speculative for a scientific work. But I enjoyed reading it. The actual science of DNA is unbelievably fascinating. "
284,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12609637-s,1,"Hmm The first part of the book is OK. However, the third part really lets it down. While there is absolutely no doubt that people's mtDNA can be traced back to one of several haplotypes, there is debate of how many unique haplotypes there are. Why should a descendent become a new haplotype and another not? Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to believe that haplotype and fictional lifestyle in the past has any effect on anyone's current personality or lifestyle proclivities. I would definitely not pay to test my DNA for a just-so story as this.I worked in the same Dept as the author for a few years and found the business he set up around testing people's mtDNA and then presenting them with a preprinted certificate about their clan ancestry close to charlatanry. "
285,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"I enjoyed this look into the evidence of mitochondrial DNA. The first 2/3's concentrates on the discovery that mitochondrial DNA can be used to look at family trees into the far past and the establishment of the science behind the theory. The author has an ""everyday"" voice that is easy to follow and understand.The last third of the book gives each ""daughter"" a chapter and gives a romanticized account of their life. The topography, animals, living conditions, tools, etc. that is described in these chapters are historically correct but, of course, the actual women's lives aren't. It's a fun way to end the book.I found this to be a very interesting book. "

When did the native Australians arrive). It answered questions I didn't even know enough about the subject to have before (What is the difference between a Paleolithic modern human and a Neanderthal). I learned a lot about genetics and how they can answer those questions. Plus, he's a great storyteller. It was fascinating to read the narratives he wrote about the lives of the Seven Eves.I wasn't really hooked until Chapter 6, though I was interested enough to keep reading until there. But after that I didn't want to put it down."

I think the writing in the first parts is excellent, with care being taken to make complicated genetic science accessible to people without a science background. It's interesting, compelling, and thought provoking.But then, and I can't be the only one to think this, when he starts describing the lives of the seven daughters, it gets weird.

298,0393020185,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15604468-nick,4,"I heard about Sykes' book in a footnote to Kevin MacDonald's Culture of Critique: ""Current data indicate that around 80% of European genes are derived from people who settled in Europe 30–40,000 years ago and therefore persisted through the Ice Ages (Sykes 2001). This is sufficient time for the adverse ecology of the north to have had a powerful shaping influence on European psychological and cultural tendencies."" MacDonald was making the argument that north-west European people have uniquely low ethnocentrism due to environmental challenges being the most important factor in evolving group strategies as opposed to competition with other groups, which MacDonald holds creates more ethnocentric cultures, such as in the Middle East. To be clear, Sykes' book is a book of popular science and isn't political, that's just what motivated me to read it. Sykes' work is a genetic history of modern Europeans traced back to seven mothers 40-10,000 years ago, from the last ice age to the arrival of agriculture. The method Sykes presents is mitochondrial DNA traced through the mother. Mitochondrial DNA exists outside of the cell nucleus and so doesn't go through the same recombination mutations like sexual gametes and so changes much slower, allowing us to measure the time between individual mutations to locate the difference from an ancestor without the mutation. For this mtDNA to be traced, a mother has to have more than one child so her genes will be shared by future generations. Because these genes are traced through one parent, the genetic lineages are called haplogroups as opposed to diplogroups. A single mutation occurs about every 10,000 years, and so these mutations are a measure for how many years separate genetic lines. The story goes that the Homo sapiens left Africa 100-70,000 years ago probably via the Arabian peninsula to spread to Eurasia and Oceania and eventually the Americas. Some earlier went along the coast of Southeast Asia all the way to Australia 50,000 years ago. Later on Homo sapiens arrived in Europe through Central Asia and split off genetically with mongoloids 30-40,000 years ago. There were other hominids in Eurasia long before Homo sapiens however; Neanderthals in Europe and Homo Erectus in Asia. The first Europeans are called Cro-Magnons who are known to us through their famous cave art. Eventually the Neanderthals died out around 30,000 years ago. The popular argument goes that Neanderthals weren't as creative as Homo sapiens despite having large brains (and bodies) who could create and pass on their knowledge. The Cro-Magnons also had large brains, larger than Europeans today which shows up the cave art they have left. Now these Cro-Magnons don't look exactly like Europeans today. They originally had darker skin. The genes for lighter skin became prevalent relatively recently in evolutionary history, in both the near east and the reaches of Northern Europe. It is to thought that light skin began evolving after 40,000 years ago to synthesize more vitamin D given less sun. What is interesting is that current Scandinavians are the most related to the early Europeans, and so it could have been that the earliest Europeans had darker skin, while Scandanavians and Siberians having light skin and colored eyes. So it seems modern European traits are the product of two general groups: the hunter-gatherers migrated from Africa 40,000 years ago who had darker skin and perhaps colored eyes who remained on the continent, Nordic and Siberians who had light skin and colored eyes. ""All modern Europeans must today trace their ancestry back to much more recent arrivals- to the Cro-Magnons, with their lighter skeleton, their much improved flint technology and their wonderful art. This was an absolute replacement of one human species by another...It is clear from the fossil record that the Neanderthals hung on for at least fifteen thousand years after the first Cro-Magnons reached Western Europe some forty to fifty thousand years ago. When the last Neanderthal expired-probably in southern Spain, where the most recent skeletons have been found-his or her death drew a line under another phase in the human occupation of Europe. An era that lasted for a quarter of a million years ended, finally and irreversibly, in a cave in southern Spain about twenty-eight thousand years ago.""Sykes does not think that Homo sapiens in Eurasia interbred with other hominids. This is the multi-regional hypothesis which doesn't necessarily mean that humans evolved independently on several continents, but after leaving Africa evolved for different environments interbreeding both with other Homo sapiens as well as hominids, Neanderthals in Europe and H Erectus in Asia. This means that humans evolved on different continents, rather than all in Africa and then leaving to the rest of the world recently. Put simply, gene flow between geographically separated populations prevented greater speciation but also meant regional variation and interbreeding with other hominids outside Africa. ""When the last Neanderthal died, twenty eight thousand years ago, there was only one human species left to rule the planet. Ours.""Since Sykes' book, the Neanderthal Genome has been sequenced in 2010, and it turns out that Europeans and Asians do share at least 1-5%. This 1-5% is supposedly total shared DNA unique to Neanderthals, and given that we are 99% similar to chimpanzees genetically, this is actually a lot and could upend the entire out of Africa hypothesis Whatever interbreeding probably began soon after leaving Africa in the Middle East. These genes do matter; they affect circadian rhythm, mood, and the immune system, adapted for the ice age environment. So the multi-regional hypothesis has something to it. Now, the seven clans which altogether 95% of current European DNA can be traced back to. * Ursula: corresponds to Haplogroup U which comprised the DNA of 11% of Europeans direct descendants. 45,000 years ago. * Xenia corresponds to Haplogroup X 25,000 years ago. 6% of current European population, 1% of native Americans * Helena corresponds to Haplogroup H 20,000 years ago. Most successful clan, all over Europe, 47% of European DNA. * Velda corresponds to Haplogroup V. 17,000 years ago. 5% of Europeans * Tara corresponds to Haplogroup T. 17,000 years ago. 9% * Katrine corresponds to Haplogroup K. 15,000 years ago, 6%* Jasmine. corresponds to Haplogroup J 17% 10,000 years ago. Haplogroup U which is the earliest haplogroup for Europeans is shared by 15% of caste Indian DNA and 8% of tribal Indians. U is supposed to have been the dominant mtDNA until the spread of agriculture and the presence of Indo-Europeans. The two dominant language groups in India are Aryan and Dravidian which are respectively associated with the north and the south. So India's population two is likely the source of two general migrations; one earlier from Africa or possibly Asia into southern India and a later migration(s) of caucasians. It turns out that native Americans have more European DNA than was thought, both haplogroup x and haplogroup u which amounts to at least a third of DNA shared with Europeans. Amerindians it turns out are both caucasoid and mongoloid, which explains the European head shape of Kennewick man. There is also the hypothesis that European Cro-Magnons, called the Solutrean culture, migrated to North America first before the American Indians from Europe during the ice age. The evidence is two things: the similarity of stone tools in Solutrean Europe and the North American Clovis culture and haplogroup x. Haplogroup x it turns out is highest in Anatolia near the Caucuses and in north North America. This is a heterodox position, but does connect with one of the seven daughters of Eve. Tara, Haplogroup T, is shared by many prominent European nobles, including Nicholas II the last Tsar of Russia. Tara may be the ancestor of the proto-Indo-Europeans as it is very common around the Black Sea where the Indo-Euorpeans are supposed to have originated, as well as in the Caucuses. T is also linked to haplogroup J, Jasmine whose genes spread with agriculture. The most interesting daughter of the book for me is of course Jasmine who I have mentioned several times already. This is the ancestor associated with the spread agriculture throughout Europe. With this came lactose tolerance which is prevalent among Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Central Asia but not with East Asians or Africans. Its interesting that northern India, where the ""Aryan invasion"" or diffusion from which the Aryan (meaning noble in Sanskrit) language and religion is supposed to have spread from 4,000 years ago, is far more lactose tolerant than southern India. This Jasmine may be the ancestor for whom the Indo-European languages shared by almost all Europeans with ancient Sanskrit was spread by, the Aryans. ""The Indo-element in Indo-European is there because there is a strong connection, again visible only to linguists, between the European languages and Sanskrit. This link was discovered by William Jones in 1786 while he was working as a judge for the British Raj. It was an amazing piece of amateur scholarship; indeed, Jones invented the concept of language families that is still a feature of comparative linguistics today. The essential idea of a language family is that all the different languages within it have evolved from a common root, almost certainly a language that is now extinct. This raises the question of where the original Indo-European language was spoken and importantly, how it spread out from there. Renfrew deduced that the original Indo-European language was spoken in Anatolia in central Turkey, and was then spread to Europe by the first farmers. A massive replacement of the hunter-gatherers by the the agricultural ""wave of advance"""" So 80% of modern European DNA can be traced back to the ice age, and the remaining 10-20% can be traced to the Near East/Central Asia, other Caucasoids. This group seems to be the unifier of European and maybe Caucasian people, providing agriculture and possibly languages and at least one source of light skin. (Back to MacDonald's thesis of lower ethnocentrism for Europeans relative to those of the Middle East: it is this 80% of DNA from the last ice age going back 40,000 years which is responsible for the difference. The later 20% is a later addition which coincides with agriculture. Groups in the Middle East had pastoralism as a way of life and developed it in competition with other groups. Europeans would have spent most of their evolutionary history on the continent as hunter gatherers, rather than as pastoralists. Being a pastoralist meant having to protect herds from other groups, which would explain higher ethnocentrism. Such resources would be kept within the family, consanguinity, endogamy, the extended family, and also enable polygamy which would altogether make individuals in the group more related. European people would have a lifestyle more dependent on the environment, with a basic division of labor between men and women who would both cooperate as their respective roles hunting and gathering. The changing climate and migration of game would be the challenges to overcome. Monogamy, exogamy, and more of a simple nuclear household would be the norm which mean less genetic relatedness and less ethnocentrism. The Indo-Europeans are the ones who brought pastoralism to Europeans evolved evolved for the environment of the central Asian steppe. Their own kinship and property systems would be transplanted over the hunter gatherers and their evolutionary heritage.)"

He has been part of a growing worldwide coordinated effort in DNA gathering and comparison, and worked with various other specialists to reconstruct the migration and cultural portraits of humans.Since 2000, our understanding has accelerated and skyrocketed into a burgeoning, exciting body of knowledge about human prehistory and the genetic character of modern populations. Sykes is a skilled storyteller and analyst, resulting in a well-crafted true tale of who we are and how we got to where we are in the world today, and how the innermost being of our every individual cell carries the story in our genes!The ongoing DNA comparisons all over the world began to fill out a picture of the kinship of all modern humans and their migrations all over the world. In 2001, Brian Sykes reported on his DNA studies in Europe and the Polynesian Islands and related, with careful comparisons to the studies by others on Hawaii and the Americas.In reporting his comprehensive and extensive DNA reconstruction for the people of Europe, Sykes detailed his DNA findings and presented a delightful historical and cultural history of Europe comparing the DNA reconstruction for Europe with related findings from Archaeology, paleoanthropology, and especially the lifestyle of each era. Important for this was the movement of agriculture across the world and its arrival in Europe.As his comparisons for Europe progressed, collecting or comparing samples from all over the UK locales, Sykes actually found a modern Irish woman who had the exact same mtDNA sequence as Ötzi, the 5000-year-old Alps Ice Man. The Ice man, found in 1991, was a mummified man found in a melting Alps glacier. This ancient European had been preserved by a glacial freeze and was determined to be 5200 or 5300 years old, determined by DNA study of grains in his leather bag carrying his tools and other paraphernalia.Similar information from pollen found in or on Ötzi providing additional insights into Ötzi's historical period. The viable DNA recovered from the Ice Man, with related findings from various disciplines of study and investigation reconstructed Ötzi's diet and likely family history. These insights into Ötzi's life and times shed additional light on Sykes' study of the origins and migrations of the streams of indigenous settlement and the much later movement of agriculture into Europe.The exciting upshot of this particular part of Sykes' study and reconstruction was the discovery of a modern current Irish woman with the same exact mitochondrial DNA sequence as the Ice Man!After analyzing the DNA patterns of thousands of subjects all across Europe, Sykes realized they all fell into a pattern of 7 groups, thus deriving from only 7 ancestral women for about 95% of the population of current Europe. These he dubs the Seven Daughters of Eve. After recounting the saga of the investigations, the puzzles, the disappointments and the breakthroughs that finally led to the final schema explaining the genetic relationship of thousand so Europeans, Sykes rounds out the story by providing a fictionalized account of the life of these seven women and their families.Sykes constructs his portraits by weaving in the knowledge from multiple disciplines like archaeology, geology, animal and plant DNA comparisons, and the toolsets associated with various eras of prehistory and history, including the advent of agriculture and its move into Europe. He outlines the movement of the human race across the world millennia by millennia to people all the continents.You will find this a fascinating novelesque saga that is our story, the human story, with particular attention to how all these factors came together in the population of the continent of Europe."
