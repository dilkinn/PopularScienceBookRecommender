There are definitely interesting aspects of the body, but I'm more of a ""fun fact here, quirky tidbit there"" kinda person. I wasn't sure I wanted to read a whole book full of words I can't pronounce. But, no, Bill Bryson really can make anything interesting.His usual charismatic, undemanding style is all over this book. He begins with the head and takes us all the way through the physiology of the human body. The organs, systems, various proteins and bacterium that I will never remember the name of. What really makes this interesting is that he links each part of the body in with the history of medicine and diseases relating to that part. He pulls out little anecdotes that shocked me, infuriated me, and often made me laugh. Bryson knows he isn't writing a book for medical professionals here. There's a certain amount of depth in some chapters, but it feels like a lot is probably skimmed over so us laymen can wrap our heads around the information. And, frankly, it wouldn't be nearly as readable if that wasn't the case.My one big takeaway from The Body is that we know almost nothing about the body. We know so much more than we did a hundred years ago, and yet we still know almost nothing. I swear that about ten times in every chapter, there's a comment like ""these cells do this, but nobody knows why"" or ""women are 10x more likely to get this disease than men, but why is anybody's guess"". I mean, we spend a third of our lives asleep and no one even knows why we do that.I like how Bryson looks at health and disease across the world and not just in the United States and Europe. Though the U.S. comes out of this looking even worse than I would have anticipated. Despite spending more on healthcare per person than any other country, U.S. citizens die younger and have higher rates of chronic disease, depression, drug abuse, homicide, and HIV than almost all (if not all) developed nations. There are a number of theories why, though no one knows for sure.If you like Bryson's previous books, you should like this one. It's pop science, and more fun than it is ground-breaking, but as long as you're not planning to use it as your handbook for experimental surgery, then I see nothing wrong with that.Facebook | Instagram"

2,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3268839-theresa-alan,5,"I learned so much from this book. One of the things I learned was that continuing to learn and keeping my brain active will help me avoid dementia, so you should read this book, too. I highlighted many, many pages, so I’ll just offer a few highlights here. The most interesting thing was reading about our skin, the tiny tiny layer that we makes us white or black or brown. Bryson watched a surgeon incise and peel back a sliver of skin a millimeter thick from the arm of cadaver. It was so thin it was translucent. That’s what race is. Which is why it’s so ridiculous that such a small facet of our composition should be given so much importance when it’s merely a reaction to sunlight. “Biologically, there is no such thing as race—nothing in terms of skin color, facial features, hair type, bone structure, or anything else that is a defining quality among peoples.”Skin gets its color from a variety of pigments, the best known is a molecule we know as melanin. It’s also responsible for the color of birds’ feathers and gives fish the texture and luminescence of the their scales. Our skin evolved based on our geography. A lot of myths I grew up with are not true. Like the fact we only use ten percent of our brain--false. I was taught as a kid that different parts of the tongue were attuned to different tastes like salty, sweet, sour. Nope. Also, like the movie the Matrix, apparently when I eat a brownie straight from the oven, it doesn’t actually taste good, my brain just reads these scentless, flavorless molecules and makes me think they’re pleasurable. In one of the studies he talks about, a man was given an injection of a harmless liquid to mimic snot. It couldn’t be seen by the naked eye, but under those blue lights detectives use. The test subject went into a room with other folks, and when they turned the overhead lights off and the blue lights on, every single person, doorknob, and bowl of nuts had the pretend snot on it, which is how the common cold passes from person to person so easily—through touch, apparently not by making out with someone (although presumably at some point you might touch that person). Antibiotics•	Almost 3/4ths of prescriptions written each year are for conditions that can’t be cured with antibiotics (like bronchitis) •	80 percent of antibiotics are fed to farm animals to fatten them up which meat eaters then consume, which is one of the reasons antibiotics aren’t as effective as they used to be.•	Fruit growers use antibiotics to combat bacterial infections in their crops, sometimes even of produce marked “organic.” Which means we humans are unwittingly eating antibiotics, rendering them ineffective when we need them for a real disease/infection.There’s a lot more interesting stuff in here. Thanks so much to NetGalley for the opportunity to read this book, which RELEASES OCTOBER 15, 2019."
3,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,4,"The definition of a “well” person?Someone who hasn’t been examined yet(loosely quoted from the book)This book is two things:-	Really interesting trivia about the human body-	TerrifyingI love trivia, and this book had tons of it. This was not a deeply scientific analysis of the human body. It is just snippets and brief anecdotes from various regions of the body as Bryson takes you on a journey through our innerspace. If you are not into big fancy words and meandering analysis, then you need not worry! There may be a time or two that he throws some deeper tidbits in, but it always moves on quickly. A good balance to keep both a med student and the layman interested (just guessing on the med student side as I am most certainly the layman!)So – yay, trivia!However, I will have to say, more often than not, the book journeys off in the direction of what can go wrong with the body. This is not surprising as a lot can go wrong with the body. However, it is not a book to read while eating, if you have hypochondria, if you have germ phobia, if the word “parasite” gives you heebie-jeebies, etc. While it may all be true, perhaps somethings are better off left unknown!With these two things in mind, proceed at your own risk! If you love trivia and don’t mind dumbed down science, this should be perfect for you. If you are a doctor, it may be too simple of an explanation to satisfy – or, maybe not??? If you are easily queasy when it comes to blood, vomit, and other bodily fluids and functions, I would suggest passing on this one.But, when all is said and done, another decent book from Bryson!"

From up to down, inside to outside, young to old, organ to nerve and so on goes the journey trough our miraculous wonder of nature whose amazing eyes are just sending this information to the brain of the reader.Many myths about the body are shown and design flaws described, but after billion years of evolution, that´s no wonder. We deliberately build in design flaws in everything we create and call it planned obsolescence and what is an appendix or other useless extra bonus parts compared to that.We really don´t understand anything in detail as shown in many great examples and the cool thing is that we once again stand in front of an ocean of lack of knowledge with that stereotypical hand full of sand and much that we believe to know about our body today might turn out to be completely different or even wrong. Especially because of the tininess we still have to explore and to discover areas of nano and quanta. Take physics, we don´t know anything, so what could this say about a system as complex as the human body in a world we hardly understand? Photosynthesis in plants seems to do it´s work with something creepy that just can be explained with some kind of not understood quanta phenomena teleportation stuff and, in some rare cases, we are more complex than vegetables.The most interesting implication of hidden dept comes for the mind, brain, conscience and ego. When over 1 billion copies of this book could be stored in an area of the cerebral cortex the size of a grain of sand, there is pretty much space for unknown programs running in the background, possibly with programming and instructions from wherever and whomever.Because we don´t understand, we should treat the body as good as possible with a diet of things and thoughts of which we know that they are not harmfulLike all of Bryson´s books, it an entertaining and great read, integrating history, medical science and vivid examples that stay in mind and easily find a way to a long term memory whose functioning we don´t understand to associate it with a brain we know nothing about and a mind that,... well, you get the meaning.It´s better and more informative than biology education and in my imagination I see books like this in a close future with much more data, pictures, animations, links of different grade of difficulty for each kind of reader, VR, AR and the integration of the reading audience, probably with a kinda collective reading live streams while using different kinds of technologies or just old school reading. A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science...Tropes show how literature is conceived and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

How to make a human body:
Blend together the right amount of each of 59 elements, at a cost of US$151,578.46 according to the Royal Society of Chemistry.  ~Or~If you don't have that kind of money lying about, you can also do it the old-fashioned way that involves heterosexual sex. I'm not here to judge your methods; make a human whichever way you please.  What I am here to do is tell you that Bill Bryson has done it again!  He has written yet another brilliant and vastly interesting book, this time about the human body. Whether you want to know about bones or skin or digestion, muscles or brains or bacteria, you'll find it in this book.  I don't even know where to begin in telling you about the contents.  Whilst some things I already knew and thus this was a refresher, there were even more that I didn't know and thus made my brain very happy.  There are just so many interesting facts wrapped up in this book.  A random few from my highlights:•""You have a meter of [DNA] packed into every cell, and so many cells that if you formed all the DNA in your body into a single strand, it would stretch ten billion miles, to beyond Pluto.""•We shed over a million flakes of skin every hour, leaving behind about a pound of dust every year.  (Easy way to rid yourself of a pound, but for some reason I've never seen it in a diet book.)•If you could ice skate on cartilage, you would go 16 times as fast as on ice, due to the smoothness of cartilage.•""In the second or so since you started this sentence, your body has made a million red blood cells."" (and used a dozen muscles just to read these words)•""The length of all your blood vessels would take you two and a half times around Earth.""•""Every gram of feces you produce contains 40 billion bacteria and 100 million archaea.""  (Now that's something you can impress your co-workers with at your Christmas party!)•The ""the death rate for infectious diseases has been climbing and is back to the level of about forty years ago.""  This is due to bacteria evolving resistance to our antibiotics, partly because of the copious amounts of antibiotics that are fed to livestock (a good reason to cut out meat and dairy!) and the over-prescription of antibiotics, especially for illnesses that are not helped by them (please stop asking your doctor for antibiotics for colds!).The award for my favourite tidbit of information in this book goes to:•All of your skin colour is in ""a sliver of skin about a millimeter thick"".  Did you get that??  ALL of the pigment in your skin is in a sliver so thin that you can see through it!  ""That’s all that race is—a sliver of epidermis.""  For this we have enslaved millions of people, killed, hated, treated unfairly, imprisoned.  For a translucent sliver of skin.   Stupid reason if you ask me, especially when you consider that if you go back far enough, every single person on earth has ancestors who came from Africa.  We ALL had black ancestors.  We ALL came from Africa.  The original skin colour of homo sapiens was dark, so stop already.  Stop hating on people over a sliver of skin.  If you have ""white"" skin, it's due to a gene mutation, a freak gene that happened to get passed on because our ancestors needed Vitamin D after they left Africa.  Not because you are somehow superior to people who have more melanin than you.  Got that?Those are just a few of the many things I highlighted in this book (it's best to have a Kindle copy if you don't like marking up paper pages).  If you enjoy learning new things, if you like to know what makes you you, or if you have an extra $151,578.46 on hand and want to know the ingredients required to create a human body, this is the book for you!"
6,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"I like Bryson, his books are often amusing and informative. He has a good eye for details that will keep the reader engaged or outraged or just smile. This is a tour of the human body, but it includes stories and asides about people associated with the discovery of various diseases or a cure or a system in the body. Some books on this topic can get a bit carried away with long names for parts that involve endless Latin or Greek. A nice thing he does here when he does give these is to say what the words mean in English, often interesting enough in itself, and to say why the person naming it that might have thought that was a good idea.I didn't realise that the X-chromosome was called that because the person who discovered it didn’t know what it did – and so, like ‘planet X’, the letter was chosen due to this mystery rather than for the chromosome’s shape. And the Y-chromosome was likewise named following on from X in the alphabet.You come away from this thinking that a lot of people are basically bastards. I won’t spoil the stories, but the person who took credit for Streptomycin fits this category particularly nicely. This is a quick read and an interesting one. Particularly good is the last chapter – you know, we are all going to die sooner or later and so death often sharpens our interest. I’ve become fascinated by the idea that no one is allowed to die of ‘old age’ any more. You have to have died of something, but as Bryson says, getting old generally involves multiple things going wrong with you – and so picking one generally ignores the significant contribution one or other of the things you were suffering from inevitably played in your demise. Perhaps saying ‘he died of old age’ as the cause of death would be in fact be more accurate. Some of the things people were allowed to die of in the past seem so much better than heart disease or cancer - like ennui, for example. ""I think he died mostly of listlessness..."" As I said recently to a friend of Facebook – the category of deaths I would choose for myself would be ‘peacefully and in his sleep’."
7,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,4,"I read this off and on for over a week, I think reading it straight through would not have left me time to ponder the information and possibly would have been a case of too much at one time. Our bodies, many systems and other developments of which I knew little all in one book. I actually own a copy because this is another that I feel deserves more than read. Or at least to have as a reference. There is a huge amount of research that went into this book. Bryson is good and picking out information and identifying unsung, unknown heroes. As informative and as I found it, it seems Bryson has traded his trademark sit for some gross examples. Thankfully, I have never encountered these relatively rare conditions. Shuddered at all the diseases, viruses we don't get, there were quite a few. Our body is quite a compact and intricate mechanism. It's a wonder that more things don't go wrong.I still have two unread by this author that I'm saving for a book drought, along with books from a few other favored author. This is an author loved by many, and he explains our bodies in an easy to understand fashion. Though I did miss the humor , of which there was some, but not as many instances as in previous books. Definitely worth reading, regardless."

For those of us who haven't had a biology class since we fulfilled some course requirement ages ago, Bryson gives an excellent overview of what doctors and scientists know about all our different body parts and bodily functions. This book does for biology what books like Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong or A People's History of the United States have done for history; it updates and corrects some common misconceptions that may have been passed on to us at one stage or another.Bryson's dry wit will come across even more clearly when this is eventually made into an audiobook.  While reading, I imagined Alton Brown reading the text in the same manner he talks to the audience in Good Eats. Bill Nye would be a great narrator, too! It's clear that The Body is aimed at a general audience. (Readers who specialize in the biological sciences might want more detail than this book provides.)One caveat, particularly for Goodreads reviewers--more than our fair share of us have had frustrating or scary ""adventures"" through the medical system. Since Bryson spends a surprising amount of time discussing the things doctors *don't* know, this aspect of the text could be unsettling. Four stars for the print version--and if the audiobook is available when you're making your purchasing decision, I would definitely give this a listen.Thanks to Doubleday and NetGalley for my DRC of this book, which will be available for purchase on October 15th."

Chapter 20 (When things go wrong) in this book is a must-read one as it is perfectly explaining the current scenario we are facing. This book will help us to know more about our body which might enable us to appreciate it's uniqueness even when it's challenged to the extreme by viruses and other microbes. I read this book amid all the pandemonium I had to face as a Doctor and more importantly, as a human being. I am going to copy and write the last paragraph of chapter 20 (page 335) due to its current relevance  ”The fact is we are really no better prepared for a bad outbreak today than we were when Spanish flu killed tens of millions of people a hundred years ago. The reason we haven’t had another experience like that isn’t because we have been especially vigilant. It’s because we have been lucky” Well, it seems that we can’t write that sentence again.P.S. Please don’t go to a bookstore to purchase this or any other book if the shops are still open in your country. Instead, either order it from any online store or buy the ebook or the audiobook.

And, of course, we also have the opportunity to enjoy the Bryson wit. This is a field trip through the human body and I was astounded at the level of research needed to write such a book. And I admit there was so much I did not know about the body and how it is built to repair itself. This is an informative guide as well as a source of humour, now and again.

13,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,5,"Until now, I only knew Bill Bryson for his snarky travelogues. My buddy-reader, however, informed me that his non-fiction book was very good indeed. Besides, many biology books suffer from the fact that their authors are great scientists but horrible writers. So I wanted to read something that had the potential to be entertaining as well as educational.The book is divided into these chapters:And yes, we did get a little bit of humour, but that wasn't because Bryson made fun of certain things, but was very good at pointing out the hilarity of history and us silly homo sapiens.Bryson decided to explain anatomy to the reader as well as giving historical and practical context. We thus hear of the abominable Typhoid Mary, a women who, at one point, found out she was one of the rare carriers of typhoid without showing any symptoms, but decided to still work in kitchens (against a promise she had made to the authorities) and didn't even bother to wash her hands before preparing meals, thus spreading the disease until she was finally put under house arrest.Or Nicholas Alkemade, who served in WW2 and jumped out of his plane (his parachute had burnt to cinders and he preferred not to burn to death), survived falling 5500 metres into a pile of snow (after having been slowed down by some pine trees) and suffering only a sprained leg. After the war had ended, he worked in a chemical plant where, while removing chlorine gas-generating liquid from a sump, he received a severe electric shock from the equipment he was using. His gas mask became dislodged and he began breathing in the poisonous gas. After 15 minutes, his appeals for aid were finally answered and he was dragged to safety, nearly asphyxiated by the fumes. Not long after, a siphoning pipe burst, spraying Alkemade’s face and arms with industrial sulphuric acid. With astounding presence of mind, he dived head-first into a nearby drum of limewash, thereby neutralising the acid and escaping with only 1st-degree-burns. He returned to work, but was pinned beneath an almost 3m long steel door runner that fell from its mountings as he passed by, escaping - somehow - with only minor bruising. However, after this, even he came to his senses and decided to no longer tempt fate. He thus became a furniture salesman, dying peacefully in June 1987.Just two examples of how remarkable and resilient the human body can be (though Mary, in my opinion, was mostly an example of being sick of mind). There are others, of course, such as people being trapped in frozen lakes or extremely cold weather, who are afterwards successfully (slowly) warmed up and who survived (babies even).The book is full of other fascinating facts as well. Many of us know, for example, that damages to our frontal lobes result in personality changes, which was the reason lobotomy became popular at one point in human history (Rosemary Kennedy was lobotomized because her father considered her too willful, something Bryson mentions in this book, too). Did you also know that it's 400 times more likely that a teenager is in an accident if said teenager is accompanied by another teenager?! And this isn't just limited to car accidents.Or did you know that we always say ""our 5 senses"" but that there are many more? Like the sense that tells us if we're lying down or standing upright even when our eyes are closed? It's called proprioception (our sense of where we are in relation to the space around us).Or did you know how many things we still cannot explain? One such thing are emotional responses like crying when sad - it has no physiological benefit AND is the same response as for joy so why are we doing it?Science, it's history, trials and errors but also impressive feats from hundreds of years ago, groundbreaking discoveries (the most well-known example being penicillin), modern appliances and procedures but also problems that will become more dangerous in the near future ... I was delighted how Bryson presented it all comprehensibly and explained it in a way every layman can understand, often giving examples from every-day occurrences, always showing just how much he is fascinated by the subject(s) himself.A wonderful look at an important and thrilling subject (us) by a seriously talented author - just don't be prissy about digestion or our insides. ;P"
14,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"For all of you other cyborgs and pure artificial intelligences out there, I should mention that this is a rather interesting primer on regular meat-sacks. It even has the distinction of not being science fiction at all.But as the title suggests, outright occupancy usually comes with a rental charge. The bill always comes due.I've read a few Brysons before... and my favorite has got to be A Short History of Nearly Everything. This one, from a regular knowledge-gathering stand, comes in as a tight second. The travelogues are fun and often funny, but Short History is pretty comprehensive and rather more funny. This one, however, was not very funny at all. That's okay. Very little about our bodies, aside from sex and farts, is funny.Bryson DOES, however, accomplish a lot, go over a LOT of ground. Pretty cool, in fact. Do I recommend reading this? Absolutely. Everyone ought to have a primer on themselves. The benefit here is much more than meets the eye, though. So many new discoveries and outright debunking of myths have made it in this text. Recent ones, too.You know that leaky faucet and the clog in the pipes? Yep. We really need to talk to the landlord. "
15,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Bryson is a wonderful travel guide, and this time around he takes us through an enjoyable tour of the human body. The book is surprisingly detailed, for a popular-science book. Bryson exhibits his usual knack for the extraordinary and unusual, but despite veering close to it at times, he avoids the pitfall of making this book just a tour of the oddities of the human body. Bryson takes just enough such detours to keep us amused, but just like a good tour guide ensures that we are adequately educated as well. The best thing about Bryson, as best exhibited in A Short History of Nearly Everything, is his knack to make everything he touches so memorable. I am sure if a quiz was added after each chapter, most of his readers would fare very well in them. Did you know it takes more time for food to move through a woman's digestive system, than a man's? Who would've thought to include that in an anatomy book? However, is this the best book to pick up if you are interested in reading about the Human Body? It might be the most fun book, but I am sure even Bryson would recommend Daniel Lieberman's The Story of the Human Body over his own book if you could read just one anatomy book. After all, he refers to Lieberman so often that it sometimes feels like this whole book is nothing but a detailed review of Lieberman's magnum opus. If you can spare the time for two, by all means, get both.Towards the end, Bryson comes to the real point of why we are reading the book - how to keep ourselves healthy. He takes us through a tour of nutrition science, exercise science and even of mortality. In the end, Bryson leaves us with the message that it is not that difficult to live a good life - you just have to take good care of your most precious resource - your Body."
16,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3292905-julie,5,"A truly amazing compendium on the human body aka ""a warm wobble of flesh!"" Truly engaging and enlightening. Occasionally I wanted to fast forward to avoid the details, but mainly I was truly engaged, appalled or enthralled!My personal favorite of Bill Bryson's anecdotal stories:The emergency appendectomy on a US submarine during WWII. The ship's pharmacist assistant was ordered to operate without any knowledge or equipment, as he as was the senior medical personnel on board. This is a little mind-boggling to me, as I would expect that there would be a trained medical doctor on board at the very least. Anyway, the pharmacist assistant successfully anesthetized the patient by guessing at the quantity of anesthesia to administer. Then, he successfully performed the appendectomy ""wearing a tea strainer lined with gauze as a surgery mask and guided by little more than a first aid manual."" Truly amazing!  Surprising fact, which had somehow passed me by: women in labor today have the same pain relief options as their great grandmothers.Conclusions: 1. We could avoid a lot of diseases by living more sensibly. LOL!2. We have been successful in extending life, but not in improving the quality of life.4/29/20 Update: Reading this for a second time with my hubby. Bill Bryson's matter of factness and humor make for a perfect listening experience during this stay-at-home time."
17,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul,3,"3.5 starsI am joining a book club; unusual for me because I am not a hugely social animal. It is based at the university where I work for one day a week and it meets a lunch time, once every two months. This is the book for January; it’s not something I would have read in normal circumstances. Bryson employs his usual wry and laconic style and applies it to the human body. This isn’t a medical text book, but it is detailed and covers pretty much what you would expect. Bryson does cover the history and development of medicines, surgery and approaches to the body. He also uncovers some of the lesser known pioneers of medicine, those history has forgotten. Bryson tells their stories and uncovers their foibles in an entertaining way. The book is full of facts, it must be a dream for someone who goes to quizzes a lot, although there are some interesting ones as well. Bryson estimates that austerity in Britain has led to about 120 000 preventable deaths. He attributes the fact that Americans die at a younger age the Europeans to lifestyle. Bryson also takes a more global perspective and looks at the battle with infectious diseases and our overuse of antibiotics which has led to antibiotic resistant bugs. Bryson takes a look at the opioid crisis and at some of the medical techniques that did not stand the test of time; lobotomy for example.There are lots of interesting facts, many obscure diseases, lesser known medical operatives and trillions of cells. It is informative and Bryson is, as ever, a great raconteur. However I was left asking WHY? What’s it all for, interesting though it is? I’ll keep you posted on the book club!"
18,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3060349-karen-r,5,"Bill Bryson’s trademark humor is evident in this fascinating book that provides detailed descriptions of the body, how things function and history of discovery. A big takeaway is that although there have been great strides in what we know about science and medicine, he makes it clear just how much is still unknown about how and why things work. This book would be perfect to serve as a primer for a high school health and wellness course. Thanks to Doubleday Books for the ARC in exchange for my honest review."
19,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,5,"This book was given to me as a Christmas present, and it was a great gift. As a fan of Bryson, I was surprised that I had not even heard of his new work of popular science. I am glad that it came to my attention, then, since this was my favorite Bryson book since A Short History of Nearly Everything. Structured as a tour of the human body, the book made me feel right at home. No matter what the subject, Bryson’s style is consistent: snappy prose, engaging anecdotes, and fun facts, all tied together with a lot of curiosity and humor. At its worst, this can make for some superficial books—a meandering array of factoids with little structure—which in my experience plagues his history writing. But science seems to bring out the best in Bryson. Here, the writing is disciplined and controlled. He clearly did a great deal of research and organized his facts with care. And Bryson has a rare talent for research. You would think that, in our media-saturated age, most of the great stories and characters from history would be known. But somehow Bryson is always able to uncover an unsung hero with an eccentric personality. The history of science seems particularly rich in this.Bryson not only unearths unsung heroes, but surprising information. Bryson is a fun fact factory. Arguably, fun facts are the very definition of superficial knowledge; but Bryson’s curiosities are irresistible. There were so many things about the body—about digestion, sleep cycles, anatomy, disease—that I did not know, and so many things that surprised me. For example, I learned that our eyes do not only have rods and cones, but photoreceptive ganglion cells; these do not contribute to vision in any way, but tell us when it is light or dark. This is why some blind people instinctually know if it is day or night, or even if the light is on or off.Bryson’s style is also well-suited to popular science. His jokes, comments, and asides can be distracting in other contexts; but when reporting potentially dry scientific information, the humor helps. And it must be said that Bryson’s two biggest preoccupations—things we do not know, and things that can kill us (or ideally both)—have ample material in a book about the human body. Indeed, this book gave me a bit of death anxiety, since Bryson dwells on all of the things that can go seriously wrong and how little we know about the why. The scariest thing, for me, was the section on antibiotics. The rate at which bacteria adapt to antibiotics is far outpacing the rate at which we are discovering new medicines. (And our flagrant overuse of antibiotics is certainly not helping.) If we do not somehow reverse this trend, we can have a real crisis in the near future.If the book has any takeaway, it is that lifestyle is important. Exercises is tremendously beneficial; and inactivity is likewise lethal. A good diet makes a big difference, too, as does avoiding obviously harmful activities like smoking and excessive drinking. Our bad habits in the United States are partially why we lag behind other developed nations in life expectancy. As Bryson also points out, our health system is not particularly good, either, despite the enormous costs involved (several times the prices in other countries). Indeed, the American health system is not only lagging behind other countries, but is actively creating problems. The most obvious example of this is the opioid epidemic, which is largely caused by overprescribing pain medication. And the reason that these medications are only overprescribed in America, it seems, is the unsavory relationship between doctors and drug companies.As you can see, there is a great deal of interest in these pages—from the history of science, to the development of modern medicine, to the science of anatomy and physiology—none of it dense, dull, or otherwise difficult, but rather witty, charming, and altogether fun to read. I recommend it."

I have to admit I would have been bored if I'd tried to read this straight through but tackling a few pages every night at bedtime turned out to be fascinating and educating. There is a lot of trivia about not just the body itself and how it works, but also about scientists and doctors and their discoveries, sometimes accidental, the sometimes wrong conclusions they came to, and health care systems all over the world. My conclusions at the end of this book: The body is an incredible machine that does everything it can to keep us alive, most of the time without us even knowing about it. In the end, it really is a crap shoot, so enjoy it while you can. Or as Bill Bryson says at the end of the last chapter that describes what happens at death - ""And that's you gone. But it was good while it lasted, wasn't it?""  Carpe Diem!"
21,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,5,"Shelve this next to Being Mortal by Atul Gawande in a collection of books that everyone should read – even if you’re a squeamish hypochondriac or you don’t normally choose nonfiction. Bryson is back on form with his latest, indulging his layman’s curiosity about how the body works. Now, I read a LOT of medical memoirs and popular science. I’ve read entire books about organ transplantation, sleep, dementia, the blood, the heart, evolutionary defects, surgery and so on, but in many cases these go into more detail than I really need and I can find my interest waning. That never happens here. Without ever being superficial or patronizing his readers, the author gives a comprehensive introduction to every organ and body system, moving briskly between engaging anecdotes from medical history and encapsulated research on everything from gut microbes to cancer treatment.Bryson delights in our physical oddities, and his sense of wonder is infectious. How fantastic that there is such a thing as the Belly Button Biodiversity Project (run by North Carolina State University) that has discovered 1,458 species in bacteria new to science in people’s navels! How astounding that a man hiccupped for 67 years straight! As you’ve likely gathered from his other work, he loves a good statistic, and while this book is full of numbers and percentages, they are accessible rather than obfuscating, and will make you shake your head in amazement.“A study in Switzerland found that flu virus can survive on a banknote for two and a half weeks if it is accompanied by a microdot of snot.”“If you’ve ever wondered why no one wants to kiss you first thing in the morning, it is possibly because your exhalations may contain up to 150 different chemical compounds” including “methyl mercaptan (which smells like very old cabbage), hydrogen sulphide (like rotten eggs), dimethyl sulphide (slimy seaweed)”, etc.“Even with the advantage of clothing, shelter and boundless ingenuity, humans can manage to live on only about 12 per cent of Earth’s land area”“Altogether there are about seven thousand rare diseases – so many that about one person in seventeen in the developed world has one, which isn’t very rare at all. But, sadly, so long as a disease affects only a small number of people it is unlikely to get much research attention. For 90 per cent of rare diseases there are no effective treatments at all.”This is a congenial and persistently cheerful book, even when discussing illness, scientists whose work was overlooked, and the inevitability of death. What I found most sobering was the observation that, having conquered many diseases and extended our life expectancy, we are now overwhelmingly killed by our lifestyle, mostly a poor diet of processed and sugary foods and a lack of exercise – “we are born with the bodies of hunter–gatherers but pass our lives as couch potatoes.”A few specific things I learned:I’ve had a nasty cold for the past two weeks, and this book saved me from making a wasted purchase – I had just put Vitamin C on the shopping list when I read that taking large doses of Vitamin C is ineffectual. That it can cure a cold is an urban myth. Immediately, I crossed it off the list and ate an orange instead.It takes 72 hours for food to move through a woman’s digestive system and be excreted. I’d always assumed that what I was getting rid of was my last meal – so that if I had a bout of diarrhea I could blame it on what I’d just eaten. I’m now curious to know how it works for flatulence: I’m sure that I get instant flatulence after eating chickpeas, lentils, eggs or cheese. But is that just my imagination? Maybe I’m actually observing the effects of a meal from a few days ago.A neat thing to know about cold weather; it makes total sense, but had never occurred to me. “Incidentally, the reason your nose runs in chilly weather is the same reason your bathroom windows run with water in chilly weather. In the case of your nose, warm air from your lungs meets cold air coming into the nostrils and condenses, resulting in a drip.”Favorite passages:“Your body is a universe of mystery. A very large part of what happens on and within it happens for reasons that we don’t know – very often, no doubt, because there are no reasons. Evolution is an accidental process, after all.”“Your brain is you. Everything else is just plumbing and scaffolding.”"
22,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,4,"Bill Bryson, as usual, manages to make a difficult and complex topic completely accessible and enjoyable in The Body. Taking the reader on journey from the brain (my favourite chapter), endocrine system down to the lungs and beyond, every chapter is full of interesting facts that will entertain as well as inform.Bryson just seems to have this ability in his writing to make the reader feel as though they're chatting with a friend about a subject that he's so clearly passionate about. It manages to invoke an excitment in the reader that is not easily achieved in lesser authors, who could make the subject too dry. I will say that I wasn't as interested in some chapets as I was in others (homeostasis and equilibrium come to mind) but this never stopped me from reading this fast paced, easy read.Fun fact: I met Bill Bryson when I graduated with my BSc and he's a really nice guy. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting a general overview into the weird and wonderful world of the human body. "
23,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43708514-candie,5,"I really enjoyed this book; it is very entertaining. There are so many interesting facts about every single part of the body in here. There are just enough stories and humor added in that it makes the book very readable; it never seems like it is too technical or dry, but keep in mind that it is still a book about body facts. It was very fascinating to learn just how much we don't know about the body and how or why it does what it does. I also found that there were quite a few things that I thought I knew, and I did not.If the topic itself sounds interesting to you then I would definitely recommend it because it is very well written."

26,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow,4,"3.5 starsThis is like A Short History of Nearly Everything but for the body.Had I not read so many medical books and watched endless hours of QI I would have given this a MUCH higher rating but because of this prior knowledge some sections felt like deja vu.The scope of the book is impressive, Bill does not leave any stone (or rather muscle, cell, bacteria or organ) unexplored. I also learned enough fascinating trivia which I plan to spring on unsuspecting friends at inappropriate times for my own entertainment.My favorite sections dealt with the microbiome, gut and nervous system and to be honest any book that incorporates something like the Belly Button Diversity Project would grab my attention.I found it amusing that he treaded so lightly and diplomatically in the nutrition and vaccine section but then again there is currently a lot of controversy in these areas.The author also quoted some of my favorite books by Mary Roach as well as sections of The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancerto just name a few so even with my slightly middle of the road rating I can highly recommend this to anyone who has a passing interest in well researched books that make medical speak accessible and learning new things fun."
27,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"What a marvelous book! Bill Bryson is one of my favorite authors. His dry wit shines in all of his books. Before reading this book, it was hard for me to imagine what the book would be like. I've read some of Bryson's travel books--all delightful--but I couldn't image what a book about the body would be like. As it turns out, it is a tour book, written in the same style, as a metaphorical tour of the body.Bryson interleaves talking about a lot of facts with interesting and often humorous anecdotes. Every single page is very interesting, even entertaining. There are a few gruesome parts that I simply skipped over. This is not a comprehensive book about the body; Bryson relates interesting facts, lots of trivia, and really skips the details. That is the magic he brings to a very engaging book.I didn't read this book, I listened to the audiobook, as read by the author. Bryson has a pleasant, soft voice. Unlike other narrators with soft voices, this audiobook's audio engineering allowed me to hear and understand the narration distinctly. It is also fun, because Bryson's voice inflections bring out the points he wants to emphasize, and the humor comes out in a perfectly deadpan manner."
28,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47188780-kathleen,3,"Bryson has supplied the reader with an anatomy class for the layman. He provides an excellent overview of what scientists know about the body from skin to bones, what is essential to keep it healthy, and a plethora of diseases that can attack it. However, missing is Bryson’s signature wit and his unique way of looking at the mundane."
29,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27298436-toni,5,"A casual readable guide for the ‘common man,’ (you know I mean person). Reading through this book by Bill Bryson, is like talking to your favorite uncle at the Thanksgiving table, after everyone else went to watch the football game. You and he are nibbling dessert, sipping coffee and just chatting about the human body. That’s how easy the writing flows.So far from any textbook, it contains valuable facts yet it’s not overly technical. The categories or elements of the vast network that contains the wonders inside and out are organized perfectly; and the technical words are available for anyone who wants them. Just when you’re ready to ask, ‘but what about this?’ Bill segues into that area. Always the teacher and the guide, Bryson just knows what to tell us next. He presents not just the basic information, but any controversies, recent and past, surrounding this body part or organ relative to disease or maladies. I’ve learned more through this book than I have reading articles or other periodicals over the past year or so. I highly recommend this book to everyone!Thank you to Netgalley, Doubleday Books, and Bill Bryson."

31,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115625-thefourthvine,1,"People who should read this: those who really, really enjoy book reports. People who should absolutely not read this: trans people, people with chronic pain, fat people, anyone with a degree in any aspect of biology, anyone who reads more than one popular science book a year. The thing is, there are basically three ways you can go with a book like this. There’s the complete and in-depth approach, which is absolutey ruled out here; you can’t cover the human body completely in four years of medical school, never mind in a single book. Then there’s the fun facts approach, which Mary Roach has absolutely perfected; you give a brief overview and then you delve into interesting and possibly amusing things your reader probably doesn’t know. That’s where I thought this was going. And then there’s the massively oversimplified, somewhat dull book report, and that’s where this unfortunately ended up. This reads like Bryson read approximately 400 books, summarized each one in a single page, and then added an introduction and a conclusion. And that’s a problem. The reason each of those books was written was that their topics could not be adequately covered in a page. So every time I happened upon an area about which I already knew some things — or when I’d read the same book Bryson had for that particular bit — I found myself hissing, “But you’re MISSING THE POINT” or “But that’s — that’s so superficial it’s actually inaccurate” or just “Seriously? Seriously??” I had particular concerns about his discussions of sex and sex chromosomes, which was so simplified and bad that it pretty much went directly to a TERF place. (The problems start with him saying everyone has two sex chromosomes, and that if you have XX you are always female and if you have XY you are always male, and then they sort of go on from there. Biology is more complicated than your fifth-grade-level overview suggests.) He also manages a neatly internally contradictory discussion of the Death Fat that spans over multiple chapters. (Especially enjoyed him explaining in one chapter some of the reasons humans are fatter today than previously, only to explain in another chapter that we all just eat too much and don’t exercise enough. Also there’s a good bit where he explains that fat is definitely killing everyone early, only to point out a bit later that some of the fattest populations on the planet are also the longest-lived. And so on.) There’s also a fun spot where he describes Alexis St. Martin, who was an intensively mistreated victim of constant unethical experimentation by a physician, as “not the most cooperative of subjects.” There’s a lot of stuff like that, that Bryson lightly glosses over and really, really should not. When the book’s not enraging, it’s just dull. Bryson mostly elides his own narrative voice, which is his main strength as a writer, in favor of pretending to be an authority, so we get an endless dull recitation of facts that many readers already know. (And many of which we learned from more engaging books than this one.)This book left me sad and frustrated and took me so long to slog through it messed up my holds at the library. A solid loser, all the way around. "
32,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98423937-nursebookie,5,"""THE BODY"" by Bill Bryson.Did you ever think you ever needed an owner's manual for our complex body? I think this was a brilliant idea!! We live in this body that we are so intimate with and yet could hardly speak of what goes on inside or tell us the functions of the organs we have, nor even name them, Bryson took a Biology Book, that is the last thing I ever want, and turned it to an amazing book that I cannot keep my hands away from. Converting a daunting and boring science book into an understandable and entertaining book for EVERYONE is like wizardry. His writing is brilliant and truly enjoyable. Bryson kept me intrigued and in awe for the facts and information he magically sprinkled throughout the pages. Additionally, the anecdotes within the chapters made for a really fun read for me. This book had accurate and important information that I did not even learn in my pre-med courses in college. I feel like I can win a trivia contest or even join Jeopardy after reading this book. Bryson wrote a phenomenal book full of amazing information without feeling like I am stuffing my head with information, but for some reason I am retaining these facts and enjoy talking about them to everyone I meet. I have recommended this book to many people already and will continue to do so. What an awesome gift for anyone that can appreciate a great read and feel so much smarter after reading this. Amazing job!Thank you NeyGalley and Double Day Books for the ARC ebook for my honest and objective opinion."
33,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101060033-woman-reading,4,"4☆ characterized in turns by droll wit and stomach - churning descriptions 

 Our bodies are a universe of 37.2 trillion cells operating in more or less perfect concert more or less all of the time. ... The miracle of human life is not that we are endowed with some frailties but we are not swamped by them. ... You truly are a wonder. But then so, it must be said, is an earthworm. 

And with this elegant turn of sentiment, Bryson embarked on a journey of the human body, from top to bottom and from outside in. Despite its subtitle and seeming breadth, it appeared to me to offer limited value as a user's personal handbook. The bulk of The Body  instead was evenly divided between being an idiosyncratic assortment of medical characters and scientists and a brief introductory course to anatomy and physiology. In regards to its utility as an user's handbook, I can easily summarize its conventional advice:- exercise more; don't be so sedentary- get sufficient sleep- eat more plant-based foods instead of processed, refined, or sugary foods - don't smoke or do drugs and drink alcohol moderately 

As with so much in life, getting the balances right is delicate business. Suicide by lifestyles takes ages.

Bryson's deadpan wit existed side by side with some very gross descriptions of past medical research. So beware if you're squeamish or planning to eat. Bryson mentioned many scientists in the context of Nobel prize winners, both the worthy and the slighted, those robbed by unscrupulous bosses or by ignorant skepticism. Many of these stories were quite old, but they made me realize that our medical advances have been relatively recent, within the past 60 years or so. Some examples of medical quackery (through modern eyes) included brain surgery with kitchenware (icepicks) and the injection of all sorts of liquids and multiple animals' blood directly into human subjects' veins. One stomach- churning account was how in the 1820s the surgeon W. Beaumont tested his subject's partially digested food by tasting it himself to confirm the presence of hydrochloric acid in the human gastrointestinal system. The other example was a very graphic testimony in 1810 by novelist F. Burney undergoing a mastectomy while awake and without anesthesia.The Body succinctly described body parts and their functions and many esoteric bits of knowledge. One myth he quickly dispelled was the self help notion that we only use 10 percent of our brain thus leaving 90 percent as an untapped massive potential. Alas, no, all of our brains are utilized. Bryson was quite clear, however, that many aspects still pose mysteries - from why we hiccup, yawn, or even sleep. The most fascinating chapter to me was about the brain. Humans can truly be idiosyncratic as we don't all see or smell the world the same way. How can we when our individual collection of odorant receptors will lead to differing experiences of smell. And then because of the distance between our optic nerves and brains, the brain forecasts 1/5th of a second in advance. 

... photons of light have no color, sound waves no sound, olfactory molecules no odors. ...All the richness of life is created inside your head. What you see is not what is but what your brain tells you it is, and that's not the same thing at all. ... color isn't a fixed reality but a perception. 

So couple that with the following, and the profound insight explains why race is purely a social construct. 

The paradox of genetics is that we are all very different and yet genetically practically identical. All humans share 99.9 percent of their DNA.""People act as if skin color is a determinant of character when all it is is a reaction to sunlight. Biologically, there is actually no such thing as race - nothing in terms of skin color, facial features, hair type, bone structure or anything else that is a defining quality among peoples."" - Nina Jablonski 

We need to overcome our knee-jerk mental reactions. This alone is sufficient for me to round up my initial 3.5+ star rating to 4 stars."

Bill Bryson explores what makes up the human body from head to toe, from birth to death, with his trademark wit and wisdom. He delves into how a healthy body functions and what can go wrong, how medicines and treatments have evolved over the years, discussing which scientists and doctors made important discoveries that benefitted humanity and which crackpot theories were eventually debunked. Best advice for living a long life? Eat healthy foods, the less processed the better, exercise, don't smoke, don't drink to excess. Take an aspirin and call me in the morning..I received an arc of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Many thanks. "
36,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/202724-jessica,4,"A lot more dry and technical than his other books I've read, but fascinating nonetheless! I really loved how he highlighted the unsung heroes, especially the women scientists, whose achievements go unnoticed or are attributed to flashier (male) colleagues.The bottom line, however, is that for all the things we do know about the body, there are about a million things we don't!"
37,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"I am a huge fan of Bill Bryson's travel books - he is a superb storyteller, and in the best parts of his science writing, this ability to provide fascinating facts and intriguing tales shines through.After taking on the whole of science in his first book, here he focuses in on the physiology, anatomy and diseases of the human body. Bryson does so with his usual light, approachable style, peppering the plethora of facts (and 'don't know's - it's amazing how much we still don't know about the workings of the body) with the little nuggets you can't help but share and stories of some of the odd and, frankly, horrifying goings on in the history of medicine.So, for example, Bryson throws in 'The chin is unique to humans and no one knows why we have one.' He speculates that it might be just that we 'find a good chin dashing' and quotes a Harvard professor as saying 'Testing this last hypothesis is especially difficult, but the reader is encouraged to think of appropriate experiments.'It's a long time since I read Bryson's first science book, but I suspect that his Short History of Nearly Everything involved more going and talking to scientists, so had more of the feel of a documentary, and more opportunity to bring in his travel writing skills. Here, there was more of a focus on presentation of facts, though always in a way that felt more like a conversation with a friend than an introductory textbook on human biology - and there are still a number of interviews.A good example of the way Bryson goes about exploring a topic is the way he deals with asthma. He starts with a story about the writer Marcel Proust, describing the many ways that Proust attempted to treat the condition, including enemas, opium and having the gas to his house cut off. From Proust we move on to the way asthma has become more prevalent and the remarkable variation around the world - not, as you might expect, paralleling the degree of air pollution. It was shocking to read that the highest rate in the world is in the UK, where '30 per cent of children have shown asthma symptoms in the last year.' This is compared with rates around 3 percent in China, Greece, Romania and Russia. He then goes on, using an interview with an expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, to show how most of our ideas about asthma are wrong. For example, he quotes Neil Pearce as saying 'the main thing I have achieved is to show that almost none of the things people think cause asthma actually do.'Along the way Bryson takes us on a tour of the body, starting with 'the outside' (skin and hair) and working through all the main parts, the vast numbers of microbes that share our body, body functions - such as movement, eating and sleep - and diseases, finishing with a whole chapter on cancer and another on the way that medicine has developed from doing more harm than good to its present state.This is the perfect book for anyone (like me) who had little to do with biology at school and to whom much of the functioning of human anatomy is a mystery. You know that with Bryson at the helm, the voyage through your inner workings is bound to be fascinating and entertaining. I wish there had been more opportunity for his humour and recounting personal adventures, as in his travel books, because this is where Bryson is at his best - but even when recounting facts he keeps the reader interested, never lingering long enough to get bogged down.Well worth a look."
38,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6181069-ingrid,5,Very interesting and informative. Easy to read.
39,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8111350-kendra,2,"It's nice to read a new book by Bryson in which he seems to have gotten over the bitterness (especially about aging) that made several of his most recent books unpleasant. And while The Body is written in something similar to his old, familiar, entertaining style, there are several issues that will keep me from buying it for friends. 1. it's hard to be precisely up-to-the-minute with books on science, but a lot of the data Bryson cites is quite old and misleading. Referring to the BMI, for example, is problematic because it is known to be a terrible indicator of, well, anything, and it's been long-condemned by medical professionals. There are other errors of fact as well: it's ""Down syndrome,"" not ""Down's,,"" for example. 2. It's ableist and sexist. The book could have used a sensitivity reading by a disabled person, who would have asked Bryson to remove a lot of the language of ""suffering"" and ""lack"" that appears. Bryson often refers to measurements and statistics about women by citing men first and then portraying women as the different or other. Although he does an excellent job of pointing out gender bias in scientific studies, his framing is redolent of those studies themselves. 3. It's not really necessary: as Bryson himself cites numerous other, recent books about the human body and human health, it's unclear why he though his addition was needed. Sure, the historical anecdotes are interesting, but they've been used numerous other times in other books on the same topic."
40,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77686200-indieflower,5,"Bill Bryson is so good at this stuff, imparting incredibly interesting information in a light, conversational tone that's easy to digest. Fascinating, informative, somewhat alarming and horrifying at times - such as the case of Fanny Burney, who in 1810 at the age of 58, underwent a radical mastectomy without anaesthesia, she not only lived long enough afterwards to write a detailed, stomach churning account of her ordeal but went on to survive another 29 years. I found it somewhat unsettling to learn how much doctors still don't know and the cheery news that it's only a matter of time before a really cracking flu pandemic decimates mankind 😬. This was a great, entertaining read, written with Bryson's usual dry humour and wit, a fun way to learn about this ""warm wobble of flesh"" we inhabit."

One of my favorites of December 2019.Very reminiscent of one of my all time favorite books in general, Bryson's  A Short History of Nearly Everything. This has that classic Bryson charm with lots of interesting factoids. Definitely a deep dive, kind of like hopping on the Magic School Bus with Miss Frizzle. Would revisit this one in the future. “Just sitting quietly, doing nothing at all, your brain churns through more information in thirty seconds than the Hubble Space Telescope has processed in thirty years. A morsel of cortex one cubic millimeter in size—about the size of a grain of sand—could hold two thousand terabytes of information, enough to store all the movies ever made, trailers included, or about 1.2 billion copies of this book.”“Pain is full of paradoxes. Its most self-evident characteristic is that it hurts–that’s what it is there for, after all–but sometimes pain feels slightly wonderful: when your muscles ache after a long run, say, or when you slide into a bath that is at once unbearably hot but also, somehow, deliciously not.”"

It doesn't hurt that his son is a practicing physician. Plus he talked to a lot of interesting people in the business. You'll likely skim parts, but it's well-worth reading. Bryson is a hell of a writer. 4.2 stars, highly recommended.Memorable anecdotes? OK, here's one: over your lifetime, you will eat something like 60 tons of food! And excrete about 7 tons of, well, ""solid waste.""● The storage capacity of your brain is estimated to be around 200 exabytes (Nature Neuroscience, 2013). Which was roughly equal to the entire digital contents of the world in 2013. I/O rates, however, are pretty pitiful.Best online reviews I saw: Nature's mini-review:""From skin to gut, the human body is a realm of wonder, and Bill Bryson’s tome explores it to its thrumming depths. The book bristles with data such as our allotment of cells (37.2 trillion) or daily faeces production (200 grams), but the star turns are Bryson’s wry forays into the histories of neuroscience, genetics, anatomy and immunology. Cue visceral gems such as diarist Samuel Pepys’s gruesome bladder-stone surgery, and US physician Chevalier Quixote Jackson’s retrieval of thousands of ingested items (including miniature binoculars and a poker chip) over his 75-year career.""https://www.nature.com/articles/d4158...WSJ has a more leisurely and thorough review:https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-body... (Paywalled. As always, I'm happy to email a copy to non-subscribers) ""According to Mr. Bryson, “running—serious, dogged, long-distance running—is the one thing we do superlatively well.” Our ancestors, with their big frontal lobes, social natures and marathoner builds, were perfectly adapted for co-operative persistence hunting. “We are not the speediest of creatures . . . but put us up against an antelope or a wildebeest on a hot day and allow us trot after it, and we can run it into the ground.”Being vertical has drawbacks. Our backs, hips and knees wear out with age. Our sinuses drain poorly and become viral cesspools every winter. And “we choke to death more easily than any other mammal.” To keep our big heads upright, our necks became longer and more centered under the skull. This had the happy side effect of making speech, and the vocal stylings of Aretha Franklin, possible. Unfortunately, it made our airways more vulnerable to accidental blockages by boluses of food."""

As Bryson writes, “We pass our existence within this warm wobble of flesh and yet take it entirely for granted.” We are the product of three billion years of evolutionary refinement, a biological machine of unimagined complexity, and yet most of us can’t even identify where the spleen is, or what it does.If this book doesn’t pique your interest in how your body works, then nothing probably will. Bryson takes the reader through each body system, describing the anatomy and physiology of each, but also providing historical information, expert interviews, and biographical details on the pioneers of medical discovery. Bryson, as usual, writes in an informative and entertaining way, presenting information in clever ways (for example, when he states that a portion of your cerebral cortex the size of a grain of sand can hold 1.2 billion copies of this book.) The book is filled with calculations and analogies like this to help the reader better contextualize the information.I also appreciate how Bryson doesn’t mindlessly repeat the cliches we always here without doing his research. It’s commonly stated that we only use 10 percent of our brains, or that our body contains 10 times as many bacterial cells as human cells. It turns out that these statements, among many others, are false, and Bryson shows you why. He doesn’t take anything for granted and researches all such claims.You will also come to understand—not only how much you don’t understand about the body—but also how much of the body no one understands. The body is unfathomably complex, and many areas and functions remain mysterious. If I had to say anything negative about the book, it would be the lack of illustrations. Some diagrams would be helpful, especially on the sections covering anatomy, as it’s hard to visualize the structures as he’s describing them. Also, don’t expect to dive too deeply into the functioning of each body system—the details are selective and you’re going to get equal measures of the history behind the discoveries. This is not a bad thing, as long as you’re expecting it. Overall, this is probably the best popular book on the subject, and a good entry point for further study in anatomy, physiology, human evolution, or medicine."
45,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041973-josh,4,"This was my first foray into Bryson territory and it was an interesting experience.I finished this the day prior to Christmas just an hour or two before a nice meal. Did I feel a little guilty about what I was putting in my body directly after I read The Body? Not really, to be honest.I learned a few things here and there that I didn't know (hormones are even made in our bones!), but overall it was a reading experience that was helped along by his writing and humor.There are multiple times, practically in each chapter that he makes the statement ""fact fact fact...and no one is exactly sure why?"". That in itself makes you think.In summary, Bryson's facts and anecdotes give you: an overall sense of being in this world, educate you on just about every topic there is when it comes to your body and causes a sense of panic and a few funny faces while you read things you'd rather not know. If you're squeamish or worried about all these little things that crawl inside us or even on our scalps, face, hands, feet, etc, then...this may not be the best thing to cuddle up with this winter on a gloomy day."
46,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"A fascinating look at the human body. This would definitely be a good one for readers who have wanted to better understand what happens inside us but who might be intimidated by real ""science-y"" books. I will say: Bryson is still a 60+ year old white man and that shows in some of how he approaches stuff in here, and his inability to humanize fat bodies or the weaknesses of ""overweight"" as the factor in many illnesses is a bit embarrassing. "
47,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/912138-alex-givant,5,"WOW, what a ride! This books covers everything from head to toes, telling you how different park of your body function and malfunction. Loved it, planning to read many more time, too much info to digest in one time. Highly recommended!"
48,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,A great Bryson book. It goes through every part of the body and explains some bits of history of understanding and bits of modern science—all with humor and wit. 
49,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75157-carol,5,"If I could, I would give this book UNLIMITED STARS!! Do you want to know everything about the human body without reading an unintelligible, dry text book? This is it!! I could not put this book down even to eat or go to bed. There is no way you can read this book and still not believe there is a creator or want to get rid of that little life inside of his/her mother. Life is a miracle and so unbelievably complicated and perfect that it still cannot be understood by human beings -- only lived.Every molecule in our bodies has to work in perfect harmony in order for us to have a healthy life -- it is truly an amazing story. I have a degree in Applied Science and have studied biology, physiology, chemistry, etc., but this is the book that brought it all home!I have read all books authored by Bill Bryson because I love his humor -- however, this is not his normal humorous writing. This book is for education and interest. That he could take such a complicated subject matter and make it so entirely readable and understandable for any education level is genious on his part. It is a must read...."
50,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72907701-dax,4,"Bryson has become Old Mr. Reliable. You know what you can expect from him: solid writing, thorough research and a lot of humor. In this case, his humor is very welcome since quite a few of the topics are... kind of scary. More than 8,000 ways to die from internal complications, antibiotics crisis, cancer..and hundreds of other diseases and malfunctions. This is not a book for a hypochondriac, but it has a ton of interesting facts. I particularly enjoyed hearing about doctors and scientists who played key roles in discovering diseases or treatments for illnesses. A lot of trial and error, a lot of poor judgement calls. A much more entertaining read than you might expect. Excellent."
51,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This is the first Bill Bryson I have read in a while. I was hoping it would be something like ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" which was truly delightful and informative. This is captivating, has the latest scientific results and is very informative - but only very occasionally funny. If you want to brush up your highschool human biology, this is a very effective way to do it."
52,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4438781-anna,4,"A fascinating exploration of what makes our bodies function. Well researched and insightful, I learned a lot and truly came to appreciate the miracle of human existence."
53,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,5,"This book is everythiiiinnnngggggg 5/5 stars.Bill Bryson goes over mostly everything about the body, everything that has significance at least. He explains the main things about each component of the body with enough detail to pretty much skim the surface on everything. He doesn't dive into the full scientific aspects but makes it readable and understandable to the masses that have a bit of scientific knowledge. The book is not for people who know nothing about the body because reading this book would be overload, but it's not for people who know a lot of knowledge about the body because they would probably know most of this book. But even people who know mostly about the body would appreciate the historic facts and backstories Bryson provides.The book goes over bodily things, what, how, why, where, and then goes into some interesting history of how we got to the what, how, why, where.A great book, definitely a re-read, tons of knowledge here. It's very textbook and it took me a long time to finish the book.I would have to re-read it for full notes but here's some that I jotted down:- we actually really don't know a lot about science, like we don't have cure's for many many conditions- spanish flu was the worst epidemic ever- Man cancer is really bad =/ treatments use to be so barbaric lol cutting off a boob with a knife- Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, insomnia, Y chromosome shrinking, a fetus having millions of eggs, reproduction- There can be so many issues with lungs. There is no cure for asthma and we don't know why or how we get it lol same with hiccups- Our immune system is super smart and can be super dumb lol""- Bipedalism (walking on two legs/feet) is actually a beautiful thing that humans have just recently developed in relation to the test of time. Even when apes walk they have to waddle because there legs, spine, even their neck/head isn't meant to stand upright.- Pancreas, spleen, gall bladder- Man... lobotomy's were really a crazy thing back then eh... sticking an ice pick past your eyeball and wiggling it around your brain gahhhhh- We have about 30 trillion human cells, and 30-50 trill bacteria cells so we’re just a big fat watery bacteria 85% of our cells are red blood cells which actually aren’t true cells at all because they don’t have the typical cell machinery like nuclei and mitochondria. Red bloods cells are only containers for hemoglobin. We'v about 20k human genes in us but 20m bacteria genes so really we are 99% bacterial and 1% you"
54,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25398561-andr-oliveira,4,What an interesting and at the same time terrifying book - so many things can go wrong with a body!
55,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61187238-pani,5,"Bill Bryson did it again! Honestly he can make every topic interesting! Even biology and human anatomy.Being a wonderful trave guide, this time Bryson takes us through a highly delightful tour of the human body. The book is packed with a lot of interesting information, but it’s not overwhelming or too much for a pleasure reader. It is full of astonishing facts - for instance did you know that it takes more time for food to go down in the digestive system of a woman’s body than a man’s? Or that you shed half a kilo of skin everyday? Or even a crazier one is that you get cancer everyday! Or you would do if your natural defences weren’t such troopers!The biggest takeaway I had from this book was that although mankind has had amazing accomplishments in medicine and science, we’re still a very long way from knowing how and why a lot of things work. Also, it is very possible to live a good life, we just have to take care of the body we occupy. Highly recommended!"
56,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5163359-jill-s,3,"Take a shot every time Bill Bryson says ""couch potato.""*I love Bill Bryson's writing, and this book started out strong. I found myself making little noises of surprise (huh!) throughout the first few chapters. There is a lot of interesting tidbits about biology and anatomy and all the other -ologies. Bryson brings his signature style of retelling fascinating and long-forgotten stories of the people who made scientific breakthroughs throughout history. These are the moments where Bryson really shines.Bryson's science writing does get a bit repetitive and dry towards the end, and increasingly abrupt. It does make the last quarter or fifth of this book a little bit of a slog.However, I had to knock this book down a star because Bryson's obsession with weight is truly distracting. It truly feels like he takes every opportunity, whether sensical or not, to comment on how fat we're all getting and how it's going to kill us all. I found this incredibly outdated and tone deaf, especially since much of the data he uses has been proven false, and his general tone is one of: fat people are lazy and sit down all day and if they just lived sensibly (this is verbatim, btw; ""sensibly"") then he wouldn't have to be burdened by writing about us jiggly fat lards. (Which seems rich coming from him since he, himself, is not known for being particularly svelt...but that's none of my business.) Every time I thought he was done with the fat shaming, he found another completely unnecessary moment to drop in how fat people are ill and miserable and are causing their own deaths. It truly infected a lot of the last 2/3rds of this book and was a ginormous wet blanket on this book for me.*Has anyone even said couch potato since 1998?"
57,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15962370-sarah,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading, and learned a lot from, Bryson's latest release, which meanders chapter-by-chapter through advances in medical knowledge around various human body systems and processes. However, I'm not sure that it's quite at the same level for bringing the layperson up to speed as his previous title A Short History of Nearly Everything.I was particularly struck by the number of medical and scientific pioneers who have never been widely recognised for their accomplishments, or at least not until long after their own demise. According to Bryson, there are many largely undeserved Nobel prizes out there!I should also mention that I occasionally found the copy editing rather puzzling - in several instances paragraphs ran on into completely different topics, where I feel a paragraph break would have been warranted. There was also a lot of inexplicable redirection in topics, only for the text to return to the original subject several paragraphs later. I felt the book as a whole would have been more effective, and certainly its content easier for the reader to digest, had it been edited more thoughtfully."
58,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568901-avid,5,"This is a very informative and in-depth look at what the heck our bodies are/do. It explores disease and really cool capabilities and phenomena, in addition to just your regular functions. It’s not exactly bryson-humorous, but it does have a bit lighter tone for a science book. With bryson’s established quality/brand, this should be an easy handsell."
59,0385539304,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18643650-mark-porton,3,"I was really looking forward to The Body - A Guide for Occupants - by Bill Bryson, I mean, really looking forward to it.Bryson takes us through the human body in a way that makes sense, each chapter is dedicated to a certain organ or system. He starts with the outside, the skin, and then systematically proceeds through chapters titled The Brain, The Heart and Blood, The Immune System, The Guts, Sleep and so on. This goes on for 23 chapters.I need to be careful not to be unfair here as I suppose your enjoyment of this lengthy book probably depends on what you expect from it. If you want to learn about most of the major elements of the body, particularly coming in as a freshman, this is the book for you. You will find Bryson covers each topic more than adequately and doesn't drill down too much to become academic. He touches each subject lightly and sufficiently. There is a lot to learn, and the historical insights are particularly fascinating. The latter is what Bryson usually does particularly well.My expectation here - rightly or wrongly - was to have a right, rollicking, gut busting laugh. I remember reading A Short History of Nearly Everything and there were many times in that book I just couldn't breathe, I found it that funny. Particularly the anecdotes about mad, desperate, profoundly intelligent scientists and audacious pioneers getting themselves into ludicrous situations. This is what I wanted here, chapter after chapter I was waiting for that massive belly laugh and it just didn't come. It's not only the story one normally finds funny, it's Bryson's impressive command of the English language that usually gets me. In many ways, there is nothing funnier than the written word. But for me, with this book, not this time. So, it is a good book and if you want a good all round education in pretty much everything to do with the human body with some interesting historical perspectives thrown in, you'll like this book a lot. If you are after fits of laughter, like I was, you may not get them - he's written funnier stuff.I can only give this one 3 stars, which is probably unfair as my expectations were so high.3 Stars"
