0,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,4,"(Nearly 4.5) In this absorbing and well-written work of popular science, Marchant, a journalist with a PhD in genetics and medical microbiology, investigates instances where the mind seems to contribute to medical improvement: the use of placebos in transplant recipients, hypnosis for IBS patients, virtual reality to help burn victims manage pain, and the remarkable differences that social connection, a sense of purpose, meditation and empathic conversation all make. On the other hand, she shows how stress and trauma in early life can set (usually poor) people up for ill health in later years. She also travels everywhere from Boston to Lourdes to meet patients and medical practitioners, and even occasionally proffers herself as a guinea pig.A relentless scientist, Marchant is skeptical of any claims for which there is no hard evidence, so when she acknowledges that there’s something to these unusual treatments, you know you can believe her. As Jeremy Howick of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford puts it, “I think it’s more important to know that something works, than how it works.” I finished the book feeling intrigued and hopeful about what this might all mean for the future of medicine. The problem, though, is that most medical trials are funded by big pharmaceutical companies, which won’t be supportive of non-traditional methods or holistic approaches.(Compare with

1,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,5,"Fascinating stuff! Marchant reminds us at every turn that more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of many of the brain related health benefits she talks about, but still... so intriguing!Marchant, a writer of popular science with respectable science-y credentials (PhD in genetics and medical microbiology, according to her website), presents this exploration of some of the current research and trials into ways that alternative medicine is trying to assist or replace conventional medicine in treating various health problems. Despite having read fairly recently some other books which described ways that the brain can alter perceptions of reality and physical systems in the body, I am generally skeptical about the power of things like hypnosis, meditation, and mindfulness to cure physical ailments (things like that seem more plausible to me as remedies for depression and stress). This is pretty much the attitude Marchant conveys at the book's opening also, which inclined me to feel comfortable in joining her on a tour of mind-focused health remedies. She begins with a story of chatting with another mom at a park during an outing with her kids, and of her dismay at this intelligent woman's reliance on homeopathic remedies. Homeopathy, she tells us, is based on the idea that the most minimal traces of an “active substance” can effect a cure. “My new friend looked at me scornfully. “Nothing measurable,” she replied, as if I were slightly dim for not grasping that its healing properties are due to an indefinable essence that's beyond scientists' reach. And in those two words, I felt that she summed up one of the major philosophical battles in medicine today.”The book has two main parts, divided roughly as Marchant says, “In writing this book, I traveled around the world to investigate some of the pioneering research that's happening in this area right now. My aim was to track down those scientists swimming against mainstream opinion to study the effects of the mind on the body, and using that knowledge to help patients. What can the mind really do? How does it work, and why? And how can we use those latest findings in our own lives? We start with perhaps the purest example of mind's influence on the body – the placebo effect – and the scientists looking at what really happens when we take fake pills. After that we explore some astonishing ways to trick the mind into fighting disease, from using hypnosis to slow gut contractions, to training the immune system to respond to taste and smell. And we learn how simply hearing the right words from your caregiver can determine whether or not you need surgery – and even how long you live.  The second half of the book moves beyond the immediate effects of thoughts and beliefs to look at how our state of mind shapes disease risk throughout our lives. We visit scientists using brain scanning and DNA analysis to test whether mind-body therapies from meditation to biofeedback really make us healthier. And we look at how our perception of the world around us influences our physical makeup, right down to the activity of our genes.”I found the first chapter, on the placebo effect, a fascinating introduction to the subject. Marchant describes some patients who were “cured” of their problems after being treated with fake medicines or surgeries. Rather than writing this off as merely wishful thinking on the part of the subjects, however, we learn that as a result of expectations, the patients' brains released chemicals in the same way they would have if treated by conventional means. We see this, for example, in the case of a Parkinson's patient who, brain scans demonstrate, gets the same improvement in the response of her motor neurons from her placebo that she does from the drug used in her treatment. “Benedetti (an Italian neuroscientist) has chased a belief right down to an individual cell – demonstrating that in Parkinson's patients, motor neurons fire more slowly after injection of a placebo, exactly as they do in response to a real drug.” Marchant continues through various mind-related treatments, always presenting her material in a lively, engaging, nontechnical way which the common reader should find easy to follow. I was reminded of Oliver Sacks, Sam Kean, Bill Bryson, and others who have the wonderful gift of presenting the work of specialists and cases of subjects they describe in such a clear and interesting way that the nonspecialist reader feels that highly technical subjects are really quite understandable after all. Details of nervous system and immune system function all fit together nicely, as presented, and I felt (very briefly) quite at home with things like the amygdala and the parasympathetic nervous system.She notes where study sizes are too small for results to be meaningful, and also instances where other specialists in the field involved offer particular objections to an alternative treatment. She also comments on where evidence of the effectiveness of an alternative medical treatment is strong, but where the medical system fails to pay attention, often due in large part to opposition by the powerful interests of drug and medical technology companies.  Marchant concludes with a call for greater openness to treatments which harness the power of the mind to heal the body. Without discounting the amazing advances of modern drugs and surgical techniques, she advocates an approach which also recognizes the importance of human relationships and support. ”I am not advocating relying solely on the mind to heal us; but denying its role in medicine surely isn't the answer either. My hope, then, is that this book might help to overcome some of the prejudice against mind-body approaches, and to raise awareness that taking account of the mind in health is actually a more scientific and evidence-based approach than relying ever more heavily on physical interventions and drugs. Perhaps one day this realization might help lead towards a system of medicine that combines the best of both worlds: one that uses life-saving drugs and technologies when they are needed, but also supports us to reduce our risk of disease and to manage our own symptoms when we are ill; and when there is no cure, cares for us and allows us to die with dignity. I hope that such a system of medicine would respect patients as equal participants whose beliefs, experiences, and preferences matter in their care; and that it would no longer stigmatize those with unexplained symptoms; and that it would recognize that the vast majority of health problems we face aren't physical or psychological – they are both.”I received this book from LibraryThing through their Early Reviewers program with the understanding that the content of my review would not affect my likelihood of receiving books through the program in the future. Many thanks to Crown Publishers and LibraryThing!"

Cure is a balanced and relatable feat of science journalism. Once we started reading we couldn’t put it down.Jo Marchant goes to the forefront of mind-body medical research and uncovers case studies that offer an impressive insight into the relationship between the mind and body. The anecdotes Marchant uses to reveal this relationship are fascinating. From virtual reality simulations that ease pain in burn patients, to placebo effects that re-engage autistic children, Cure cuts through the noise to provide a thoughtful, in-depth study.You don’t need a science major or a medical PhD to enjoy this book. Regardless of your background this is a topic that will interest everyone. As Publishers Weekly said in their STARRED review, Cure is: ""A critically needed conceptual bridge for those who are frustrated with pseudoscientific explanations of alternative therapies but intrigued by the mind’s potential power to both cause and treat chronic, stress-related conditions.""Read Marchant’s popular LinkedIn article ‘How to Thrive on Stress’: www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-thrive-str...Listen to an interview on NPR: www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/201..."

I grew up in household that eschewed medical care and relied entirely on prayer for healing. Since leaving that environment in my 20s, I've wondered how intelligent people like my parents can feel that this belief or practice healed them. Reading Cure helped me find some answers, and perhaps the information it discusses will help you. Although I suspect your reasons for reading are different. Author Jo Marchant reviews a wide variety of mind-body techniques, such as hypnotherapy, meditation, placebo and nocebo effects, virtual reality, bioelectronics, and religious pilgrimages. In each case she interviews experts and researchers who are trying to prove or disprove the way their chosen techniques impacts our bodies, our health, and our longevity. Thankfully, she tells patient stories to bring the research-heavy text a human element. Marchant takes a potentially dry subject and infuses it with warmth and humor. She genuinely wants to understand the connection between mind and body. And the conclusions she draws help show how people living with chronic illness, pain, and even life-threatening conditions can benefit from mind-body or holistic approaches along with medical care. She says in her acknowledgements, ""I started this book fascinated by the science of how our minds might influence our bodies, but speaking to patients and trial volunteers helped me to realize that, beyond its intellectual importance, this subject has profound practical consequences for our health and how we all live our lives.""For the first time, I have some solid data-driven conclusions about why and how a group of people could believe in faith healing. This made the book well worth my time! "
4,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne,5,"“…in many situations, we have the capacity to influence our own health, by harnessing the power of the (conscious and unconscious) mind”Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body is the third book by British scientist, science journalist and editor, Jo Marchant. In it, she looks at many different, often “alternative” therapies and examines the claims they make in a rational and thoughtful manner. Many of the results are not just unexpected, but frequently quite astounding. If Text had offered a “be surprised or your money back” guarantee on this one, it would have been a safe bet for them.Quoting actual trials and real patients, Marchant reveals some stunning facts about placebos, looks at how to train the immune system, fighting fatigue, hypnotherapy for a myriad of ailments, and pain therapy of quite a different nature (will some future pain relief trials be funded by gaming software developers?). Marchant looks at biofeedback, mindfulness, talk therapy, reiki and prayer, and reports amazing results in conditions as diverse as autism, IBS, spinal surgery, ageing, HIV, childbirth third degree burns, autoimmune disease, Parkinson’s and transplant rejection.She speculates on a different approach to aged care: “What if reshaped care for the elderly not around managing their decline, but harvesting their abilities? We could use that ageing brain to give back to a society that’s in great need…..We don’t know what the message does to a person when they are told ageing is a time of deterioration. If we reframe it, and say ageing is a time to give back to others, it might actually help them age better”She concludes that “…the vast majority of health problems we face aren’t physical or psychological – they are both”. She also tells us “At the heart of almost all the pathways I’ve learned about is one guiding principle: if we feel safe, cared for and in control – in a critical moment during injury or disease, or generally throughout our lives – we do better. We feel less pain, less fatigue, less sickness. Our immune system works with us instead of against us. Our bodies ease off on emergency defences and can focus on repair and growth”.All the information that Marchant conveys may be readily available, but her talent, no doubt a product of her career in both science and journalism, is to compile and present it in an easily understandable form for readers without scientific expertise. Readers will find themselves looking at how they can apply these discoveries to their own lives and the lives of those they care about, not just for treatment of illness, but for ways to improve their quality of life now and in the future. An absolutely fascinating read."
5,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,4,"Non-fiction in which Jo Marchant takes a scientific approach to recounting the latest research on the mind-body connection. She undertook this effort to find out the latest on what the mind can and cannot do to assist in achievement of overall better health and quality of life. Topics include the placebo effect, mindfulness meditation, the immune system, virtual reality, pain management, social connection, kindness in caregiving, stress, aging, depression, hypnosis, electrical impulses, and much more.A self-professed skeptic and advocate for the scientific method, she systematically explores each topic and examines results of recent research. She brings a human component to these findings by providing case studies of people currently going through treatment. For the most part, these are people she has met, and she tells their stories in an empathetic way. The scientific jargon is kept to a minimum, and the concepts are explained in a straightforward manner. She is careful to cite areas where more research is needed, and documents dissenting opinions. Unfortunately, the pharmaceutical companies, which sponsor a vast amount of current research, are not motivated to spend money to support experiments that may reduce the need for their products.In the author’s words:”I am not advocating relying solely on the mind to heal us; but denying its role in medicine surely isn't the answer either. My hope, then, is that this book might help to overcome some of the prejudice against mind-body approaches, and to raise awareness that taking account of the mind in health is actually a more scientific and evidence-based approach than relying ever more heavily on physical interventions and drugs.”Recommended to those interested in health and brain-related science. Those with current health issues may discover some helpful coping strategies."
6,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"Marchant, a science writer with a PhD in genetics and microbiology, delves deep into the mind-body connection in her 2016 book Cure. For someone new to this field of study, it is a great place to start, as the book is more of a survey map of several types of therapies that incorporate mind and body. She props the text with many well-known and referenced works in medicine and psychology. If you have read in this field, you'll find some review here, but with some intriguing case studies and stories of new research.The book shines when discussing the science around the placebo effect, the importance of human connection and interaction, visualizations and technology's role in healing, and the science of the vagus nerve and its regulation role in the body.3.5 rounded to 4 stars"
7,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,5,"Most books about the mind-body connection seem to be wildly leaning one way or the other: it's nonsense or it's gospel. Cure by Jo Marchant is different. Marchant cautiously approaches each claim in a deeply scientific way, remaining both open and skeptical to results. I loved this read and I highly recommend it. It's a readable book, with both stories and science, to investigate all the many ways mind and body are connected. If you have interest in this topic, without permanently aligning yourself to one end of the spectrum or the other, I think you will find this book to be fascinating."
8,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"The field of alternative medicine is plagued with claims that can be as misleading as they are lethal. In Simon Singh’s book, Trick or Treatment, he covers aa number of the alternative medicines with a solid scientific rebuttal of those that fail to live up to expectations. But is there something going on that science is beginning to uncover? In this book Marchant considers the latest scientific research into the effect that our minds can have over our bodies, with solid evidence of the effects of positive thoughts and mindsets.In the book she considers some fairly fundamental questions; the way our minds work, the almost magical effect of placebo, the management of pain and how the act of caring for someone can be transformative. There are chapters on training your immune system and the power of friendships. All of these things, when used in conjunction with a sympathetic doctor and the appropriate course of drugs can have an amazing effect compared to just regular treatments. Alternative medicine has lots of flaws, but what it does do well is to spend time with and care about the patient, something that conventional appointments with their rushed 10 minute slots and almost guaranteed prescription at the end of the consultation seems to have now lost. Throughout the book she meets with the scientists, doctors and patients who are at the leading edge of this research, bringing us their perspectives and trying to articulate why they think that it is working. When reading this it did bring to mind Pratchett’s headology, the way that people see themselves and the world around them. But this is about real lives and people who are being treated with regular medicines, but who are fortunate to have doctors who are considering the whole individual at the same time. Marchant writes this with sparkling clarity and authority, and thankfully rarely dips into obscure medical jargon. It made for very interesting reading too, with some well written examples of those that have been healed or had their lives return to something closer to normal. Based on the research here, we need to consider both mind and body treatments not just a blind acceptance of the newest drugs. All very interesting stuff and much food for thought."
9,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1192324-ana,5,"Five big, fat, shiny stars. But this book deserves a good review, so I will take some more time and write it tomorrow. Right now, I am still in the process of mourning the fact that it came to the end so soon...And here is my complete review.Quite frankly, I am not sure I will be able to write something that makes justice to the quality of this book, which is among the best non-fiction I’ve read lately.The book deals with a controversial issue, the influence of human mind over physical condition, and describes the cutting-edge research currently ongoing in this area. I like the skepticism of the author, who has a scientific background herself (a BSc in genetics and a PhD in microbiology), having later become a science writer. I think some of the main reasons why I liked this book so much were the fact that the theme is so interesting and yet controversial, and the research being done in new, still ongoing. I liked to have access to information contained in the book (some of it left me dumbfounded) and I really liked the way it is presented, in the form of case studies, narrated as patient’s stories, paired with interviews with scientists and doctors, citations from scientific papers and the author’s own experience. In addition, she makes a point of always presenting the opposing points of view and the arguments for and against the idea, hypothesis, or experiment in question. And yet, this thought-provoking book, packed with so much information and written with scientific accurateness, reads just like a novel...I was going to finish by saying that I recommend this book to everyone with an interest in science in general and in health in particular, but in fact I think this is a book that I would recommend to everyone that likes o read non-fiction. Really, just go get it and read it!"
10,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19214043-doris,5,"I appreciated this book for presenting a well-researched and balanced perspective on the importance of taking care of the mind- through maintaining a resilient mindset, social support, and compassion- in the maintenance of wellbeing. In short, the mind & body comes together and works together in cultivating total health. Jo Marchant has presented this idea clearly with very compelling information."
11,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,5,"(Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com]. I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.)As a middle-aged guy with barely any health insurance and who is officially now pushing 50, I find myself more and more interested in lively NPR-style nonfiction guides to taking your health into your own hands; and that subject doesn't get much more dramatic than Jo Marchant's brand-new Cure, instantly controversial for its main message, that traditional science is starting to more and more prove something that the New Agers have been saying for decades, that your thoughts and attitudes can and do have a direct influence over such physiological, biological traits like your mood, pain levels, even the way your autoimmune system works. Although let's be clear -- the PhD holder Marchant says right in the introduction that New Age BS is still New Age BS, that it's simply impossible to do things like ""wish away cancer"" or trick a diabetic body into thinking it's getting insulin when it's not, and that the vast majority of new discoveries about this subject have mostly to do with things that the brain and the brain alone controls in our bodies, things like our heartrate and the amount of hormones that get released into our bloodstream, the amount of pain we perceive, even such things like how tired or alert we feel when fighting off the flu. That said, however, this book is a real revelation, especially mind-blowing because of all of it being based on actual Western-type scientifically rigorous testing going on around the world, showing through lab-based control-tested experiments such things as that placebo pills can often work just as well as ""real"" medicine in certain cases (even when the patient knows they're taking a placebo), that you can train your body like a Pavlovian dog to get a full effect out of half-doses of medicine, that a 99-cent iPhone app can let regular schmoes regulate things like their heartbeat in a way traditionally reserved for yogis who practice for decades, and that such seemingly innocuous things like meditation and having friends who take care of you when sick have an actual, quantifiable effect on the biological processes that go into recovering from illness. As Marchant says throughout this eye-opening tome, you need to take all of these things with a grain of salt (and in fact this is a big running theme throughout, that all of these findings need much more official studies before we can start taking them for granted, which are nearly impossible to get funded because 95 percent of the medical experiments done in this country are sponsored by drug companies, who have no interest in funding experiments that prove that people need less drugs and not more); but certainly this book has given me a brand-new way to look at the subject of illness and just how much control I actually have over it, an illuminating read that is worth your time regardless of what kinds of conclusions you come to by the end. Strongly recommended to one and all.Out of 10: 9.3 "
12,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12763282-jackie-law,5,"Medical research scientists are required to be rigorous in their investigations but also open minded to the lessons that can be learned, both positive and negative, from the results of clinical trials. Drugs that show early promise may not be as effective when tested over the long term on a wide variety of subjects. Side effects of treatments and surgical interventions can be as harmful as the problems they attempt to resolve.While doctors may be eager to find more effective treatments, particularly for the growing number of chronic conditions, there are deep seated biases against certain alternatives: homeopathic remedies, mindfulness and meditation, distraction techniques, hypnotism, religious belief. What Cure sets out to do is to look at the trials that have been undertaken around such so called woo woo treatments and scientifically question their efficacy.The book opens with an investigation into the placebo – pills given to patients that are known to contain no active ingredient, or treatment that has been shown not to work after accounting for the placebo effect in test results. Time and again trials show that many patients’ outcomes improve when given a placebo. The author asks why such a cheap and easy alternative is not offered when it could have clinical value. It is now known that the body is capable of producing its own powerful drugs, e.g. endorphins. The brain is a natural pharmacy.“If someone takes a placebo and feels their pain melt away, it isn’t trickery, wishful thinking, or all in the mind. It is a physical mechanism, as concrete as the effects of any drug.”There are important limitations in the placebo as treatment; it is limited to the natural tools that the body has available.“Placebos are good at influencing how we feel but there’s little evidence that they affect measures we’re not consciously aware of”“Feeling great isn’t everything. We also want to be kept alive.”Yet for those who do not feel great, placebos could offer a welcome improvement in the way they live. Certain patient groups, especially those with chronic conditions such as CFS / ME, reject that the mind can have such an important impact as they then feel they are being blamed for their illness. This separation of the mind and the body, and the biases such thinking uncovers, may be one reason why the treatments looked at in this book are often dismissed.Another reason is the difficulty of obtaining funding for large scale clinical trials. Drugs companies are unlikely to support investigations into treatments that will lead to fewer expensive drugs being administered.Living with long term stress has been shown to create physiological damage and to rewire the brain.“people in a threat state take longer to recover to baseline once a task is over […] Over time, the extra strain on the heart can lead to hypertension. And as we’ve seen, repeated activation of cortisol can damage the immune system.”The author investigates a variety of alternative treatments that attempt to train the body to deal with challenges and decrease the harm caused.“Just as with physical exercise, if we put our bodies under a manageable amount of stress, then go home and rest, this eventually makes us stronger and more resilient.”The effects of meditation and mindfulness are studied and compared to the effects of antidepressants. Once again, certain patients enjoy benefits yet many medical practitioners dismiss such treatments as nonsense, the proponents delusional. Prejudices are strong.One problem with alternative and holistic treatments is the way modern medicine is practiced. In the UK an initial consultation typically involves a ten minute GP appointment with the expectation at the end that there will be a prescription or potential for surgical intervention. There may not be a pill for every ill but there could be minimally invasive and effective treatment if the patient is willing.Drugs for stress, depression and chronic pain are costly with damaging side effects such as risk of addiction. Trials have shown time and again that mind-body techniques can work better on many. Despite the evidence, stigma remains.Religion is shown to have a placebo effect although only if compassionate and accepting rather than threatening. A sense of belonging – the importance of community and damage caused by loneliness – are also investigated. There is a beneficial effect on health when a patient feels they are a part of something bigger.“the prolonged impact of having the opportunity to live your life in a way that you find meaningful”The author is asking: if an alternative treatment works for a patient then why mock and dismiss it? It is clearly stated that a patient may not simply wish themselves better yet there are ways in which the conscious mind can influence outcomes and deal better with painful situations. There is also the argument that keeping alternative medicine within the NHS allows for regulation and the ability to offer conventional treatments as needed. The potential for harm is acknowledged, such as when proven beneficial medications such as vaccines are withheld for spurious reasons.Each chapter contains details of a variety of patients’ experiences alongside interviews with clinicians and references to papers and journals in which studies are detailed. Throughout, the writing is warm and accessible, the tone clear and inquiring rather than dogmatic. The reader may decide for themselves if improvements in health are worthwhile even if treatment cannot always be fully, scientifically explained in the traditionally accepted way.Any Cop?: This is a fascinating approach to a controversial subject. The author offers due diligence and a willingness to look for facts without prejudice. The workings of the mind may not yet be fully understood by doctors but this doesn’t mean it cannot be harnessed for innovative and effective treatments. The book offers a compelling and persuasive contribution to a wider conversation. It may change the way rational and informed readers view alternative medicine."
13,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83141-jdk1962,4,"A lot of very interesting ideas about how the mind can be leveraged to deal with physical injuries or illness. The early material on the power of placebos--including honest placebos--is especially fascinating. A topic that comes up again and again is how damaging stress is to the physical body, and how growing up in stress can lead to a lifetime of chronic problems. It's a shame that this is an area in which research moves so slowly, due to the lack of funding (not too many drug companies want to sponsor research into a replacement product that doesn't come out of a bottle).I especially appreciated the skeptical mindset that the author brings to the work. So-called alternative therapies should not be afraid of the scientific method: if things work, they work, and rigorously studying the how and the why is fascinating stuff. It's the snake-oil crowd that fears looking too closely. "
14,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6476980-rebecka,3,"The content of this book is very, very interesting, but both the author and the audio book narrator ruin the book, the author by ridiculous descriptions of the people she uses to make a point (who all have ""delicate features"", ""beautiful brown eyes"" etc. -- WHO CARES!?) and the audio book narrator by imitating the accent or dialect of EVERY SINGLE PERSON WITH A DIRECT LINE. As a result I can't help hating the author for having so many direct lines in her book as well. What happened to scientific books? Why are they all so full of fluff? Because they could really have been summed up in a 25 page article? Probably.Still, a very interesting read."

17,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42492733-ho-i-b-ng,5,"Having pretty much knowledge about alternative treatments and the impact of placebo effects, it was quite easy for me to start and appreciate this book.It's vital to know and understand the mind-body relationship and how the mind can shape people's physical condition (was proved by notorious scientific evidences and experiments). From that, alternative treatments can pass through all the stigmas to come close to the public health setting, provide other ways of healing not only for mental problem but also for physical illness. This is a good beginning to rethink about illness and healing, as well as to have some sense of what contributes to a better health of human. Highly recommend to anyone who in medical field or simply care about health and healing. "
18,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10911644-paula-vince,3,"I requested this book with a bit of trepidation. The concept that our minds are huge tools in our arsenal against disease has been close to my heart for a long time, but I got the feeling from reading Jo Marchant's bio that she wasn't going to just nod and accept it without a lot of probing around. Still, at least she embarked on her personal quest with an understanding that the mind/body connection shouldn't be shrugged off by the cynical as hogwash. Since it's widely agreed by medical experts that negative mental states such as stress and anxiety have detrimental effects on the body, why not consider the flip side, that positive, happy states can be beneficial? I'll mention her findings which I found most interesting.1) Marchant came up with evidence that continued stress may accelerate premature aging. Although external problems don't damage our bodies directly, our long term psychological responses to the stressful circumstances can certainly harm us. Marchant's subjects were worn-out mothers who are the primary carers of children with severe intellectual disabilities. Some of the them even noticed effects such as suddenly greying hair.2) The emotion of fear takes a severe toll on people. Although it's been suggested over the years that positive and negative stress have similar results on the body, Marchant has come to believe that their effects are way different. People with stressful childhood histories react far quicker to stress, and chronically stressed people find that small hassles escalate to full-blown anxiety far faster than others. These are measurable in the way the brain is wired, helping to explain why the effects of early adversity can persist long after others think it should have stopped.3) My favourite part was Marchant's discussion with the young father Gareth Walker who suffers from M.S. He made a personal discovery that a lifestyle of regular quiet time and living in the moment has helped him halt the process of his disease more than he'd believed possible. The conscious decision to change his thought patterns changed him from a reactive, fear-driven person who dreaded his future to a calmer man who recognises his thoughts as mere background chatter which he doesn't have to buy into. His is a philosophy I admire.Overall, I can't help wondering if Marchant has walked into her project with a closed mind, even though she tries to be impartial and fair. She says things like, 'I usually try my hardest to avoid religious ceremonies. I get uneasy about the idea of substituting reason and clear understanding for robes, incantations and mysterious higher powers.' She comes across as the sort of person who finds it impossible to accept a miracle on face value without scrabbling around for some measurable way to explain it. Anybody who wants to read this book should be aware that the author never considers the divine as a possible explanation at all. That's just not the sort of person she is.At the end, I'm left with the same feeling I get after watching current affair documentaries. After waiting for what seems to be advertised as promised breakthroughs, the journalists end up cautiously sitting on the fence, unwilling to commit themselves one way or another. And after all the words in this book, Jo Marchant seems to be doing the same thing. Still, it's interesting to read some of the direct results of her research, in spite of her not wanting to make a firm stand for the mind/body connection.I think my favourite book which delves into the mind/body connection written by a medical doctor is still The Fear Cure by Dr Lissa Rankin.Thanks to Crown Publishing and Blogging for Books for giving me a copy through NetGalley."
19,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"In a culture such as the US, one focused on drugs and surgery to maintain or increase health, Jo Marchant's Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body is a breath of fresh air. Marchant described strategies that are more effective, less expensive, and less invasive than those typically used in modern medicine. Many of the interventions described here will be unsurprising to psychologists. Others are firmly rooted in psychology, but surprising nonetheless. Burn patients using Snow World, a virtual reality environment, had 35% lower pain scores. This worked well for acute interventions (e.g., abrading scar tissue), but pain tended to rise again throughout the day; hypnosis helps patients maintain low levels of pain across time and decrease their need for narcotics. Patients receiving Comfort Talk (just as it sounds) during surgeries required lower levels of sedatives and had fewer complications. Early research suggests that people with transplants can use classically-conditioned placebos to reduce their immunosuppressants safely, receive similar benefits, and avoid the toxicity of these drugs. Palliative care is both less expensive than treatment as usual and extends lifespans.Why doesn’t the medical system use such interventions more frequently? Marchant repeatedly suggests that one difficulty is that the medical system tends to think dualistically – either mind or body – rather than recognizing the importance of both systems. Patients, also thinking dualistically, feel blamed by interventions focused on the mind (""you're saying I'm crazy, right?""). Further, because pharmaceutical companies cannot profit from treatments like Comfort Talk, they aren’t promoted and obtaining research grants is difficult. One clinician interviewed said that although Comfort Talk has a range of health benefits, she now focuses on its economic benefits rather than health outcomes when talking to hospital administrators: “that’s what [they’re] interested in” (p. 123). There are many modern-day snake oils that promise cures and which have little research supporting them. Perhaps another explanation for our focus on drugs and surgeries is that many interventions are demonstrated failures, with little to no support. The interventions Marchant describes are guilty by association with these fraudulent treatments. On the other hand, we readily jump at medications – which fit with our view of the world – that we accept with less support than some of the alternative medications have.One thing that especially interested me about this book is that Marchant has her PhD in microbiology. She approaches alternative medicines with a scientist's mind, and her writing and thinking are smart. As importantly, though, she is willing to see things that counter her biases. Maybe we can too."
20,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body, is book about the mind-body question, i.e. our mind's power to influence our body. However, if you are looking for ""scientific proof"" of religion, this is NOT a book for you. Jo Marchant's approach is very scientific. She is skeptical but also open-minded, which is what I think the right attitude towards this controversial topic.This book covers several topics. The first several chapters focus on the placebo and nocebo effect (the opposite of placebo affect). I have always been fascinated by the placebo effect. Modern medical science tends to see it as a distraction rather than something useful. Jo Marchant’s book is eyeopening. The placebo effect can trigger our body to release our own natural painkiller and mood booster. It will not regrow a leg or kill the cancer, but it can reduce pain and improve the quality of life. The book also talks about hypnosis. Apparently there are evidences especially in treating Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. The discussion about using Virtual Reality to help patients relax and reduce pain is very interesting. Perhaps it's time for gaming companies to dive into healthcare market. There are chapters about mind's influence on the immune system through the nerve system. Of course, meditation is discussed in the book as well, especially using meditation to fight stress and depression. As a beginner meditator, I have read several meditation books, so this part is nothing new to me.The chapters about compassionate care giving and value of social ties are good reading too. Modernisation is a double sided sword indeed.I am not surprised pharmaceutical companies reluctant to invest in placebo or hypnosis, because these would potentially damage their profit. Government should interfere - smaller drug dosage means less medical spending and better healthcare. The last chapter talks about religion. Whether believing in God helps someone to cope sickness depends many things, one is what you believe - is God a saver or punisher? When it helps, it is because ""feeling part of something bigger may help us not only to deal with life’s daily hassles but to defuse our deepest source of angst: knowledge of our own mortality"". However, this is not the same as the evidence of God. It does not have to be God - ""As individuals, rather than putting our faith in mystical rituals and practices, the science described in this book shows that in many situations, we have the capacity to influence our own health, by harnessing the power of the (conscious and unconscious) mind."""
21,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30833806-paul,4," I am always curious about the subject of how our bodies actually work. For everything we seem to know there are equal parts that we have yet to get to grips with. The human brain would defiantly appear to be one of those that we still have so much to learn about. It is capable of doing so much more than we give it credit for. So this is what brought me to Cure. Marchant going into this topic looking for answers that can be backed up with science in what I was told was a fair and even-handed approach to a topic that most have written off as scudo science and the world of new age and hippies.  The author starts off by telling us why she decides to write a book on the subject of how the brain can help manage pain and heal itself and the rest of the body. For me, this was a good pint as it gave me a good insight into her intentions and just how she was going to pick apart such a subject. From there she went on to break down many of the key subjects into chapters that were easy to digest. I found my self fascinated by which of these bits she chose to focus on. Somewhere to be expected such as our ability to use our minds when dealing with pain others I can safely say caught me off guard. It is also a case of how easily we can trick our own minds into believing things even when we know and have been told the very opposite.  There is a great deal to learn from this book, and for me, her style went a long way in making it not only an easy narrative to get on with but also enlightening me with so much new information. In following her top meet these people we get a more insightful look at such a subject than if it was simply dry fact and anecdotal stories. It was also interesting to see how the medical establishment reacts to these new findings. It makes you realize just how much the whole industry is driven by money. Be it from what they can make selling medicine to their worry of being sued for using less conventional methods. For me, if you can show me something works then I'm all for it, even if it's a matter of tricking my brain into being something works or not. For me, I think overall she did a good job of keeping her own biases to a minimum when going to look into this field. I appreciate that no one can truly complete keeps a neutral opinion on such matters.  Having never read anything by this author I was left feeling very impressed by this book. She did a great job in presenting not only her initial hypothesis but also where she was wrong in her own think and also where she had been correct. There is so much going on in this field that it is easy to mix in what truly works with people looking to make a quick buck. But for me the author this very well and I am left with the ability to recommend this book to all of you."
22,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-d-collins,4,"A special thank you to Crown, NetGalley, and LibraryThing Early Reviewers for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. Award-winning science writer Jo Marchant travels the world to meet the physicians, patients, and researchers on the cutting edge of this new world of medicine in her extraordinary book, CURE, A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body.  ""The healing power of the mind -or lack thereof; has thus become a key battleground in the bigger fight against irrational thinking."" Drawing on her training as a scientist and a science writer, Marchant precisely and thoroughly investigates both promising and improbable theories of the mind’s ability to heal the body.When the health problems we face aren’t just physical or psychological—they are both. By combining the best of both world, one day, hopefully a workable solution of medicine. Using life-saving drugs and technologies when they are needed, but also supports us to reduce our risk of disease and to manage our own symptoms when we are ill; and when there is no cure- allowing us to die with dignity. We cannot wish  ourselves better. Harnessing the power of the mind providing alternative treatments offering something conventional medicine has missed. There are ways we can use our conscious minds to influence from believing we have taken a pill or focusing on the present moment to seeking support of a loved one. If we feel safe, cared for, and in control during an injury or disease, we feel less pain, less fatigue, and our immune system works with us instead of against us. To focus on repair and growth. However even though the mind plays a role in health, this does not mean it can cure everything. As the author reiterates,  the problems with modern medicine run deep; clearly they will not all be solved by mind-body therapies. But trying to improve medical outcomes by treating patients as the complex human beings we are, rather than simply as physical bodies, is a good starting place.The implications of embracing the role of the mind in health go beyond medicine, based on the research in the book (stresses of poverty and inequality) are creating life-long chronic disease before babies are out of their nappies. Understanding the link  between mind and body—not just about health, medicine, or society, but something more fundamental. What it means to be human. It is now clear the principle holds true for health; our thoughts, beliefs, stress levels, and world views-- all influence how ill or well we feel. However, you don’t have to believe what your brain in saying. I recently read Michael A. Singer’s The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself-highly recommend. Also, Dr. Joe Dispenza's You Are the Placebo: Making Your Mind Matter.Physical reality— and in turn, the health of our physical bodies influences the state of our minds. As examples: Inflammation induces fatigue and depression. Low blood-sugar levels make us short tempered. Calming our bodies by slow breathing, improves our mood. The main threats facing us today are not acute infections, easily cured with a pill, but chronic stress-related conditions for which drugs are not nearly as effective. Shocking, the top ten highest grossing drugs in the US help only between 1 and 25 and 1 in 4 of the people who take them; statins may benefit as few as 1 in 50.Combined with the ongoing problem of physicians pushed to see more patients in less time, contributing to a loss of empathy among medical professionals. Our country spends $3 trillion a year on health care, meanwhile prescription drug use is high- almost half of Americans are on medications for cardiovascular disease and high cholesterol (both caused by high stress), with nearly 60% of adults aged over 65 taking five or more different drugs at any one time. From allergy side effects, adverse drug reaction, complications of medications, interventions, prescription drug abuse and the rise of antibiotic resistance, there needs to be other alternatives. The US is the richest country in the world yet even with trillions of dollars to spend, it cannot match the life expectancy of a middle-income country like Costa Rica.Unfortunately, the clinical trials are funded by drug companies who have no interest in proving the benefit of any approach to care that might reduce the need for their products. Sadly in comparison: ""Annual budget NIH $30 billion, versus .2% goes on testing mind-body therapies"". Marchant is not advocating relying solely on the mind to heal us, but denying its role in medicine surely isn’t the answer either. Her hope is that this book might help to overcome of the prejudice against mind-body approaches, and to raise awareness that taking account of the mind in health is actually a more scientific and evidence-based approach than relying ever more heavily on physical interventions and drugs.With our minds as well as our bodies shaped by evolution, we are built to hold beliefs that aid our health and survival, not that are necessarily true. There are powerful evolutionary forces driving to believe in a variety of remedies and faith, and some more positive than they are. By simply understanding how our minds influence and reflect our physiology, we can resolve that paradox and live in tune with our bodies in a way that is based on evidence, not delusion.Well-researched, informative, beautifully written, and laid out in easy to read chapters—""a must read""! Baby boomers will appreciate the immediate effects of thoughts and beliefs--how our state of mind shapes disease risk throughout our lives, especially as we move into older adults, with dementia, Alzheimer's, and other health concerns. On a personal note: I happen to be one of those, with a family history of heart disease, cancer, and high cholesterol. However, due to my severe allergies, I am unable to take any medications or undergo any procedures. Therefore, thyroid, heart, cholesterol, and other conditions are controlled by vegan diet, yoga, environmental changes, exercise, and low stress. I am a firm believer in the mind-body, meditation, and other ways to heal the body, versus medications. Embrace alternative treatment!  JDCMustReadBooks "
23,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9888786-ita,4,"If I had read only the first half of this book, I would have unreservedly recommended it. It is subtitled, ‘A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body’, but it is more than that. It is also a book about the people involved in the journey – the scientists, the clinicians, but, above all, the patients. Their stories are told with great empathy and compassion.The journey starts with the placebo and nocebo effects. We learn how powerful the placebo effect can be, but also its limitations. An understanding of it can enable people to be brought off excessive medication, but that understanding is still rare among health professionals, and resources are squandered in health systems. Nocebo effects are even less well known. We still don’t know the harm we may be doing by accompanying medication with long lists of side effects, and by publishing scary health stories in newspapers and on the Internet.Giving a placebo presents a health professional with an ethical dilemma. Jo Marchand assures us this need not be. An ethical placebo, where the patient knows (s)he is being given an inert medicine, may still have beneficial effects. In a trial involving seventy children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder a placebo was administered along with the effective medication. The active medication was then reduced, while the placebo was continued. Placebo- controlled dose reduction is still in the experimental stage, but promising results have been observed in patients with psoriasis and asthma as well as ADHD.How we insist that diseases are either biological or psychological, and are unwilling to allow that they can be both, is illustrated by the reaction of a patients’ group, representing people with chronic fatigue syndrome, to a new experimental treatment. The treatment combines graded exercise therapy with cognitive behavioural therapy. It is based on the hypothesis that, if you suffer from CFS, a central governor in your brain has its settings wrong, and is overestimating how fatigued you are. Although the treatment has been shown to be moderately helpful, and better than any existing treatment, it is opposed by a patients’ group, which insists that the disease is biological.I have no difficulty in accepting hypnosis as an effective treatment for pain relief, even as an anaesthetic, because I once saw a very powerful demonstration. With opioid addictions, and fatal overdoses described as ‘one of the great unfolding tragedies of our time’, I agree that hypnosis as a method of pain control needs to be given very serious consideration.‘There is tremendous prejudice against hypnosis,’ says Peter Whorwell. He has been using gut-focused hypnotherapy to help patients suffering from the very painful and distressing condition, irritable bowel syndrome. Since 1984, he has been publishing results which show the benefit of hypnotherapy to patients for whom other treatments have failed. A recent audit of a thousand patients showed that 76% had a clinically significant reduction in symptoms. 83% of responders were still well after one-to-five years. 59% were taking no medication. 41% were taking less. 79% were consulting their doctor less often, or not at all. Although NICE now recommends hypnotherapy for IBS where conventional treatments have failed, Whorwell says that he and others involved in the work are still fighting those who fund treatment.Our brains have a limited capacity for conscious attention, and distraction has long been recognised as a way of dealing with pain. Snow World is a very sophisticated form of distraction being used in Burns Units in the USA. When patients put on their virtual reality goggles and their headphones, they block out all sights and sounds from the outside world, and enter the Ice Canyon where they can fire snowballs with a computer mouse. Snow World consistently cuts pain scores by 35%. When used with pain medication, brain scans of patients show that activity in pain related areas is almost completely extinguished. When hypnotic suggestions are made, while the burns victim is immersed in Snow World, it is possible to extend relief from pain, and to aid recovery in the longer term.In the first half of the book, which dealt with the application of mind-body research in a health care setting, it was not difficult to see where Jo Marchand’s sympathies lay. However, it was while reading the final chapters, which suggested ways in which research might be used to guide decisions about keeping healthy, that I began to feel slightly uneasy. Although Jo Marchand has a PhD in genetics and medical microbiology, and says she believes passionately in the scientific method, she seemed to be selecting research that agreed with her beliefs, and underplaying that which disagreed. These are very reasonable and widely held beliefs – that stress is damaging to health, that continuity of care and friendship have positive effects, that prayer and belief are beneficial to health. The problem for me was that some of the studies she quoted were preliminary and small. I can’t help being sceptical about studies on the epigenetic effects of social interactions, for example, and I feel she underplayed the harm caused to some people by mindfulness meditation. However this is a book well worth reading, a story of lost opportunities to help those in greatest need, but also with promise for the future. "

25,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24761653-penni,5,"Cure, A Journey Into the Science of Mind Over Bodyby: Jo MarchantThe Mind-body connection was hijacked by Alternative medicine/ New age gurus, spiritual healers, in short: quacks.The hijacking has tainted the scientific research on the mind/body connection so much so that scientists who tried to study this topic were guaranteed not to get tenure, so they didn’t pursue it. With good research and data, Jo Marchant sets out to explore the potential of the mind’s ability to heal the body, the power of the placebo,And the peace that can come with the mind. In her discussion on The Placebo Effect she talks about how drugs have to perform better than a placebo. What is not discussed is the rate of the actual placebo effect and how that can be beneficial.Now, obviously, the placebo effect isn’t news. It is ubiquitous in all medical literature and training.The question is, why isn’t it being harnessed, asks Marchant. Ethics of placebo can be an issue, and Marchant extensively addresses the ethics of misleading patients, and studies on the ethical placebo, where patients know they are taking a placebo, and how it can still work. She addresses how gut issues, fatigue, pain, inflammation are all examples of illnesses that the mind can help bring respite. Not to mention Mental Illness. She speaks with people who have slowed the speed of their degenerative illnesses with Yoga and meditation. I learned about Biofeedback/paced breathing as well. As in centering and calming the body, this makes sense to reduce stress which in turn may reduce inflammation. Doctors routinely attribute stress to be the cause of many fatal illnesses. Why can’t the reverse be, at least a little bit, true?So better food patterns, sleep and stress relief in the form of mediation, yoga, etc, are critical in reducing inflammation. What she’s saying isn’t new.It’s just illuminating and coherent. She also has a chapter on the role of relationships and health, that social ties are linked to longevity.Great if I don’t have patience to yoga, at least I have good friends.Or in this time of social distancing where I can’t spend time with friends, take on Yoga 😊. While her research points to a clear connection to the mind/body connection, she also make sure to point out the following:“we can rarely deploy these tools at will; we can’t simply “wish” ourselves better. But as described in these pages, there are ways in which we can use our conscious minds to influence them, from believing we have taken a pill, or focusing on the present moment, to seeking the support of someone we love.”** Before I get eviscerated**This is not a book about anti vaxx, or about healing with voodoo (ok a little bit), or about doing away with mainstream medicine.As Marchant says:“I am not advocating relying solely on the mind to heal us; but denying its role in medicine surely isn’t the answer either. My hope, then, is that this book might help to overcome some of the prejudice against mind-body approaches, and to raise awareness that taking account of the mind in health is actually a more scientific and evidence-based approach than relying ever more heavily on physical interventions and drugs.”Jeremy Howick, an epidemiologist at the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine in Oxford argues: “I think it’s more important to know that it something works, than how it works. If I had cancer, I wouldn’t care what explanation the therapist gave. I would want him to cure my pain. Wouldn’t you?” Pain is inevitable. Suffering is Optional. – Buddha."
26,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46924592-policemanprawn,4,"This is a very interesting book on how the mind affects the body, and vice versa, in a medical context. Some of these ideas include how placebos can work even if people know it’s a placebo, how increased personal care and affection from medical practitioners can improve the health of patients, and how the effects of powerful drugs can be replicated or extended using techniques of the mind. Much of it discusses cutting-edge research, and the attempts of researchers to get their ideas across. Western medicine has traditionally viewed the body and mind as separate realms, and anything that deviates from this has been considered pseudoscience. There is huge arrogance from those in the medical professions (this can be seen by the separate student societies of medics), and it’s only recently that going to the doctor was more beneficial than harmful. A well-written and interesting book."
27,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60889959-susan,4,"Given Evan’s scoliosis and the range of issues my family and friends face or have faced with various diagnoses from Parkinson’s to alopecia to cancer to fibromyalgia, this topic has been on my mind for some time. I figured this would be a great book because the author has a PHD in genetics and microbiology and I hoped she’d go in skeptical but open minded. That’s just what she did and she explores a different mind-body connection topic in each chapter, including placebos, conditioning, hypnosis, harnessing psychological/mental resources as a critical part of medical care, physical impact of stress/‘fight or flight’ instinct, mindfulness meditation, the impact of social connectiveness, the direct connection between the brain and immune system and the impact of spirituality on health. The results are fascinating and I walked away believing there is definitely science behind the idea that we have the capacity to influence our health by using our minds. The connection is complex and requires a lot more research to fully understand, but there’s something there for sure, although I don’t believe these ideas should fully replace traditional medicine. This book gave me a ton of ideas about ways to try to incorporate alternative therapies into care for both chronic conditions and for daily living. A great non-fiction read if you are interested in this topic!"
28,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,4,"The author did an excellent job describing the subtleties of scientific studies about the placebo effect, stress reduction, and related phenomena. Her writing is also evocative at a human-interest level--for example, her description of Lourdes and what is so valuable there. The worst thing about the book is the title. It's not really about ""cures."" It's about palliation and prevention. It's also not about ""mind over body"" because, as Marchant takes great pains to explain, the mind is the body. I also found it odd that Marchant devotes a lot of space to neuroscience rationalizations, whereas a major theme of the book is that what matters for medicine is what helps people, not what's happening in a laboratory. For anyone interested, there's a whole other book exposing the weakness of trendy neuroscience: 

"
29,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7701175-alison,4,"I chose this book because I correctly surmised that Jo Marchant shares much of my worldview - that the increasing culture wars over science are dividing us between an anything-goes rejection of the scientific method, and an increasingly reductionalist view of what that method is. On the one hand, we have the unfounded, disproven claims of homeopaths and reiki practititioners, and on the other a dogmatic shouting about the infallibility of science, with modern days techniques like double-blind studies elevated to unquestionable sacred pillars, holding up some kind of edifice of human progress. The science I have grown to love - the practice of asking questions, investigating anomalies, groping blindly towards some greater glimpse of knowledge - a science that recognises it's inadequacy just as it forges ahead despite it: that science has long since been buried to me in a deluge of smug superior social media memes.So - having got that off my chest (just kidding! There will be a lot more of that in this review!) , let's talk about the book for a tick. Marchant's ambitious undertaking here is to argue the case for a less Descartian view of the mind/body issue - that is, to acknowledge that the two are actually somewhat interconnected. It is ludicrous to me that this is even an issue in this day and age, but well, there we are. The history of modern medicine is pretty much based on a good old Decartian view that there is the body, and the mind is another kind of thing altogether. As we understand more about the brain, this is getting shakier to maintain: it actually indicates that the mind pretty much is the brain, which, to state the obvious, is kinda part of the body. In fact, the brain isn't just part of the body, it's kind of the of the control centre, the Bridge if you like. So it is hardly a strength of modern medicine that it is still faintly embarrassed by this, as if influencing the body by engaging with a person's mind is somehow kind of cheating. At best, modern doctors will mutter about a ""positive attitude"" being ""helpful"".And there is good reason for this reluctance to encourage patients to think about their mind as influential. There are literally hundreds of scams to cure incurable conditions by thinking differently pushed at vulnerable and desperate people, usually as an 'alternative' to proven treatments. It is understandable that many doctors, keen to prevent unnecessary death, tend to react too far in the other direction. The brain might be the control centre for the body, but it is hardly omnipotent, and is just as subject to the laws of physics and biology as the rest of the body.Which is why this book is so daring. Because Marchant has written an argument for recognising the power of the mind to assist with healing, and incorporating that into our view of medicine. She does that by choosing case studies - each one illustrating a different theme - and weaving accounts of studies around anecdote to explore. For example, the first chapter focuses on the Placebo Effect, looking at several studies exploring the power of this effect, and looking at a start-up to sell openly marketed placebo pills. Another chapter looks at fatigue, centered around the effectiveness of Graded Exercise Therapy (GET)for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, but drawing on studies of elite athletes and others to look at the mechanics of fatigue and how it might be controlled by the brain.As an argument, it is very powerful. Marchant is a journalist by trade, and it shows. She includes enough references to reputable studies to ensure the credentials of the book, but it is the power of the anecdotes that fires it along, creating the emotional plea for a different approach, and the tantalising hope of miracles.As science, the approach is a little annoying. Marchant is careful to mention where there is controversy, to explain where challenges exist, but generally these are tossed aside, downplayed and overwhelmed by the strength of the narrative she constructs. In a couple of cases I'm fairly knowledgeable about - the debate over the effectiveness of anti-depressants; and the controversial nature of GET - I was fairly certain the average reader would end up with the impression that the conclusions she supports are far more accepted than they are by their respective medical communities. Both of these are complex issues, but simplified down, they seem to be part of a giant pile of evidence supporting a broader point. Examples are consistently chosen for maximum effect - describing Parkinson's experiments to explore the placebo effect, when Parkinson's symptoms are caused by dopamine deficiency and dopamine is a chemical the brain releases on anticipation - you would expect the biology of placebo to be more dramatic than with other conditions.There are also things missing I would have loved to see - I was hoping for some neuroscience, for starters - there is plenty there in modern neuroscience to support Marchant's theories, and at times such as discussing the effect of meditation on the brain - she throws out references to brain structures and chemicals. A holistic overview would have brought more readers into understanding how it might all fit together, and grounded the book. The neuroscience is also needed I think in parts - I don't agree with Marchant's general optimism that it is ok if people take useless treatments, because ""placebo effect"". The problem with the placebo effect, as she explains it beyond pain relief, is that it is based on the brain expecting a particular kind of response and preparing for it. This can work even if your concious mind ""knows"" the treatment is a placebo because your brain takes a lot of evidence into account in making such judgments, and your ""conscious"" ""rational"" judgement doesn't always represent the majority viewpoint (ok, so that's simplistic, but go read some neurophilosophy and come back and argue it with me, it's fun!). So sure, printing bottles of pills that look like other pills might fool the brain for a while (huh, you THINK it's a placebo, your prefrontal cortex hums, but I've experienced thousands of those bottles and I know what they mean.... ), but eventually, that expectation is going to wear off.I'd also have liked the book to explore more of the fundamental difficulties with change. One of my favourite parts of the book is where Marchant discusses the limitations of double-blind trials for meditation and mindfulness. Now I'm a fan of double-blind trails, but science writers like Ben Goldacre, in their zeal to improve science standards, have also created a monster, where techniques like the double-blind trial have been automatic, unchallengeable solutions to every freaking problem. But there are limitations - as Marchant points out, double-blind trials are designed to dismiss the importance of the mind. The whole idea is that whatever a person *thinks* about their treatment should be irrelevant to the outcomes of that treatment. So we fool the person - we fool all those people around the person so that they really, really can't work it out - to ensure we are simply studying what the body does when the mind doesn't know what is happening to it. For lots of things, that is an excellent approach. Not least because while the mind can assist with healing, it can also assist with killing us too. It is not really a good thing, for example, for us to convince ourselves we have plenty of oxygen when, in fact, we do not. (The book actually doesn't explore this issue much, which is also a problem. I can't have been the only one wondering in the bit about elite athletes training their minds to allow more exertion that just maybe the brain cuts to fatigue early FOR A FREAKING REASON?). But back to double-bind trials, the point being, if what you want to study is how the mind is impacting on the result, then you can't by nature compare two groups who think the same thing is happening. You have to compare groups with different thinking processes - you need an alternative approach. But this thorny question - about what kind of science we could have that doesn't need to feel embarrassed about the mind, that understands how to study it, is undeveloped.Having said that, Marchant does better than most journalists, mentioning where dissent exists even if she doesn't explore it, and I tend to the curmudgeonly about such things. And her vision deserves to shine through - the last chapter, in which she explores the phenomenon of Lourdes is a beautiful climax to the book, as she masterfully builds up a picture of a town centered on empathy and supportive community, where the sick and the weary find solace, not in an absent god or freezing pools, but in ever present loving arms of pilgrims and fellow travellers. Without needing to be overt, the reader inevitably contrasts this patient-centered place of acceptance, peace and understanding to the modern hospital and health-care system, with its finely calibrated aura of stress, chaos and crisis, with exhausted and overworked brusque staff, and a clear expectation that a well-behaved patient is one who understands how to do what the system expects. One of the most devastating part s of Cure, for me, is when a woman with strong clinical trials proving - and yes this is obvious - that the way patients are spoken to before awake surgery influences how well they tolerate the surgery - explains that she had to re-jig her focus in order to sell her work. ""I focus on cost-savings"", she says, ""hospital administrators care more about that"". (paraphrased, too lazy to find the quote now).And it isn't that you can't put a case for patient-centered care being more efficient - Marchant's subject has made a living out of it - but it is that to do so requires such an enormous cultural shift in our healthcare system that it is, frankly, difficult to achieve in small steps. It is easier and less challenging to our social order to just keep researching better and newer drugs. But I honestly believe it is fuelling a lot of our health problems, particularly the ever-escalating increase in depression, and a growing health gap between rich and poor: the supported and the vulnerable. Marchant points out that simply spending more time with a healthcare professional improves outcomes: health partnerships encourage empowerment and reduce stress and fight/flight responses. They also increase trust and understanding of the medical profession, and in doing so, would allow us to move beyond the science wars into the kind of better future both sides claim to want."
30,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"I approached this book with long-standing skepticism about alternative medicine, but at the end of it, found that I had consumed a healthy serving of wholesome food for thought. One reason I read the book, despite my skepticism, is that it is written by a heavily-credentialed scientist who, it turns out, also had initial reservations about her subject. Nevertheless, Jo Marchant has written a solidly-researched book which will, at a minimum, leave the reader with the impression that much of what the author says rings true.In twelve chapters, Marchant describes various illnesses and health conditions of people all over the world, and juxtaposes conventional medical treatments with lesser-known treatments that incorporate actions of the human mind. In chapter one, for example, she talks about illnesses ranging from autism and Parkinson’s disease to altitude sickness, and how placebos were used to test the efficacy of drugs intended to target a specific disease. Surprisingly, in many cases, placebo patients described deriving the same beneficial effects as patients receiving a real drug. In even more astonishing cases of “honest placebos,” patients knowingly receiving placebos still underwent health improvements. Clearly, this circumstance was less to do with placebos and drugs than it was to do with how the mind was participating in the intervention.In riveting chapter after chapter, Marchant illustrates the psychological response humans have in the treatment of illnesses. She takes on numerous controversial alternative treatments—acupuncture, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, the Lourdes miracle cures, the power of social interactions, and yes, even religion-based and virtual reality therapies—and suggests the healing power of the mind, either with or without real drugs and medications.What makes this book so readable is Marchant’s wonderful, fluent writing in a style and form that is totally accessible to the lay reader. The progressive, case-building structure of the whole book, and even the chapter formats are beautifully constructed, making Cure not only an easy read, but a fast-paced one. Although she readily admits the need for much more basic research to “understand the complexities of the connections between brain and body,” she philosophically accepts that pharmaceutical companies will have no interest in trials that potentially result in non-drug treatments or that might reduce dosages of existing medications.In the book’s conclusion, the scientist in Marchant issues a caution: she is “uneasy” when doctors offer alternative treatments accompanied by “explanatory frameworks with no scientific basis.” But she is also open-minded enough to state that, “…the science described in this book shows that in many situations, we have the capacity to influence our own health by harnessing the power of the (conscious and unconscious) mind.” Marchant sees no reason not to participate in remedies that appear to work, especially when conventional treatments fall short.This is a fabulous, well-written, thought-provoking book on a subject as controversial as it is popular. I highly recommend it—to believers and skeptics alike!"
31,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4282506-becca-chopra,5,"Mind-body medicine has been around for thousands of years, and is now scientifically shown to work.With CURE – A Journey into the Science of Mind over Body, Jo Marchant has written a book that I would recommend to all healers, complementary or allopathic, and to all those in need of healing… which is pretty much everyone.Having experienced every healing modality mentioned in the book, I have my own personal opinions of miracle cures, the placebo effect, the benefits of mindfulness and meditation, and using the mind to enhance our physical healing. But Marchant investigates the evidence, the science, behind the effectiveness of alternative or complementary therapies and the power of our minds to affect our health.Marchant interviewed both practitioners, researchers and patients, such as a gent named Gareth, whose MS was under control through meditation. As Gareth explains:“People think of meditation as a time consumer, but the opposite is true. It is a time provider, because of all the time that we don’t spend following useless trains of thought. I wouldn’t be able to lead the life that I lead now if it weren’t for meditation.”Marchant covers many mind-body therapies that can improve medical outcomes by “treating patients as the complex human beings we are, rather than simply as physical bodies…”Her conclusion after looking into everything from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction to homeopathy, acupuncture, and social factors such as loneliness and poverty, show that “our thoughts, beliefs, stress levels and worldview all influence how ill or well we feel.”She explains that the way our brains are wired not only constructs our experience but our physical reality and vice versa.Nearly 400 years after Descartes’ separation of the mind and body in scientific thought, Marchant uncovers evidence that shows something very different — that our bodies and minds have evolved in exquisite harmony, so perfectly integrated that it is impossible to consider one without the other:“Terms like ‘mind-body’ and ‘holistic’ are often derided as flaky and unscientific, but in fact it’s the idea of a mind distinct from the body, an ephemeral entity that floats somewhere in the skull like a spirit or soul, that makes no scientific sense.”If you’d like to understand how our minds influence and reflect our physiology, CURE is definitely a must-read. Marchant’s research lays out the potential of our mind’s ability to heal the body — and how we can use her findings in our own lives."
32,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"My sister has relied on homeopathic healers through much of her adult life. She ate a healthy vegan diet and regularly attended Tai Chi and Chi Gong classes for exercise. When she began feeling nauseous and fatigued, she stepped up the program and increased the number of alternative remedies she used. So when she was finally diagnosed with Stage 4 B Cell Lymphoma, her condition was serious indeed. Fortunately, chemotherapy destroyed the tumors that crowded most of her body and left her struggling to breath and unable to eat. The experience left me more than a little angry with alternative medicine. Is there any redeeming value in alternative medicine?I’m happy to say that the answer is yes; some alternative therapies are effective in improving quality of life, relieving some symptoms, and even noosing the immune system. The Cure recounts a plethora of well-designed studies that suggest that meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, yoga, and other treatment modes have a salutive effect on health and week being. What’s complicated is working out when and why this is true. For example, people who meditate regularly are less subject to stress reactions. As a result, meditators are more resilient and less likely to suffer the effects of cortisol and adrenaline, including immune diseases and cardiovascular disease. This is a fascinating book and I will go back and reread a few chapters again."
33,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52492316-kachina,5,"This book was very informative yet, Marchant’s tone keeps things real and interesting. This isn’t some book about rejecting conventional medicine to pursue homeopathy. Rather, the author suggests that unconventional practices such as the use of placebos, meditation and even the feeling of simply being cared for, may reduce our stress levels which then improves our well-being. In a world that is so reliant on drugs, it is comforting to know that there are other alternatives. The author makes sure to back up her information with scientific research and data which I found reassuring. It’s no secret that funding for alternative medicine is extremely low because there isn’t a lot of money that can be made with treating people without pills. That is the sad truth that is repeated throughout the book. The funny thing is, (as Marchant states), a lot of the pain-killer and antidepressants that are prescribed to people don’t work any better than the placebos. Ultimately, with the use of real-world examples, it is further proof that the mind and the body truly are remarkable. In Marchant’s own words, she hopes this books helps to “overcome some prejudice against mind-body approaches.” I can go on and on about this book but I’ll leave it at that! Everyone should read it! "
34,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,4,"A few years back, I was plagued with a mysterious choking problem that came up when I was attempting to eat under stress, or if I hadn't had any food in more than a few hours. The doctor prescribed antacid, which made matters worse. No help there. It seemed to be worse when I was eating meat, so I tried no meat for a while. That helped, but not enough. Finally, after having been declared a medical mystery enough times by Western doctors, I tried acupuncture. The problem went away almost immediately and has never returned. I'm the sort of case that Jo Marchant writes about in this highly interesting and occasionally frustrating book. Interesting, because she investigates and illuminates, with the cool light of science, everything from acupuncture (hardly any discernible effects) to homeopathy (hogwash) to the placebo effect (very real). Frustrating, because she's working so hard to be reasonable that sometimes it seems that she's pulling back from a necessary conclusion in order to appear to be open-minded. Indeed, the only practice she roundly dispenses with is homeopathy. Everything else she manages to find some use for -- precisely because her main thesis is that the mind and body are not separate, but heavily influence one another, so that of course -- of course -- the mind is important in just about every aspect of medicine. Even Lourdes, which Marchant discusses as the importance of community and loving attention to healing, and as a way of criticizing Western medicine for neglecting the heart's need for love as well as the mind's need for authority and the body's need for good medicine. It's a good book. Just a little too reasonable. Which is probably not a very fair thing to say. "
35,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4068546-cecilia,5,"This book was exactly what I hoped it would be. I flew through the first part about medical therapies, and, while the second part about ""the importance of our minds from day to day"" was interesting, it wasn't as interesting as the first part. Regardless, the whole book is a worthwhile read, and I highly recommend it. I appreciate the critical and balanced perspective of the author and that she investigates the science, techniques, and theories with the right amount of openness and skepticism. She approaches research studies the way I do--for instance, she might discuss a promising study, but she makes sure to detail any possible shortcomings of the study (small sample size, results have not been reproduced yet, etc.). I was happy to discover there was a book marrying two topics that interest me greatly--psychology and medicine--and I'm happy that it turned out to be as fascinating and informative as I imagined it would be."

I only have two minor complaints: the first is that the information on graded exercise therapy (GET) for chronic fatigue syndrome is outdated. This particular form of ""treatment"" has largely been found to be detrimental to CFS patients. I also think the book, while nearly perfect in most other ways, could benefit from a bit of editing to sharpen it up a bit.This year I am trying to scale back my ratings to be more discriminating, but still, this is a solid ""4"" for me!! I agree with the author's assessment that progress for the individual will likely come not from the medical/pharmaceutical fields but from technology, particularly the development/marketing of consumer biofeedback programs.

All of the references are detailed for those interested in the science, but everything is explained thoroughly enough to be easily understood by anyone. Jo Marchant strikes a good balance between personal anecdotes, interviews with scientists, and interviews with patients on all of the topics covered. The more personal touches make it much more engaging than standard scientific literature. I did feel like it often jumped around between anecdotes, which was jarring until their relevance became clear - although this may have been necessary given the breadth of subjects covered.I'm glad that books about the arbtitrariness of separating the mind and body are becoming more common. For anyone interested in the human mind, this is a recommended read."

This is a very difficult task: one step too far, and you're in the land of the wackos.

50,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/735052-james,4,"Marchant is a popular science writer with a PhD in genetics and medical microbiology who has written for New Scientist, Nature, the Guardian, and the Smithonian . She is rigorously skeptical of alternative therapies and the miraculous; however she isn't dismissive of the fact that people are sometimes helped by them. Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body is her examination of the mind's power to influence physical health and well being. She reviews various scientific studies, interviews those who have participated in them, and explores what the brain can or cannot do as far as healing our bodies.Marchant observes a well known phenomena in contemporary medical research: the placebo effect. She cites research which shows that in some instances, a placebo works even if the person knows they are getting the placebo, though it impacts symptoms rather than the disease itself (still valuable for quality of life). She also notes the 'nocebo effect' where a person's health declines because of the belief that something is causing them harm (i.e. believing you were poisoned, or had a curse put on you). Placebos can be a powerful counter medicine to these psychosomatic ailments and empathetic patient care does make a real difference in prognosis. So Marchant admits some value in alternative medicines:Therapies such as homeopathy and Reiki contain no active ingredient and show no benefit in rigorous clinical trials. They are based on principles that from a scientific point of view are nonsensical—almost certainly do not work in the way they claim they do. But with long, personal consultations and empathetic care, they are perfectly honed to maximize placebo responses. For that reason they probably do provide real relief, particularly for chronic ailments that conventional medicine is not well equipped to treat (39)Marchant examines the benefits of combining a placebo with Pavlovian conditioning, the benefits of cognitive therapies in fighting Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, hypnosis in treating Irritable Bowl Syndrome, and the benefits virtual reality for Pain management. In the latter part of the book she talks about how stress affects health, the benefits of meditation the importance of relationships and positive outlook for aging well, and how manipulating the vagus nerve through electricity may impact our immunity. Her final chapter examines the role of faith in healing, specifically at Lourdes.Marchant doesn't believe in miracles and treats religious ritual like a powerful placebo. She does volunteer at Lourdes and record her observations of a worship service she participated in:I feel out of place amid all the singing and signing. I've never attended a Catholic Mass, and I usually try my hardest to avoid religious ceremonies. I get uneasy about the idea of substituting reason and clear thinking for robes, incantations and mysterious higher powers. But at the same time it is beautiful; a hugely impressive assault on the senses. (266).Later she writes, ""Lourdes didn't turn me into a believer. But after attending this giant underground service, I'm struck by the physical force that religious belief can have"" (227). She sees the power of religion to effect people's health, for good or ill, in mechanisms like stress and ritual. She prefers a naturalistic interpretation of how healing occurs—a scientific explanation of how healing took place invalidates it as a miracle (which she doesn't believe in anyway).I have participated and benefited from healing prayers, but I am also aware of studies on intercessory prayer that show no significant change, and reveal faith healers' success rates as equal to that of a placebo (about 29%). I don't share Marchant's skepticism of the miraculous. I do, however, appreciate her well-documented look at the science behind the power of the mind to influence physical health. Her bias towards a rigorous look at the evidence is what made me want to read the book. I especially found the studies of the placebo effect in the first part of the book interesting, and this is a fun read. I recommend this for anyone interested in our current understanding of the brain's ability to effect our body. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I give this four stars.Note: I received this book from Random House and Crown Publishers through the Blogging For Books Program in exchange for my honest review."

54,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964233-elizabeth,2,"Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body (Hardcover) by Jo Marchant from the libraryWhat a disappointment! There are some paragraphs which deserve more than two stars and many that deserve less. I am so tired of so called science educated journalists writing about what they know nothing about. This author has a genuine science background. But so do I. I have solid background in the hard sciences, did research at Caltech in molecular biology and have a doctorate in a behavioral science. I also have studied some of the alternative healing arts. I am quite clear that I would be dead if I only took care from MD's. So lets get down to some real issues. What about Osteopathy with its moving cranial bones and its craniosacral rhythm? Most of medicine considers that nonsense. What about the veterinary use of acupuncture on race horses? My father was a horse vet. (grad of Texas A&M) He said if it works on horses, its real. The same for veterinary use of homeopathy? So instead of saying science says blah blah, start from it works and figure out why. It would help if the science educated would learn about the healing arts before they write about them. This book is like having a deaf person faced with critiquing music counting the notes of a symphony to decide its value. Try to remember that it wasn't so long ago that doctors denied the value of washing their hands, or the value of fruits and vegetables in diet. They believed that masturbation led to insanity, that women had less intelligence because their skull volume was smaller than men's and that letting women become educated would result in damaged babies and the resulting destruction of the human species."
55,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46134979-juliet,4,"I found this book fascinating and refreshing. I am already a believer in alternative therapies where appropriate and looking to non-prescription solutions whenever possible. What made this book stand out to me was the author's skepticism of these alternative therapies and the thorough research she conducted to get to the bottom of what was causing the results. It's hard to find books in this topic that aren't heavily biased one way or another, but this one is the exception. A lot of the stories and examples hit close to home for me, and I felt that the author did an excellent job exploring both sides of each argument before drawing conclusions (which were always based on facts and evidence). It’s yet another book that confirms how effective mindfulness and meditation can be in managing stress and depression. I was also intrigued by the placebo effect and how most antidepressants are no more effective than placebos in trials, yet they still get the green light. The author is British, yet her outside perspective of the U.S. healthcare system is spot on.An underlying theme in many of the alternative therapies was a feeling of connection to the world (either through religion, spirituality, or nature), a strong social network, and close relationships with others. Overall it seems the key to health, with or without a diagnosis, is being able to be mindful of the present moment and having a connection to others and the world around us. While this book left me feeling frustrated at the current state of our healthcare system, I did leave off hopeful that there are some steps I can take on my own."

57,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915736-marya,4,"Cure is a great way to introduce yourself to alternative healing practices from a scientific/skeptical perspective. Marchant never writes off anyone as a quack, but neither does she embrace all practices as equal or even effective. Instead, Marchant recognizes a mind-body connection and how modern medicine tries to avoid that connection like the plague. This does a disservice to everyone as potentially effective treatments are dismissed by medicine, patients dismiss these dismissive doctors, and no one actually addresses the patient's needs.Marchant begins with the placebo effect and highlights research showing what it can --- and can't - do. The nerve cells of individuals suffering from PD actually improve their coordination after a placebo treatment. Yet, the individuals still have PD. Marchant then meanders through other treatments that aim to repeat that effect, from hypnosis to virtual reality. This was my favorite part of the book, though the research becomes less and less conclusive as she continues. That's not necessarily a condemnation of the methods- the research simply isn't there (and sometimes, neither is the funding). I really wish Marchant had expanded on this portion. A whole book on the placebo effect with that writer would be wonderful!Sadly, Marchant strays further and further away from the extensive research to end with something that has no research supporting it at all. It's an interesting journey, but I spent far longer trying to motivate myself to read the second half than the first."
58,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48896082-archi,2,"This book is a placebo. It began with promise: the explanation of the various types of placebo effect, channels of operation, and the selection bias of medical trials that lead to a failure of standard medicine to appreciate the value of ""mind"" induced or enhanced therapies. Very interesting and worth further research. This is up to about chapter 4, ending with altitude sickness.From there, the book turned into an anecdotal, self-focused review of the travels of the author on 'research' of alternative medicine. Both her logic and her science are weak. Her conclusions are based on personal experience more than data, and the data she uses are extremely limited. Most of her conclusions are 'but what if X turns out to be true?' Her kid-gloved critique of obviously un-founded treatments (like the Washington aura healer) do little to add rigor to her process. For example, her review of the placebo effect on an autistic toddler - completely baseless. Was it the parents' change in attitude that cured the child? Was it the autistic child whose mind became convinced that an unrelated treatment was suddenly useful? Sports, childbirth, poverty/politics and religion sections were painful to read. I would think that a fundamental flaw is her inability to define mind and/or body in the context of illness or treatment.Its a shame really, b/c this is a real subject worth deep and rigorous research. This is a feel-good, diet science book that raises the issue, but does little to advance it. "

In some of the chapters, the author reports on the placebo effect, but in others seems to swallow reports of what might be placebo effect without question.While the anecdotes make it easier to understand the diseases Ms. Marchant writes about, it was difficult to believe she understands science if she cites grey hair as proof of stress. The age at which your hair turns grey is recognized as being genetic. If we want to go into anecdotes, I have a 65 year old relative with a huge amount of stress in her life (retirement, moving, divorce, cancer, death) who still has no grey, just like her mother at the same age. I have other friends who turned grey in their 30's and 40's while living a good life. Grey hair should not be cited as proof of a stressful life. On page 39 the author states ""..long personal consultations and empathetic care.....maximize placebo responses."" This pretty much sums up the book. Ms. Marchant tells some interesting stories, but not many of them are about science based research with results that can't be attributed to the placebo effect. "

One reason I read the book, despite my skepticism, is that it is written by a heavily-credentialed scientist who, it turns out, also had initial reservations about her subject. Nevertheless, Jo Marchant has written a solidly-researched book which will, at a minimum, leave the reader with the impression that much of what the author says rings true.In twelve chapters, Marchant describes various illnesses and health conditions of people all over the world, and juxtaposes conventional medical treatments with lesser-known treatments that incorporate actions of the human mind. In chapter one, for example, she talks about illnesses ranging from autism and Parkinson’s disease to altitude sickness, and how placebos were used to test the efficacy of drugs intended to target a specific disease. Surprisingly, in many cases, placebo patients described deriving the same beneficial effects as patients receiving a real drug. In even more astonishing cases of “honest placebos,” patients knowingly receiving placebos still underwent health improvements. Clearly, this circumstance was less to do with placebos and drugs than it was to do with how the mind was participating in the intervention.In riveting chapter after chapter, Marchant illustrates the psychological response humans have in the treatment of illnesses. She takes on numerous controversial alternative treatments—acupuncture, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, the Lourdes miracle cures, the power of social interactions, and yes, even religion-based and virtual reality therapies—and suggests the healing power of the mind, either with or without real drugs and medications.What makes this book so readable is Marchant’s wonderful, fluent writing in a style and form that is totally accessible to the lay reader. The progressive, case-building structure of the whole book, and even the chapter formats are beautifully constructed, making Cure not only an easy read, but a fast-paced one. Although she readily admits the need for much more basic research to “understand the complexities of the connections between brain and body,” she philosophically accepts that pharmaceutical companies will have no interest in trials that potentially result in non-drug treatments or that might reduce dosages of existing medications.In the book’s conclusion, the scientist in Marchant issues a caution: she is “uneasy” when doctors offer alternative treatments accompanied by “explanatory frameworks with no scientific basis.” But she is also open-minded enough to state that, “…the science described in this book shows that in many situations, we have the capacity to influence our own health by harnessing the power of the (conscious and unconscious) mind.” Marchant sees no reason not to participate in remedies that appear to work, especially when conventional treatments fall short.This is a fabulous, well-written, thought-provoking book on a subject as controversial as it is popular. I highly recommend it—to believers and skeptics alike!"
61,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4282506-becca-chopra,5,"Mind-body medicine has been around for thousands of years, and is now scientifically shown to work.With CURE – A Journey into the Science of Mind over Body, Jo Marchant has written a book that I would recommend to all healers, complementary or allopathic, and to all those in need of healing… which is pretty much everyone.Having experienced every healing modality mentioned in the book, I have my own personal opinions of miracle cures, the placebo effect, the benefits of mindfulness and meditation, and using the mind to enhance our physical healing. But Marchant investigates the evidence, the science, behind the effectiveness of alternative or complementary therapies and the power of our minds to affect our health.Marchant interviewed both practitioners, researchers and patients, such as a gent named Gareth, whose MS was under control through meditation. As Gareth explains:“People think of meditation as a time consumer, but the opposite is true. It is a time provider, because of all the time that we don’t spend following useless trains of thought. I wouldn’t be able to lead the life that I lead now if it weren’t for meditation.”Marchant covers many mind-body therapies that can improve medical outcomes by “treating patients as the complex human beings we are, rather than simply as physical bodies…”Her conclusion after looking into everything from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction to homeopathy, acupuncture, and social factors such as loneliness and poverty, show that “our thoughts, beliefs, stress levels and worldview all influence how ill or well we feel.”She explains that the way our brains are wired not only constructs our experience but our physical reality and vice versa.Nearly 400 years after Descartes’ separation of the mind and body in scientific thought, Marchant uncovers evidence that shows something very different — that our bodies and minds have evolved in exquisite harmony, so perfectly integrated that it is impossible to consider one without the other:“Terms like ‘mind-body’ and ‘holistic’ are often derided as flaky and unscientific, but in fact it’s the idea of a mind distinct from the body, an ephemeral entity that floats somewhere in the skull like a spirit or soul, that makes no scientific sense.”If you’d like to understand how our minds influence and reflect our physiology, CURE is definitely a must-read. Marchant’s research lays out the potential of our mind’s ability to heal the body — and how we can use her findings in our own lives."
62,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"My sister has relied on homeopathic healers through much of her adult life. She ate a healthy vegan diet and regularly attended Tai Chi and Chi Gong classes for exercise. When she began feeling nauseous and fatigued, she stepped up the program and increased the number of alternative remedies she used. So when she was finally diagnosed with Stage 4 B Cell Lymphoma, her condition was serious indeed. Fortunately, chemotherapy destroyed the tumors that crowded most of her body and left her struggling to breath and unable to eat. The experience left me more than a little angry with alternative medicine. Is there any redeeming value in alternative medicine?I’m happy to say that the answer is yes; some alternative therapies are effective in improving quality of life, relieving some symptoms, and even noosing the immune system. The Cure recounts a plethora of well-designed studies that suggest that meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, yoga, and other treatment modes have a salutive effect on health and week being. What’s complicated is working out when and why this is true. For example, people who meditate regularly are less subject to stress reactions. As a result, meditators are more resilient and less likely to suffer the effects of cortisol and adrenaline, including immune diseases and cardiovascular disease. This is a fascinating book and I will go back and reread a few chapters again."
63,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52492316-kachina,5,"This book was very informative yet, Marchant’s tone keeps things real and interesting. This isn’t some book about rejecting conventional medicine to pursue homeopathy. Rather, the author suggests that unconventional practices such as the use of placebos, meditation and even the feeling of simply being cared for, may reduce our stress levels which then improves our well-being. In a world that is so reliant on drugs, it is comforting to know that there are other alternatives. The author makes sure to back up her information with scientific research and data which I found reassuring. It’s no secret that funding for alternative medicine is extremely low because there isn’t a lot of money that can be made with treating people without pills. That is the sad truth that is repeated throughout the book. The funny thing is, (as Marchant states), a lot of the pain-killer and antidepressants that are prescribed to people don’t work any better than the placebos. Ultimately, with the use of real-world examples, it is further proof that the mind and the body truly are remarkable. In Marchant’s own words, she hopes this books helps to “overcome some prejudice against mind-body approaches.” I can go on and on about this book but I’ll leave it at that! Everyone should read it! "
64,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,4,"A few years back, I was plagued with a mysterious choking problem that came up when I was attempting to eat under stress, or if I hadn't had any food in more than a few hours. The doctor prescribed antacid, which made matters worse. No help there. It seemed to be worse when I was eating meat, so I tried no meat for a while. That helped, but not enough. Finally, after having been declared a medical mystery enough times by Western doctors, I tried acupuncture. The problem went away almost immediately and has never returned. I'm the sort of case that Jo Marchant writes about in this highly interesting and occasionally frustrating book. Interesting, because she investigates and illuminates, with the cool light of science, everything from acupuncture (hardly any discernible effects) to homeopathy (hogwash) to the placebo effect (very real). Frustrating, because she's working so hard to be reasonable that sometimes it seems that she's pulling back from a necessary conclusion in order to appear to be open-minded. Indeed, the only practice she roundly dispenses with is homeopathy. Everything else she manages to find some use for -- precisely because her main thesis is that the mind and body are not separate, but heavily influence one another, so that of course -- of course -- the mind is important in just about every aspect of medicine. Even Lourdes, which Marchant discusses as the importance of community and loving attention to healing, and as a way of criticizing Western medicine for neglecting the heart's need for love as well as the mind's need for authority and the body's need for good medicine. It's a good book. Just a little too reasonable. Which is probably not a very fair thing to say. "
65,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4068546-cecilia,5,"This book was exactly what I hoped it would be. I flew through the first part about medical therapies, and, while the second part about ""the importance of our minds from day to day"" was interesting, it wasn't as interesting as the first part. Regardless, the whole book is a worthwhile read, and I highly recommend it. I appreciate the critical and balanced perspective of the author and that she investigates the science, techniques, and theories with the right amount of openness and skepticism. She approaches research studies the way I do--for instance, she might discuss a promising study, but she makes sure to detail any possible shortcomings of the study (small sample size, results have not been reproduced yet, etc.). I was happy to discover there was a book marrying two topics that interest me greatly--psychology and medicine--and I'm happy that it turned out to be as fascinating and informative as I imagined it would be."

I only have two minor complaints: the first is that the information on graded exercise therapy (GET) for chronic fatigue syndrome is outdated. This particular form of ""treatment"" has largely been found to be detrimental to CFS patients. I also think the book, while nearly perfect in most other ways, could benefit from a bit of editing to sharpen it up a bit.This year I am trying to scale back my ratings to be more discriminating, but still, this is a solid ""4"" for me!! I agree with the author's assessment that progress for the individual will likely come not from the medical/pharmaceutical fields but from technology, particularly the development/marketing of consumer biofeedback programs.

67,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24030791-robyn,4,"This is an exceptionally well-researched and accessibly written book on a fascinating topic - the extent of the mind's influence over the body, and how this influences health and illness. All of the references are detailed for those interested in the science, but everything is explained thoroughly enough to be easily understood by anyone. Jo Marchant strikes a good balance between personal anecdotes, interviews with scientists, and interviews with patients on all of the topics covered. The more personal touches make it much more engaging than standard scientific literature. I did feel like it often jumped around between anecdotes, which was jarring until their relevance became clear - although this may have been necessary given the breadth of subjects covered.I'm glad that books about the arbtitrariness of separating the mind and body are becoming more common. For anyone interested in the human mind, this is a recommended read."

This is a very difficult task: one step too far, and you're in the land of the wackos. Almost miraculously, Marchant avoids this and writes about all those strange (or not very strange) cures accurately, never leaving the confines of the reasonable and the scientific, but at the same time not turning them into a small box, which often happens in real life."

80,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/735052-james,4,"Marchant is a popular science writer with a PhD in genetics and medical microbiology who has written for New Scientist, Nature, the Guardian, and the Smithonian . She is rigorously skeptical of alternative therapies and the miraculous; however she isn't dismissive of the fact that people are sometimes helped by them. Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body is her examination of the mind's power to influence physical health and well being. She reviews various scientific studies, interviews those who have participated in them, and explores what the brain can or cannot do as far as healing our bodies.Marchant observes a well known phenomena in contemporary medical research: the placebo effect. She cites research which shows that in some instances, a placebo works even if the person knows they are getting the placebo, though it impacts symptoms rather than the disease itself (still valuable for quality of life). She also notes the 'nocebo effect' where a person's health declines because of the belief that something is causing them harm (i.e. believing you were poisoned, or had a curse put on you). Placebos can be a powerful counter medicine to these psychosomatic ailments and empathetic patient care does make a real difference in prognosis. So Marchant admits some value in alternative medicines:Therapies such as homeopathy and Reiki contain no active ingredient and show no benefit in rigorous clinical trials. They are based on principles that from a scientific point of view are nonsensical—almost certainly do not work in the way they claim they do. But with long, personal consultations and empathetic care, they are perfectly honed to maximize placebo responses. For that reason they probably do provide real relief, particularly for chronic ailments that conventional medicine is not well equipped to treat (39)Marchant examines the benefits of combining a placebo with Pavlovian conditioning, the benefits of cognitive therapies in fighting Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, hypnosis in treating Irritable Bowl Syndrome, and the benefits virtual reality for Pain management. In the latter part of the book she talks about how stress affects health, the benefits of meditation the importance of relationships and positive outlook for aging well, and how manipulating the vagus nerve through electricity may impact our immunity. Her final chapter examines the role of faith in healing, specifically at Lourdes.Marchant doesn't believe in miracles and treats religious ritual like a powerful placebo. She does volunteer at Lourdes and record her observations of a worship service she participated in:I feel out of place amid all the singing and signing. I've never attended a Catholic Mass, and I usually try my hardest to avoid religious ceremonies. I get uneasy about the idea of substituting reason and clear thinking for robes, incantations and mysterious higher powers. But at the same time it is beautiful; a hugely impressive assault on the senses. (266).Later she writes, ""Lourdes didn't turn me into a believer. But after attending this giant underground service, I'm struck by the physical force that religious belief can have"" (227). She sees the power of religion to effect people's health, for good or ill, in mechanisms like stress and ritual. She prefers a naturalistic interpretation of how healing occurs—a scientific explanation of how healing took place invalidates it as a miracle (which she doesn't believe in anyway).I have participated and benefited from healing prayers, but I am also aware of studies on intercessory prayer that show no significant change, and reveal faith healers' success rates as equal to that of a placebo (about 29%). I don't share Marchant's skepticism of the miraculous. I do, however, appreciate her well-documented look at the science behind the power of the mind to influence physical health. Her bias towards a rigorous look at the evidence is what made me want to read the book. I especially found the studies of the placebo effect in the first part of the book interesting, and this is a fun read. I recommend this for anyone interested in our current understanding of the brain's ability to effect our body. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I give this four stars.Note: I received this book from Random House and Crown Publishers through the Blogging For Books Program in exchange for my honest review."

84,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964233-elizabeth,2,"Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body (Hardcover) by Jo Marchant from the libraryWhat a disappointment! There are some paragraphs which deserve more than two stars and many that deserve less. I am so tired of so called science educated journalists writing about what they know nothing about. This author has a genuine science background. But so do I. I have solid background in the hard sciences, did research at Caltech in molecular biology and have a doctorate in a behavioral science. I also have studied some of the alternative healing arts. I am quite clear that I would be dead if I only took care from MD's. So lets get down to some real issues. What about Osteopathy with its moving cranial bones and its craniosacral rhythm? Most of medicine considers that nonsense. What about the veterinary use of acupuncture on race horses? My father was a horse vet. (grad of Texas A&M) He said if it works on horses, its real. The same for veterinary use of homeopathy? So instead of saying science says blah blah, start from it works and figure out why. It would help if the science educated would learn about the healing arts before they write about them. This book is like having a deaf person faced with critiquing music counting the notes of a symphony to decide its value. Try to remember that it wasn't so long ago that doctors denied the value of washing their hands, or the value of fruits and vegetables in diet. They believed that masturbation led to insanity, that women had less intelligence because their skull volume was smaller than men's and that letting women become educated would result in damaged babies and the resulting destruction of the human species."
85,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46134979-juliet,4,"I found this book fascinating and refreshing. I am already a believer in alternative therapies where appropriate and looking to non-prescription solutions whenever possible. What made this book stand out to me was the author's skepticism of these alternative therapies and the thorough research she conducted to get to the bottom of what was causing the results. It's hard to find books in this topic that aren't heavily biased one way or another, but this one is the exception. A lot of the stories and examples hit close to home for me, and I felt that the author did an excellent job exploring both sides of each argument before drawing conclusions (which were always based on facts and evidence). It’s yet another book that confirms how effective mindfulness and meditation can be in managing stress and depression. I was also intrigued by the placebo effect and how most antidepressants are no more effective than placebos in trials, yet they still get the green light. The author is British, yet her outside perspective of the U.S. healthcare system is spot on.An underlying theme in many of the alternative therapies was a feeling of connection to the world (either through religion, spirituality, or nature), a strong social network, and close relationships with others. Overall it seems the key to health, with or without a diagnosis, is being able to be mindful of the present moment and having a connection to others and the world around us. While this book left me feeling frustrated at the current state of our healthcare system, I did leave off hopeful that there are some steps I can take on my own."

Highly recommend, especially for my fellow scientists."
87,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915736-marya,4,"Cure is a great way to introduce yourself to alternative healing practices from a scientific/skeptical perspective. Marchant never writes off anyone as a quack, but neither does she embrace all practices as equal or even effective. Instead, Marchant recognizes a mind-body connection and how modern medicine tries to avoid that connection like the plague. This does a disservice to everyone as potentially effective treatments are dismissed by medicine, patients dismiss these dismissive doctors, and no one actually addresses the patient's needs.Marchant begins with the placebo effect and highlights research showing what it can --- and can't - do. The nerve cells of individuals suffering from PD actually improve their coordination after a placebo treatment. Yet, the individuals still have PD. Marchant then meanders through other treatments that aim to repeat that effect, from hypnosis to virtual reality. This was my favorite part of the book, though the research becomes less and less conclusive as she continues. That's not necessarily a condemnation of the methods- the research simply isn't there (and sometimes, neither is the funding). I really wish Marchant had expanded on this portion. A whole book on the placebo effect with that writer would be wonderful!Sadly, Marchant strays further and further away from the extensive research to end with something that has no research supporting it at all. It's an interesting journey, but I spent far longer trying to motivate myself to read the second half than the first."
88,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48896082-archi,2,"This book is a placebo. It began with promise: the explanation of the various types of placebo effect, channels of operation, and the selection bias of medical trials that lead to a failure of standard medicine to appreciate the value of ""mind"" induced or enhanced therapies. Very interesting and worth further research. This is up to about chapter 4, ending with altitude sickness.From there, the book turned into an anecdotal, self-focused review of the travels of the author on 'research' of alternative medicine. Both her logic and her science are weak. Her conclusions are based on personal experience more than data, and the data she uses are extremely limited. Most of her conclusions are 'but what if X turns out to be true?' Her kid-gloved critique of obviously un-founded treatments (like the Washington aura healer) do little to add rigor to her process. For example, her review of the placebo effect on an autistic toddler - completely baseless. Was it the parents' change in attitude that cured the child? Was it the autistic child whose mind became convinced that an unrelated treatment was suddenly useful? Sports, childbirth, poverty/politics and religion sections were painful to read. I would think that a fundamental flaw is her inability to define mind and/or body in the context of illness or treatment.Its a shame really, b/c this is a real subject worth deep and rigorous research. This is a feel-good, diet science book that raises the issue, but does little to advance it. "
89,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,3,"This book is a series of fairly entertaining articles about different ways the mind might influence illness, or maybe the perceptions of illness. In some of the chapters, the author reports on the placebo effect, but in others seems to swallow reports of what might be placebo effect without question.While the anecdotes make it easier to understand the diseases Ms. Marchant writes about, it was difficult to believe she understands science if she cites grey hair as proof of stress. The age at which your hair turns grey is recognized as being genetic. If we want to go into anecdotes, I have a 65 year old relative with a huge amount of stress in her life (retirement, moving, divorce, cancer, death) who still has no grey, just like her mother at the same age. I have other friends who turned grey in their 30's and 40's while living a good life. Grey hair should not be cited as proof of a stressful life. On page 39 the author states ""..long personal consultations and empathetic care.....maximize placebo responses."" This pretty much sums up the book. Ms. Marchant tells some interesting stories, but not many of them are about science based research with results that can't be attributed to the placebo effect. "
90,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"I approached this book with long-standing skepticism about alternative medicine, but at the end of it, found that I had consumed a healthy serving of wholesome food for thought. One reason I read the book, despite my skepticism, is that it is written by a heavily-credentialed scientist who, it turns out, also had initial reservations about her subject. Nevertheless, Jo Marchant has written a solidly-researched book which will, at a minimum, leave the reader with the impression that much of what the author says rings true.In twelve chapters, Marchant describes various illnesses and health conditions of people all over the world, and juxtaposes conventional medical treatments with lesser-known treatments that incorporate actions of the human mind. In chapter one, for example, she talks about illnesses ranging from autism and Parkinson’s disease to altitude sickness, and how placebos were used to test the efficacy of drugs intended to target a specific disease. Surprisingly, in many cases, placebo patients described deriving the same beneficial effects as patients receiving a real drug. In even more astonishing cases of “honest placebos,” patients knowingly receiving placebos still underwent health improvements. Clearly, this circumstance was less to do with placebos and drugs than it was to do with how the mind was participating in the intervention.In riveting chapter after chapter, Marchant illustrates the psychological response humans have in the treatment of illnesses. She takes on numerous controversial alternative treatments—acupuncture, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, the Lourdes miracle cures, the power of social interactions, and yes, even religion-based and virtual reality therapies—and suggests the healing power of the mind, either with or without real drugs and medications.What makes this book so readable is Marchant’s wonderful, fluent writing in a style and form that is totally accessible to the lay reader. The progressive, case-building structure of the whole book, and even the chapter formats are beautifully constructed, making Cure not only an easy read, but a fast-paced one. Although she readily admits the need for much more basic research to “understand the complexities of the connections between brain and body,” she philosophically accepts that pharmaceutical companies will have no interest in trials that potentially result in non-drug treatments or that might reduce dosages of existing medications.In the book’s conclusion, the scientist in Marchant issues a caution: she is “uneasy” when doctors offer alternative treatments accompanied by “explanatory frameworks with no scientific basis.” But she is also open-minded enough to state that, “…the science described in this book shows that in many situations, we have the capacity to influence our own health by harnessing the power of the (conscious and unconscious) mind.” Marchant sees no reason not to participate in remedies that appear to work, especially when conventional treatments fall short.This is a fabulous, well-written, thought-provoking book on a subject as controversial as it is popular. I highly recommend it—to believers and skeptics alike!"

But Marchant investigates the evidence, the science, behind the effectiveness of alternative or complementary therapies and the power of our minds to affect our health.Marchant interviewed both practitioners, researchers and patients, such as a gent named Gareth, whose MS was under control through meditation. As Gareth explains:“People think of meditation as a time consumer, but the opposite is true. It is a time provider, because of all the time that we don’t spend following useless trains of thought. I wouldn’t be able to lead the life that I lead now if it weren’t for meditation.”Marchant covers many mind-body therapies that can improve medical outcomes by “treating patients as the complex human beings we are, rather than simply as physical bodies…”Her conclusion after looking into everything from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction to homeopathy, acupuncture, and social factors such as loneliness and poverty, show that “our thoughts, beliefs, stress levels and worldview all influence how ill or well we feel.”She explains that the way our brains are wired not only constructs our experience but our physical reality and vice versa.Nearly 400 years after Descartes’ separation of the mind and body in scientific thought, Marchant uncovers evidence that shows something very different — that our bodies and minds have evolved in exquisite harmony, so perfectly integrated that it is impossible to consider one without the other:“Terms like ‘mind-body’ and ‘holistic’ are often derided as flaky and unscientific, but in fact it’s the idea of a mind distinct from the body, an ephemeral entity that floats somewhere in the skull like a spirit or soul, that makes no scientific sense.”If you’d like to understand how our minds influence and reflect our physiology, CURE is definitely a must-read. Marchant’s research lays out the potential of our mind’s ability to heal the body — and how we can use her findings in our own lives."
92,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"My sister has relied on homeopathic healers through much of her adult life. She ate a healthy vegan diet and regularly attended Tai Chi and Chi Gong classes for exercise. When she began feeling nauseous and fatigued, she stepped up the program and increased the number of alternative remedies she used. So when she was finally diagnosed with Stage 4 B Cell Lymphoma, her condition was serious indeed. Fortunately, chemotherapy destroyed the tumors that crowded most of her body and left her struggling to breath and unable to eat. The experience left me more than a little angry with alternative medicine. Is there any redeeming value in alternative medicine?I’m happy to say that the answer is yes; some alternative therapies are effective in improving quality of life, relieving some symptoms, and even noosing the immune system. The Cure recounts a plethora of well-designed studies that suggest that meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, yoga, and other treatment modes have a salutive effect on health and week being. What’s complicated is working out when and why this is true. For example, people who meditate regularly are less subject to stress reactions. As a result, meditators are more resilient and less likely to suffer the effects of cortisol and adrenaline, including immune diseases and cardiovascular disease. This is a fascinating book and I will go back and reread a few chapters again."
93,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52492316-kachina,5,"This book was very informative yet, Marchant’s tone keeps things real and interesting. This isn’t some book about rejecting conventional medicine to pursue homeopathy. Rather, the author suggests that unconventional practices such as the use of placebos, meditation and even the feeling of simply being cared for, may reduce our stress levels which then improves our well-being. In a world that is so reliant on drugs, it is comforting to know that there are other alternatives. The author makes sure to back up her information with scientific research and data which I found reassuring. It’s no secret that funding for alternative medicine is extremely low because there isn’t a lot of money that can be made with treating people without pills. That is the sad truth that is repeated throughout the book. The funny thing is, (as Marchant states), a lot of the pain-killer and antidepressants that are prescribed to people don’t work any better than the placebos. Ultimately, with the use of real-world examples, it is further proof that the mind and the body truly are remarkable. In Marchant’s own words, she hopes this books helps to “overcome some prejudice against mind-body approaches.” I can go on and on about this book but I’ll leave it at that! Everyone should read it! "
94,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,4,"A few years back, I was plagued with a mysterious choking problem that came up when I was attempting to eat under stress, or if I hadn't had any food in more than a few hours. The doctor prescribed antacid, which made matters worse. No help there. It seemed to be worse when I was eating meat, so I tried no meat for a while. That helped, but not enough. Finally, after having been declared a medical mystery enough times by Western doctors, I tried acupuncture. The problem went away almost immediately and has never returned. I'm the sort of case that Jo Marchant writes about in this highly interesting and occasionally frustrating book. Interesting, because she investigates and illuminates, with the cool light of science, everything from acupuncture (hardly any discernible effects) to homeopathy (hogwash) to the placebo effect (very real). Frustrating, because she's working so hard to be reasonable that sometimes it seems that she's pulling back from a necessary conclusion in order to appear to be open-minded. Indeed, the only practice she roundly dispenses with is homeopathy. Everything else she manages to find some use for -- precisely because her main thesis is that the mind and body are not separate, but heavily influence one another, so that of course -- of course -- the mind is important in just about every aspect of medicine. Even Lourdes, which Marchant discusses as the importance of community and loving attention to healing, and as a way of criticizing Western medicine for neglecting the heart's need for love as well as the mind's need for authority and the body's need for good medicine. It's a good book. Just a little too reasonable. Which is probably not a very fair thing to say. "
95,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4068546-cecilia,5,"This book was exactly what I hoped it would be. I flew through the first part about medical therapies, and, while the second part about ""the importance of our minds from day to day"" was interesting, it wasn't as interesting as the first part. Regardless, the whole book is a worthwhile read, and I highly recommend it. I appreciate the critical and balanced perspective of the author and that she investigates the science, techniques, and theories with the right amount of openness and skepticism. She approaches research studies the way I do--for instance, she might discuss a promising study, but she makes sure to detail any possible shortcomings of the study (small sample size, results have not been reproduced yet, etc.). I was happy to discover there was a book marrying two topics that interest me greatly--psychology and medicine--and I'm happy that it turned out to be as fascinating and informative as I imagined it would be."

I only have two minor complaints: the first is that the information on graded exercise therapy (GET) for chronic fatigue syndrome is outdated. This particular form of ""treatment"" has largely been found to be detrimental to CFS patients. I also think the book, while nearly perfect in most other ways, could benefit from a bit of editing to sharpen it up a bit.This year I am trying to scale back my ratings to be more discriminating, but still, this is a solid ""4"" for me!! I agree with the author's assessment that progress for the individual will likely come not from the medical/pharmaceutical fields but from technology, particularly the development/marketing of consumer biofeedback programs. "
97,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24030791-robyn,4,"This is an exceptionally well-researched and accessibly written book on a fascinating topic - the extent of the mind's influence over the body, and how this influences health and illness. All of the references are detailed for those interested in the science, but everything is explained thoroughly enough to be easily understood by anyone. Jo Marchant strikes a good balance between personal anecdotes, interviews with scientists, and interviews with patients on all of the topics covered. The more personal touches make it much more engaging than standard scientific literature. I did feel like it often jumped around between anecdotes, which was jarring until their relevance became clear - although this may have been necessary given the breadth of subjects covered.I'm glad that books about the arbtitrariness of separating the mind and body are becoming more common. For anyone interested in the human mind, this is a recommended read."

This is a very difficult task: one step too far, and you're in the land of the wackos. Almost miraculously, Marchant avoids this and writes about all those strange (or not very strange) cures accurately, never leaving the confines of the reasonable and the scientific, but at the same time not turning them into a small box, which often happens in real life."

However the ending was delayed by way too many repetitive examples, all vying to prove the same point - e.g. that stress can cause physical damage to ones body.

It contains fascinating accounts of research into the power of the brain to alleviate physical suffering. The author makes the science easy to understand and she offers many vignettes from the studies. A quick but truly engaging read, even if you are not a devotee of ""mindfulness""!!"
110,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/735052-james,4,"Marchant is a popular science writer with a PhD in genetics and medical microbiology who has written for New Scientist, Nature, the Guardian, and the Smithonian . She is rigorously skeptical of alternative therapies and the miraculous; however she isn't dismissive of the fact that people are sometimes helped by them. Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body is her examination of the mind's power to influence physical health and well being. She reviews various scientific studies, interviews those who have participated in them, and explores what the brain can or cannot do as far as healing our bodies.Marchant observes a well known phenomena in contemporary medical research: the placebo effect. She cites research which shows that in some instances, a placebo works even if the person knows they are getting the placebo, though it impacts symptoms rather than the disease itself (still valuable for quality of life). She also notes the 'nocebo effect' where a person's health declines because of the belief that something is causing them harm (i.e. believing you were poisoned, or had a curse put on you). Placebos can be a powerful counter medicine to these psychosomatic ailments and empathetic patient care does make a real difference in prognosis. So Marchant admits some value in alternative medicines:Therapies such as homeopathy and Reiki contain no active ingredient and show no benefit in rigorous clinical trials. They are based on principles that from a scientific point of view are nonsensical—almost certainly do not work in the way they claim they do. But with long, personal consultations and empathetic care, they are perfectly honed to maximize placebo responses. For that reason they probably do provide real relief, particularly for chronic ailments that conventional medicine is not well equipped to treat (39)Marchant examines the benefits of combining a placebo with Pavlovian conditioning, the benefits of cognitive therapies in fighting Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, hypnosis in treating Irritable Bowl Syndrome, and the benefits virtual reality for Pain management. In the latter part of the book she talks about how stress affects health, the benefits of meditation the importance of relationships and positive outlook for aging well, and how manipulating the vagus nerve through electricity may impact our immunity. Her final chapter examines the role of faith in healing, specifically at Lourdes.Marchant doesn't believe in miracles and treats religious ritual like a powerful placebo. She does volunteer at Lourdes and record her observations of a worship service she participated in:I feel out of place amid all the singing and signing. I've never attended a Catholic Mass, and I usually try my hardest to avoid religious ceremonies. I get uneasy about the idea of substituting reason and clear thinking for robes, incantations and mysterious higher powers. But at the same time it is beautiful; a hugely impressive assault on the senses. (266).Later she writes, ""Lourdes didn't turn me into a believer. But after attending this giant underground service, I'm struck by the physical force that religious belief can have"" (227). She sees the power of religion to effect people's health, for good or ill, in mechanisms like stress and ritual. She prefers a naturalistic interpretation of how healing occurs—a scientific explanation of how healing took place invalidates it as a miracle (which she doesn't believe in anyway).I have participated and benefited from healing prayers, but I am also aware of studies on intercessory prayer that show no significant change, and reveal faith healers' success rates as equal to that of a placebo (about 29%). I don't share Marchant's skepticism of the miraculous. I do, however, appreciate her well-documented look at the science behind the power of the mind to influence physical health. Her bias towards a rigorous look at the evidence is what made me want to read the book. I especially found the studies of the placebo effect in the first part of the book interesting, and this is a fun read. I recommend this for anyone interested in our current understanding of the brain's ability to effect our body. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I give this four stars.Note: I received this book from Random House and Crown Publishers through the Blogging For Books Program in exchange for my honest review."
111,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/374466-barbara,4,"I liked this more than I expected to. She does a good job keeping the line between science and woo-woo clear but not impassable.

114,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964233-elizabeth,2,"Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body (Hardcover) by Jo Marchant from the libraryWhat a disappointment! There are some paragraphs which deserve more than two stars and many that deserve less. I am so tired of so called science educated journalists writing about what they know nothing about. This author has a genuine science background. But so do I. I have solid background in the hard sciences, did research at Caltech in molecular biology and have a doctorate in a behavioral science. I also have studied some of the alternative healing arts. I am quite clear that I would be dead if I only took care from MD's. So lets get down to some real issues. What about Osteopathy with its moving cranial bones and its craniosacral rhythm? Most of medicine considers that nonsense. What about the veterinary use of acupuncture on race horses? My father was a horse vet. (grad of Texas A&M) He said if it works on horses, its real. The same for veterinary use of homeopathy? So instead of saying science says blah blah, start from it works and figure out why. It would help if the science educated would learn about the healing arts before they write about them. This book is like having a deaf person faced with critiquing music counting the notes of a symphony to decide its value. Try to remember that it wasn't so long ago that doctors denied the value of washing their hands, or the value of fruits and vegetables in diet. They believed that masturbation led to insanity, that women had less intelligence because their skull volume was smaller than men's and that letting women become educated would result in damaged babies and the resulting destruction of the human species."
115,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46134979-juliet,4,"I found this book fascinating and refreshing. I am already a believer in alternative therapies where appropriate and looking to non-prescription solutions whenever possible. What made this book stand out to me was the author's skepticism of these alternative therapies and the thorough research she conducted to get to the bottom of what was causing the results. It's hard to find books in this topic that aren't heavily biased one way or another, but this one is the exception. A lot of the stories and examples hit close to home for me, and I felt that the author did an excellent job exploring both sides of each argument before drawing conclusions (which were always based on facts and evidence). It’s yet another book that confirms how effective mindfulness and meditation can be in managing stress and depression. I was also intrigued by the placebo effect and how most antidepressants are no more effective than placebos in trials, yet they still get the green light. The author is British, yet her outside perspective of the U.S. healthcare system is spot on.An underlying theme in many of the alternative therapies was a feeling of connection to the world (either through religion, spirituality, or nature), a strong social network, and close relationships with others. Overall it seems the key to health, with or without a diagnosis, is being able to be mindful of the present moment and having a connection to others and the world around us. While this book left me feeling frustrated at the current state of our healthcare system, I did leave off hopeful that there are some steps I can take on my own."
116,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27489272-molecule,5,"Excellent! Eye-opening, mind-expanding and incredibly well written. Jo Marchant gives us perspective and starting point for the future of health care where real human touch and experience, as well as our own powerful resources, will join forces with science to help as live healthier and happier lives. Highly recommend, especially for my fellow scientists."
117,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915736-marya,4,"Cure is a great way to introduce yourself to alternative healing practices from a scientific/skeptical perspective. Marchant never writes off anyone as a quack, but neither does she embrace all practices as equal or even effective. Instead, Marchant recognizes a mind-body connection and how modern medicine tries to avoid that connection like the plague. This does a disservice to everyone as potentially effective treatments are dismissed by medicine, patients dismiss these dismissive doctors, and no one actually addresses the patient's needs.Marchant begins with the placebo effect and highlights research showing what it can --- and can't - do. The nerve cells of individuals suffering from PD actually improve their coordination after a placebo treatment. Yet, the individuals still have PD. Marchant then meanders through other treatments that aim to repeat that effect, from hypnosis to virtual reality. This was my favorite part of the book, though the research becomes less and less conclusive as she continues. That's not necessarily a condemnation of the methods- the research simply isn't there (and sometimes, neither is the funding). I really wish Marchant had expanded on this portion. A whole book on the placebo effect with that writer would be wonderful!Sadly, Marchant strays further and further away from the extensive research to end with something that has no research supporting it at all. It's an interesting journey, but I spent far longer trying to motivate myself to read the second half than the first."
118,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48896082-archi,2,"This book is a placebo. It began with promise: the explanation of the various types of placebo effect, channels of operation, and the selection bias of medical trials that lead to a failure of standard medicine to appreciate the value of ""mind"" induced or enhanced therapies. Very interesting and worth further research. This is up to about chapter 4, ending with altitude sickness.From there, the book turned into an anecdotal, self-focused review of the travels of the author on 'research' of alternative medicine. Both her logic and her science are weak. Her conclusions are based on personal experience more than data, and the data she uses are extremely limited. Most of her conclusions are 'but what if X turns out to be true?' Her kid-gloved critique of obviously un-founded treatments (like the Washington aura healer) do little to add rigor to her process. For example, her review of the placebo effect on an autistic toddler - completely baseless. Was it the parents' change in attitude that cured the child? Was it the autistic child whose mind became convinced that an unrelated treatment was suddenly useful? Sports, childbirth, poverty/politics and religion sections were painful to read. I would think that a fundamental flaw is her inability to define mind and/or body in the context of illness or treatment.Its a shame really, b/c this is a real subject worth deep and rigorous research. This is a feel-good, diet science book that raises the issue, but does little to advance it. "
119,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,3,"This book is a series of fairly entertaining articles about different ways the mind might influence illness, or maybe the perceptions of illness. In some of the chapters, the author reports on the placebo effect, but in others seems to swallow reports of what might be placebo effect without question.While the anecdotes make it easier to understand the diseases Ms. Marchant writes about, it was difficult to believe she understands science if she cites grey hair as proof of stress. The age at which your hair turns grey is recognized as being genetic. If we want to go into anecdotes, I have a 65 year old relative with a huge amount of stress in her life (retirement, moving, divorce, cancer, death) who still has no grey, just like her mother at the same age. I have other friends who turned grey in their 30's and 40's while living a good life. Grey hair should not be cited as proof of a stressful life. On page 39 the author states ""..long personal consultations and empathetic care.....maximize placebo responses."" This pretty much sums up the book. Ms. Marchant tells some interesting stories, but not many of them are about science based research with results that can't be attributed to the placebo effect. "
120,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"I approached this book with long-standing skepticism about alternative medicine, but at the end of it, found that I had consumed a healthy serving of wholesome food for thought. One reason I read the book, despite my skepticism, is that it is written by a heavily-credentialed scientist who, it turns out, also had initial reservations about her subject. Nevertheless, Jo Marchant has written a solidly-researched book which will, at a minimum, leave the reader with the impression that much of what the author says rings true.In twelve chapters, Marchant describes various illnesses and health conditions of people all over the world, and juxtaposes conventional medical treatments with lesser-known treatments that incorporate actions of the human mind. In chapter one, for example, she talks about illnesses ranging from autism and Parkinson’s disease to altitude sickness, and how placebos were used to test the efficacy of drugs intended to target a specific disease. Surprisingly, in many cases, placebo patients described deriving the same beneficial effects as patients receiving a real drug. In even more astonishing cases of “honest placebos,” patients knowingly receiving placebos still underwent health improvements. Clearly, this circumstance was less to do with placebos and drugs than it was to do with how the mind was participating in the intervention.In riveting chapter after chapter, Marchant illustrates the psychological response humans have in the treatment of illnesses. She takes on numerous controversial alternative treatments—acupuncture, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, the Lourdes miracle cures, the power of social interactions, and yes, even religion-based and virtual reality therapies—and suggests the healing power of the mind, either with or without real drugs and medications.What makes this book so readable is Marchant’s wonderful, fluent writing in a style and form that is totally accessible to the lay reader. The progressive, case-building structure of the whole book, and even the chapter formats are beautifully constructed, making Cure not only an easy read, but a fast-paced one. Although she readily admits the need for much more basic research to “understand the complexities of the connections between brain and body,” she philosophically accepts that pharmaceutical companies will have no interest in trials that potentially result in non-drug treatments or that might reduce dosages of existing medications.In the book’s conclusion, the scientist in Marchant issues a caution: she is “uneasy” when doctors offer alternative treatments accompanied by “explanatory frameworks with no scientific basis.” But she is also open-minded enough to state that, “…the science described in this book shows that in many situations, we have the capacity to influence our own health by harnessing the power of the (conscious and unconscious) mind.” Marchant sees no reason not to participate in remedies that appear to work, especially when conventional treatments fall short.This is a fabulous, well-written, thought-provoking book on a subject as controversial as it is popular. I highly recommend it—to believers and skeptics alike!"
121,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4282506-becca-chopra,5,"Mind-body medicine has been around for thousands of years, and is now scientifically shown to work.With CURE – A Journey into the Science of Mind over Body, Jo Marchant has written a book that I would recommend to all healers, complementary or allopathic, and to all those in need of healing… which is pretty much everyone.Having experienced every healing modality mentioned in the book, I have my own personal opinions of miracle cures, the placebo effect, the benefits of mindfulness and meditation, and using the mind to enhance our physical healing. But Marchant investigates the evidence, the science, behind the effectiveness of alternative or complementary therapies and the power of our minds to affect our health.Marchant interviewed both practitioners, researchers and patients, such as a gent named Gareth, whose MS was under control through meditation. As Gareth explains:“People think of meditation as a time consumer, but the opposite is true. It is a time provider, because of all the time that we don’t spend following useless trains of thought. I wouldn’t be able to lead the life that I lead now if it weren’t for meditation.”Marchant covers many mind-body therapies that can improve medical outcomes by “treating patients as the complex human beings we are, rather than simply as physical bodies…”Her conclusion after looking into everything from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction to homeopathy, acupuncture, and social factors such as loneliness and poverty, show that “our thoughts, beliefs, stress levels and worldview all influence how ill or well we feel.”She explains that the way our brains are wired not only constructs our experience but our physical reality and vice versa.Nearly 400 years after Descartes’ separation of the mind and body in scientific thought, Marchant uncovers evidence that shows something very different — that our bodies and minds have evolved in exquisite harmony, so perfectly integrated that it is impossible to consider one without the other:“Terms like ‘mind-body’ and ‘holistic’ are often derided as flaky and unscientific, but in fact it’s the idea of a mind distinct from the body, an ephemeral entity that floats somewhere in the skull like a spirit or soul, that makes no scientific sense.”If you’d like to understand how our minds influence and reflect our physiology, CURE is definitely a must-read. Marchant’s research lays out the potential of our mind’s ability to heal the body — and how we can use her findings in our own lives."

She ate a healthy vegan diet and regularly attended Tai Chi and Chi Gong classes for exercise. When she began feeling nauseous and fatigued, she stepped up the program and increased the number of alternative remedies she used. So when she was finally diagnosed with Stage 4 B Cell Lymphoma, her condition was serious indeed. Fortunately, chemotherapy destroyed the tumors that crowded most of her body and left her struggling to breath and unable to eat. The experience left me more than a little angry with alternative medicine. Is there any redeeming value in alternative medicine?I’m happy to say that the answer is yes; some alternative therapies are effective in improving quality of life, relieving some symptoms, and even noosing the immune system. The Cure recounts a plethora of well-designed studies that suggest that meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, yoga, and other treatment modes have a salutive effect on health and week being. What’s complicated is working out when and why this is true. For example, people who meditate regularly are less subject to stress reactions. As a result, meditators are more resilient and less likely to suffer the effects of cortisol and adrenaline, including immune diseases and cardiovascular disease. This is a fascinating book and I will go back and reread a few chapters again."
123,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52492316-kachina,5,"This book was very informative yet, Marchant’s tone keeps things real and interesting. This isn’t some book about rejecting conventional medicine to pursue homeopathy. Rather, the author suggests that unconventional practices such as the use of placebos, meditation and even the feeling of simply being cared for, may reduce our stress levels which then improves our well-being. In a world that is so reliant on drugs, it is comforting to know that there are other alternatives. The author makes sure to back up her information with scientific research and data which I found reassuring. It’s no secret that funding for alternative medicine is extremely low because there isn’t a lot of money that can be made with treating people without pills. That is the sad truth that is repeated throughout the book. The funny thing is, (as Marchant states), a lot of the pain-killer and antidepressants that are prescribed to people don’t work any better than the placebos. Ultimately, with the use of real-world examples, it is further proof that the mind and the body truly are remarkable. In Marchant’s own words, she hopes this books helps to “overcome some prejudice against mind-body approaches.” I can go on and on about this book but I’ll leave it at that! Everyone should read it! "
124,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,4,"A few years back, I was plagued with a mysterious choking problem that came up when I was attempting to eat under stress, or if I hadn't had any food in more than a few hours. The doctor prescribed antacid, which made matters worse. No help there. It seemed to be worse when I was eating meat, so I tried no meat for a while. That helped, but not enough. Finally, after having been declared a medical mystery enough times by Western doctors, I tried acupuncture. The problem went away almost immediately and has never returned. I'm the sort of case that Jo Marchant writes about in this highly interesting and occasionally frustrating book. Interesting, because she investigates and illuminates, with the cool light of science, everything from acupuncture (hardly any discernible effects) to homeopathy (hogwash) to the placebo effect (very real). Frustrating, because she's working so hard to be reasonable that sometimes it seems that she's pulling back from a necessary conclusion in order to appear to be open-minded. Indeed, the only practice she roundly dispenses with is homeopathy. Everything else she manages to find some use for -- precisely because her main thesis is that the mind and body are not separate, but heavily influence one another, so that of course -- of course -- the mind is important in just about every aspect of medicine. Even Lourdes, which Marchant discusses as the importance of community and loving attention to healing, and as a way of criticizing Western medicine for neglecting the heart's need for love as well as the mind's need for authority and the body's need for good medicine. It's a good book. Just a little too reasonable. Which is probably not a very fair thing to say. "

I flew through the first part about medical therapies, and, while the second part about ""the importance of our minds from day to day"" was interesting, it wasn't as interesting as the first part. Regardless, the whole book is a worthwhile read, and I highly recommend it. I appreciate the critical and balanced perspective of the author and that she investigates the science, techniques, and theories with the right amount of openness and skepticism. She approaches research studies the way I do--for instance, she might discuss a promising study, but she makes sure to detail any possible shortcomings of the study (small sample size, results have not been reproduced yet, etc.). I was happy to discover there was a book marrying two topics that interest me greatly--psychology and medicine--and I'm happy that it turned out to be as fascinating and informative as I imagined it would be."

All of the references are detailed for those interested in the science, but everything is explained thoroughly enough to be easily understood by anyone. Jo Marchant strikes a good balance between personal anecdotes, interviews with scientists, and interviews with patients on all of the topics covered. The more personal touches make it much more engaging than standard scientific literature. I did feel like it often jumped around between anecdotes, which was jarring until their relevance became clear - although this may have been necessary given the breadth of subjects covered.I'm glad that books about the arbtitrariness of separating the mind and body are becoming more common.

140,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/735052-james,4,"Marchant is a popular science writer with a PhD in genetics and medical microbiology who has written for New Scientist, Nature, the Guardian, and the Smithonian . She is rigorously skeptical of alternative therapies and the miraculous; however she isn't dismissive of the fact that people are sometimes helped by them. Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body is her examination of the mind's power to influence physical health and well being. She reviews various scientific studies, interviews those who have participated in them, and explores what the brain can or cannot do as far as healing our bodies.Marchant observes a well known phenomena in contemporary medical research: the placebo effect. She cites research which shows that in some instances, a placebo works even if the person knows they are getting the placebo, though it impacts symptoms rather than the disease itself (still valuable for quality of life). She also notes the 'nocebo effect' where a person's health declines because of the belief that something is causing them harm (i.e. believing you were poisoned, or had a curse put on you). Placebos can be a powerful counter medicine to these psychosomatic ailments and empathetic patient care does make a real difference in prognosis. So Marchant admits some value in alternative medicines:Therapies such as homeopathy and Reiki contain no active ingredient and show no benefit in rigorous clinical trials. They are based on principles that from a scientific point of view are nonsensical—almost certainly do not work in the way they claim they do. But with long, personal consultations and empathetic care, they are perfectly honed to maximize placebo responses. For that reason they probably do provide real relief, particularly for chronic ailments that conventional medicine is not well equipped to treat (39)Marchant examines the benefits of combining a placebo with Pavlovian conditioning, the benefits of cognitive therapies in fighting Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, hypnosis in treating Irritable Bowl Syndrome, and the benefits virtual reality for Pain management. In the latter part of the book she talks about how stress affects health, the benefits of meditation the importance of relationships and positive outlook for aging well, and how manipulating the vagus nerve through electricity may impact our immunity. Her final chapter examines the role of faith in healing, specifically at Lourdes.Marchant doesn't believe in miracles and treats religious ritual like a powerful placebo. She does volunteer at Lourdes and record her observations of a worship service she participated in:I feel out of place amid all the singing and signing. I've never attended a Catholic Mass, and I usually try my hardest to avoid religious ceremonies. I get uneasy about the idea of substituting reason and clear thinking for robes, incantations and mysterious higher powers. But at the same time it is beautiful; a hugely impressive assault on the senses. (266).Later she writes, ""Lourdes didn't turn me into a believer. But after attending this giant underground service, I'm struck by the physical force that religious belief can have"" (227). She sees the power of religion to effect people's health, for good or ill, in mechanisms like stress and ritual. She prefers a naturalistic interpretation of how healing occurs—a scientific explanation of how healing took place invalidates it as a miracle (which she doesn't believe in anyway).I have participated and benefited from healing prayers, but I am also aware of studies on intercessory prayer that show no significant change, and reveal faith healers' success rates as equal to that of a placebo (about 29%). I don't share Marchant's skepticism of the miraculous. I do, however, appreciate her well-documented look at the science behind the power of the mind to influence physical health. Her bias towards a rigorous look at the evidence is what made me want to read the book. I especially found the studies of the placebo effect in the first part of the book interesting, and this is a fun read. I recommend this for anyone interested in our current understanding of the brain's ability to effect our body. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I give this four stars.Note: I received this book from Random House and Crown Publishers through the Blogging For Books Program in exchange for my honest review."

144,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964233-elizabeth,2,"Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body (Hardcover) by Jo Marchant from the libraryWhat a disappointment! There are some paragraphs which deserve more than two stars and many that deserve less. I am so tired of so called science educated journalists writing about what they know nothing about. This author has a genuine science background. But so do I. I have solid background in the hard sciences, did research at Caltech in molecular biology and have a doctorate in a behavioral science. I also have studied some of the alternative healing arts. I am quite clear that I would be dead if I only took care from MD's. So lets get down to some real issues. What about Osteopathy with its moving cranial bones and its craniosacral rhythm? Most of medicine considers that nonsense. What about the veterinary use of acupuncture on race horses? My father was a horse vet. (grad of Texas A&M) He said if it works on horses, its real. The same for veterinary use of homeopathy? So instead of saying science says blah blah, start from it works and figure out why. It would help if the science educated would learn about the healing arts before they write about them. This book is like having a deaf person faced with critiquing music counting the notes of a symphony to decide its value. Try to remember that it wasn't so long ago that doctors denied the value of washing their hands, or the value of fruits and vegetables in diet. They believed that masturbation led to insanity, that women had less intelligence because their skull volume was smaller than men's and that letting women become educated would result in damaged babies and the resulting destruction of the human species."
145,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46134979-juliet,4,"I found this book fascinating and refreshing. I am already a believer in alternative therapies where appropriate and looking to non-prescription solutions whenever possible. What made this book stand out to me was the author's skepticism of these alternative therapies and the thorough research she conducted to get to the bottom of what was causing the results. It's hard to find books in this topic that aren't heavily biased one way or another, but this one is the exception. A lot of the stories and examples hit close to home for me, and I felt that the author did an excellent job exploring both sides of each argument before drawing conclusions (which were always based on facts and evidence). It’s yet another book that confirms how effective mindfulness and meditation can be in managing stress and depression. I was also intrigued by the placebo effect and how most antidepressants are no more effective than placebos in trials, yet they still get the green light. The author is British, yet her outside perspective of the U.S. healthcare system is spot on.An underlying theme in many of the alternative therapies was a feeling of connection to the world (either through religion, spirituality, or nature), a strong social network, and close relationships with others. Overall it seems the key to health, with or without a diagnosis, is being able to be mindful of the present moment and having a connection to others and the world around us. While this book left me feeling frustrated at the current state of our healthcare system, I did leave off hopeful that there are some steps I can take on my own."

Highly recommend, especially for my fellow scientists."
147,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915736-marya,4,"Cure is a great way to introduce yourself to alternative healing practices from a scientific/skeptical perspective. Marchant never writes off anyone as a quack, but neither does she embrace all practices as equal or even effective. Instead, Marchant recognizes a mind-body connection and how modern medicine tries to avoid that connection like the plague. This does a disservice to everyone as potentially effective treatments are dismissed by medicine, patients dismiss these dismissive doctors, and no one actually addresses the patient's needs.Marchant begins with the placebo effect and highlights research showing what it can --- and can't - do. The nerve cells of individuals suffering from PD actually improve their coordination after a placebo treatment. Yet, the individuals still have PD. Marchant then meanders through other treatments that aim to repeat that effect, from hypnosis to virtual reality. This was my favorite part of the book, though the research becomes less and less conclusive as she continues. That's not necessarily a condemnation of the methods- the research simply isn't there (and sometimes, neither is the funding). I really wish Marchant had expanded on this portion. A whole book on the placebo effect with that writer would be wonderful!Sadly, Marchant strays further and further away from the extensive research to end with something that has no research supporting it at all. It's an interesting journey, but I spent far longer trying to motivate myself to read the second half than the first."
148,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48896082-archi,2,"This book is a placebo. It began with promise: the explanation of the various types of placebo effect, channels of operation, and the selection bias of medical trials that lead to a failure of standard medicine to appreciate the value of ""mind"" induced or enhanced therapies. Very interesting and worth further research. This is up to about chapter 4, ending with altitude sickness.From there, the book turned into an anecdotal, self-focused review of the travels of the author on 'research' of alternative medicine. Both her logic and her science are weak. Her conclusions are based on personal experience more than data, and the data she uses are extremely limited. Most of her conclusions are 'but what if X turns out to be true?' Her kid-gloved critique of obviously un-founded treatments (like the Washington aura healer) do little to add rigor to her process. For example, her review of the placebo effect on an autistic toddler - completely baseless. Was it the parents' change in attitude that cured the child? Was it the autistic child whose mind became convinced that an unrelated treatment was suddenly useful? Sports, childbirth, poverty/politics and religion sections were painful to read. I would think that a fundamental flaw is her inability to define mind and/or body in the context of illness or treatment.Its a shame really, b/c this is a real subject worth deep and rigorous research. This is a feel-good, diet science book that raises the issue, but does little to advance it. "
149,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,3,"This book is a series of fairly entertaining articles about different ways the mind might influence illness, or maybe the perceptions of illness. In some of the chapters, the author reports on the placebo effect, but in others seems to swallow reports of what might be placebo effect without question.While the anecdotes make it easier to understand the diseases Ms. Marchant writes about, it was difficult to believe she understands science if she cites grey hair as proof of stress. The age at which your hair turns grey is recognized as being genetic. If we want to go into anecdotes, I have a 65 year old relative with a huge amount of stress in her life (retirement, moving, divorce, cancer, death) who still has no grey, just like her mother at the same age. I have other friends who turned grey in their 30's and 40's while living a good life. Grey hair should not be cited as proof of a stressful life. On page 39 the author states ""..long personal consultations and empathetic care.....maximize placebo responses."" This pretty much sums up the book. Ms. Marchant tells some interesting stories, but not many of them are about science based research with results that can't be attributed to the placebo effect. "
150,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"I approached this book with long-standing skepticism about alternative medicine, but at the end of it, found that I had consumed a healthy serving of wholesome food for thought. One reason I read the book, despite my skepticism, is that it is written by a heavily-credentialed scientist who, it turns out, also had initial reservations about her subject. Nevertheless, Jo Marchant has written a solidly-researched book which will, at a minimum, leave the reader with the impression that much of what the author says rings true.In twelve chapters, Marchant describes various illnesses and health conditions of people all over the world, and juxtaposes conventional medical treatments with lesser-known treatments that incorporate actions of the human mind. In chapter one, for example, she talks about illnesses ranging from autism and Parkinson’s disease to altitude sickness, and how placebos were used to test the efficacy of drugs intended to target a specific disease. Surprisingly, in many cases, placebo patients described deriving the same beneficial effects as patients receiving a real drug. In even more astonishing cases of “honest placebos,” patients knowingly receiving placebos still underwent health improvements. Clearly, this circumstance was less to do with placebos and drugs than it was to do with how the mind was participating in the intervention.In riveting chapter after chapter, Marchant illustrates the psychological response humans have in the treatment of illnesses. She takes on numerous controversial alternative treatments—acupuncture, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, the Lourdes miracle cures, the power of social interactions, and yes, even religion-based and virtual reality therapies—and suggests the healing power of the mind, either with or without real drugs and medications.What makes this book so readable is Marchant’s wonderful, fluent writing in a style and form that is totally accessible to the lay reader. The progressive, case-building structure of the whole book, and even the chapter formats are beautifully constructed, making Cure not only an easy read, but a fast-paced one. Although she readily admits the need for much more basic research to “understand the complexities of the connections between brain and body,” she philosophically accepts that pharmaceutical companies will have no interest in trials that potentially result in non-drug treatments or that might reduce dosages of existing medications.In the book’s conclusion, the scientist in Marchant issues a caution: she is “uneasy” when doctors offer alternative treatments accompanied by “explanatory frameworks with no scientific basis.” But she is also open-minded enough to state that, “…the science described in this book shows that in many situations, we have the capacity to influence our own health by harnessing the power of the (conscious and unconscious) mind.” Marchant sees no reason not to participate in remedies that appear to work, especially when conventional treatments fall short.This is a fabulous, well-written, thought-provoking book on a subject as controversial as it is popular. I highly recommend it—to believers and skeptics alike!"
151,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4282506-becca-chopra,5,"Mind-body medicine has been around for thousands of years, and is now scientifically shown to work.With CURE – A Journey into the Science of Mind over Body, Jo Marchant has written a book that I would recommend to all healers, complementary or allopathic, and to all those in need of healing… which is pretty much everyone.Having experienced every healing modality mentioned in the book, I have my own personal opinions of miracle cures, the placebo effect, the benefits of mindfulness and meditation, and using the mind to enhance our physical healing. But Marchant investigates the evidence, the science, behind the effectiveness of alternative or complementary therapies and the power of our minds to affect our health.Marchant interviewed both practitioners, researchers and patients, such as a gent named Gareth, whose MS was under control through meditation. As Gareth explains:“People think of meditation as a time consumer, but the opposite is true. It is a time provider, because of all the time that we don’t spend following useless trains of thought. I wouldn’t be able to lead the life that I lead now if it weren’t for meditation.”Marchant covers many mind-body therapies that can improve medical outcomes by “treating patients as the complex human beings we are, rather than simply as physical bodies…”Her conclusion after looking into everything from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction to homeopathy, acupuncture, and social factors such as loneliness and poverty, show that “our thoughts, beliefs, stress levels and worldview all influence how ill or well we feel.”She explains that the way our brains are wired not only constructs our experience but our physical reality and vice versa.Nearly 400 years after Descartes’ separation of the mind and body in scientific thought, Marchant uncovers evidence that shows something very different — that our bodies and minds have evolved in exquisite harmony, so perfectly integrated that it is impossible to consider one without the other:“Terms like ‘mind-body’ and ‘holistic’ are often derided as flaky and unscientific, but in fact it’s the idea of a mind distinct from the body, an ephemeral entity that floats somewhere in the skull like a spirit or soul, that makes no scientific sense.”If you’d like to understand how our minds influence and reflect our physiology, CURE is definitely a must-read. Marchant’s research lays out the potential of our mind’s ability to heal the body — and how we can use her findings in our own lives."

Fortunately, chemotherapy destroyed the tumors that crowded most of her body and left her struggling to breath and unable to eat. The experience left me more than a little angry with alternative medicine. Is there any redeeming value in alternative medicine?I’m happy to say that the answer is yes; some alternative therapies are effective in improving quality of life, relieving some symptoms, and even noosing the immune system.

Interesting, because she investigates and illuminates, with the cool light of science, everything from acupuncture (hardly any discernible effects) to homeopathy (hogwash) to the placebo effect (very real). Frustrating, because she's working so hard to be reasonable that sometimes it seems that she's pulling back from a necessary conclusion in order to appear to be open-minded. Indeed, the only practice she roundly dispenses with is homeopathy. Everything else she manages to find some use for -- precisely because her main thesis is that the mind and body are not separate, but heavily influence one another, so that of course -- of course -- the mind is important in just about every aspect of medicine. Even Lourdes, which Marchant discusses as the importance of community and loving attention to healing, and as a way of criticizing Western medicine for neglecting the heart's need for love as well as the mind's need for authority and the body's need for good medicine. It's a good book. Just a little too reasonable. Which is probably not a very fair thing to say. "

Jo Marchant strikes a good balance between personal anecdotes, interviews with scientists, and interviews with patients on all of the topics covered. The more personal touches make it much more engaging than standard scientific literature. I did feel like it often jumped around between anecdotes, which was jarring until their relevance became clear - although this may have been necessary given the breadth of subjects covered.I'm glad that books about the arbtitrariness of separating the mind and body are becoming more common.

170,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/735052-james,4,"Marchant is a popular science writer with a PhD in genetics and medical microbiology who has written for New Scientist, Nature, the Guardian, and the Smithonian . She is rigorously skeptical of alternative therapies and the miraculous; however she isn't dismissive of the fact that people are sometimes helped by them. Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body is her examination of the mind's power to influence physical health and well being. She reviews various scientific studies, interviews those who have participated in them, and explores what the brain can or cannot do as far as healing our bodies.Marchant observes a well known phenomena in contemporary medical research: the placebo effect. She cites research which shows that in some instances, a placebo works even if the person knows they are getting the placebo, though it impacts symptoms rather than the disease itself (still valuable for quality of life). She also notes the 'nocebo effect' where a person's health declines because of the belief that something is causing them harm (i.e. believing you were poisoned, or had a curse put on you). Placebos can be a powerful counter medicine to these psychosomatic ailments and empathetic patient care does make a real difference in prognosis. So Marchant admits some value in alternative medicines:Therapies such as homeopathy and Reiki contain no active ingredient and show no benefit in rigorous clinical trials. They are based on principles that from a scientific point of view are nonsensical—almost certainly do not work in the way they claim they do. But with long, personal consultations and empathetic care, they are perfectly honed to maximize placebo responses. For that reason they probably do provide real relief, particularly for chronic ailments that conventional medicine is not well equipped to treat (39)Marchant examines the benefits of combining a placebo with Pavlovian conditioning, the benefits of cognitive therapies in fighting Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, hypnosis in treating Irritable Bowl Syndrome, and the benefits virtual reality for Pain management. In the latter part of the book she talks about how stress affects health, the benefits of meditation the importance of relationships and positive outlook for aging well, and how manipulating the vagus nerve through electricity may impact our immunity. Her final chapter examines the role of faith in healing, specifically at Lourdes.Marchant doesn't believe in miracles and treats religious ritual like a powerful placebo. She does volunteer at Lourdes and record her observations of a worship service she participated in:I feel out of place amid all the singing and signing. I've never attended a Catholic Mass, and I usually try my hardest to avoid religious ceremonies. I get uneasy about the idea of substituting reason and clear thinking for robes, incantations and mysterious higher powers. But at the same time it is beautiful; a hugely impressive assault on the senses. (266).Later she writes, ""Lourdes didn't turn me into a believer. But after attending this giant underground service, I'm struck by the physical force that religious belief can have"" (227). She sees the power of religion to effect people's health, for good or ill, in mechanisms like stress and ritual. She prefers a naturalistic interpretation of how healing occurs—a scientific explanation of how healing took place invalidates it as a miracle (which she doesn't believe in anyway).I have participated and benefited from healing prayers, but I am also aware of studies on intercessory prayer that show no significant change, and reveal faith healers' success rates as equal to that of a placebo (about 29%). I don't share Marchant's skepticism of the miraculous. I do, however, appreciate her well-documented look at the science behind the power of the mind to influence physical health. Her bias towards a rigorous look at the evidence is what made me want to read the book. I especially found the studies of the placebo effect in the first part of the book interesting, and this is a fun read. I recommend this for anyone interested in our current understanding of the brain's ability to effect our body. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I give this four stars.Note: I received this book from Random House and Crown Publishers through the Blogging For Books Program in exchange for my honest review."

174,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964233-elizabeth,2,"Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body (Hardcover) by Jo Marchant from the libraryWhat a disappointment! There are some paragraphs which deserve more than two stars and many that deserve less. I am so tired of so called science educated journalists writing about what they know nothing about. This author has a genuine science background. But so do I. I have solid background in the hard sciences, did research at Caltech in molecular biology and have a doctorate in a behavioral science. I also have studied some of the alternative healing arts. I am quite clear that I would be dead if I only took care from MD's. So lets get down to some real issues. What about Osteopathy with its moving cranial bones and its craniosacral rhythm? Most of medicine considers that nonsense. What about the veterinary use of acupuncture on race horses? My father was a horse vet. (grad of Texas A&M) He said if it works on horses, its real. The same for veterinary use of homeopathy? So instead of saying science says blah blah, start from it works and figure out why. It would help if the science educated would learn about the healing arts before they write about them. This book is like having a deaf person faced with critiquing music counting the notes of a symphony to decide its value. Try to remember that it wasn't so long ago that doctors denied the value of washing their hands, or the value of fruits and vegetables in diet. They believed that masturbation led to insanity, that women had less intelligence because their skull volume was smaller than men's and that letting women become educated would result in damaged babies and the resulting destruction of the human species."
175,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46134979-juliet,4,"I found this book fascinating and refreshing. I am already a believer in alternative therapies where appropriate and looking to non-prescription solutions whenever possible. What made this book stand out to me was the author's skepticism of these alternative therapies and the thorough research she conducted to get to the bottom of what was causing the results. It's hard to find books in this topic that aren't heavily biased one way or another, but this one is the exception. A lot of the stories and examples hit close to home for me, and I felt that the author did an excellent job exploring both sides of each argument before drawing conclusions (which were always based on facts and evidence). It’s yet another book that confirms how effective mindfulness and meditation can be in managing stress and depression. I was also intrigued by the placebo effect and how most antidepressants are no more effective than placebos in trials, yet they still get the green light. The author is British, yet her outside perspective of the U.S. healthcare system is spot on.An underlying theme in many of the alternative therapies was a feeling of connection to the world (either through religion, spirituality, or nature), a strong social network, and close relationships with others. Overall it seems the key to health, with or without a diagnosis, is being able to be mindful of the present moment and having a connection to others and the world around us. While this book left me feeling frustrated at the current state of our healthcare system, I did leave off hopeful that there are some steps I can take on my own."
176,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27489272-molecule,5,"Excellent! Eye-opening, mind-expanding and incredibly well written. Jo Marchant gives us perspective and starting point for the future of health care where real human touch and experience, as well as our own powerful resources, will join forces with science to help as live healthier and happier lives. Highly recommend, especially for my fellow scientists."
177,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915736-marya,4,"Cure is a great way to introduce yourself to alternative healing practices from a scientific/skeptical perspective. Marchant never writes off anyone as a quack, but neither does she embrace all practices as equal or even effective. Instead, Marchant recognizes a mind-body connection and how modern medicine tries to avoid that connection like the plague. This does a disservice to everyone as potentially effective treatments are dismissed by medicine, patients dismiss these dismissive doctors, and no one actually addresses the patient's needs.Marchant begins with the placebo effect and highlights research showing what it can --- and can't - do. The nerve cells of individuals suffering from PD actually improve their coordination after a placebo treatment. Yet, the individuals still have PD. Marchant then meanders through other treatments that aim to repeat that effect, from hypnosis to virtual reality. This was my favorite part of the book, though the research becomes less and less conclusive as she continues. That's not necessarily a condemnation of the methods- the research simply isn't there (and sometimes, neither is the funding). I really wish Marchant had expanded on this portion. A whole book on the placebo effect with that writer would be wonderful!Sadly, Marchant strays further and further away from the extensive research to end with something that has no research supporting it at all. It's an interesting journey, but I spent far longer trying to motivate myself to read the second half than the first."
178,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48896082-archi,2,"This book is a placebo. It began with promise: the explanation of the various types of placebo effect, channels of operation, and the selection bias of medical trials that lead to a failure of standard medicine to appreciate the value of ""mind"" induced or enhanced therapies. Very interesting and worth further research. This is up to about chapter 4, ending with altitude sickness.From there, the book turned into an anecdotal, self-focused review of the travels of the author on 'research' of alternative medicine. Both her logic and her science are weak. Her conclusions are based on personal experience more than data, and the data she uses are extremely limited. Most of her conclusions are 'but what if X turns out to be true?' Her kid-gloved critique of obviously un-founded treatments (like the Washington aura healer) do little to add rigor to her process. For example, her review of the placebo effect on an autistic toddler - completely baseless. Was it the parents' change in attitude that cured the child? Was it the autistic child whose mind became convinced that an unrelated treatment was suddenly useful? Sports, childbirth, poverty/politics and religion sections were painful to read. I would think that a fundamental flaw is her inability to define mind and/or body in the context of illness or treatment.Its a shame really, b/c this is a real subject worth deep and rigorous research. This is a feel-good, diet science book that raises the issue, but does little to advance it. "
179,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,3,"This book is a series of fairly entertaining articles about different ways the mind might influence illness, or maybe the perceptions of illness. In some of the chapters, the author reports on the placebo effect, but in others seems to swallow reports of what might be placebo effect without question.While the anecdotes make it easier to understand the diseases Ms. Marchant writes about, it was difficult to believe she understands science if she cites grey hair as proof of stress. The age at which your hair turns grey is recognized as being genetic. If we want to go into anecdotes, I have a 65 year old relative with a huge amount of stress in her life (retirement, moving, divorce, cancer, death) who still has no grey, just like her mother at the same age. I have other friends who turned grey in their 30's and 40's while living a good life. Grey hair should not be cited as proof of a stressful life. On page 39 the author states ""..long personal consultations and empathetic care.....maximize placebo responses."" This pretty much sums up the book. Ms. Marchant tells some interesting stories, but not many of them are about science based research with results that can't be attributed to the placebo effect. "
180,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"I approached this book with long-standing skepticism about alternative medicine, but at the end of it, found that I had consumed a healthy serving of wholesome food for thought. One reason I read the book, despite my skepticism, is that it is written by a heavily-credentialed scientist who, it turns out, also had initial reservations about her subject. Nevertheless, Jo Marchant has written a solidly-researched book which will, at a minimum, leave the reader with the impression that much of what the author says rings true.In twelve chapters, Marchant describes various illnesses and health conditions of people all over the world, and juxtaposes conventional medical treatments with lesser-known treatments that incorporate actions of the human mind. In chapter one, for example, she talks about illnesses ranging from autism and Parkinson’s disease to altitude sickness, and how placebos were used to test the efficacy of drugs intended to target a specific disease. Surprisingly, in many cases, placebo patients described deriving the same beneficial effects as patients receiving a real drug. In even more astonishing cases of “honest placebos,” patients knowingly receiving placebos still underwent health improvements. Clearly, this circumstance was less to do with placebos and drugs than it was to do with how the mind was participating in the intervention.In riveting chapter after chapter, Marchant illustrates the psychological response humans have in the treatment of illnesses. She takes on numerous controversial alternative treatments—acupuncture, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, the Lourdes miracle cures, the power of social interactions, and yes, even religion-based and virtual reality therapies—and suggests the healing power of the mind, either with or without real drugs and medications.What makes this book so readable is Marchant’s wonderful, fluent writing in a style and form that is totally accessible to the lay reader. The progressive, case-building structure of the whole book, and even the chapter formats are beautifully constructed, making Cure not only an easy read, but a fast-paced one. Although she readily admits the need for much more basic research to “understand the complexities of the connections between brain and body,” she philosophically accepts that pharmaceutical companies will have no interest in trials that potentially result in non-drug treatments or that might reduce dosages of existing medications.In the book’s conclusion, the scientist in Marchant issues a caution: she is “uneasy” when doctors offer alternative treatments accompanied by “explanatory frameworks with no scientific basis.” But she is also open-minded enough to state that, “…the science described in this book shows that in many situations, we have the capacity to influence our own health by harnessing the power of the (conscious and unconscious) mind.” Marchant sees no reason not to participate in remedies that appear to work, especially when conventional treatments fall short.This is a fabulous, well-written, thought-provoking book on a subject as controversial as it is popular. I highly recommend it—to believers and skeptics alike!"
181,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4282506-becca-chopra,5,"Mind-body medicine has been around for thousands of years, and is now scientifically shown to work.With CURE – A Journey into the Science of Mind over Body, Jo Marchant has written a book that I would recommend to all healers, complementary or allopathic, and to all those in need of healing… which is pretty much everyone.Having experienced every healing modality mentioned in the book, I have my own personal opinions of miracle cures, the placebo effect, the benefits of mindfulness and meditation, and using the mind to enhance our physical healing. But Marchant investigates the evidence, the science, behind the effectiveness of alternative or complementary therapies and the power of our minds to affect our health.Marchant interviewed both practitioners, researchers and patients, such as a gent named Gareth, whose MS was under control through meditation. As Gareth explains:“People think of meditation as a time consumer, but the opposite is true. It is a time provider, because of all the time that we don’t spend following useless trains of thought. I wouldn’t be able to lead the life that I lead now if it weren’t for meditation.”Marchant covers many mind-body therapies that can improve medical outcomes by “treating patients as the complex human beings we are, rather than simply as physical bodies…”Her conclusion after looking into everything from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction to homeopathy, acupuncture, and social factors such as loneliness and poverty, show that “our thoughts, beliefs, stress levels and worldview all influence how ill or well we feel.”She explains that the way our brains are wired not only constructs our experience but our physical reality and vice versa.Nearly 400 years after Descartes’ separation of the mind and body in scientific thought, Marchant uncovers evidence that shows something very different — that our bodies and minds have evolved in exquisite harmony, so perfectly integrated that it is impossible to consider one without the other:“Terms like ‘mind-body’ and ‘holistic’ are often derided as flaky and unscientific, but in fact it’s the idea of a mind distinct from the body, an ephemeral entity that floats somewhere in the skull like a spirit or soul, that makes no scientific sense.”If you’d like to understand how our minds influence and reflect our physiology, CURE is definitely a must-read. Marchant’s research lays out the potential of our mind’s ability to heal the body — and how we can use her findings in our own lives."
182,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"My sister has relied on homeopathic healers through much of her adult life. She ate a healthy vegan diet and regularly attended Tai Chi and Chi Gong classes for exercise. When she began feeling nauseous and fatigued, she stepped up the program and increased the number of alternative remedies she used. So when she was finally diagnosed with Stage 4 B Cell Lymphoma, her condition was serious indeed. Fortunately, chemotherapy destroyed the tumors that crowded most of her body and left her struggling to breath and unable to eat. The experience left me more than a little angry with alternative medicine. Is there any redeeming value in alternative medicine?I’m happy to say that the answer is yes; some alternative therapies are effective in improving quality of life, relieving some symptoms, and even noosing the immune system. The Cure recounts a plethora of well-designed studies that suggest that meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, yoga, and other treatment modes have a salutive effect on health and week being. What’s complicated is working out when and why this is true. For example, people who meditate regularly are less subject to stress reactions. As a result, meditators are more resilient and less likely to suffer the effects of cortisol and adrenaline, including immune diseases and cardiovascular disease. This is a fascinating book and I will go back and reread a few chapters again."
183,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52492316-kachina,5,"This book was very informative yet, Marchant’s tone keeps things real and interesting. This isn’t some book about rejecting conventional medicine to pursue homeopathy. Rather, the author suggests that unconventional practices such as the use of placebos, meditation and even the feeling of simply being cared for, may reduce our stress levels which then improves our well-being. In a world that is so reliant on drugs, it is comforting to know that there are other alternatives. The author makes sure to back up her information with scientific research and data which I found reassuring. It’s no secret that funding for alternative medicine is extremely low because there isn’t a lot of money that can be made with treating people without pills. That is the sad truth that is repeated throughout the book. The funny thing is, (as Marchant states), a lot of the pain-killer and antidepressants that are prescribed to people don’t work any better than the placebos. Ultimately, with the use of real-world examples, it is further proof that the mind and the body truly are remarkable. In Marchant’s own words, she hopes this books helps to “overcome some prejudice against mind-body approaches.” I can go on and on about this book but I’ll leave it at that! Everyone should read it! "

Finally, after having been declared a medical mystery enough times by Western doctors, I tried acupuncture. The problem went away almost immediately and has never returned.

200,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/735052-james,4,"Marchant is a popular science writer with a PhD in genetics and medical microbiology who has written for New Scientist, Nature, the Guardian, and the Smithonian . She is rigorously skeptical of alternative therapies and the miraculous; however she isn't dismissive of the fact that people are sometimes helped by them. Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body is her examination of the mind's power to influence physical health and well being. She reviews various scientific studies, interviews those who have participated in them, and explores what the brain can or cannot do as far as healing our bodies.Marchant observes a well known phenomena in contemporary medical research: the placebo effect. She cites research which shows that in some instances, a placebo works even if the person knows they are getting the placebo, though it impacts symptoms rather than the disease itself (still valuable for quality of life). She also notes the 'nocebo effect' where a person's health declines because of the belief that something is causing them harm (i.e. believing you were poisoned, or had a curse put on you). Placebos can be a powerful counter medicine to these psychosomatic ailments and empathetic patient care does make a real difference in prognosis. So Marchant admits some value in alternative medicines:Therapies such as homeopathy and Reiki contain no active ingredient and show no benefit in rigorous clinical trials. They are based on principles that from a scientific point of view are nonsensical—almost certainly do not work in the way they claim they do. But with long, personal consultations and empathetic care, they are perfectly honed to maximize placebo responses. For that reason they probably do provide real relief, particularly for chronic ailments that conventional medicine is not well equipped to treat (39)Marchant examines the benefits of combining a placebo with Pavlovian conditioning, the benefits of cognitive therapies in fighting Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, hypnosis in treating Irritable Bowl Syndrome, and the benefits virtual reality for Pain management. In the latter part of the book she talks about how stress affects health, the benefits of meditation the importance of relationships and positive outlook for aging well, and how manipulating the vagus nerve through electricity may impact our immunity. Her final chapter examines the role of faith in healing, specifically at Lourdes.Marchant doesn't believe in miracles and treats religious ritual like a powerful placebo. She does volunteer at Lourdes and record her observations of a worship service she participated in:I feel out of place amid all the singing and signing. I've never attended a Catholic Mass, and I usually try my hardest to avoid religious ceremonies. I get uneasy about the idea of substituting reason and clear thinking for robes, incantations and mysterious higher powers. But at the same time it is beautiful; a hugely impressive assault on the senses. (266).Later she writes, ""Lourdes didn't turn me into a believer. But after attending this giant underground service, I'm struck by the physical force that religious belief can have"" (227). She sees the power of religion to effect people's health, for good or ill, in mechanisms like stress and ritual. She prefers a naturalistic interpretation of how healing occurs—a scientific explanation of how healing took place invalidates it as a miracle (which she doesn't believe in anyway).I have participated and benefited from healing prayers, but I am also aware of studies on intercessory prayer that show no significant change, and reveal faith healers' success rates as equal to that of a placebo (about 29%). I don't share Marchant's skepticism of the miraculous. I do, however, appreciate her well-documented look at the science behind the power of the mind to influence physical health. Her bias towards a rigorous look at the evidence is what made me want to read the book. I especially found the studies of the placebo effect in the first part of the book interesting, and this is a fun read. I recommend this for anyone interested in our current understanding of the brain's ability to effect our body. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I give this four stars.Note: I received this book from Random House and Crown Publishers through the Blogging For Books Program in exchange for my honest review."

204,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964233-elizabeth,2,"Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body (Hardcover) by Jo Marchant from the libraryWhat a disappointment! There are some paragraphs which deserve more than two stars and many that deserve less. I am so tired of so called science educated journalists writing about what they know nothing about. This author has a genuine science background. But so do I. I have solid background in the hard sciences, did research at Caltech in molecular biology and have a doctorate in a behavioral science. I also have studied some of the alternative healing arts. I am quite clear that I would be dead if I only took care from MD's. So lets get down to some real issues. What about Osteopathy with its moving cranial bones and its craniosacral rhythm? Most of medicine considers that nonsense. What about the veterinary use of acupuncture on race horses? My father was a horse vet. (grad of Texas A&M) He said if it works on horses, its real. The same for veterinary use of homeopathy? So instead of saying science says blah blah, start from it works and figure out why. It would help if the science educated would learn about the healing arts before they write about them. This book is like having a deaf person faced with critiquing music counting the notes of a symphony to decide its value. Try to remember that it wasn't so long ago that doctors denied the value of washing their hands, or the value of fruits and vegetables in diet. They believed that masturbation led to insanity, that women had less intelligence because their skull volume was smaller than men's and that letting women become educated would result in damaged babies and the resulting destruction of the human species."
205,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46134979-juliet,4,"I found this book fascinating and refreshing. I am already a believer in alternative therapies where appropriate and looking to non-prescription solutions whenever possible. What made this book stand out to me was the author's skepticism of these alternative therapies and the thorough research she conducted to get to the bottom of what was causing the results. It's hard to find books in this topic that aren't heavily biased one way or another, but this one is the exception. A lot of the stories and examples hit close to home for me, and I felt that the author did an excellent job exploring both sides of each argument before drawing conclusions (which were always based on facts and evidence). It’s yet another book that confirms how effective mindfulness and meditation can be in managing stress and depression. I was also intrigued by the placebo effect and how most antidepressants are no more effective than placebos in trials, yet they still get the green light. The author is British, yet her outside perspective of the U.S. healthcare system is spot on.An underlying theme in many of the alternative therapies was a feeling of connection to the world (either through religion, spirituality, or nature), a strong social network, and close relationships with others. Overall it seems the key to health, with or without a diagnosis, is being able to be mindful of the present moment and having a connection to others and the world around us. While this book left me feeling frustrated at the current state of our healthcare system, I did leave off hopeful that there are some steps I can take on my own."
206,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27489272-molecule,5,"Excellent! Eye-opening, mind-expanding and incredibly well written. Jo Marchant gives us perspective and starting point for the future of health care where real human touch and experience, as well as our own powerful resources, will join forces with science to help as live healthier and happier lives. Highly recommend, especially for my fellow scientists."
207,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915736-marya,4,"Cure is a great way to introduce yourself to alternative healing practices from a scientific/skeptical perspective. Marchant never writes off anyone as a quack, but neither does she embrace all practices as equal or even effective. Instead, Marchant recognizes a mind-body connection and how modern medicine tries to avoid that connection like the plague. This does a disservice to everyone as potentially effective treatments are dismissed by medicine, patients dismiss these dismissive doctors, and no one actually addresses the patient's needs.Marchant begins with the placebo effect and highlights research showing what it can --- and can't - do. The nerve cells of individuals suffering from PD actually improve their coordination after a placebo treatment. Yet, the individuals still have PD. Marchant then meanders through other treatments that aim to repeat that effect, from hypnosis to virtual reality. This was my favorite part of the book, though the research becomes less and less conclusive as she continues. That's not necessarily a condemnation of the methods- the research simply isn't there (and sometimes, neither is the funding). I really wish Marchant had expanded on this portion. A whole book on the placebo effect with that writer would be wonderful!Sadly, Marchant strays further and further away from the extensive research to end with something that has no research supporting it at all. It's an interesting journey, but I spent far longer trying to motivate myself to read the second half than the first."
208,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48896082-archi,2,"This book is a placebo. It began with promise: the explanation of the various types of placebo effect, channels of operation, and the selection bias of medical trials that lead to a failure of standard medicine to appreciate the value of ""mind"" induced or enhanced therapies. Very interesting and worth further research. This is up to about chapter 4, ending with altitude sickness.From there, the book turned into an anecdotal, self-focused review of the travels of the author on 'research' of alternative medicine. Both her logic and her science are weak. Her conclusions are based on personal experience more than data, and the data she uses are extremely limited. Most of her conclusions are 'but what if X turns out to be true?' Her kid-gloved critique of obviously un-founded treatments (like the Washington aura healer) do little to add rigor to her process. For example, her review of the placebo effect on an autistic toddler - completely baseless. Was it the parents' change in attitude that cured the child? Was it the autistic child whose mind became convinced that an unrelated treatment was suddenly useful? Sports, childbirth, poverty/politics and religion sections were painful to read. I would think that a fundamental flaw is her inability to define mind and/or body in the context of illness or treatment.Its a shame really, b/c this is a real subject worth deep and rigorous research. This is a feel-good, diet science book that raises the issue, but does little to advance it. "
209,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,3,"This book is a series of fairly entertaining articles about different ways the mind might influence illness, or maybe the perceptions of illness. In some of the chapters, the author reports on the placebo effect, but in others seems to swallow reports of what might be placebo effect without question.While the anecdotes make it easier to understand the diseases Ms. Marchant writes about, it was difficult to believe she understands science if she cites grey hair as proof of stress. The age at which your hair turns grey is recognized as being genetic. If we want to go into anecdotes, I have a 65 year old relative with a huge amount of stress in her life (retirement, moving, divorce, cancer, death) who still has no grey, just like her mother at the same age. I have other friends who turned grey in their 30's and 40's while living a good life. Grey hair should not be cited as proof of a stressful life. On page 39 the author states ""..long personal consultations and empathetic care.....maximize placebo responses."" This pretty much sums up the book. Ms. Marchant tells some interesting stories, but not many of them are about science based research with results that can't be attributed to the placebo effect. "
210,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"I approached this book with long-standing skepticism about alternative medicine, but at the end of it, found that I had consumed a healthy serving of wholesome food for thought. One reason I read the book, despite my skepticism, is that it is written by a heavily-credentialed scientist who, it turns out, also had initial reservations about her subject. Nevertheless, Jo Marchant has written a solidly-researched book which will, at a minimum, leave the reader with the impression that much of what the author says rings true.In twelve chapters, Marchant describes various illnesses and health conditions of people all over the world, and juxtaposes conventional medical treatments with lesser-known treatments that incorporate actions of the human mind. In chapter one, for example, she talks about illnesses ranging from autism and Parkinson’s disease to altitude sickness, and how placebos were used to test the efficacy of drugs intended to target a specific disease. Surprisingly, in many cases, placebo patients described deriving the same beneficial effects as patients receiving a real drug. In even more astonishing cases of “honest placebos,” patients knowingly receiving placebos still underwent health improvements. Clearly, this circumstance was less to do with placebos and drugs than it was to do with how the mind was participating in the intervention.In riveting chapter after chapter, Marchant illustrates the psychological response humans have in the treatment of illnesses. She takes on numerous controversial alternative treatments—acupuncture, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, the Lourdes miracle cures, the power of social interactions, and yes, even religion-based and virtual reality therapies—and suggests the healing power of the mind, either with or without real drugs and medications.What makes this book so readable is Marchant’s wonderful, fluent writing in a style and form that is totally accessible to the lay reader. The progressive, case-building structure of the whole book, and even the chapter formats are beautifully constructed, making Cure not only an easy read, but a fast-paced one. Although she readily admits the need for much more basic research to “understand the complexities of the connections between brain and body,” she philosophically accepts that pharmaceutical companies will have no interest in trials that potentially result in non-drug treatments or that might reduce dosages of existing medications.In the book’s conclusion, the scientist in Marchant issues a caution: she is “uneasy” when doctors offer alternative treatments accompanied by “explanatory frameworks with no scientific basis.” But she is also open-minded enough to state that, “…the science described in this book shows that in many situations, we have the capacity to influence our own health by harnessing the power of the (conscious and unconscious) mind.” Marchant sees no reason not to participate in remedies that appear to work, especially when conventional treatments fall short.This is a fabulous, well-written, thought-provoking book on a subject as controversial as it is popular. I highly recommend it—to believers and skeptics alike!"
211,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4282506-becca-chopra,5,"Mind-body medicine has been around for thousands of years, and is now scientifically shown to work.With CURE – A Journey into the Science of Mind over Body, Jo Marchant has written a book that I would recommend to all healers, complementary or allopathic, and to all those in need of healing… which is pretty much everyone.Having experienced every healing modality mentioned in the book, I have my own personal opinions of miracle cures, the placebo effect, the benefits of mindfulness and meditation, and using the mind to enhance our physical healing. But Marchant investigates the evidence, the science, behind the effectiveness of alternative or complementary therapies and the power of our minds to affect our health.Marchant interviewed both practitioners, researchers and patients, such as a gent named Gareth, whose MS was under control through meditation. As Gareth explains:“People think of meditation as a time consumer, but the opposite is true. It is a time provider, because of all the time that we don’t spend following useless trains of thought. I wouldn’t be able to lead the life that I lead now if it weren’t for meditation.”Marchant covers many mind-body therapies that can improve medical outcomes by “treating patients as the complex human beings we are, rather than simply as physical bodies…”Her conclusion after looking into everything from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction to homeopathy, acupuncture, and social factors such as loneliness and poverty, show that “our thoughts, beliefs, stress levels and worldview all influence how ill or well we feel.”She explains that the way our brains are wired not only constructs our experience but our physical reality and vice versa.Nearly 400 years after Descartes’ separation of the mind and body in scientific thought, Marchant uncovers evidence that shows something very different — that our bodies and minds have evolved in exquisite harmony, so perfectly integrated that it is impossible to consider one without the other:“Terms like ‘mind-body’ and ‘holistic’ are often derided as flaky and unscientific, but in fact it’s the idea of a mind distinct from the body, an ephemeral entity that floats somewhere in the skull like a spirit or soul, that makes no scientific sense.”If you’d like to understand how our minds influence and reflect our physiology, CURE is definitely a must-read. Marchant’s research lays out the potential of our mind’s ability to heal the body — and how we can use her findings in our own lives."
212,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"My sister has relied on homeopathic healers through much of her adult life. She ate a healthy vegan diet and regularly attended Tai Chi and Chi Gong classes for exercise. When she began feeling nauseous and fatigued, she stepped up the program and increased the number of alternative remedies she used. So when she was finally diagnosed with Stage 4 B Cell Lymphoma, her condition was serious indeed. Fortunately, chemotherapy destroyed the tumors that crowded most of her body and left her struggling to breath and unable to eat. The experience left me more than a little angry with alternative medicine. Is there any redeeming value in alternative medicine?I’m happy to say that the answer is yes; some alternative therapies are effective in improving quality of life, relieving some symptoms, and even noosing the immune system. The Cure recounts a plethora of well-designed studies that suggest that meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, yoga, and other treatment modes have a salutive effect on health and week being. What’s complicated is working out when and why this is true. For example, people who meditate regularly are less subject to stress reactions. As a result, meditators are more resilient and less likely to suffer the effects of cortisol and adrenaline, including immune diseases and cardiovascular disease. This is a fascinating book and I will go back and reread a few chapters again."
213,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52492316-kachina,5,"This book was very informative yet, Marchant’s tone keeps things real and interesting. This isn’t some book about rejecting conventional medicine to pursue homeopathy. Rather, the author suggests that unconventional practices such as the use of placebos, meditation and even the feeling of simply being cared for, may reduce our stress levels which then improves our well-being. In a world that is so reliant on drugs, it is comforting to know that there are other alternatives. The author makes sure to back up her information with scientific research and data which I found reassuring. It’s no secret that funding for alternative medicine is extremely low because there isn’t a lot of money that can be made with treating people without pills. That is the sad truth that is repeated throughout the book. The funny thing is, (as Marchant states), a lot of the pain-killer and antidepressants that are prescribed to people don’t work any better than the placebos. Ultimately, with the use of real-world examples, it is further proof that the mind and the body truly are remarkable. In Marchant’s own words, she hopes this books helps to “overcome some prejudice against mind-body approaches.” I can go on and on about this book but I’ll leave it at that! Everyone should read it! "
214,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,4,"A few years back, I was plagued with a mysterious choking problem that came up when I was attempting to eat under stress, or if I hadn't had any food in more than a few hours. The doctor prescribed antacid, which made matters worse. No help there. It seemed to be worse when I was eating meat, so I tried no meat for a while. That helped, but not enough. Finally, after having been declared a medical mystery enough times by Western doctors, I tried acupuncture. The problem went away almost immediately and has never returned. I'm the sort of case that Jo Marchant writes about in this highly interesting and occasionally frustrating book. Interesting, because she investigates and illuminates, with the cool light of science, everything from acupuncture (hardly any discernible effects) to homeopathy (hogwash) to the placebo effect (very real). Frustrating, because she's working so hard to be reasonable that sometimes it seems that she's pulling back from a necessary conclusion in order to appear to be open-minded. Indeed, the only practice she roundly dispenses with is homeopathy. Everything else she manages to find some use for -- precisely because her main thesis is that the mind and body are not separate, but heavily influence one another, so that of course -- of course -- the mind is important in just about every aspect of medicine. Even Lourdes, which Marchant discusses as the importance of community and loving attention to healing, and as a way of criticizing Western medicine for neglecting the heart's need for love as well as the mind's need for authority and the body's need for good medicine. It's a good book. Just a little too reasonable. Which is probably not a very fair thing to say. "

I flew through the first part about medical therapies, and, while the second part about ""the importance of our minds from day to day"" was interesting, it wasn't as interesting as the first part. Regardless, the whole book is a worthwhile read, and I highly recommend it. I appreciate the critical and balanced perspective of the author and that she investigates the science, techniques, and theories with the right amount of openness and skepticism. She approaches research studies the way I do--for instance, she might discuss a promising study, but she makes sure to detail any possible shortcomings of the study (small sample size, results have not been reproduced yet, etc.). I was happy to discover there was a book marrying two topics that interest me greatly--psychology and medicine--and I'm happy that it turned out to be as fascinating and informative as I imagined it would be."

230,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/735052-james,4,"Marchant is a popular science writer with a PhD in genetics and medical microbiology who has written for New Scientist, Nature, the Guardian, and the Smithonian . She is rigorously skeptical of alternative therapies and the miraculous; however she isn't dismissive of the fact that people are sometimes helped by them. Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body is her examination of the mind's power to influence physical health and well being. She reviews various scientific studies, interviews those who have participated in them, and explores what the brain can or cannot do as far as healing our bodies.Marchant observes a well known phenomena in contemporary medical research: the placebo effect. She cites research which shows that in some instances, a placebo works even if the person knows they are getting the placebo, though it impacts symptoms rather than the disease itself (still valuable for quality of life). She also notes the 'nocebo effect' where a person's health declines because of the belief that something is causing them harm (i.e. believing you were poisoned, or had a curse put on you). Placebos can be a powerful counter medicine to these psychosomatic ailments and empathetic patient care does make a real difference in prognosis. So Marchant admits some value in alternative medicines:Therapies such as homeopathy and Reiki contain no active ingredient and show no benefit in rigorous clinical trials. They are based on principles that from a scientific point of view are nonsensical—almost certainly do not work in the way they claim they do. But with long, personal consultations and empathetic care, they are perfectly honed to maximize placebo responses. For that reason they probably do provide real relief, particularly for chronic ailments that conventional medicine is not well equipped to treat (39)Marchant examines the benefits of combining a placebo with Pavlovian conditioning, the benefits of cognitive therapies in fighting Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, hypnosis in treating Irritable Bowl Syndrome, and the benefits virtual reality for Pain management. In the latter part of the book she talks about how stress affects health, the benefits of meditation the importance of relationships and positive outlook for aging well, and how manipulating the vagus nerve through electricity may impact our immunity. Her final chapter examines the role of faith in healing, specifically at Lourdes.Marchant doesn't believe in miracles and treats religious ritual like a powerful placebo. She does volunteer at Lourdes and record her observations of a worship service she participated in:I feel out of place amid all the singing and signing. I've never attended a Catholic Mass, and I usually try my hardest to avoid religious ceremonies. I get uneasy about the idea of substituting reason and clear thinking for robes, incantations and mysterious higher powers. But at the same time it is beautiful; a hugely impressive assault on the senses. (266).Later she writes, ""Lourdes didn't turn me into a believer. But after attending this giant underground service, I'm struck by the physical force that religious belief can have"" (227). She sees the power of religion to effect people's health, for good or ill, in mechanisms like stress and ritual. She prefers a naturalistic interpretation of how healing occurs—a scientific explanation of how healing took place invalidates it as a miracle (which she doesn't believe in anyway).I have participated and benefited from healing prayers, but I am also aware of studies on intercessory prayer that show no significant change, and reveal faith healers' success rates as equal to that of a placebo (about 29%). I don't share Marchant's skepticism of the miraculous. I do, however, appreciate her well-documented look at the science behind the power of the mind to influence physical health. Her bias towards a rigorous look at the evidence is what made me want to read the book. I especially found the studies of the placebo effect in the first part of the book interesting, and this is a fun read. I recommend this for anyone interested in our current understanding of the brain's ability to effect our body. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I give this four stars.Note: I received this book from Random House and Crown Publishers through the Blogging For Books Program in exchange for my honest review."

234,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964233-elizabeth,2,"Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body (Hardcover) by Jo Marchant from the libraryWhat a disappointment! There are some paragraphs which deserve more than two stars and many that deserve less. I am so tired of so called science educated journalists writing about what they know nothing about. This author has a genuine science background. But so do I. I have solid background in the hard sciences, did research at Caltech in molecular biology and have a doctorate in a behavioral science. I also have studied some of the alternative healing arts. I am quite clear that I would be dead if I only took care from MD's. So lets get down to some real issues. What about Osteopathy with its moving cranial bones and its craniosacral rhythm? Most of medicine considers that nonsense. What about the veterinary use of acupuncture on race horses? My father was a horse vet. (grad of Texas A&M) He said if it works on horses, its real. The same for veterinary use of homeopathy? So instead of saying science says blah blah, start from it works and figure out why. It would help if the science educated would learn about the healing arts before they write about them. This book is like having a deaf person faced with critiquing music counting the notes of a symphony to decide its value. Try to remember that it wasn't so long ago that doctors denied the value of washing their hands, or the value of fruits and vegetables in diet. They believed that masturbation led to insanity, that women had less intelligence because their skull volume was smaller than men's and that letting women become educated would result in damaged babies and the resulting destruction of the human species."
235,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46134979-juliet,4,"I found this book fascinating and refreshing. I am already a believer in alternative therapies where appropriate and looking to non-prescription solutions whenever possible. What made this book stand out to me was the author's skepticism of these alternative therapies and the thorough research she conducted to get to the bottom of what was causing the results. It's hard to find books in this topic that aren't heavily biased one way or another, but this one is the exception. A lot of the stories and examples hit close to home for me, and I felt that the author did an excellent job exploring both sides of each argument before drawing conclusions (which were always based on facts and evidence). It’s yet another book that confirms how effective mindfulness and meditation can be in managing stress and depression. I was also intrigued by the placebo effect and how most antidepressants are no more effective than placebos in trials, yet they still get the green light. The author is British, yet her outside perspective of the U.S. healthcare system is spot on.An underlying theme in many of the alternative therapies was a feeling of connection to the world (either through religion, spirituality, or nature), a strong social network, and close relationships with others. Overall it seems the key to health, with or without a diagnosis, is being able to be mindful of the present moment and having a connection to others and the world around us. While this book left me feeling frustrated at the current state of our healthcare system, I did leave off hopeful that there are some steps I can take on my own."
236,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27489272-molecule,5,"Excellent! Eye-opening, mind-expanding and incredibly well written. Jo Marchant gives us perspective and starting point for the future of health care where real human touch and experience, as well as our own powerful resources, will join forces with science to help as live healthier and happier lives. Highly recommend, especially for my fellow scientists."
237,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915736-marya,4,"Cure is a great way to introduce yourself to alternative healing practices from a scientific/skeptical perspective. Marchant never writes off anyone as a quack, but neither does she embrace all practices as equal or even effective. Instead, Marchant recognizes a mind-body connection and how modern medicine tries to avoid that connection like the plague. This does a disservice to everyone as potentially effective treatments are dismissed by medicine, patients dismiss these dismissive doctors, and no one actually addresses the patient's needs.Marchant begins with the placebo effect and highlights research showing what it can --- and can't - do. The nerve cells of individuals suffering from PD actually improve their coordination after a placebo treatment. Yet, the individuals still have PD. Marchant then meanders through other treatments that aim to repeat that effect, from hypnosis to virtual reality. This was my favorite part of the book, though the research becomes less and less conclusive as she continues. That's not necessarily a condemnation of the methods- the research simply isn't there (and sometimes, neither is the funding). I really wish Marchant had expanded on this portion. A whole book on the placebo effect with that writer would be wonderful!Sadly, Marchant strays further and further away from the extensive research to end with something that has no research supporting it at all. It's an interesting journey, but I spent far longer trying to motivate myself to read the second half than the first."
238,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48896082-archi,2,"This book is a placebo. It began with promise: the explanation of the various types of placebo effect, channels of operation, and the selection bias of medical trials that lead to a failure of standard medicine to appreciate the value of ""mind"" induced or enhanced therapies. Very interesting and worth further research. This is up to about chapter 4, ending with altitude sickness.From there, the book turned into an anecdotal, self-focused review of the travels of the author on 'research' of alternative medicine. Both her logic and her science are weak. Her conclusions are based on personal experience more than data, and the data she uses are extremely limited. Most of her conclusions are 'but what if X turns out to be true?' Her kid-gloved critique of obviously un-founded treatments (like the Washington aura healer) do little to add rigor to her process. For example, her review of the placebo effect on an autistic toddler - completely baseless. Was it the parents' change in attitude that cured the child? Was it the autistic child whose mind became convinced that an unrelated treatment was suddenly useful? Sports, childbirth, poverty/politics and religion sections were painful to read. I would think that a fundamental flaw is her inability to define mind and/or body in the context of illness or treatment.Its a shame really, b/c this is a real subject worth deep and rigorous research. This is a feel-good, diet science book that raises the issue, but does little to advance it. "
239,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,3,"This book is a series of fairly entertaining articles about different ways the mind might influence illness, or maybe the perceptions of illness. In some of the chapters, the author reports on the placebo effect, but in others seems to swallow reports of what might be placebo effect without question.While the anecdotes make it easier to understand the diseases Ms. Marchant writes about, it was difficult to believe she understands science if she cites grey hair as proof of stress. The age at which your hair turns grey is recognized as being genetic. If we want to go into anecdotes, I have a 65 year old relative with a huge amount of stress in her life (retirement, moving, divorce, cancer, death) who still has no grey, just like her mother at the same age. I have other friends who turned grey in their 30's and 40's while living a good life. Grey hair should not be cited as proof of a stressful life. On page 39 the author states ""..long personal consultations and empathetic care.....maximize placebo responses."" This pretty much sums up the book. Ms. Marchant tells some interesting stories, but not many of them are about science based research with results that can't be attributed to the placebo effect. "
240,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"I approached this book with long-standing skepticism about alternative medicine, but at the end of it, found that I had consumed a healthy serving of wholesome food for thought. One reason I read the book, despite my skepticism, is that it is written by a heavily-credentialed scientist who, it turns out, also had initial reservations about her subject. Nevertheless, Jo Marchant has written a solidly-researched book which will, at a minimum, leave the reader with the impression that much of what the author says rings true.In twelve chapters, Marchant describes various illnesses and health conditions of people all over the world, and juxtaposes conventional medical treatments with lesser-known treatments that incorporate actions of the human mind. In chapter one, for example, she talks about illnesses ranging from autism and Parkinson’s disease to altitude sickness, and how placebos were used to test the efficacy of drugs intended to target a specific disease. Surprisingly, in many cases, placebo patients described deriving the same beneficial effects as patients receiving a real drug. In even more astonishing cases of “honest placebos,” patients knowingly receiving placebos still underwent health improvements. Clearly, this circumstance was less to do with placebos and drugs than it was to do with how the mind was participating in the intervention.In riveting chapter after chapter, Marchant illustrates the psychological response humans have in the treatment of illnesses. She takes on numerous controversial alternative treatments—acupuncture, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, the Lourdes miracle cures, the power of social interactions, and yes, even religion-based and virtual reality therapies—and suggests the healing power of the mind, either with or without real drugs and medications.What makes this book so readable is Marchant’s wonderful, fluent writing in a style and form that is totally accessible to the lay reader. The progressive, case-building structure of the whole book, and even the chapter formats are beautifully constructed, making Cure not only an easy read, but a fast-paced one. Although she readily admits the need for much more basic research to “understand the complexities of the connections between brain and body,” she philosophically accepts that pharmaceutical companies will have no interest in trials that potentially result in non-drug treatments or that might reduce dosages of existing medications.In the book’s conclusion, the scientist in Marchant issues a caution: she is “uneasy” when doctors offer alternative treatments accompanied by “explanatory frameworks with no scientific basis.” But she is also open-minded enough to state that, “…the science described in this book shows that in many situations, we have the capacity to influence our own health by harnessing the power of the (conscious and unconscious) mind.” Marchant sees no reason not to participate in remedies that appear to work, especially when conventional treatments fall short.This is a fabulous, well-written, thought-provoking book on a subject as controversial as it is popular. I highly recommend it—to believers and skeptics alike!"
241,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4282506-becca-chopra,5,"Mind-body medicine has been around for thousands of years, and is now scientifically shown to work.With CURE – A Journey into the Science of Mind over Body, Jo Marchant has written a book that I would recommend to all healers, complementary or allopathic, and to all those in need of healing… which is pretty much everyone.Having experienced every healing modality mentioned in the book, I have my own personal opinions of miracle cures, the placebo effect, the benefits of mindfulness and meditation, and using the mind to enhance our physical healing. But Marchant investigates the evidence, the science, behind the effectiveness of alternative or complementary therapies and the power of our minds to affect our health.Marchant interviewed both practitioners, researchers and patients, such as a gent named Gareth, whose MS was under control through meditation. As Gareth explains:“People think of meditation as a time consumer, but the opposite is true. It is a time provider, because of all the time that we don’t spend following useless trains of thought. I wouldn’t be able to lead the life that I lead now if it weren’t for meditation.”Marchant covers many mind-body therapies that can improve medical outcomes by “treating patients as the complex human beings we are, rather than simply as physical bodies…”Her conclusion after looking into everything from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction to homeopathy, acupuncture, and social factors such as loneliness and poverty, show that “our thoughts, beliefs, stress levels and worldview all influence how ill or well we feel.”She explains that the way our brains are wired not only constructs our experience but our physical reality and vice versa.Nearly 400 years after Descartes’ separation of the mind and body in scientific thought, Marchant uncovers evidence that shows something very different — that our bodies and minds have evolved in exquisite harmony, so perfectly integrated that it is impossible to consider one without the other:“Terms like ‘mind-body’ and ‘holistic’ are often derided as flaky and unscientific, but in fact it’s the idea of a mind distinct from the body, an ephemeral entity that floats somewhere in the skull like a spirit or soul, that makes no scientific sense.”If you’d like to understand how our minds influence and reflect our physiology, CURE is definitely a must-read. Marchant’s research lays out the potential of our mind’s ability to heal the body — and how we can use her findings in our own lives."
242,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"My sister has relied on homeopathic healers through much of her adult life. She ate a healthy vegan diet and regularly attended Tai Chi and Chi Gong classes for exercise. When she began feeling nauseous and fatigued, she stepped up the program and increased the number of alternative remedies she used. So when she was finally diagnosed with Stage 4 B Cell Lymphoma, her condition was serious indeed. Fortunately, chemotherapy destroyed the tumors that crowded most of her body and left her struggling to breath and unable to eat. The experience left me more than a little angry with alternative medicine. Is there any redeeming value in alternative medicine?I’m happy to say that the answer is yes; some alternative therapies are effective in improving quality of life, relieving some symptoms, and even noosing the immune system. The Cure recounts a plethora of well-designed studies that suggest that meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, yoga, and other treatment modes have a salutive effect on health and week being. What’s complicated is working out when and why this is true. For example, people who meditate regularly are less subject to stress reactions. As a result, meditators are more resilient and less likely to suffer the effects of cortisol and adrenaline, including immune diseases and cardiovascular disease. This is a fascinating book and I will go back and reread a few chapters again."
243,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52492316-kachina,5,"This book was very informative yet, Marchant’s tone keeps things real and interesting. This isn’t some book about rejecting conventional medicine to pursue homeopathy. Rather, the author suggests that unconventional practices such as the use of placebos, meditation and even the feeling of simply being cared for, may reduce our stress levels which then improves our well-being. In a world that is so reliant on drugs, it is comforting to know that there are other alternatives. The author makes sure to back up her information with scientific research and data which I found reassuring. It’s no secret that funding for alternative medicine is extremely low because there isn’t a lot of money that can be made with treating people without pills. That is the sad truth that is repeated throughout the book. The funny thing is, (as Marchant states), a lot of the pain-killer and antidepressants that are prescribed to people don’t work any better than the placebos. Ultimately, with the use of real-world examples, it is further proof that the mind and the body truly are remarkable. In Marchant’s own words, she hopes this books helps to “overcome some prejudice against mind-body approaches.” I can go on and on about this book but I’ll leave it at that! Everyone should read it! "
244,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,4,"A few years back, I was plagued with a mysterious choking problem that came up when I was attempting to eat under stress, or if I hadn't had any food in more than a few hours. The doctor prescribed antacid, which made matters worse. No help there. It seemed to be worse when I was eating meat, so I tried no meat for a while. That helped, but not enough. Finally, after having been declared a medical mystery enough times by Western doctors, I tried acupuncture. The problem went away almost immediately and has never returned. I'm the sort of case that Jo Marchant writes about in this highly interesting and occasionally frustrating book. Interesting, because she investigates and illuminates, with the cool light of science, everything from acupuncture (hardly any discernible effects) to homeopathy (hogwash) to the placebo effect (very real). Frustrating, because she's working so hard to be reasonable that sometimes it seems that she's pulling back from a necessary conclusion in order to appear to be open-minded. Indeed, the only practice she roundly dispenses with is homeopathy. Everything else she manages to find some use for -- precisely because her main thesis is that the mind and body are not separate, but heavily influence one another, so that of course -- of course -- the mind is important in just about every aspect of medicine. Even Lourdes, which Marchant discusses as the importance of community and loving attention to healing, and as a way of criticizing Western medicine for neglecting the heart's need for love as well as the mind's need for authority and the body's need for good medicine. It's a good book. Just a little too reasonable. Which is probably not a very fair thing to say. "

I flew through the first part about medical therapies, and, while the second part about ""the importance of our minds from day to day"" was interesting, it wasn't as interesting as the first part. Regardless, the whole book is a worthwhile read, and I highly recommend it. I appreciate the critical and balanced perspective of the author and that she investigates the science, techniques, and theories with the right amount of openness and skepticism. She approaches research studies the way I do--for instance, she might discuss a promising study, but she makes sure to detail any possible shortcomings of the study (small sample size, results have not been reproduced yet, etc.). I was happy to discover there was a book marrying two topics that interest me greatly--psychology and medicine--and I'm happy that it turned out to be as fascinating and informative as I imagined it would be."

This particular form of ""treatment"" has largely been found to be detrimental to CFS patients. I also think the book, while nearly perfect in most other ways, could benefit from a bit of editing to sharpen it up a bit.This year I am trying to scale back my ratings to be more discriminating, but still, this is a solid ""4"" for me!! I agree with the author's assessment that progress for the individual will likely come not from the medical/pharmaceutical fields but from technology, particularly the development/marketing of consumer biofeedback programs.

All of the references are detailed for those interested in the science, but everything is explained thoroughly enough to be easily understood by anyone. Jo Marchant strikes a good balance between personal anecdotes, interviews with scientists, and interviews with patients on all of the topics covered. The more personal touches make it much more engaging than standard scientific literature. I did feel like it often jumped around between anecdotes, which was jarring until their relevance became clear - although this may have been necessary given the breadth of subjects covered.I'm glad that books about the arbtitrariness of separating the mind and body are becoming more common.

260,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/735052-james,4,"Marchant is a popular science writer with a PhD in genetics and medical microbiology who has written for New Scientist, Nature, the Guardian, and the Smithonian . She is rigorously skeptical of alternative therapies and the miraculous; however she isn't dismissive of the fact that people are sometimes helped by them. Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body is her examination of the mind's power to influence physical health and well being. She reviews various scientific studies, interviews those who have participated in them, and explores what the brain can or cannot do as far as healing our bodies.Marchant observes a well known phenomena in contemporary medical research: the placebo effect. She cites research which shows that in some instances, a placebo works even if the person knows they are getting the placebo, though it impacts symptoms rather than the disease itself (still valuable for quality of life). She also notes the 'nocebo effect' where a person's health declines because of the belief that something is causing them harm (i.e. believing you were poisoned, or had a curse put on you). Placebos can be a powerful counter medicine to these psychosomatic ailments and empathetic patient care does make a real difference in prognosis. So Marchant admits some value in alternative medicines:Therapies such as homeopathy and Reiki contain no active ingredient and show no benefit in rigorous clinical trials. They are based on principles that from a scientific point of view are nonsensical—almost certainly do not work in the way they claim they do. But with long, personal consultations and empathetic care, they are perfectly honed to maximize placebo responses. For that reason they probably do provide real relief, particularly for chronic ailments that conventional medicine is not well equipped to treat (39)Marchant examines the benefits of combining a placebo with Pavlovian conditioning, the benefits of cognitive therapies in fighting Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, hypnosis in treating Irritable Bowl Syndrome, and the benefits virtual reality for Pain management. In the latter part of the book she talks about how stress affects health, the benefits of meditation the importance of relationships and positive outlook for aging well, and how manipulating the vagus nerve through electricity may impact our immunity. Her final chapter examines the role of faith in healing, specifically at Lourdes.Marchant doesn't believe in miracles and treats religious ritual like a powerful placebo. She does volunteer at Lourdes and record her observations of a worship service she participated in:I feel out of place amid all the singing and signing. I've never attended a Catholic Mass, and I usually try my hardest to avoid religious ceremonies. I get uneasy about the idea of substituting reason and clear thinking for robes, incantations and mysterious higher powers. But at the same time it is beautiful; a hugely impressive assault on the senses. (266).Later she writes, ""Lourdes didn't turn me into a believer. But after attending this giant underground service, I'm struck by the physical force that religious belief can have"" (227). She sees the power of religion to effect people's health, for good or ill, in mechanisms like stress and ritual. She prefers a naturalistic interpretation of how healing occurs—a scientific explanation of how healing took place invalidates it as a miracle (which she doesn't believe in anyway).I have participated and benefited from healing prayers, but I am also aware of studies on intercessory prayer that show no significant change, and reveal faith healers' success rates as equal to that of a placebo (about 29%). I don't share Marchant's skepticism of the miraculous. I do, however, appreciate her well-documented look at the science behind the power of the mind to influence physical health. Her bias towards a rigorous look at the evidence is what made me want to read the book. I especially found the studies of the placebo effect in the first part of the book interesting, and this is a fun read. I recommend this for anyone interested in our current understanding of the brain's ability to effect our body. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I give this four stars.Note: I received this book from Random House and Crown Publishers through the Blogging For Books Program in exchange for my honest review."

264,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964233-elizabeth,2,"Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body (Hardcover) by Jo Marchant from the libraryWhat a disappointment! There are some paragraphs which deserve more than two stars and many that deserve less. I am so tired of so called science educated journalists writing about what they know nothing about. This author has a genuine science background. But so do I. I have solid background in the hard sciences, did research at Caltech in molecular biology and have a doctorate in a behavioral science. I also have studied some of the alternative healing arts. I am quite clear that I would be dead if I only took care from MD's. So lets get down to some real issues. What about Osteopathy with its moving cranial bones and its craniosacral rhythm? Most of medicine considers that nonsense. What about the veterinary use of acupuncture on race horses? My father was a horse vet. (grad of Texas A&M) He said if it works on horses, its real. The same for veterinary use of homeopathy? So instead of saying science says blah blah, start from it works and figure out why. It would help if the science educated would learn about the healing arts before they write about them. This book is like having a deaf person faced with critiquing music counting the notes of a symphony to decide its value. Try to remember that it wasn't so long ago that doctors denied the value of washing their hands, or the value of fruits and vegetables in diet. They believed that masturbation led to insanity, that women had less intelligence because their skull volume was smaller than men's and that letting women become educated would result in damaged babies and the resulting destruction of the human species."
265,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46134979-juliet,4,"I found this book fascinating and refreshing. I am already a believer in alternative therapies where appropriate and looking to non-prescription solutions whenever possible. What made this book stand out to me was the author's skepticism of these alternative therapies and the thorough research she conducted to get to the bottom of what was causing the results. It's hard to find books in this topic that aren't heavily biased one way or another, but this one is the exception. A lot of the stories and examples hit close to home for me, and I felt that the author did an excellent job exploring both sides of each argument before drawing conclusions (which were always based on facts and evidence). It’s yet another book that confirms how effective mindfulness and meditation can be in managing stress and depression. I was also intrigued by the placebo effect and how most antidepressants are no more effective than placebos in trials, yet they still get the green light. The author is British, yet her outside perspective of the U.S. healthcare system is spot on.An underlying theme in many of the alternative therapies was a feeling of connection to the world (either through religion, spirituality, or nature), a strong social network, and close relationships with others. Overall it seems the key to health, with or without a diagnosis, is being able to be mindful of the present moment and having a connection to others and the world around us. While this book left me feeling frustrated at the current state of our healthcare system, I did leave off hopeful that there are some steps I can take on my own."
266,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27489272-molecule,5,"Excellent! Eye-opening, mind-expanding and incredibly well written. Jo Marchant gives us perspective and starting point for the future of health care where real human touch and experience, as well as our own powerful resources, will join forces with science to help as live healthier and happier lives. Highly recommend, especially for my fellow scientists."
267,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915736-marya,4,"Cure is a great way to introduce yourself to alternative healing practices from a scientific/skeptical perspective. Marchant never writes off anyone as a quack, but neither does she embrace all practices as equal or even effective. Instead, Marchant recognizes a mind-body connection and how modern medicine tries to avoid that connection like the plague. This does a disservice to everyone as potentially effective treatments are dismissed by medicine, patients dismiss these dismissive doctors, and no one actually addresses the patient's needs.Marchant begins with the placebo effect and highlights research showing what it can --- and can't - do. The nerve cells of individuals suffering from PD actually improve their coordination after a placebo treatment. Yet, the individuals still have PD. Marchant then meanders through other treatments that aim to repeat that effect, from hypnosis to virtual reality. This was my favorite part of the book, though the research becomes less and less conclusive as she continues. That's not necessarily a condemnation of the methods- the research simply isn't there (and sometimes, neither is the funding). I really wish Marchant had expanded on this portion. A whole book on the placebo effect with that writer would be wonderful!Sadly, Marchant strays further and further away from the extensive research to end with something that has no research supporting it at all. It's an interesting journey, but I spent far longer trying to motivate myself to read the second half than the first."
268,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48896082-archi,2,"This book is a placebo. It began with promise: the explanation of the various types of placebo effect, channels of operation, and the selection bias of medical trials that lead to a failure of standard medicine to appreciate the value of ""mind"" induced or enhanced therapies. Very interesting and worth further research. This is up to about chapter 4, ending with altitude sickness.From there, the book turned into an anecdotal, self-focused review of the travels of the author on 'research' of alternative medicine. Both her logic and her science are weak. Her conclusions are based on personal experience more than data, and the data she uses are extremely limited. Most of her conclusions are 'but what if X turns out to be true?' Her kid-gloved critique of obviously un-founded treatments (like the Washington aura healer) do little to add rigor to her process. For example, her review of the placebo effect on an autistic toddler - completely baseless. Was it the parents' change in attitude that cured the child? Was it the autistic child whose mind became convinced that an unrelated treatment was suddenly useful? Sports, childbirth, poverty/politics and religion sections were painful to read. I would think that a fundamental flaw is her inability to define mind and/or body in the context of illness or treatment.Its a shame really, b/c this is a real subject worth deep and rigorous research. This is a feel-good, diet science book that raises the issue, but does little to advance it. "
269,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,3,"This book is a series of fairly entertaining articles about different ways the mind might influence illness, or maybe the perceptions of illness. In some of the chapters, the author reports on the placebo effect, but in others seems to swallow reports of what might be placebo effect without question.While the anecdotes make it easier to understand the diseases Ms. Marchant writes about, it was difficult to believe she understands science if she cites grey hair as proof of stress. The age at which your hair turns grey is recognized as being genetic. If we want to go into anecdotes, I have a 65 year old relative with a huge amount of stress in her life (retirement, moving, divorce, cancer, death) who still has no grey, just like her mother at the same age. I have other friends who turned grey in their 30's and 40's while living a good life. Grey hair should not be cited as proof of a stressful life. On page 39 the author states ""..long personal consultations and empathetic care.....maximize placebo responses."" This pretty much sums up the book. Ms. Marchant tells some interesting stories, but not many of them are about science based research with results that can't be attributed to the placebo effect. "
270,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56104661-mark,4,"I approached this book with long-standing skepticism about alternative medicine, but at the end of it, found that I had consumed a healthy serving of wholesome food for thought. One reason I read the book, despite my skepticism, is that it is written by a heavily-credentialed scientist who, it turns out, also had initial reservations about her subject. Nevertheless, Jo Marchant has written a solidly-researched book which will, at a minimum, leave the reader with the impression that much of what the author says rings true.In twelve chapters, Marchant describes various illnesses and health conditions of people all over the world, and juxtaposes conventional medical treatments with lesser-known treatments that incorporate actions of the human mind. In chapter one, for example, she talks about illnesses ranging from autism and Parkinson’s disease to altitude sickness, and how placebos were used to test the efficacy of drugs intended to target a specific disease. Surprisingly, in many cases, placebo patients described deriving the same beneficial effects as patients receiving a real drug. In even more astonishing cases of “honest placebos,” patients knowingly receiving placebos still underwent health improvements. Clearly, this circumstance was less to do with placebos and drugs than it was to do with how the mind was participating in the intervention.In riveting chapter after chapter, Marchant illustrates the psychological response humans have in the treatment of illnesses. She takes on numerous controversial alternative treatments—acupuncture, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, the Lourdes miracle cures, the power of social interactions, and yes, even religion-based and virtual reality therapies—and suggests the healing power of the mind, either with or without real drugs and medications.What makes this book so readable is Marchant’s wonderful, fluent writing in a style and form that is totally accessible to the lay reader. The progressive, case-building structure of the whole book, and even the chapter formats are beautifully constructed, making Cure not only an easy read, but a fast-paced one. Although she readily admits the need for much more basic research to “understand the complexities of the connections between brain and body,” she philosophically accepts that pharmaceutical companies will have no interest in trials that potentially result in non-drug treatments or that might reduce dosages of existing medications.In the book’s conclusion, the scientist in Marchant issues a caution: she is “uneasy” when doctors offer alternative treatments accompanied by “explanatory frameworks with no scientific basis.” But she is also open-minded enough to state that, “…the science described in this book shows that in many situations, we have the capacity to influence our own health by harnessing the power of the (conscious and unconscious) mind.” Marchant sees no reason not to participate in remedies that appear to work, especially when conventional treatments fall short.This is a fabulous, well-written, thought-provoking book on a subject as controversial as it is popular. I highly recommend it—to believers and skeptics alike!"
271,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4282506-becca-chopra,5,"Mind-body medicine has been around for thousands of years, and is now scientifically shown to work.With CURE – A Journey into the Science of Mind over Body, Jo Marchant has written a book that I would recommend to all healers, complementary or allopathic, and to all those in need of healing… which is pretty much everyone.Having experienced every healing modality mentioned in the book, I have my own personal opinions of miracle cures, the placebo effect, the benefits of mindfulness and meditation, and using the mind to enhance our physical healing. But Marchant investigates the evidence, the science, behind the effectiveness of alternative or complementary therapies and the power of our minds to affect our health.Marchant interviewed both practitioners, researchers and patients, such as a gent named Gareth, whose MS was under control through meditation. As Gareth explains:“People think of meditation as a time consumer, but the opposite is true. It is a time provider, because of all the time that we don’t spend following useless trains of thought. I wouldn’t be able to lead the life that I lead now if it weren’t for meditation.”Marchant covers many mind-body therapies that can improve medical outcomes by “treating patients as the complex human beings we are, rather than simply as physical bodies…”Her conclusion after looking into everything from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction to homeopathy, acupuncture, and social factors such as loneliness and poverty, show that “our thoughts, beliefs, stress levels and worldview all influence how ill or well we feel.”She explains that the way our brains are wired not only constructs our experience but our physical reality and vice versa.Nearly 400 years after Descartes’ separation of the mind and body in scientific thought, Marchant uncovers evidence that shows something very different — that our bodies and minds have evolved in exquisite harmony, so perfectly integrated that it is impossible to consider one without the other:“Terms like ‘mind-body’ and ‘holistic’ are often derided as flaky and unscientific, but in fact it’s the idea of a mind distinct from the body, an ephemeral entity that floats somewhere in the skull like a spirit or soul, that makes no scientific sense.”If you’d like to understand how our minds influence and reflect our physiology, CURE is definitely a must-read. Marchant’s research lays out the potential of our mind’s ability to heal the body — and how we can use her findings in our own lives."
272,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"My sister has relied on homeopathic healers through much of her adult life. She ate a healthy vegan diet and regularly attended Tai Chi and Chi Gong classes for exercise. When she began feeling nauseous and fatigued, she stepped up the program and increased the number of alternative remedies she used. So when she was finally diagnosed with Stage 4 B Cell Lymphoma, her condition was serious indeed. Fortunately, chemotherapy destroyed the tumors that crowded most of her body and left her struggling to breath and unable to eat. The experience left me more than a little angry with alternative medicine. Is there any redeeming value in alternative medicine?I’m happy to say that the answer is yes; some alternative therapies are effective in improving quality of life, relieving some symptoms, and even noosing the immune system. The Cure recounts a plethora of well-designed studies that suggest that meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, yoga, and other treatment modes have a salutive effect on health and week being. What’s complicated is working out when and why this is true. For example, people who meditate regularly are less subject to stress reactions. As a result, meditators are more resilient and less likely to suffer the effects of cortisol and adrenaline, including immune diseases and cardiovascular disease. This is a fascinating book and I will go back and reread a few chapters again."
273,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52492316-kachina,5,"This book was very informative yet, Marchant’s tone keeps things real and interesting. This isn’t some book about rejecting conventional medicine to pursue homeopathy. Rather, the author suggests that unconventional practices such as the use of placebos, meditation and even the feeling of simply being cared for, may reduce our stress levels which then improves our well-being. In a world that is so reliant on drugs, it is comforting to know that there are other alternatives. The author makes sure to back up her information with scientific research and data which I found reassuring. It’s no secret that funding for alternative medicine is extremely low because there isn’t a lot of money that can be made with treating people without pills. That is the sad truth that is repeated throughout the book. The funny thing is, (as Marchant states), a lot of the pain-killer and antidepressants that are prescribed to people don’t work any better than the placebos. Ultimately, with the use of real-world examples, it is further proof that the mind and the body truly are remarkable. In Marchant’s own words, she hopes this books helps to “overcome some prejudice against mind-body approaches.” I can go on and on about this book but I’ll leave it at that! Everyone should read it! "
274,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,4,"A few years back, I was plagued with a mysterious choking problem that came up when I was attempting to eat under stress, or if I hadn't had any food in more than a few hours. The doctor prescribed antacid, which made matters worse. No help there. It seemed to be worse when I was eating meat, so I tried no meat for a while. That helped, but not enough. Finally, after having been declared a medical mystery enough times by Western doctors, I tried acupuncture. The problem went away almost immediately and has never returned. I'm the sort of case that Jo Marchant writes about in this highly interesting and occasionally frustrating book. Interesting, because she investigates and illuminates, with the cool light of science, everything from acupuncture (hardly any discernible effects) to homeopathy (hogwash) to the placebo effect (very real). Frustrating, because she's working so hard to be reasonable that sometimes it seems that she's pulling back from a necessary conclusion in order to appear to be open-minded. Indeed, the only practice she roundly dispenses with is homeopathy. Everything else she manages to find some use for -- precisely because her main thesis is that the mind and body are not separate, but heavily influence one another, so that of course -- of course -- the mind is important in just about every aspect of medicine. Even Lourdes, which Marchant discusses as the importance of community and loving attention to healing, and as a way of criticizing Western medicine for neglecting the heart's need for love as well as the mind's need for authority and the body's need for good medicine. It's a good book. Just a little too reasonable. Which is probably not a very fair thing to say. "

I flew through the first part about medical therapies, and, while the second part about ""the importance of our minds from day to day"" was interesting, it wasn't as interesting as the first part. Regardless, the whole book is a worthwhile read, and I highly recommend it. I appreciate the critical and balanced perspective of the author and that she investigates the science, techniques, and theories with the right amount of openness and skepticism. She approaches research studies the way I do--for instance, she might discuss a promising study, but she makes sure to detail any possible shortcomings of the study (small sample size, results have not been reproduced yet, etc.). I was happy to discover there was a book marrying two topics that interest me greatly--psychology and medicine--and I'm happy that it turned out to be as fascinating and informative as I imagined it would be."

I only have two minor complaints: the first is that the information on graded exercise therapy (GET) for chronic fatigue syndrome is outdated. This particular form of ""treatment"" has largely been found to be detrimental to CFS patients. I also think the book, while nearly perfect in most other ways, could benefit from a bit of editing to sharpen it up a bit.This year I am trying to scale back my ratings to be more discriminating, but still, this is a solid ""4"" for me!! I agree with the author's assessment that progress for the individual will likely come not from the medical/pharmaceutical fields but from technology, particularly the development/marketing of consumer biofeedback programs.

All of the references are detailed for those interested in the science, but everything is explained thoroughly enough to be easily understood by anyone. Jo Marchant strikes a good balance between personal anecdotes, interviews with scientists, and interviews with patients on all of the topics covered. The more personal touches make it much more engaging than standard scientific literature. I did feel like it often jumped around between anecdotes, which was jarring until their relevance became clear - although this may have been necessary given the breadth of subjects covered.I'm glad that books about the arbtitrariness of separating the mind and body are becoming more common.

She reviews various scientific studies, interviews those who have participated in them, and explores what the brain can or cannot do as far as healing our bodies.Marchant observes a well known phenomena in contemporary medical research: the placebo effect. She cites research which shows that in some instances, a placebo works even if the person knows they are getting the placebo, though it impacts symptoms rather than the disease itself (still valuable for quality of life). She also notes the 'nocebo effect' where a person's health declines because of the belief that something is causing them harm (i.e. believing you were poisoned, or had a curse put on you). Placebos can be a powerful counter medicine to these psychosomatic ailments and empathetic patient care does make a real difference in prognosis. So Marchant admits some value in alternative medicines:Therapies such as homeopathy and Reiki contain no active ingredient and show no benefit in rigorous clinical trials. They are based on principles that from a scientific point of view are nonsensical—almost certainly do not work in the way they claim they do. But with long, personal consultations and empathetic care, they are perfectly honed to maximize placebo responses. For that reason they probably do provide real relief, particularly for chronic ailments that conventional medicine is not well equipped to treat (39)Marchant examines the benefits of combining a placebo with Pavlovian conditioning, the benefits of cognitive therapies in fighting Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, hypnosis in treating Irritable Bowl Syndrome, and the benefits virtual reality for Pain management. In the latter part of the book she talks about how stress affects health, the benefits of meditation the importance of relationships and positive outlook for aging well, and how manipulating the vagus nerve through electricity may impact our immunity. Her final chapter examines the role of faith in healing, specifically at Lourdes.Marchant doesn't believe in miracles and treats religious ritual like a powerful placebo. She does volunteer at Lourdes and record her observations of a worship service she participated in:I feel out of place amid all the singing and signing. I've never attended a Catholic Mass, and I usually try my hardest to avoid religious ceremonies. I get uneasy about the idea of substituting reason and clear thinking for robes, incantations and mysterious higher powers. But at the same time it is beautiful; a hugely impressive assault on the senses. (266).Later she writes, ""Lourdes didn't turn me into a believer. But after attending this giant underground service, I'm struck by the physical force that religious belief can have"" (227). She sees the power of religion to effect people's health, for good or ill, in mechanisms like stress and ritual. She prefers a naturalistic interpretation of how healing occurs—a scientific explanation of how healing took place invalidates it as a miracle (which she doesn't believe in anyway).I have participated and benefited from healing prayers, but I am also aware of studies on intercessory prayer that show no significant change, and reveal faith healers' success rates as equal to that of a placebo (about 29%). I don't share Marchant's skepticism of the miraculous. I do, however, appreciate her well-documented look at the science behind the power of the mind to influence physical health. Her bias towards a rigorous look at the evidence is what made me want to read the book. I especially found the studies of the placebo effect in the first part of the book interesting, and this is a fun read. I recommend this for anyone interested in our current understanding of the brain's ability to effect our body. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. I give this four stars.Note: I received this book from Random House and Crown Publishers through the Blogging For Books Program in exchange for my honest review."

I buy her premise - it makes sense to me from observation and experience. She cites lots of studies, but not too many and not in a tedious way. Enlightening and thought-provoking. I have started saying, “these vitamins are really helping my bones” when I take my calcium. "
292,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1172580-cynthia,4,"3.5 stars rounded up. For me, this book was uneven. Some of the topics were inherently more interesting to me than others. "

294,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964233-elizabeth,2,"Cure: A Journey into the Science of Mind Over Body (Hardcover) by Jo Marchant from the libraryWhat a disappointment! There are some paragraphs which deserve more than two stars and many that deserve less. I am so tired of so called science educated journalists writing about what they know nothing about. This author has a genuine science background. But so do I. I have solid background in the hard sciences, did research at Caltech in molecular biology and have a doctorate in a behavioral science. I also have studied some of the alternative healing arts. I am quite clear that I would be dead if I only took care from MD's. So lets get down to some real issues. What about Osteopathy with its moving cranial bones and its craniosacral rhythm? Most of medicine considers that nonsense. What about the veterinary use of acupuncture on race horses? My father was a horse vet. (grad of Texas A&M) He said if it works on horses, its real. The same for veterinary use of homeopathy? So instead of saying science says blah blah, start from it works and figure out why. It would help if the science educated would learn about the healing arts before they write about them. This book is like having a deaf person faced with critiquing music counting the notes of a symphony to decide its value. Try to remember that it wasn't so long ago that doctors denied the value of washing their hands, or the value of fruits and vegetables in diet. They believed that masturbation led to insanity, that women had less intelligence because their skull volume was smaller than men's and that letting women become educated would result in damaged babies and the resulting destruction of the human species."
295,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46134979-juliet,4,"I found this book fascinating and refreshing. I am already a believer in alternative therapies where appropriate and looking to non-prescription solutions whenever possible. What made this book stand out to me was the author's skepticism of these alternative therapies and the thorough research she conducted to get to the bottom of what was causing the results. It's hard to find books in this topic that aren't heavily biased one way or another, but this one is the exception. A lot of the stories and examples hit close to home for me, and I felt that the author did an excellent job exploring both sides of each argument before drawing conclusions (which were always based on facts and evidence). It’s yet another book that confirms how effective mindfulness and meditation can be in managing stress and depression. I was also intrigued by the placebo effect and how most antidepressants are no more effective than placebos in trials, yet they still get the green light. The author is British, yet her outside perspective of the U.S. healthcare system is spot on.An underlying theme in many of the alternative therapies was a feeling of connection to the world (either through religion, spirituality, or nature), a strong social network, and close relationships with others. Overall it seems the key to health, with or without a diagnosis, is being able to be mindful of the present moment and having a connection to others and the world around us. While this book left me feeling frustrated at the current state of our healthcare system, I did leave off hopeful that there are some steps I can take on my own."
296,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27489272-molecule,5,"Excellent! Eye-opening, mind-expanding and incredibly well written. Jo Marchant gives us perspective and starting point for the future of health care where real human touch and experience, as well as our own powerful resources, will join forces with science to help as live healthier and happier lives. Highly recommend, especially for my fellow scientists."
297,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915736-marya,4,"Cure is a great way to introduce yourself to alternative healing practices from a scientific/skeptical perspective. Marchant never writes off anyone as a quack, but neither does she embrace all practices as equal or even effective. Instead, Marchant recognizes a mind-body connection and how modern medicine tries to avoid that connection like the plague. This does a disservice to everyone as potentially effective treatments are dismissed by medicine, patients dismiss these dismissive doctors, and no one actually addresses the patient's needs.Marchant begins with the placebo effect and highlights research showing what it can --- and can't - do. The nerve cells of individuals suffering from PD actually improve their coordination after a placebo treatment. Yet, the individuals still have PD. Marchant then meanders through other treatments that aim to repeat that effect, from hypnosis to virtual reality. This was my favorite part of the book, though the research becomes less and less conclusive as she continues. That's not necessarily a condemnation of the methods- the research simply isn't there (and sometimes, neither is the funding). I really wish Marchant had expanded on this portion. A whole book on the placebo effect with that writer would be wonderful!Sadly, Marchant strays further and further away from the extensive research to end with something that has no research supporting it at all. It's an interesting journey, but I spent far longer trying to motivate myself to read the second half than the first."
298,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48896082-archi,2,"This book is a placebo. It began with promise: the explanation of the various types of placebo effect, channels of operation, and the selection bias of medical trials that lead to a failure of standard medicine to appreciate the value of ""mind"" induced or enhanced therapies. Very interesting and worth further research. This is up to about chapter 4, ending with altitude sickness.From there, the book turned into an anecdotal, self-focused review of the travels of the author on 'research' of alternative medicine. Both her logic and her science are weak. Her conclusions are based on personal experience more than data, and the data she uses are extremely limited. Most of her conclusions are 'but what if X turns out to be true?' Her kid-gloved critique of obviously un-founded treatments (like the Washington aura healer) do little to add rigor to her process. For example, her review of the placebo effect on an autistic toddler - completely baseless. Was it the parents' change in attitude that cured the child? Was it the autistic child whose mind became convinced that an unrelated treatment was suddenly useful? Sports, childbirth, poverty/politics and religion sections were painful to read. I would think that a fundamental flaw is her inability to define mind and/or body in the context of illness or treatment.Its a shame really, b/c this is a real subject worth deep and rigorous research. This is a feel-good, diet science book that raises the issue, but does little to advance it. "
299,0385348150,http://goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy,3,"This book is a series of fairly entertaining articles about different ways the mind might influence illness, or maybe the perceptions of illness. In some of the chapters, the author reports on the placebo effect, but in others seems to swallow reports of what might be placebo effect without question.While the anecdotes make it easier to understand the diseases Ms. Marchant writes about, it was difficult to believe she understands science if she cites grey hair as proof of stress. The age at which your hair turns grey is recognized as being genetic. If we want to go into anecdotes, I have a 65 year old relative with a huge amount of stress in her life (retirement, moving, divorce, cancer, death) who still has no grey, just like her mother at the same age. I have other friends who turned grey in their 30's and 40's while living a good life. Grey hair should not be cited as proof of a stressful life. On page 39 the author states ""..long personal consultations and empathetic care.....maximize placebo responses."" This pretty much sums up the book. Ms. Marchant tells some interesting stories, but not many of them are about science based research with results that can't be attributed to the placebo effect. "
