What science writer Marcus Chown does especially well is to excite our imagination about what might be possible in light of what we now know or think we know.This is not, however a book to give comfort to mainstream physicists. Chown's emphasis is on minority report notions including parallel universes, invisible universes, time travel, universes created by super-intelligent beings, extra dimensions, and the like. His technique is to introduce the ideas of maverick scientists (e.g., Max Tegmark, Edward Harrison, David Stevenson, etc.) and, where possible, meld them with the ideas of more established scientists. He avoids (I think) the impossible while concentrating on the exciting.Since most of the ideas presented in this book are of the ""not likely to be proven any time soon"" variety, I would like to give them a kind of aesthetic grade just for fun and as a way to show you what the book is about.First, the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, an idea championed by physicist David Deutsch in his book, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes‚Äîand Its Implications (1997). Grade: A+. This is a beautiful notion that expands the mind wonderfully. A entire new universe with every tick of the quantum! Mind-boggling in the extreme, yet eye-opening in the sense that by contemplating such an amazement, we might have a better idea of the thought of infinity. (Personally, though, I prefer in everyday life, the Copenhagen interpretation.) By the way, see my review of Deutsch‚Äôs book.Second, the idea of parallel universes (a possibility that can be independent of the many worlds interpretation of QM). Grade: A-. Too easy by itself to imagine. But what gives it elegance is the underlying question that it begs: what is the nature of reality? ""Where"" do these parallel universes reside? Is ""where"" really a meaningful concept? Do we have any idea of what ""where"" really means? Third, time travel backwards based on an imploding universe headed for crunch time. Grade: C. My problem is the ""so what"" nature of this idea. Clearly it is not supposed that broken cups and scrambled eggs will go a-mending and unscrambling as time moves backwards as in a movie run in reverse. Fourth, time travel based on worm holes, etc. Grade C+. I like the idea that somewhere else (as we emerge from the worm hole) is also some other time, but I just don't see in my wildest imaginings how we might control our destination, either in terms of where or when.Fifth, time travel that avoids the grandfather paradox by having the changes take effect in parallel universes. Grade: A. This really is a nice answer to both the paradoxes and the salient question that Stephen Hawking asked, ""Where are the tourists?"" (from the future). Incidentally, time travel into the future is no problem logically in this world. It just takes time. (Ha!) It is time travel to the past that leads to all the logical and conceptional problems.Sixth: Invisible universes. Grade: D-. If they can in some way affect our visible universe, make that a C. Invisible universes that we cannot become aware of in any way are effectively speaking not much different than parallel universes.Seventh: the idea that black holes ""explode"" or bud out into a new universe elsewhere. Grade: A. Although this is about as close to an untestable idea as one can imagine, it has a beautiful symmetry to it that is infectious. Our universe itself could be the result of such a budding out.Eighth: the idea that universes propagate by giving birth to new universes, either through black holes or some other manner. Grade: B. What I like about this idea is the suggestion of infinity, one universe leads to another to another, etc., etc., truly mind-exploding! What I don't like is the somewhat biological taint. Testability? (Grin.)Ninth: the idea that there are dark planets in interstellar space teeming with life. Grade: A+. Eminently reasonable. I predict this idea will become a common assumption in a few years. The impetus for this idea is the fairly recent realization here on earth of just how common life is, underground, at the bottom of deep ocean trenches, that does not rely on photosynthesis. This is also an idea that could conceivably, even in my lifetime, find some empirical support.Tenth: panspermia (from Chandra Wickramasinghe and Fred Hoyle), or the idea that the origin of life is extraterrestrial. Grade: A. This is also eminently reasonable and likely to be given some support before too long (if it is true). This really is the most likely idea in the book.Eleven: alien garbage, or the notion that artifacts from ET's are littering up interstellar space and some of those artifacts have hit the earth and are under our feet. Grade C-. I have several problems with this, mainly that I think the amount of debris is a huge overestimate, primarily because I don't think the superior technicians envisioned would be as careless as radio astronomer Alexey Arkhipov seems to think.I could go on but better you should read Chown's book and do your own grading.Bottom line: this is an entertaining excursion up to and over the edge of the known. --Dennis Littrell, author of ‚ÄúThe World Is Not as We Think It Is‚Äù"

Apart from some sections on plancks and branes that went over my head, I got a lot from it as a lay-person and it made me want to learn more. Mirror worlds and particles; tricksy atoms that can be in more than one place at once; the likelihood that our universe is teeming with life, originating from asteroids that seed any planet with enough warmth to have liquid water; and that six missing dimensions that must exist for wave theory to be correct, might be folded so small that we cannot perceive them."

La parte regulera es que los conceptos se van repitiendo en muchos de los 12 ensayos, e incluso alg√∫n dato va cambiando entre ellos. La buena, que es muy especulativo. Chown muestra hip√≥tesis sobre el funcionamiento del universo bastante heterodoxas, habla mucho de Max Tergmark (que lo tengo pendiente) y se atreve con multiversos matem√°ticos y nubes de cometas rebosantes de vida congelada, antes viva gracias a un is√≥topo de aluminio. Interesante."

5,0195168844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772165-parksy,4,"Cool book on the new theories in physics - specifically quantum physics.Immortality in an alternate quantum reality? Black holes that give birth to new universes? Galactic regions where time runs backward? Mere fiction simply cannot keep up with the wild rush of contemporary science. And no writer makes it easier for general readers to come along for the dizzying ride than Chown, cosmology consultant for New Scientist. Whether assessing the latest evidence for comet-borne life or probing the implications of 10-dimensional models for space, Chown frees readers from the technical rigors of theorizing but ceaselessly challenges us to enlarge our imaginative horizons. The galaxy itself cannot contain ideas that open up onto a multiuniverse of cosmic possibilities, including invisible mirror planets and cosmic laboratories for detonating new big bangs. To be sure, Chown ventures far beyond what scientists have actually proved, delving deep into what they only wildly conjecture. But even the wildest of speculations (that, for instance, each atom is a miniature time machine) show us how brilliant scientists grapple with fundamental questions. Many of these theoretical forays will eventually be exposed as fantasies. But others are bound to revolutionize the way scientists--and ordinary humans--view our cosmos and our place in it. For sheer intellectual exhilaration, few books offer more. Bryce ChristensenThe idea that an atom can be in two places at once defies logic. Yet this is now an established scientific fact. In The Universe Next Door, science writer Marcus Chown examines a dozen mind-bending new ideas that also fly in the face of reason--but that, according to eminent scientists, might just be crazy enough to be true. Could time run backwards? Is there a fifth dimension? Does quantum theory promise immortality? To explore these questions, Chown has interviewed some of the most imaginative and courageous people working at the forefront of science, and he has come away with a smorgasbord of mind-expanding ideas. For instance, Lawrence Schulman at New York's Clarkson University believes there could be regions in our Universe where stars unexplode, eggs unbreak and living things grow younger with every passing second. Max Tegmark, at the University of Pennsylvania, believes there could be an infinity of realities stacked together like the pages of a never-ending book (with an infinite number of versions of you, living out an infinite number of different lives). And David Stevenson of Cal Tech argues that life may exist on worlds drifting in the cold, dark abyss between the stars, worlds without suns to warm them. Indeed, these worlds may be the most common sites for life in the universe. Was our universe created by super-intelligent beings from another universe? Is there evidence of extraterrestrial life lying right beneath our feet? The Universe Next Door ponders these and many other thought-provoking questions. You may not agree with all the answers but your head will be spinning by the time you reach the last page."

The Universe Next Door
 contains lots of interesting concepts from theoretical physics ‚Äì mainly the more exotic implications of theories such as general relativity and quantum mechanics. It explores a number of ideas that have captivated both professional scientists and curious laymen alike since Einstein's annus mirabilis.The author, Marcus Chown, discusses many ideas that have been popularised by the likes of Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose and Max Tegmark, to name but a few.The book capitalises on concepts such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, the extra dimensions postulated by string theory, and some of the more extreme predictions of the mathematics of general relativity. It then endeavours to explain in a non-technical language the mind-bending implications of these theories, and does a good job of it too.I would highly recommend this book to a newcomer to physics, or to someone who has never really thought in detail about the idea of the multiverse/parallel universes etc. However, readers who have a scientific background, or even just hobbyists who have read all the popular science books or watched a lot of documentaries on space, may find that this book is lacking in any original stimulating ideas, and may want to try something else.Overall, a good book considering its scope and audience."
7,0195168844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8032118-phoebe,4,"If you are not familiar with quantum theory and relativity theory then these essays will certainly seem like science fiction and will be very difficult to take seriously. This is because the background for these theories is not given here. However Chown knows that quantum physics hobbyists such as myself are everywhere, making this kind of book a plausible money spinner. For those familiar with the bizarre world of quantum physics, these theories that Chown describes are some of the more (and less as in multiverses) contentious attempts to address some of the remaining holes in quantum theory, and the ever enticing task of uniting relativity and quantum theory. The interesting parts for me were in the last section of the book where Chown describes one theory which proposes how there may be millions of ""invisible"" planets sustaining life in the dark of interstellar space, and another theory showing how life may originally have evolved to bacteria stage, elsewhere in the universe and arrived fully formed on early earth. "
8,0195168844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2286365-jack-massa,2,"Interesting and easy-to-read survey of some of the more astounding postulations in recent Physics and Astronomy. 'Easy-to-read' is why I didn't appreciate this book more. Obviously, unless you are a scientist and 'get' the math, you can't really understand the mind-bending theories presented. But the best science writing uses metaphors and detailed descriptions of experiments to help the non-specialist who is willing to think hard at least approach understanding. There's little of this kind of writing here, not much encouragement to think hard, and so not much help in gaining more than a very surface level of knowledge.An enjoyable and quick read, but I won't remember most of it next month."
9,0195168844,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1022828-dan,3,"Fascinating material...although I get the feeling that when theoretical physicists know that their predictions won't be testable in their lifetimes (if ever), that they just start making up crazy stuff in order to get attention. A fun read regardless, and it definitely gets the imagination going on all kinds of bizarre tangents. Note: I filed this under non-fiction, but I'm not really sure that is completely appropriate."
