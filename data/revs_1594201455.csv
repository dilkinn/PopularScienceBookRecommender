0,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/307041-ginny-messina,1,"Actually, there is enough good material in this book that it probably warrants another star or two. But I was so alarmed at the amount of misinformation here that one star is the best I can do. Michael Pollan is right about some of the big stuff. Nutrition research is badly flawed. It has sometimes led us down the wrong road (although it has also provided life-saving findings). The government is far too slow to change its recommendations and has strong ties (to put it mildly) to the food industry. The same can be said of my own nutrition profession. And obviously he is right that we should choose more whole foods and engage in practices that help us appreciate food—a useful perspective even if it isn’t a particularly cutting edge one. But for the most part, Pollan’s reasoning about nutrition and research was pretty unsophisticated and uninformed. He carefully describes all of the reasons why nutrition research is flawed, and then employs some of the worst examples of research (animal studies and completely uncontrolled observational approaches) to support his own arguments. He quotes ""nutrition professionals"" whose credentials and opinions are questionable at best. Almost without exception, his observations on nutrition are wrong—sometimes subtly so, sometimes overtly so, and sometimes in ways that are actually dangerous. Pollan defends his right to provide nutrition advice because he speaks on the authority of “tradition and common sense.” But, tradition and common sense will get you about 90% of the way to a healthy diet. The other 10% can have unfortunate and Pollan really has no sense of this. The last part of the book has recommendations about how to eat and shop. “Shop the perimeter of the grocery store” is exactly the advice that was popular among nutritionists when I started in this field 30 years ago. It’s just as wrong now as it was then. Why would you shop the perimeter of the store if you are supposed to be eating mostly plant foods? Far better to shop the produce corner and then head to the interior for grains, beans, condiments, and spices. Pollan doesn’t want us to eat anything with more than 5 ingredients on the label. So no prepared spaghetti sauce, salsa, fortified soymilk, or curry paste, all of which are perfectly healthful foods that play a central role in my diet. Of course, I understand the spirit behind this and all of his recommendations—-he wants us to slow down, cook more from scratch, use more whole-food ingredients, fewer manufactured foods. He’s a big fan of the Slow Food Association, for whom he is a frequent speaker and which he admits can sometimes sound like an elitist club for foodies (I'm thinking this has something to do with the fact that it is an elitist club for foodies as a quick peek at their website shows). Slowing down to cook and eat and enjoy food are good things, but there has to be room for a little bit of compromise and a sense of reality. There is nothing wrong with eating pasta sauce from a jar or frozen vegetables or—-my favorite convenience food and I’ll defend it to my death—-butternut squash soup from a box. It’s the way many busy responsible people cook and it’s a perfectly healthful and acceptable way to eat. I was disappointed that his entire discussion of the ethics of food choices fit into one single parenthetical sentence plus a footnote. This from the man who wrote The Omnivore’s Dilemma and who debated ethics with Peter Singer (and lost the debate). I realize this isn’t what this book is about, but Pollan knows, far better than most people, the true cost-- in terms of animal suffering and environmental destruction-- of animal food production. When he talks about how to eat, he is obligated to speak to that issue at least a little bit. Pollan’s opening mantra—-eat food, not too much, mostly plants—-is good advice. There are other snippets of good advice in this book. For me, it was all greatly overwhelmed by faulty and uninformed reasoning , the unnecessarily restrictive requirements for food choices, and the great amount of misinformation. All in all, a disappointing book. At least it was short (a little shorter than my review, I think! ) "
1,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98091-e-a-quinn,4,"In the Buddhist tradition there is a level of hell whereby the dead, known as hungry ghosts, are trapped with enormous stomachs and tiny throats unable to swallow anything but the smallest bites of food. Their particular brand of torture is that they are always eating and yet their hunger is never satisfied. These hungry ghosts sound an awful lot like the modern American eater trapped in the unhealthy western diet demonized in Michael Pollan’s In Defense of Food: An Eater’s Manifesto. You may be surprised that anyone felt they needed to defend food, since we all rely on it to survive. But Pollan makes a clear distinction between the processed food-like substances that fill our grocery aisles in glistening packages and real foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains and unprocessed, natural foods. Pollan argues that we eat way too much of the fake stuff, ignoring the foods that our bodies actually need. Like the hungry ghosts, we just never feel satisfied. At a clipping pace, Pollan examines both the field of nutritional science and the industrialization of food to show the reader just how we got to our particular brand of hell. Then, thankfully, he offers us a way out.Instead of being hungry ghosts, Pollan tells us we can practice thoughtful consumption. He argues that the onslaught of nutritional science has taken the expertise out of the kitchen and into the laboratory, and too often isolates nutritional elements from the whole food that bore it. Any of us who keep up on nutritional trends will be shaking our heads when he discusses the familiar irritation of being told this week to eat one thing and avoid another, only to be told later that we had it right the first time. Instead of offering us a new trend in dieting, his solutions are both revolutionary and literally as old as time. “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” Pollan argues we should eat like our ancestors, before diabetes and heart disease reigned supreme and before high fructose corn syrup became more popular to the American consumer than television. Despite the dire evidence he presents in the book, his voice remains jocular and never dips into pessimism, though I did as a reader once or twice.Even if you are not a health nut, Pollan makes a good argument for adopting his method of eating. The benefit of this thoughtful consumption is more than nutritional. The eater will be practicing a lifestyle of environmental stewardship, optimal health, and respect for the time required to grow and prepare the food necessary for life. The book, addictive as those processed foods Pollan does such a powerful job of damning, is difficult to put down, in part because you don’t want to stop to eat anything until you know what you are supposed to eat after all. The only caveat is that In Defense of Food offers so little compromise between the western lifestyle and the lifestyle Pollan requires the eater to adopt, which just may be the reality of the current food paradigm. Maybe eating well is a revolutionary act in these times of microwavable meals and fast food paragons. When you buy food it is no longer a given that it is real food, and you may have to be willing to make some major changes in your lifestyle to get the real food back onto your table and into your stomach.

One of the more pernicious aspects of nutritionism is that it encourages us to blame our health problems on lifestyle choices, implying that the individual bears ultimate responsibility for whatever illnesses befall him. It’s worth keeping in mind that a far more powerful predictor of heart disease than either diet or exercise is social class.
Pollan contends that Western society has replaced our relationship with food to a relationship with nutrition, to our great loss. Science has sought to figure out exactly what parts of foods do, and having figured out how this or that part functions, sought to replace the food itself with its nutritive parts. As Doctor Phil might say, “How’s that working out for you?” Not well. What Pollan calls “the Western diet” is a disaster, replacing actual nutrition with a manufactured diet that loses much of the actual benefit that real food provides. This is not a book that offers a prescriptive diet. He is not looking to sell a program, but to argue that the way we eat is out of whack. The nutrition business is not about feeding people but about pushing product. The results are raging epidemics of diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Not that a return to a more natural state would eliminate those entirely, but there is compelling research that indicates it would make a significant difference. One interesting thing Pollan notes is that in different parts of the world, people do quite well with various types of diets. There appears not to be a single best way to eat. It does appear that there is a single worst way to eat and we have found it.

3,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"I am conflicted about this book. On the one hand, I agree with Pollan's thesis: food science has not served us well over the past 100 years, and we really should ""Eat Food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" I believe that partially because of Pollan's arguments, and the revelatory reporting he did for  The Omnivore's Dilemma, but mostly because I've studied biology, and have at least a limited idea of how complex human bodies and human food can be, and how evolution may not have prepared us for Twinkies.On the other hand, Pollan's rhetoric was definitely fast and loose in this book. He's an amazingly mellifluous, persuasive writer, but some portions were just bad reporting. One example: in attempting to demonstrate the ills of the Western diet, he cites a study of Aboriginal Australians who suffered from a suite of Western diseases, then decided to leave town and return to a hunter/gatherer life in the bush. Their diseases disappeared and they became more healthy, and lo, Pollan blames the Western diet. What? There are more than a few confounding factors there, including amount of exercise, sleep, sunlight, air quality, mental health, etc. And this was after several cases in which Pollan critiqued nutritionists for falling victim to the same basic fallacy: correlation is not necessarily causation.There are several other similar examples, many of which cite studies that may very well prove his points, but for which he doesn't cite enough of the evidence to be bulletproof.The other main problem with this book, to which Pollan readily admits but doesn't resolve, is his simultaneous critique and reliance upon reductionist science. If food is so complex that we should despair of science's ability to explain it to us, why does he spend so long discussing the latest research praising the benefits of omega-3 fats? I know he doesn't actually think science is intrinsically incapable of revealing truths about food, but his rhetoric definitely has an anti-scientific air that I can see fueling irrational zealotry.Overall, I really did enjoy most of the book. Well, Part III, in which he gets proscriptive. Pollan's most salient point: if you actually read a book called In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto, then your food system is badly broken.I think I'll look for an Orthorexics Anonymous group now..."
4,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901783-happyreader,2,"I hated reading this book. And that's sad because I agree with his basic premise. Just eat real food. Not too much. Mostly plants. And I would add, try and get off your ass once in awhile. But this book was excrutiating to read. I read the first 50 pages, gave up, and went to the last section on his very basic food rules, gave up again. His language was all black and white with blanket condemnations and blanket recommendations, ironic since that's what he condemns in scientific thinking and food marketing. Oddly, he comes off as so much more even-handed in his interviews.That said, his message is important but what's really going on is more nuanced than presented. As a dietitian, I agree that people should be able to figure out what to eat on their own. I really should only have to meet with people with special medical conditions and dietary needs. Instead, many of my patients haven't a clue and they rely on supplements, protein powders, and various bars to meet their needs. It's crazy. A balanced and varied diet of mostly veggies, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins will meet your nutritional needs.I also agree with him about the nature of nutrition research. The food frequency questionnaire is a crazy tool. And don't even get me started on diet recalls. Patients lie. I used to think they lied to me but soon realized they're actually lying to themselves. They really don't register and/or are unwilling to own up to what they're eating. But that's another topic. Any research involving human beings is tough. Test tubes are easier to control.I think that's what really bothered me about this book. It came across as a good-people-vs-bad-people polemic. Like all systems, however, there is usually some good and bad on all sides. Food marketers sell what people buy. If we wouldn't buy it, they wouldn't sell it. On the positive side, that's why there is more organic food available these days. There's a market for it and where there's a market, there's a marketer. That's not to say there aren't some sleazy marketing practices that pervert what the market wants. Just look at what's happening with organic food guidelines.As consumers, we bear some responsibility. Food and diet have definately become fetishized. We project so much onto our eating habits, including comfort, status, shame, and ego gratification. Plus many people are looking for the quick, easy, and mindless route to healthy living so ""special diets,"" ""power foods,"" and ""quickie solutions"" sell. I sometimes joke with my dietitian friends that we could make some real money with a crazy diet book that only allows red foods to be eaten on Monday and orange foods on Tuesday.Crazy gimmicks sell. They relieve us of the burden of decision making. When I first saw the Special K diet commercials, I thought there was no way that anyone who eat mostly Special K all day. I was shocked when I met patients actually on that diet. They liked it because they didn't have to think about what foods to eat. Gimmicks also create the illusion that you're buying some secret that will keep you thin and healthy forever. Eat less, exercise more just doesn't seem cutting edge enough for some people.If what you're looking is more info on how crazy our food system is, try Marion Nestle's ""Food Politics."" If what you're looking for is more practical advice on a normal, balanced diet, try ""Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy"" or ""Eat, Drink, and Weigh Less."" And if you want to follow Michael Pollan's sage advice to cook more, start somewhere easy like ""How to Cook Everything Vegetarian."" Like Mollie Katzen very wisely said, regardless of your eating philosophy, we need to eat more veggies. Eat more plants."
5,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,5,"Books like this make me afraid to eat. Then they make me mad at the way I've been eating. Finally, they make me a better eater. At the start, the idea seems simple: ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" When I read that I thought, okay I can stop reading. I know that already, so I've got this shit down.But what is food today? It may not be what you think it is. Most of what you find at the grocer's is not food. That complicates things just a little bit, doesn't it? Pollan complicates that simple ""eat food"" mantra a lot. Which is not to say In Defense of Food is a complicated read. Indeed no, quite the opposite. He actually does an excellent job at explaining it all in layman terms (He even helped me figured out the glucose-to-triglicerides issue I have that two doctors failed to make me fully understand). It's not Pollan's fault eating has become difficult. The problem is that the seemingly simple act of eating these days is more difficult than it used to be for our grandparents due to the food engineering/fiddling that's been happening the last few decades.There's oh-so much more info I could lay down here for you, but you wouldn't want to bite into a rotten apple, so why would you want me too spoil this for you? No, no, read In Defense of Food. It's enjoyable, it's quick and it's full of information. Ingesting this book will do your body good!"
6,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/427149-charlotte,2,"Michael Pollan is absolutely on to something with his central thesis; namely, that the American diet has been taken over by ""edible foodlike substances"" (ie, hyper-processed foods) and the American approach to health as it relates to eating has been taken over by ""nutritionism"" (ie, the idea that food is nothing more than the sum of its nutrient parts). He makes an excellent case that the current epidemics of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, etc. are the inevitable result of this perverse relationship with food and eating. His proposed remedy is to ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" In other words, eat whole, not processed foods; concentrate on the quality of the eating experience rather than the quantity of food consumed; and eat a wide variety of species, mainly fruits and vegetables. But as with his previous book, The Omnivore's Dilemma, he fails to explain how anyone other than smug, affluent foodies with an abundance of time on their hands could possibly follow his recommendations. He even laments the fact that Americans don't spend more of their annual income on food! He paints an admittedly appealing picture of long, leisurely meals made of fresh, local ingredients, enjoyed among friends over a glass or two of wine. Great, I'm sure that's no problem for his fellow professors at Berkeley, but how about for single-parent households, two-career families, families with lots of children, low-income families, families who don't happen to live next to a farmer's market, etc.? Pollan's refusal to address these very real issues made the book rather--ahem--hard to swallow (sorry!)."

8,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"One of the most remarkable meals I’ve ever eaten was here - http://www.royalmail.com.au/Pages/Foo.... Now, Dunkeld is a long way to go for a meal, even if you do live in Melbourne – and a ten course meal served over many hours with matching wines that costs an arm and three toes possibly isn’t something everyone would think of as value for money. However, unlike the said value for money meals I will never forget the evening I spent at this restaurant. Fantastic food, remarkable wines and delightful company – if that isn’t the definition of the good life, what possibly could be?And that question is at the heart of this book. Every review of this book needs to quote Pollan’s eating maxim, so let’s get it over and done with now. ‘Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.’ Actually, the real advice is this book is eat what your Neolithic ancestors evolved to eat and do so in a way that makes eating it a culturally significant part of your life, and not just a way to stuff calories into your face. And that piece of advice can’t be said too often.There was a time in human evolution when you could tell food was fit to eat because it smelt ripe and because it tasted sweet. Food also had this weird way of going off. I know you’ll find this hard to believe, but real food actually used to spoil. This was because the nutrients in real food were so appealing and appetising to other creatures (even bacteria) that the time window when it could be eaten by us was remarkably narrow.I’m old enough to remember a time when bread would go stale. This is very hard to explain to young people, but bread used to go hard if left uneaten for a few days. Now bread can be covered in blue mould and still be soft and flexible. Whatever THEY have done to bread now (and they know who they are) it could not reasonably still be called bread. And this is a much of the point of the ‘eat food’ advice. Much of the food-like products sold to us to eat simply isn’t really food anymore.The problem is that at some stage we decided that if you want to have a food industry you need to organise it in such a way that food doesn’t spoil. The best way to achieve this is to make it unappetising to other creatures and you do this by removing most of the nutrients in the ‘food’. But this ‘food’ is unappealing to vermin because it is unappealing full-stop. So then they need to add stuff to it to fool the eater that it is actually worth eating. Sugars and salts and oils and essences and foliate and azodicarbonamide. On page 151 of this book Pollan provides a list of the ingredients in a loaf of Sara Lee’s Soft & Smooth Whole Grain White Bread. Real bread, he points out, only requires four ingredients – this Frankenstein variety has 36. A big part of our modern problem is that we are all Platonists when it comes to understanding food. We want food to be about things and not about relationships. I do need to quote this: “What would happen if we were to start thinking about food as less of a thing and more of a relationship? In nature, that is of course precisely what eating has always been: relationships among species in systems we call food chains, or food webs, that reach all the way down to the soil.” But we don’t talk about beef or carrots or wine anymore, but trans-fats and beta-carotene and anti-oxidants. There is a wonderful bit where he talks about how Asian cultures turned an anti-nutritious plant (soy) into a highly important source of protein by making it into tofu. But our science thinks that it can isolate the soy proteins and these will be just as good for us when slapped into some hideous processed goo. His point being that food is often only good for us in a cultural context of relationships between real foods. I read an article once about how the carbohydrates in bread do interesting things with the proteins in beans and that this might be part of the reason why we quite like baked beans on toast.A few years ago they did a test to see if giving supplements of anti-oxidants would help cancer patients. So, they started handing out tablets with isolated anti-oxidants in them and they found that they had to stop the trail because not only were the people on the treatment not doing any better than the people in the control group not receiving the anti-oxidants, but they were actually doing worse – much worse. See what has happened here? It is standard Western Science gone nuts. We want there to be a reductionist answer. Eating fruit makes you healthy, so what is it in the fruit that is so good? Well, as you grow old your body produces free radical oxygen molecules and these destroy your DNA. Fruit contains anti-oxidants. Therefore why don’t we just skip the fruit and pump in the anti-oxidants? Well, because we don’t know nearly enough about what we are doing is one answer.The point is that biological systems are both easier and more complicated than that. Rather than obsessively looking for the thing that delivers the health benefit in fruit (and perhaps there is no ‘thing’), perhaps we would be better off looking at the fruit as a whole package, one which has evolved to both encourage us to eat it (as we can then transport the plant’s seeds) and to make us healthy in the process (so we will keep coming back to help transport more seeds). The lesson is to embrace complexity and diversity – and this is actually the lesson of this entire book.What is the secret to French people eating lots of fats and still being slimmer than the average American or Australian or Brit? Variety of diet and a culture that loves food and prefers dining to merely eating. Is it any wonder that the slow food movement started in Italy and not in England? Jamie Oliver not withstanding, there is something incredibly sad about our Anglo-Saxon diet. However, there was once a Starbucks on Lygon Street – nothing gives me more hope for Australia’s future than the fact that this is no longer the case.His three rules are actually supplemented with a range of other valuable pieces of advice. Spend more money on food for smaller quantities is superb advice. Food is to be enjoyed, and eating cakes that never go off that have been filled with ‘cream’ that has never seen the inside of a cow simply can’t be a recipe for enjoyment. Especially not in a world where mangos are coming into season and female pigs are squealing to have their bellies roasted. Have you ever eaten pork and mango together? If you wanted to construct an argument to prove that God really doesn’t like Jews or Muslims I think you have it right there.Eat at a table – now there is a novel idea. Did you know that one in five meals eaten by 18 to 50 year olds in the US are now eaten in a car? I could make some sort of snide remark about that fact, but do I really need to? Regard non-traditional food with scepticism. Like I said, real food has evolved to meet our needs, we have evolved to have our needs met by real food – scientists (particularly nutrition scientists) only have the vaguest notions about how food works – that is why we were once told to eat monounsaturated fats rather than saturated fats and now are told that the monounsaturated fats were worse for us than saturated fats could ever have been – and next week? If you want to see healthy people you have to look to people who have a healthy cultural cuisine – the Italians, the Greeks, the French, the Japanese. It is not olive oil or red wine, it is a complex and varied diet.Eat more leaves than seeds. I need to follow this advice – he makes a powerful argument for it. Seeds are easier to store and transport and so have taken over our culture which is obsessed with storing and transporting, but leaves have much more omega3 oils and our modern diet has meant a shift of the ratio of omega3 and omega6 in our bodies from about 1 to 3 a century ago to about 1 to 10 today. This is a fascinating book – it might even change the way you eat – it might even save your life, if nothing else, it might make you enjoy food again. If you are still able to squeeze your bum out of your chair and walk unassisted I would suggest a trip to your local bookshop so you can buy it. I’ve loved the other two books I’ve read by Pollan on food, but this one was not just interesting – this was essential reading."
9,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/958786-james,5,"I am deeply ashamed, depressed, and embarrassed by the fact that such a book as Michael Pollan’s In Defense of Food need be written, much less published, critically acclaimed, and enjoyed by someone such as myself. Pollan himself acknowledges the perverse state of affairs saying, “That one should feel the need to mount a defense of ‘the meal’ is sad, but then I never would have thought ‘food’ needed defending, either.”We should be collectively mortified as a culture because though Pollan greets us on the back jacket with his cute bald head, dopey ears, nerdy glasses, and huge grin of unassuming innocence…pollan_highres.jpg…his sheer journalistic acuity packs a hard punch. When you are done with his book, you will feel the same way about food manufacturers, food marketers, nutritionists, and the government as you do about Scientologists, multi-level marketing schemes, and two-bit scam artists.We’re not eating food anymore. We’re Orthorexics, people with an unhealthy obsession with healthy eating. And now that the ideology of “Nutritionism” has its cold, clammy hands firmly throttling our very throats and controlling what we mindlessly shovel into our mouths, food has been distilled into a convoluted linguistic labyrinth of nutrients, macro-nutrients, micro-nutrients, vitamins, minerals, protein, fat, carbohydrates, saturated fat, antioxidants, polyunsaturated fat, cholesterol, fiber, amino acids, etc, etc, et al. Good Grief!Though Pollan does a very good job of taking the reader through nutritionism’s never-ending oscillations of advice (fat is evil, cholesterol is evil, carbs are evil), one specific fact illuminates all we need to know: “30 years of nutritional advice have left us fatter, sicker, and more poorly nourished.” Something must change. And Pollan does humbly offer a few suggestions.A quarter of all Americans suffer from metabolic syndrome.Two thirds of us are overweight or obese.Diet-related diseases are already killing the majority of us.“Much more so than the human body, capitalism is marvelously adaptive, able to turn the problems it creates into new business opportunities: diet pills, heart bypass operations, insulin pumps, bariatric surgery.” Hooray, Capitalism!Even our modern dental maladies (braces, root canals, extractions of wisdom teeth, cavities, and routine cleanings and procedures) may be the result of poor diet and nutrition. A public debate between hygiene and nutrition was waged in the 1930s. Hygiene ultimately carried the day, hygiene being easier and far more profitable for the dental profession than restructuring the entire food system.We are overfed and undernourished.USDA figures show a decline in the nutrient content of the forty-three crops it has tracked since the 1950s.The Food Industry releases 17,000 new food products every year and spends $32 billion a year marketing them. There are boxed breakfast cereals with bright labels proudly claiming their health benefits while fruits and vegetables in the produce section have no such marks. (Pollan advises to be wary of any product that has to advertise its health benefits. Shouldn’t anything you put in your body be good for you?)Pollan eloquently and intelligently provides some rationale to this sick world of contemporary food consumption that is a nefarious web of collusion with straightforward advice:“A whole food might be more than the sum of its nutrient parts.”“There is now abundant scientific evidence for the health benefits of alcohol to go with a few centuries of traditional belief and anecdotal evidence. Mindful of the social and health effects of alcoholism, public health authorities are loath to recommend drinking, but the fact is that people who drink moderately and regularly live longer and suffer considerably less heart disease than teetotalers.” Thank god.And Pollan spends the final third of his book offering sensible solutions to combat the Chicken Littles of “Nutritionism” and the fallacies of “Food Science” that expand upon his basic thesis to “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants,” that will leave you feeling more prepared to combat the hucksters and rubes of the contemporary food industry. Those bastards."
10,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,3,Thoughts soon.
11,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,4,"""Eat food. Not much. Mostly Plants.""This pretty much encapsulates the book. When Pollan speaks of ""food"" he refers to things that can be grown, not things that are manufactured. The ""mostly plants"" refers to mostly fruits and leaves not seeds. He also recommends this for your meat. In other words, try to consume animals that were raised on real food (grass fed cows). Pollan throws lots of interesting facts about the food we consume and its origins. He is not a fan of ""nutritionism"" or the nature of deconstructing foods down to their scientific components so that you can get the recommended doses of Vitamin C etc by choosing the right types of foods. Nor is he a fan of fat or calorie counting and contents. The ""no fat"" fad that ended up being detrimental because fat is important as are all ""nutrients"" in moderation. He also points out that the same food can have very different nutrients depending on the soil in which it was grown. One carrot can be more nutritious by ""nutritionism"" measures merely by being grown in a more nutrient rich soil. He had an interesting take on diets (aka calorie and nutrient counting) and how the notion of dieting has it's foundation in Puritanical roots. Nutrition science has usually put more of its energies into the idea that the problems it studies are the result of too much of a bad thing instead of too little of a good thing. Is this good science or nutritionist prejudice? The epidemiologist John Powles has suggested this predilection is little more than a Puritan bias: Bad things happen to people who eat bad things. Hadn't thought about it that way but...yep! Anyone remember that old axiom ""you are what you eat"" which is true, but unless you have been very focused on the origins of the food that you eat, you really aren't much in control of that. He also says: A diet based on quantity rather than quality has ushered a new creature onto the world stage: the human being who manages to be both overfed and undernourished, two characteristics seldom found in the same body in the long natural history of our species. In most traditional diets, when calories are adequate, nutrient intake will usually be adequate as well. Pollan reminds us that in nutrition science, much is still theory and most encouragements have agendas (even when agendas are well meaning, we can't always assume that the findings are inarguable). But while nutritionism has its roots in a scientific approach to food, it’s important to remember that it is not a science but an ideology, and that the food industry, journalism, and government bear just as much responsibility for its conquest of our minds and diets. I don't know about you, but in this day and age, I'm not interested in following any ideology.All in all this book was a good reminder that like all things, we need to be mindful of what we eat. Everything has nuance in our world. Everything is advertised and marketed and spun even the scientific approaches. Pollan makes a great case for just following your body. Eat until you are full. Of course even that takes a whole lot of self-awareness, education and money. The ability to understand yourself and recognizing the difference between hunger and boredom and anxiety etc and also the ability to identify what your body craves. The healthiest eaters are also wealthier and more educated. A good book with many interesting facts about food and theories. Worthwhile.4 StarsListened to the Audio book. The narration was excellent."
12,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62081-ganesh,0,"Last night, I watched Pollan -- who looks just like one of my uncles -- on TV promoting this book. Something wonderful and empowering he said: the food industry pays very close attention to what consumers want. In fact, they're terrified of us.  For instance, it only took a little over 100 concerned McDonald's customers writing to ask if it were true that the chain served genetically modified potatoes -- that was enoughto get the issue on the agenda at their shareholders' meeting. Another example: in his popular book The Omnivore's Dilemma, Pollan was very critical of Whole Foods' support of gigantic organic farms , and in response, the CEO made a commitment to support small, local farmers by buying more of their produce and allowing them to sell their own produce outside the store. Last week I put a note in the suggestion box at my grocery store: ""I would be in HEAVEN if you had organic apples from local farms* . . . "" From now on, trips to the grocery store will be more fun as I walk the aisles, thinking of the kind of changes I'd like to see and writing them down.=======*I live in New England. If shoppers were willing to pay for organic, locally grown fruit, there would be no reason to fly in apples grown on another continent. Pollan argues that about 80% of the population can afford to pay more for food. As a nation, we spend less than 10 % of our income on food -- which is less than any country in history. (The French currently spend about 15%.) It's a matter of priorties. Maybe to afford for food that is healthy for our bodies, communities, and earth, we will need to forgo things that aren't true necessities. And Pollan argues that healthy food should be available for everyone. For the 20% of us who can't afford organic food, we need to reform our agricultural policies to stop subsidzing a toxic fast-food culture and begin building a health-focused culture.  "
13,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4569199-adam,1,"Michael Pollan's In Defense of Food might best be described as a book which fares best when judged by its cover. Below the title, a reader finds some dietary advice which is not a bad place to start: ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" There are a few good ideas inside the book, too. It would be easy not to look much deeper, as Pollan's prose is so lively that most readers won't want to stop and give things a closer look. However, the reader who does bother to check the details sees that In Defense of Food is not a credible work of nonfiction. Pollan twists facts and misrepresents the way science works in the course of assembling exaggerated, false, and contradictory narratives.Pollan's central thesis is that introducing science into our food system has done more harm than good and that the best thing for all of us would be to go back to eating a more traditional diet. It's fair to point out that nutritional science has led to some mistakes (such as recommendations to replace saturated fats with hydrogenated oils), but Pollan devotes too much of his effort to dismantling his own shallow caricature of science. Pollan's chief criticism of nutritional science is that it adheres to the ideology of nutritionism, which he defines as the belief that foods can be understood by studying their constituent nutrients. He explains that nutritionism is rooted in the idea that foods are ""decidedly unscientific things"" (19) and that studying individual nutrients is ""the only thing [nutritional scientists] can do"" (62). He even puts forth the idea that the goal of nutritional science is to find an ""X factor"" (178) -- a single compound that is responsible for good health -- so that food processors can add more of it to their products.But science -- to the people who study it -- isn't defined by the consideration of certain ""scientific"" things with hard-to-pronounce names. The scientific method is a general process for improving our understanding of the world. It entails using observations to form a hypothesis, testing the hypothesis experimentally, and refining that hypothesis based on the results of the experiment. As far as the scientific method is concerned, oranges are as good a subject to study as vitamin C. And nutritional scientists tend to be aware that human nutrition is too complicated to be explained by a single ""X factor."" After all, that's part of what makes their jobs challenging!As proof of the malignancy of nutritionism, Pollan points to the various sets of nutritional guidelines which encouraged Americans to reduce their fat consumption. As Pollan explains, these recommendations gave rise to products like the SnackWell's cookie, which was presumed healthy on the basis of its being fat-free. He contrasts the low-fat guidelines with the theory (put forward by Gary Taubes and others) that weight gain results when the consumption of refined carbohydrates promotes fat storage and overeating. If that theory is correct, he explains, ""there is no escaping the conclusion that the [official dietary advice] bears direct responsibility for creating the public health crisis that now confronts us"" (59-60).By the end of the book, he's moved on to blaming that same public health crisis on overconsumption of cheap sweeteners and added fats, pointing out that Americans have added 300 calories to their daily diets since 1980 and citing a group of Harvard economists who ""concluded that the widespread availability of cheap convenience foods could explain most of the twelve-pound increase in the weight of the average American since the early 1960s"" (186-187). If both the dietary guidelines and the cheap convenience foods are to blame, then it must be that the guidelines encouraged Americans to eat those convenience foods, right?Not exactly, as it would happen. For all his insistence that Americans have ""an unhealthy obsession with healthy eating"" (9), Pollan gives us precious little evidence that we've actually been following the official dietary advice. Indeed, a reader of the various guidelines would see that falling prey to the food marketers often meant going against the science-based dietary advice. For instance, the second edition of the 1977 Dietary Goals for the United States, one of the main sets of guidelines which Pollan criticizes, included warnings against overeating and recommended a decrease in consumption of both fats and refined sugars. So while the sugary SnackWell's cookies might have helped to reduce fat intake, the dietary guidelines were hardly an invitation to eat them without restraint.It should thus be no surprise that in his quest to fault science-based nutritional advice for our public health crisis, Pollan often misleads readers about what the dietary guidelines actually said. He tells us, for instance, that a literature review ""found 'some evidence' that replacing fats in the diet with carbohydrates (as official dietary advice has urged us to do since the 1970s) will lead to weight gain"" (45). It sounds pretty damning, at least until you look at the actual paper, which, in fact, reported ""some evidence"" that replacing dietary fats with refined carbohydrates leads to weight gain. Pollan, of course, had a very good reason to leave out the extra word: that little bit in parentheses would have been false if he'd included it. The government recommendations never urged Americans to replace dietary fats with refined carbohydrates. Truth be told, the official dietary advice could have done better here, but a reader of the recommendations would see encouragements to decrease our consumption of a major class of refined carbohydrate (sugars) and to eat more unrefined carbohydrates in the form of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.But some falsehoods can't be made to look true just by neatly hiding the pesky details behind a missing adjective, and Pollan's book contains some of these ideas, too. Indeed, the notion that nutritional scientists study nutrients to the exclusion of foods is incorrect; the ideology of nutritionism that occupies so much of Pollan's attention is a straw man. A reader might get the sense that something isn't quite right when Pollan refers to a few nutritional studies that considered whole foods. On the other hand, the reader might suppose, perhaps those studies are outliers. After all, Pollan tells us that (since 1977) the official dietary recommendations have always been expressed in terms of nutrients rather than foods. As an example, he gives us the 1982 report, Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer, in which the National Academy of Sciences ""was careful to frame its recommendations nutrient by nutrient rather than food by food, to avoid offending any powerful interests"" (25). The only problem is that it isn't true. The report contains six ""Interim Dietary Guidelines,"" only one of which was expressed in terms of nutrients, and two of which were expressed in terms of foods. (Of the remaining three, two were encouragements to keep dangerous substances out of the food supply, and one was a reminder not to drink too much.)The antidote to nutritionism, as Pollan explains, is ""to entertain seriously the proposition that processed foods of any kind are a big part of the problem"" (141) and  ""escape the Western diet"" (142) for a more traditional diet. That's a bold declaration, considering that ""processing"" in the food system includes not just things like hydrogenating vegetable oils but also everything from chopping vegetables to slaughtering animals. Pollan reasons that science has made us unhealthy by encouraging us to eat in new ways, but a traditional diet must be healthy because ""if it wasn’t a healthy regimen, the diet and the people who followed it wouldn’t still be around"" (173). Unfortunately, he thereby misses the rather important point that a diet can be unhealthy without doing away with its eaters. Pollan's line of argument would, for example, vindicate the diet of white rice that left so many with beriberi. And some day, it may well exonerate the American diet, whose worst health effects tend to show up well beyond reproductive age.For all that Pollan gets wrong, there is a grain of truth to his message. Though Pollan errs in faulting nutritional science for giving us a license to eat every high-carb, low-fat food that processors might concoct, it is true that it would be a bad idea to assume that a low-fat food is a healthy food. Pollan is probably even right that some people reached that conclusion based on their interpretations of the official dietary advice. However, the lesson to take away from this is not that we should ignore nutritional science but that when we oversimplify our decision-making processes, we leave ourselves particularly vulnerable to cheap marketing ploys. With that in mind, the solution he offers is regrettable. Rather than embracing critical thinking and careful attention to detail, Pollan gives us a few simple rules backed up by the same sort of lazy thinking that he claims to have seen in nutritional science. It should therefore be no surprise that food companies have begun to take advantage of his rules for eating, with Frito-Lay advertising that its Lay's potato chips have only ""three simple ingredients"" (less than Pollan's recommended maximum of five ingredients) and manufacturers reformulating products like Gatorade, Hunt's ketchup, and Wheat Thins to replace the taboo high-fructose corn syrup with other sugars.To be fair, a few of Pollan's rules, such as ""eat slowly...in the sense of deliberate and knowledgeable eating promoted by Slow Food"" (194) and ""plant a garden"" (197), will probably prove difficult for food companies to use for their own ends. For the most part, however, these reflect a level of privilege which many people do not have. This isn't too surprising, as Pollan makes no secret of the fact that he writes for a well-to-do audience when he declares, ""Not everyone can afford to eat high-quality food in America, and that is shameful; however, those of us who can, should"" (184). That doesn't invalidate his perspective, but there is nonetheless something a bit distasteful about a bestselling author lamenting the eating habits of people whose lives are worlds away from his own. Absent any indication of a good-faith effort to understand why people might choose to microwave frozen dinners instead of preparing a family meal from home-grown ingredients, Pollan's work seems less likely to inspire positive social change than, as Julie Guthman puts it, to appeal to ""those who already are refined eaters and want to feel ethically good about it.""Michael Pollan remarks in the introduction of In Defense of Food that had he written the book forty years earlier, it would have been received as ""the manifesto of a crackpot"" (14). In light of the superficiality of the book's merits and its loose relationship to the facts, that wouldn't have been a particularly unfair appraisal. Alas, in the time since the work's publication in 2008, our collective judgment has proven decidedly less sound. Thanks to its engaging style and appealing commonsense message, In Defense of Food has become required reading for thousands of college students, and its author now stands at the helm of a respected social movement. With the alarming rise in diet-related disease, the time was indeed ripe for someone to fill that leading role. It's just too bad that it was somebody who mostly gives us the same kind of simplistic solutions and sloppy reasoning that helped to create the problem in the first place."
14,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1344382-patadave,4,"I’m a huge fan of Michael Pollan’s Omnivore’s Dilemma, (see review here) but only a big fan of In Defense of Food. The first two sections of Defense, “The Age of Nutritionism,” and “The Western Diet and Diseases of Civilization” fit perfectly with Omnivore’s posture of investigative journalism. While Omnivore included Pollan as a character, it came across as a non-biased, or relatively low-biased, intro to the foodstuffs served across America. The first two sections of Defense adhere to this even-handed journalistic method, but the final section, “Getting Over Nutritionism,” slips into more assertion and weaker argument and investigation.Pollan is upfront about the final third of this book. He refers to his suggestions as “eating algorithms.” He doesn’t recommend what you should eat, but what you should think about before you eat. Mostly I agree with him, but there are few people in the United States who can live, and eat, the way Michael Pollan does. Lesisurely dinners prepared from foods out of your home-grown garden sounds like a great way to live, but re-arranging one’s life to create space to eat well may be impossible for most.That said, there’s still a bushel of great advice in this book. Even if you can’t afford the time to grow your own garden, or eat every lunch gathered with friends and family, you will at least come away with an understanding of why eating anything that says “low-carb,” “low-fat,” “enriched,” or “fortified” is probably a bad idea.In Omnivore Pollan researched where our food comes from. In Defense his research starts with asking why we think about food the way we do. Why are Americans obsessed with cholestrol, trans-fat, omega-3, and omega-6? What do nutrients have to do with food?Pollan pulls together several threads that brought us to the nutrient-obsessed culture we have today. Three of these threads are lobbyists, scientists, and nutritionists. Together this triumvirate has eradicated any common sense about food that might have once been found in this nation. That this is a particularly national problem is very much a part of Pollan’s argument. Other cultures have long histories that have allowed them to create food cultures promote health. The French paradox ceases to be a paradox when you consider the culture that surrounds eating, and the hundreds of generations that have contributed to creating foods, and ways of eating, that combine in healthful ways.Not only is the United States, a melange of many cultures, lacking this kind of food tradition, but it also suffers from a technophilia that rose to dominance in the 20th century and made it seem like science could solve every problem. Chemists began analyzing food to see what made it tick, and nutritionists began promoting these ingredients/nutrients as ways of achieving health. If Wonder Bread can be enriched what does it matter that it’s made out of processed flour and a little extra sweetener? A lot, according to Pollan.When early nutritionism didn’t really work as advertised nutritionists did more research and uncovered micronutrients. Once micro-nutrients were discovered, they argued that now food chemists could mix and match ingredients to promote perfect health. Unfortunately, it seems like everytime a nutrient was thought to help or hurt later research overturned these findings. Pollan argues that this rises out of the simplified way of doing research. While nutritional research may be correct for a single ingredient it couldn’t predict how the ingredients all worked together in the food, or in relation to a human body. Food, and our relationship with food, is far too complex to be reduced to a simple formula.Pollan’s argument persuaded me. Especially reading the two books in conjunction.One of the pleasant things about reading Pollan is that he doesn’t take the tone of a scolding moralist in his writing. There is no right answer or rigid formula you must follow to health, only some thoughtfully considered common sense which he sums up in the opening of the book. “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” The rest of the book explains why the American diet is not really food, but food-like products, and why Americans continue to eat long after they’ve consumed more than enough to meet their nutritional needs.Pollan’s perfect world of eating that he tries to conjure up in the last third of the book will probably never make it into most people’s daily lives. But, that shouldn’t stop anyone from striving. Even if you’re not eating green beans out of your own garden, you can still eat more fruit and vegetables and less meat. There are common-sense strategies for eating that seem to have been forgotten. In Defense of Food is a great reminder that food should lead to health, not type-2 diabetes."
15,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun,2,"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. Certainly good advice, but unfortunately, Michael Pollan should have stopped there.Ugh...what a huge disappointment. This is a perfect example of why journalists should not give nutritional advice or write these kinds of books.Pollan starts out by stating the obvious, but then quickly learns what many nutritional professionals and public health advocates do, the obvious isn't sexy and it certainly doesn't make a bestseller. As a result the chapters that follow his iconic slogan are little more than poppy-cock for the masses.I'm going to break this review down by sections, because in fairness, some were better than others.Section I: The Age of Nutritionism - 1 starI guess the first step in any straw man argument is to give it a name, in this case nutritionism. The problem is like others before him, he argues against an opponent that never existed. According to Pollan a bunch of questionable studies led some incompetent (if well-meaning) scientists to determine that saturated fat was bad. As a result the government developed anti-fat nutritional guidelines that the public embraced wholeheartedly, but that ultimately made them unhealthier.He repeatedly points to these ""nutritionists"" (which he somehow lumps in with greedy capitalists and which almost feels like a derogatory label the way he uses it) that misled the public with their ""junk science"" and continue to do us all an injustice in their efforts to further our understanding of the nutritional sciences.Interestingly, I happened to be a college student in the eighties studying, of all things, Nutritional Sciences (and while I usually avoid reading these types of books). As such I can tell you that his characterizations are incorrect and best and dishonest at worst. In the late seventies and early eighties there was a push toward limiting fats to 30 percent of total calories. It was further recommended that less than 10 percent of total calories should come from saturated fats based on the belief that it was related to CHD. The merits of this recommendation have since come under fire and has spurred more research...because after all that is what science demands (that it constantly improves upon itself). But the important part of the discussion that is left out is that this was only one small part of the guidelines. The USDA also recommended that of the carbs ingested at least half those should be from complex carbs and not from processed sources. And they didn't stop there. They recommended eating one serving of fish at least two times a week. They recommended eating 2-3 servings each of fruits and veggies daily. They recommended limiting salt intake to under 2300 milligrams. They recommended eating a diversity of food. They recommended eating foods high in fiber. They recommended limiting sweets. Okay...so you get where I'm going with this.However, as is so often the case, capitalists saw an opportunity and the food companies began a massive anti-fat campaign that would help to distort certain aspects of the USDA recommendations to the point that low-fat became the most important aspect of a healthy diet. Of course, even Pollan admits that people didn't cut out fat, they simply ate more low-fat foods in addition to the fat they were already consuming. Mostly ultra-processed foods whose fat had been replaced with sugar and salt. Bottom line, people didn't get fat because they followed the USDA dietary guidelines of the eighties which by the way with the exception of a few tweaks based on additional research and changing needs of society (and saturated fat has still not been completely vindicated), the recommendations have not changed significantly. People got fat because they became ultra-consumers of the cheap and easy...just like they have become ultra-consumers of cheap and easy everything from clothes, to shoes, to electronics, to home décor. The West is a culture of excess everything.Pollan further contends that ""nutritionists,"" which by the way is a poorly defined and meaningless term then and now so I'm not exactly sure who he is referring to, were obsessed with isolating nutrients...again, totally not true. In fact, the food pyramid, despite its flaws, was designed to encourage consumption of a wide range of foods to ensure that Americans ingested a diversity of nutrients. Vitamin supplements were also discouraged and seen as inferior to eating real food as nutritional scientists and dieticians have always acknowledged and appreciated the symbiotic relationship of various nutrients within food as well as those that exist between various foods in the diet. Pollan then blasts the science itself, pointing out all the shortcomings innate in nutritional research, shortcomings that those who actually study nutrition appreciated long before Pollan pointed it out. But just because something is difficult to study doesn't mean we shouldn't try. It also doesn't necessarily invalidate the research. Ironically, Pollan himself has no problem citing these flawed studies later on in support of points he is trying to make. And again, Pollan's misrepresentation is huge. Anyone who attempts to study nutrition understands the difficultly in isolating the effect of any one nutrient. And yet we somehow know more now than we did say 50 years ago. The fact that we aren't any healthier as a nation isn't necessarily a reflection of what we know or don't know. Using Pollan's own argument trying to tease out all the cofounding factors is futile. He seems to suggest that our anti-fat campaign, which led to an increase in the amount of highly processed carbs being eaten is responsible for the rise in obesity and diseases like diabetes...and he may be right...or partially right...or completely wrong. It is widely accepted that the obesity epidemic is probably the result of several cofounding factors.Anyway, I cringed reading this first section. I expected so much more from Pollan. Ironically, despite disagreeing with his characterizations and the logic employed, I agree with a number of his conclusions. In short, I agree that we need to look at foods as greater than the sum of their parts. I also agree that science can have limitations and can be flawed. In that sense, a recommendation is just that a best guess based on what we think we know at any given point and people need to understand this.Section II: The Western Diet and the Disease of  - 3 starsI felt this was the strongest of the three sections. Whatever the culprit, it does appear that the Western Diet contributes to poor health outcomes.Pollan makes some good points about the food chain and our interconnectedness with our environment. Ironically, the most recent panel of experts that propose changes to the USDA guidelines for the first time ever suggested that the new revised guidelines should take into consideration not only the internal impact of our eating habits but also the external factors. To Pollan's credit, I think his efforts have played a crucial role in this type of thinking.His argument for whole foods is sound. If the nutritional research to date seems to agree on anything it is that whole unprocessed foods are generally superior. His argument from quality to quantity also has some merit, though I think there is still some debate about the significance. For example, there are several studies (probably flawed if you bought into section one of Pollan's book) that suggest industrially produced produce is lower in nutrition than its locally grown, organic counterpart. However, the relevance of this in a society where our food options are endless is debatable as it may be a non-factor. The reality is in the US we have access to superior nutrition. We might not always make the right choices, but given a little vigilance 99.5% of us should be able to meet our nutritional needs even if the products we are eating are nutritionally inferior, not organic, and purchased from the grocery store. The whole omega-3 section is a little weak. He spends the entire first third of the book telling us why these nutritional studies are flawed and can't be trusted and why we should not be isolating nutrients and then seems to put the omega-3s on some sort of nutritional pedestal, repeatedly referencing the science to make his case. Section III: Getting Over Nutritionism - 2 starsWhile I applaud and agree with many of Pollan's recommendations, I have a feeling they were recommendations that could only be made by a man in his unique position. Unfortunately, I think many of Pollan's ideas are shortsighted and impractical for the average family. They look good on paper but are too idealistic as to really make a difference.Pollan's plan to buy local in season produce, to cook more and eat together paints a nostalgic picture that panders to our natural bias. But really...Seriously. I see how the average American eats and it isn't pretty. And I know from talking to them that most of them want to do better. But they are struggling to meet the demands of their job and family. They need real world solutions for their world and while some of Pollan's suggestions may be helpful most don't even come close to reaching the people who need his help the most.At one point Pollan claims that you wouldn't be reading this book if you already got it...but I would argue he's wrong. This book most certainly speaks to the people who already get ""it,"" but offers little for the people who really, really need it. In fact, I would be willing to bet that the majority of people who bought this book are college educated, or at least educated, do not have diabetes, don't regularly eat at McDonalds, and aren't obese. And if you are, I'm not sure this book offers substantially more than the government's nutritional guidelines he was so quick to criticize. So by all means...Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. As far as the book...if you already get it and are interested in reinforcing your commitment to eating healthy, then maybe this is worth your time. If you're currently struggling and looking for real life strategies to overcome obstacles, go somewhere else.I should add, despite not ""loving"" this book, I am a fan of Pollan and what he is trying to do. His common sense approach to diet is admirable and I think he has done a lot of good and reached a lot of people."
16,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/769376-spencer,5,"Thanks for the reminder to update, Ethan!This book was really eye opening. I think (or thought) of myself as having a pretty healthy diet-- I have the whole wheat blend flaxseed enhanced pasta, the total cereal with nonfat soy milk, the bran muffins and the fish oil capsules.I AM A DUPE! I've been sucked into the cult of ""nutritionism"" as Pollans calls it, the belief that what's healthy about the food are the identified micronutrients it contains, and that foods are either healthful elixers or near poisons, depending on whether or not they contain the nutritional demon of the moment (once this was saturated fat, now it's trans fats). I was a believer in progress-- I regularly two-fist diet coke and tasti-d-lite, drink the vitamin water and snack on the bars-- the luna, the balance, the zone. Yes, I notice that the more we Americans seem to discover about the inner workings of food, the fatter and sicker we seem to become, but I figured that was just because we don't know how to control ourselves and we, as a culture, drive everywhere.Pollans' theory is so simple, so obvious, it makes me kind of angry I didn't notice it before. Scientists obviously don't know a lot about the inner workings of food-- nutrition is a new science, and we've witnessed such faddish changes in its fundamental precepts (margarine is better for you! antioxidants will prevent cancer! carbs are the cornerstone of a healthy diet! carbs are SATAN!) we should already be skeptical of its claims. We know so little about how food really works in the body that it's preposterous to think that we could reengineer it better than nature could. Even the produce we grow-- so carefully engineered to produce high yields and easily transportable produce, has fewer nutrients than the same food did in the 1940s. The modern, largely refined and processed, ""western diet"" is lethal, fattening, and leads to chronic diseases unknown in societies that eat much simpler, traditional foodstuffs. If we're so good at food science, how come we're so much worse off?So he advises us to eat food (as in, something our great grandmothers would recognize as such-- not, in his example, a ""go-gurt"" squeezable yogurt tube), not too much, and mostly plants. This is enormously freeing. Until you try to avoid eating processed foods, in which case it also becomes enormously challenging. And time consuming, and expensive.But if you can do it, it's worth it. He doesn't promise a panacea, and his recommendations don't make any health claims. That's the point. There is a mystery to the foods themselves-- how they have evolved to satisfy and sustain us-- and an art to bringing that food forth from the earth. This book is a reminder of what nutritionism taught us to forget."
17,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5405898-patrice-hoffman,3,"I'm not sure I need to review Michael Pollan's In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto. Chances are the person who bought this book is looking to find out what about food needs defending. It appears everything. I came across this book because of my Sociology class in explaining how the economy and current food structures continue to lead to systematic oppression or maintain an the imbalance of wealth, inequality in this country. Firstly, in reference to defending food, it is actual food that needs defending without a doubt. Our society has turned into one that has placed a greater emphasis on eating the right nutrients (see nutritionism science) rather than the right foods. Foods that haven't been refined or been made into food-like substances that are packaged with the fad labels of the time, tightly wrapped in sugar... or sugar-like substances. What can be appreciated is the amount of insight that has gone into Pollan's case for food. He could have saved us 200 pages if he simply said eat food, real food, food that is grown on a farm, and not fed to us to support the capitalistic beast. These foods that were made to suppress the bodies natural defense in being full, rather cause us to have an insatiable appetite. Instead, Pollan goes into how the Western diet has changed over time and a few of the contributing factors such as the government thinking they know best what we should eat after having spoken with someone greasing their wheels.Anyway, In Defense of Food is a firm 3-star rating for me simply because it gets a little repetitive and boring. Had I chose this to read on my own instead of as an assignment, there's a good chance I would not have finished it. Michael Pollan had already provided more than enough reason to trade my nutragrain bar for an apple or banana... which reminds me. Our current farming methods makes it so even those foods aren't half as good as they used to be. READ HIS BOOK TO FIND OUT WHY!!! "
18,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/208829-andy,3,"**My full review is posted on my blog at: http://citingthetext.blogspot.com Michael Pollan summarizes his latest book, published January 2008, on the cover and in just seven words: ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" He admits on the very first page that he has pretty much ""given the game away"" with that summary, but that he plans to complicate matters a bit in the interest of ""keeping things going for a couple hundred more pages."" Since I began the book at the start of a four hour bus ride, I chose to oblige him and see what could possibly so complicated about such simple commands.I came to realize two things by the time I got about halfway through the book - which, ironically, was about the same time that the bus stopped at a Burger King. The first was that there was much more to the book than simple recommendations; the second was that those seven words were not so simple after all.Take, for example, the first two words of Pollan's credo: Eat food. Not so hard, you say. False. By Pollan's definition, much of the offerings in an average grocery story are not in fact ""food"" but rather ""edible food-like substances.""To understand this difference, Pollan sprinkles much of the first half of the book with discussions of the past hundred years of nutrition ""science"" and why it's really not so scientific. Anyone who pays attention to the constant and conflicting admonitions about the latest nutrients that are both good for you and could possibly kill you will already be convinced of many of Pollan's arguments here. He goes on to elaborate, however, citing the focus on individual nutrients as one major reason why these studies are so flawed. This is one area where reductionist science just seems to fail entirely. In many cases it is nearly impossible to separate the effects of a single nutrient on a person's well being from the rest of their diet and overall lifestyle.Studies nevertheless attempt to drill down to this level, for two reasons: the prevalence of reductionist thinking in other academic fields and the fact that, politically, it's a lot easier to tell people to eat less or more of an individual nutrient or compound (trans fat, e.g) than it is to recommend that they eat less of a food, since the food has lobbyists on K Street in Washington. Nutrients, with the exception of sucrose, tend not to be so well represented.Pollan then moves into his recommendations for what an average person can do to eat well without buying land and learning to farm for all of their needs. Many of these recommendations are easy to follow (I managed to resist the deep-fried mozzarella sticks at Burger King, but that wasn't just because Pollan would classify them as ""food-like substances""), but some are a bit trickier. It takes some real discipline to devote more of your day to preparing and cleaning up after meals - I can almost guarantee that I won't be enacting this one, or doing much preparing of meals at all, as long as I am on this same project and without someone to cook with for three-four nights a week.I will, however, be changing some choices when it comes to the meals that I do eat out - even eating out has a whole new feel to it after reading this book. My perspective now is that it's an opportunity to seize: here are people who are willing to prepare lots of delicious options for you, many of which contain loads and loads of fresh fruits and vegetables, all in a portion that is more or less perfectly suited to your needs without having to worry about buying too many veggies and watching them go bad.The one negative that I identified in Pollan's recommendations was the fact that they seemed to be geared toward people who lived more or less inactive lifestyles. Many of the potential problems from diet go away if you just exercise a few times a week - if you're really concerned about your health but are not willing to take that simple next step - it seems as though you could pour endless hours into researching, purchasing, and preparing foods and are very healthful (Pollan mentions a word to describe this situation - ""orthorexia,"" or an obsession with eating right, a disease still awaiting official confirmation) and only be fighting less than half of the battle."

20,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957217-laurel,5,"""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.""Those are the first sentences of Michael Pollan's delightful little book In Defense of Food. In fact, as Pollan himself admits, there's not much more to it than that. So, how to fill up a whole book when those three first sentences tell it all?Well, as simple as that advice seems, the first sentence is more complicated than it may appear. Eat food. Sure. Of course. What else would we eat? But as we all know and often try not to think too much about -- what is labeled as ""food"" these days isn't often really food. It is processed food stripped of everything that once made it food, and then ""fortified"" with the vitamins and minerals it was stripped of, and loaded with various non-food items such as high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, and a multitude of non-pronounceable mystery ingredients. As just one example, Pollan lists the ingredients of Sara Lee's ""whole wheat white bread"" which in and of it self seems to be an oxymoron. How can white bread be whole wheat? As Pollan rattles off the makings of this mystery bread, you can't help but laugh. Instead of the basics of any ""real"" bread (yeast, flour, water and salt), Sara Lee's version instead has over 32 ingredients, with only about 4 that one can recognize as actual food items.Pollan points out that, though we may be the most evolved and intelligent of all the species on the planet, we are also the only species that require food charts, diagrams, pyramids and a panel of ""experts"" to tell us what to eat. He goes through the history of all these ""expert"" recommendations, much of which seems to change with each year. First margarine would save us all from heart disease. Then... oops... turns out margarine actually significantly increases our chances of getting heart disease. First low fat food will help you lose weight. Then... oops... looks like it's the carbs that might be making you fat. But hold on....some carbs are actually good, it's the simple ones that are bad. And about all those different fats....What are we to do with all this conflicting and changing information?Pollan suggests a diet of fruits and vegetables, meat that is 100% grass fed, and anything that is genuinely real food. As a guide, he recommends avoiding anything that has more than a handful of ingredients (especially if you can't pronounce any of those ingredients). Shopping at a farmer's markets is always a good idea as well. He also suggests that you pretend you are grocery shopping with your great grandmother. If you pick up something that Grandma would see and say ""What the heck is THAT?"" then it's probably not real food and should stay on the shelf. After all, it has a long shelf life anyway, and could stay there for years and years without going bad. So there's no real rush to put it in your cart anyway. :)Did Pollan only cite research studies that support his biases? Probably. In fact, I'm sure he did. There's so much conflicting info out there, that you can find research to support virtually any nutritional leaning you want these days. But I happened to agree with many of the points Pollan makes, so I didn't mind the bias. :) I found In Defense of Food to be informative, educational and surprisingly funny. I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in nutrition. Or anyone who eats. "
21,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"A well-written book that was also perfectly narrated by Scott Brick. And, I can think of no more succinct summation than that which my sister-in-law typed to me ""The Carrot> carotene."" Pollan makes an excellent argument that food science is really in its infancy (and much more complex than *I* ever gave it credit for) but that what we need to focus on the whole food- a balanced, traditional meal, rather than worry about hitting our macro-nutrients each dayThis book didn’t tell me anything that I didn’t expect to hear, and yet, it was still pretty disgusting to read all the ways in which food companies are actively trying to present you with anything other than actual food. It like in Neil Gaiman’s Good Omens when one of the four horsemen, Famine, is found to be doing VERY well for himself by managing a fast food chain and also a dieting cult in modern America. Nailed that one on the head.What I found particularly refreshing about Pollan’s take is that he views food through a cultural lens to really display how Americans (and everyone catching up) have a really perverted relationship with the food that hinders us from moving beyond this sick yo-yo’ing we do with our health and our weight. The French were shown a picture of chocolate cake and asked to do word association, predominantly they said “celebration.” What did Americans say? “Guilt.” This relationship to a small indulgence just sets us up for failure- if you feel guilt you are going to lie to yourself, and probably over eat because “you are already being naughty.” Our food isn’t here to punish us, it’s the building blocks of our existence and its time to center more of our lives around it… and that also means we probably have to slow down elsewhere. It’s not easy, even Pollan says that, with two working parents, no one has time to make their own pasta noodles, or put up pounds of homegrown produce, but if we do agree to slow down, and maybe make time for those family-centered, traditional things, what would be the downside? Wouldn’t that be better?In the end Pollan lays down 7 or so rules that expand on his initial rule of “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” They talk about actually sitting down and eating with others, becoming in tune with your own body, and understanding on a cultural level what you are eating. Did you make it? Would grandma recognize it?To that I want to add one additional, and I think it builds directly on what Pollan has said, and it’s a “dieting” rule that I have had for a long time even when I was trying to cut calories- ANY food made with love, is diet-friendly. I used to say “If Granny baked it, its lowcal” because we should express our gratitude for the things that others have invested their energy and care into. Eat these treats from our mothers and grandmothers while we are lucky enough to have them, and don’t groan over the calories while you are eating them. Savor each bite, chew 25 times, and if you are properly relishing something, and also taking the time to listen to your body, it will let you know when it’s time to be done."

I don't think there was much in it that I didn't already know or that was surprising to hear, but it was still interesting and made sense. I know my current diet isn't my best and I can certainly feel a difference when I'm eating well versus eating whatever is available or quick. This book certainly made me think that it's time to get back to eating basics. I think this book is worth a read. It's not groundbreaking, but it will reinforce what you already know (some of you deep down). I plan to read it again some time when I can take my time and process it as I go. "
23,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/258790-rebecca,4,"I'm suspicious of my motivation to read this book. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with wanting to be congratulated on my eating habits. Well, having now finished it, I'm mostly right about that. Congratulations, self. But I also learned a lot, particularly a theory about how Americans think about food that seems utterly true for the majority of my friends and family. Which is that people don't think, ""Hey, I'm eating a banana, yum!"" they think, ""Whoa, too much sugar, not enough protein, no thanks."" Which is fucked up. These people that I know mostly admit that they have food issues, and, yes, they do. This is a part of it. If you say no thanks to real food, like popcorn with butter and salt, baked potatoes, greens with bacon, bananas, tequila and lime juice, ice cream, whatever, and instead think that you are doing yourself a big favor by eating products, like low-fat puffed corn product with added Omega-3s and fake cheese flavor, diet vitamin drinks, low carb bagels, multivitamin cereal, drink mix with Splenda and organic Oreos, yikes. And yet this describes most of the people I know. One of the things I learned is that American spend a lower percentage of their income on food than anyone else. Low cost, low quality, but a whole lot of it. Which strikes me as connected to a larger problem--low cost stuff, and a whole lot of it. Let's spend money on amassing a huge amount of low quality foods and low quality crap for our house. Which leads to problems like ""I have way too much junk in my house so I need a professional to help me organize it and clean it out"" and also ""I have way too much body weight so I need..."" This poor spending of money creates all kinds of business opportunities.So: less, but higher quality. One theory is that this is inherently elitist because poor people can't spend more money or time on food. Which is impossible for me to buy, since I happen to know many non-rich recent immigrants who work full time, go to school full time, and still cook for themselves and their families. And there are millions of extremely poor non-Americans who find the time to prepare way better food that what we have. My great-grandmother raised 10 kids (seriously) on her very low wages, and she could feed them all on a head of cabbage, some chicken fat, and a couple cups of flour. That is almost certainly healthier, more delicious, and better for the environment than what most people are eating now. But, here I am, the choir. My few idiotic attempts to talk about this with non-choir friends and family have led to anger and irritation on their part, frustration on mine. People seriously dislike change, even when they know that it's better for their health, their kids' health, and the environment, not to mention way more delicious. Do I worry about their health? Yes. It's like watching them all smoke a pack a day. "
24,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,4,"This book really changed the way I look at food and will certainly lead to changes in my eating habits. I didn't want to ruin life for my older self (as I found out, almost all most serious western diseases can be attributed to mostly nutrition) so I resolved to drill down into nutrition science over the last few weeks in an attempt to identify a healthy diet. I've skimmed several books, read a number of articles, a few papers, blogs and so on, but it was all a trip down the rabbit hole of complexity that is the human body and its interaction with digested food. I was exhausted and become more confused than certain about anything as I read about all the conflicting diets out there and all the evidence supporting or conflicting all of them. What a mess.I was about to give up in confusion when a friend recommended this book to me. I come from a scientific background, so when I am faced with a problem (such as nutrition) I have a sudden impulse to right away try to drill down into details: of all components of a human body, the nutrients in foods, studies that show how they behave and interact in the body, etc. This book champions an approach that I ordinarily look down on, but it does a great job of convincing the reader that it is the best approach we have at the moment. Mainly, it argues that we should keep it simple, look at the few uncontroversial nutrition facts we have established, consider some history, and apply some common sense.In short, this book is the most honest, balanced and frank attempt I've seen so far to exploring the problem of healthy nutrition and by the end the conclusions seem clear. Warmly recommended!"
25,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89796323-viktoria-tomcheva,5,"Buy this book, learn it, live it, tell your loved ones.Pollan summarizes his advice in 7 words: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. “Eat food” turns out to be more complicated than it seems. Most of the “food” eaten in the Western Diet is processed food, junk that Pollan deems unworthy of the moniker “food” and calls “edible food-like substances” instead.Real food would be recognized by your great-grandmother and can rot. Processed food is easy to spot because it is “loud” due to TV ads and screaming health claims like REDUCED FAT or LESS SODIUM.Pollan argues that quieter food is healthier and sums this up in his usual creative way: “If it came from a plant, eat it. If it was made in a plant, don’t.” This is one of his many Food Rules, a list of pithy recommendations that he reveals throughout the documentary. The narrative moves at a rapid clip, sliding from topic to topic, occasionally diving in political waters like when he advocates for a beverage tax as a means to reduce sugar intake. He also addresses psychological issues that lead to overeating and offers simple suggestions like using smaller plates, eating slower, and serving vegetables first.As in most health documentaries, he recommends a predominantly plant-based diet but doesn’t suggest that you stop eating meat entirely but rather consider meat a “flavoring or special occasion food.” The most inventive concept is his discussion of Nutritionism, which Pollan defines as nutrition complicated into an ideology. He explains that so-called food experts redefine food as a collection of nutrients and have historically made faulty assumptions that contradict previously held ideas. The consequences of this over complication of nutrition is contradicting health claims that have led to a decline in health, the opposite of what it was meant to do.This may be his most controversial contention since he leaps to the opposite extreme by suggesting that nutrients are unimportant. Still, he makes a relevant point in calling out the preoccupations of nutrients over actual food endemic to the many ineffective fad diets (Atkins, South Beach, Ornish, Pritikin, etc.) Nutrients are important, they just shouldn’t be a substitute for eating real food.In his most effective segment, Pollan exposes how processing food takes out naturally occurring nutrients and vitamins. Food companies have reacted to pseudo-scientific Nutritionism by using marketing strategies that tweak nutrients. They enrich processed food with vitamins or artificially adjust nutrient content (hence the REDUCED FAT or LESS SODIUM above) to make unhealthy processed foods sound healthy.This convoluted reasoning is why many people believe that sugary drinks like Gatorade or VitaminWater are actually good for you. The government, in turn, has subsidized processed food ingredients like high fructose corn syrup and hydrolyzed soy protein to create an inexpensive “calorie conveyor belt” that fuels the obesity epidemic.Practically every health documentary has identified the same problem, but Pollen makes a compelling and quite sensible case as to how we got here. In my experience, many people think they are eating healthy foods when they are not and become frustrated when they continue to gain weight or find their blood sugar and cholesterol have worsened despite their efforts. I do what I can during a 15-minute office visit to challenge a lifetime of misinformation that has led to poor food choices, but this nearly 2-hour documentary does a more exhaustive job. I highly recommend it. No insurance or co-pay required.Pollen’s thesis is that we have been devaluing real food with disastrous results for our health and our happiness. His food rules offer reasonable suggestions for how to shift into a healthier diet. For individuals with obesity-related disease who are not ready to commit to a strict vegetarian or vegan diet, this documentary offers a moderate course towards healthier eating.Biggest criticism: Pollen never bothers to match any of the health claims in this documentary with an actual source. I suspect the book version does cite sources, but the documentary just expects you to take his word for everything he says. That doesn’t work for me, even when I agree with him.Best quote: “We’re eating fat on fat on fat on sugar on fat, sugar, and salt.” – Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler, describing Buffalo wings. The full quote is worth reading:“Take Buffalo wings. What are they? You start off with the fatty part of the chicken, usually fried in the manufacturing plant first. That pushes a lot of fat into that chicken wing. Fried usually again in the restaurant – that pushes more fat into that wing. Then red sauce, what is it? Sugar and salt. Then white creamy sauce on the side. That’s sugar and salt. What are we eating? We’re eating fat on fat on fat on sugar on fat, sugar, and salt.”Eew. I can feel my arteries clogging just thinking about it."

While I haven't read anything about perky single British chicks trying to make it on their own and find love in the big city or perky single British vampire chicks trying to fight crime and find love in the big city, this book by Michael Pollen about nutrition and eating well does signal a bit of a departure for me.Pollen's manifesto here isn't actually that much about nutrition, though. His specific advice about what to eat doesn't get much more specific than what he presents as both his ""eater's manifesto"" and his seven word summary of the whole book: ""Eat food, not to much, mostly plants."" The rest is just elaboration.The elaboration starts with Pollen's differentiating ""food"" from ""non-food."" He does this mainly by railing against what he calls ""nutritionism,"" which is the recent trend where food scientists (and food marketing professionals) focus on the nutritional content of food rather than whole foods. A lot of this has its genesis from when the U.S. government wanted to recommend eating less meat and dairy, but the lobby groups from those industries had a Class A freakout and through political pressures got the recommendations changed to focus more on nutrients rather than foods. So ""Eat less meat and dairy"" got malformed into ""Choose lean protein sources like fish, chicken, and fat-free dairy products.""This is bad, Pollen argues, because scientists and policy makers don't know that much about how the individual nutrients behave outside of their complex, whole food systems. And, worse, they're sometimes wrong in entirely harmful ways. Think margarine here. This whole nutrient obsession has also created bizarre creations like low carb pasta (what?), fat-free half-and-half (what IS one of the halves, then?), and other culinary impossibilities. Pollen goes into detail about why such concoctions are not ""food"" per se, but ""food products"" and generally bad for you. His advice is generally to avoid anything that your great-grandmother wouldn't recognize as food, especially if it tries to make health claims. Replace that stuff with whole foods, especially plants and especially the leafy greens of plants.In general, a lot of Pollen's suggestions make sense, and the book is written in an easy to read, almost conversational tone that makes it easy to (pardon the pun) digest. Some of his advice is hard to swallow (dang, another pun), like eschewing (oops, puns everywhere) anything with more than five ingredients and only buying stuff that you've either grown yourself our bought directly from a grower. Still, it's good food for thought (ah, sorry), and a lot of what he says about how senselessly the government regulates food labeling gives you plenty to chew on (dang, that one just slipped in there).

27,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"""Eat food; not too much; mostly plants"" is what consisted in Michael Pollan's Eater's Manifesto. For what he truly means, one must read the entire book. In Defense of Food, Michael Pollan tells the darkside of global food industry, the flawed nutrient studies, and the inadequate scientific understanding of nutrients. He is skeptical about ""nutritionism"", where a type food is reduced to its nutrients and nutrients are arbitrarily divided into good and bad camps. He thinks food is not equivalent to the sum of its nutrients. He also argues that not the single nutrient (fat, sugar, carbohydrates, or protein), but the Western Dietary patten that is the culprit for the ""Western diseases"", i.e. obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.Above all, he holds a holistic view of the relationship between human and the food we eat. No, he is not anti-science. The scientific reductionism still deserves its shrine in the hall of human progress albeit its flaws. Most of his views are already in sync with mine. However, to apply the manifesto costs money and time, and impossible sometimes. You do what you can: 1. Be skeptical about “food” making health claims2. Read the small labels, be educated3. Buy local (I have doubts in this one)4. Buy seasonal5. Plant food by yourself (yes, if you can make gardening your hobby)6. Invest time in preparing meals and eating meals (sigh, in the high speed, high intensity modern life?)7. Eat bigger varieties of food without increasing the total amount; no snaking"

Michael Pollan's advice, ""Eat food, mostly plants, not too much"" is just brilliant and is explained in great detail throughout the book. I knew of this saying before reading the book, but hearing the details about it made it so much more interesting and applicable.Pollan is a gifted journalist and writer who has researched a tremendous amount of information about food, the food industry, and their relationship to our health. I went into this book knowing about lot of about food and health already, but I never felt bored, I learned many new things, and I loved having all of the information complied in one place. It was great to listen to this book with my wife Krista. We had many good discussions along with way (we both feel very similarly about good food and health), and the book reinforced several things we already try to do with regards to food and meals. My 10 year old daughter Delaney also listened in and she has committed to improved eating habits for good health as a result (we now read labels and ask each other, nature or industry?)! It was fun to do this in the car together as we all traveled to and from our summer vacation.I loved the balance between scientific facts, historical events, and practical advice.

He makes a very convincing case that food science has been oversimplified into ""nutritionism"", which reduces the idea of food to its component nutrients. The problem is that we still don't know everything that food does, and cannot adequately replace it by artificial means. Even fresh food is suffering from this simplification, as the big agricultural companies use industrial fertilizers that are equivalent to junk food for plants to grow their crops. Did you know that a modern apple is has fewer measurable nutrients than an apple 50 years ago? And that some food companies think that's great, because consumers will have to buy and eat more of their food to get enough nutrition.So, what do we do about this? Fortunately, the book is not just doom and gloom about food. It presents strategies, such as shopping the outer areas of the supermarket, where the fresh food is, instead of the processed food in the middle; shopping from farmer's markets where you can find organic, locally grown food and meet the farmers that grow it, and making what we eat count through our food choices.""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants,"" is his message. A short, convincing book worth a look by everyone who cares both about their health, and our food production system."

It's the best deal I've ever gotten with food. I only hope that I can continue to give it away before it spoils. Also the last three books I've read have all been about food. And in someways -- they've merged together. Between reading these books, I search for good freezing tips and canning recipes. Basically this book allows me to believe that my insane idea to commit to a summer of locally grown sustainable food was a really good decision. When I was in Grad school, I worked full time.

Michael Pollan's succinct dietary advice is so simple it's practically insulting, but thanks to a combination of bad science and government influence, Americans are more confused than ever about how and what to eat. Our ancestors wouldn't recognize most of the ""food"" we eat today, things like refined pasta fortified with omega-3s or diet soda spiked with vitamins. By refining and processing our food and trying to add the nutrients back in, the modern food industry has introduced a bevy of chronic diseases ranging from cancer to heart disease to type 2 diabetes. Pollan makes a compelling case for doing away with the Western diet and only eating foods that your great-grandmother would recognize as such. This is, quite honestly, one of the most fascinating books I've read in a long while. It's also incredibly concise, readable, and hard to put down. "
32,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"It's possible that this book should be rated lower. I found it difficult to tell since I've read almost all of Pollan's other work at this point. Is this a rehash or an addition? In Defense of Food is maybe redundant for anyone who has already read Omnivore and maybe watched a couple online interviews with the author.The core argument here is that many people know very little about food due to nutritional science, which coopted TK (traditional knowledge) too early and was then codified into law before leaking into the bureaucracy. Here's one concise critique: ""If any of the authors of the critical review are conscious of the cosmic irony here -- that the principal contribution of thirty years of official nutritional advice has been to replace a possibly mildly unhealthy fat in our diets with a demonstrably lethal one -- they are not saying."" Pollan concludes that people should ""eat food, not too much, and mostly plants.""There's probably an easier takeaway. When we eat potato chips that contain 30% less fat, we fool ourselves into thinking we've made a health decision even though we know we're eating unhealthfully. When we pig out at a barbecue, even if the meat is 100% grass fed, organic, free range, or reinforced with vitamins, we know it's wrong to pig out. But when it comes to these ""now with vitamin D"" or ""salt reduced!"" labels, Pollan would argue that we perhaps have not even made a less unhealthy decision as so much of nutritional science seems flawed.I've read some responses to Pollan that suggest his analyses and recommendations are too easy. Even as a casual observer of this topic, I often wonder if Pollan paints with too wide a brush (though it sometimes occurs to me that it's too narrow).Regardless, I nevertheless would rate his body of work as having a greater influence on my life than almost any other author. At the end of the day, ""you are what you eat"" explains a lot about how we experience our days, something that I didn't fully realize until I began reading these books.So four stars."

Both are expert expert-bashers, though they ply their trade in contrasting styles. While Taleb is on the face and abrasive, Pollan is more subtle and gradual.In this book he attacks nutritionism-the science or rather the ideology of breaking down foods into their constituent nutrients in order to assess their benefits to the eater.It is a lamentation of how food marketing, with sufficient help from the Government and journalists, has not only robbed all the pleasure out of eating but also has made people utterly confused and anxious about the food they eat. Food has been many things to humans over the course of evolution- a great source of pleasure, something that fosters oneness within the family and community, a way of building strong and intense relationships with the natural world,even a way of expressing one's identity and spirituality.But today it has widely become just a biological necessity, a way of obtaining nutrients, something that is piled up high in supermarkets and got cheap. All of this owes greatly to the reductionist approach of what is called food science, that has been thrust onto the public by food companies, journalists and the Government. Pollan uses a series of convincing arguments that are built out of the wisdom of traditional food cultures like Asia, India, Mediterranean and several aboriginal cultures(before the west forced them out of their bushes), to showcase the horrible fallacies of nutritionism and to show that all this conventional wisdom can be distilled down into just 7 words - Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.I always find lot of things I'd never known before when I read Pollan's books, and even when he discusses topics and ideas that are familiar to me(and these are numerous too since I think a lot about food)it isn't boring due to his fantastic sense of humour which makes me chuckle and enjoy it instead of thinking come on, I know this lets move on. A great read, if you are tired of nutrition labels, food pyramids and journalist advice. Apparantly, Grandmother's advice is still the best and will continue to be."
35,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.""These cautiously conservative recommendations from this book by Michael Pollan I'm sure are good advice. Humans are descended from a long line of omnivores who found the most readily available food to be plants. Anything sweet such as ripe fruit was more rare and seasonal. With the development of hunting tools humans gained the ability to acquire meat, however the size of the human canine teeth is a good indication that humans are not true carnivores. So it is only logical and reasonable that the best human diet is one that approximates the diet upon which humans evolved.So as best as I can tell probably everything Pollan says in the book is true mostly. Yet I don't feel completely comfortable with the overall tone of the book. I think the book expresses too much glee in trashing nutritionism, processed foods, and the ""western diet."" I think the only thing wrong with those three words is that they describe systems that make sweets, salt and fat easily available to humans who evolved from ancestors who were always on the edge of starvation. In other words, I think it's possible to eat the western diet and be healthy if one doesn't eat too much and too often.So it's a matter of education and motivation which this book does a good job of providing. Do you want to be (1) fat, dumb and happy; or (2) thin, clever and wise? My tongue-in-cheek solution for motivating the masses to eat correctly is to increase the cost of all sugars by a factor of 100, increase the cost of meat and salt by a factor or 10, and keep plant based products at their present low costs. These economic changes would be sure to improve the western diet to a point where only stupid rich people would die of heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and cancer. Here I am being guilty of what I've accusing Pollan of doing; expressing too much glee in exposing common diet mistakes."
36,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27925-edan,4,"""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.""So begins In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto, Michael Pollan's informative, frightening, and ultimately inspiring new book. Pollan explores the dangers of nutritionism and traces how we became a culture of fat people eating ""Heart Healthy!"" Fritos in our cars--and/or a culture of eaters obsessed with health, and yet eating food-like substances that are in fact incredibly harmful to our bodies. He urges us to to ignore the noise of diet fads and journalists (uh, except him) and return to whole foods, prepared ourselves and enjoyed at the table with family and friends. Eating is more than just fueling the body.Since this book fell into our laps, Patrick and I have been making regular trips to the farmers market to buy not only local fruits and vegetables, but also grass-finished beef (rather than beef made from industrial feedlot cows who are forced to eat corn and pumped with antibiotics), for we're not only what we eat, but also what we eat eats. It's been a joy to discover turnips and parnips, and to experiment with various eggplants (so many sizes and shapes!), and to try a bison burger. Patrick and I have always been big cooks, and we stay away from fast food and twinkies and the like, but we have come to see that spending more time and money on food makes even more sense than we originally thought. We hope to start an herb garden soon. Yea!I gave this book only 4 instead of 5 stars because its lack of narrative made it sometimes difficult to a fiction reader like myself. I appreciated all the information, however, and don't think Pollan could write it any other way. It is a manifesto, after all!"
37,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,5,"Any eaters out there? I thought so. And probably you didn't think you needed to educate yourself about eating since you mastered it way back when you were a babe. Think again! Michael Pollan's call to the ramparts is must-read material for those wondering what the heck happened to food as our great-grandparents knew it. Yeah, SOME of it (real food, I mean) is still around, but an awful lot of the stuff we buy and ingest, in all innocence, is ""food"" that has unfortunately earned the quotation marks. Frankenfood, if you will.The book is divided into three sections: ""The Age of Nutritionism"" provides all the scientific explanations about how Big Food has sacrificed your health on the altars of mass production, chemicals, and profits; ""The Western Diet and the Diseases of Civilization"" offers ample reasons as to why the word ""die"" is in western ""diet""; and ""Getting Over Nutritionism"" sets down a list of simple actions you can take to improve your health and the world's (if not Big Food's and -- its partner in crime -- Big Pharma's). Yes, Virginia, there IS a link between these two. One begets sickness, the other produces drugs to treat those sicknesses (often unsuccessfully).What kind of advice will you come across? Things like starting a garden, avoiding foods with unpronounceable ingredients (or more than five ingredients), spending more on food (produce is pricey, but health care is pricier -- pay it now or pay it later), and eating less food while drawing the meal out into ""an event"" like many other cultures do.The book's value is priceless if you put it to good use by taking action. Try it and see."
38,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3891953-cass,5,"Just finished it. Loved it. I borrowed this copy, which is a shame as I would have highlighted it, I shall have to buy my own copy and highlight it.Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.This is the message of the book, brilliant in its simplicity. I plan to get a big poster made up and hung in the kitchen/dining area. I wholeheartedly agree with everything written.The first half of the book talks about what is wrong with our western food culture. The second half of the books discusses some loose guidelines for improving your food intake, basically expounding on the ideas of ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."".Go buy this book. Read it. Stop eating shit."
39,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,4,"I thought this book was a helpful tool to navigate through all the mixed messages sent through the media about food, although Pollan is a journalist too. :) The cover sums it up - Eat Food, Not Too Much, Mostly Plants. Most of this book was in-depth explanations of what I already know about food and eating but do not necessarily do. That is probably how most of us feel, actually. If I was going to recommend one book by Pollan, it would probably be The Omnivore's Dilemma, because I really liked its perspective and admittedly lighter focus on the details."
40,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47450180-abby,3,I would like to know what Michael eats in a given day. The highlight of this book was definitely when he said to go out into the local park and forage for wild mushrooms. To eat. 
41,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1060805-marie,3,"""In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto"" was my first taste of Michael Pollan. Pollan asserts that Americans are ""orthorexics,"" or people with an unhealthy obsession with healthy eating. Having lived in Japan and traveled frequently to the UK, I can agree with this assertion. I remember years ago when England finally got some decent coffee shops (serving real coffee), and I asked for skim milk. The barista looked at me as if I had two heads! (Things have changed since then, thanks to Starbucks.) Pollan gives us a slew of information about the science of ""nutrition,"" and the ways that government and the food industry have created and endorsed a series of ""frankenfoods"" over the years, depending on the slant of the latest health study and the deep pockets of the food and farmers' lobbies. He talks about how Americans had early interest in scientific eating, reflecting their discomfort for ""immigrant food,"" which was viewed as weird, smelly, and mixed up. Americans have always been drawn to scientific data, and we are a nation obsessed with the pursuit of perfect bodies...we jump on any bandwagon, as long as it is telling us it will help us get skinnier. As Pollan illustrates, nutritionists, the USDA, and the food industry have led down all sorts of various paths over the years, none of which has helped Americans get fitter or healthier.Reading Michael Pollan makes me feel suspicious of my nonfat milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese. How about the calcium-enriched orange juice we give to the children? Is it all bad?What I liked most about the book was the final third, in which he gives clear advice about what we should eat, and why:Eat foods. Not too much. Mostly plants.Okay, easy enough, right?Don't eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn't recognize as food.This makes total sense when considering Yoplait Gogurt, full of high-fructose corn syrup, modified corn starch, natural and artificial flavors, etc. But what about Stonyfield Farms' organic YoKids squeezers, containing organic strawberries, colored with beets, and not containing any artificial ingredients? Yes, it does have sugar. But the reality is it's healthier than Gogurt. And in a busy family, it is nice to have reasonably healthy food that can be eaten on the run.Avoid food products containing ingredients that are unfamiliar, unpronounceable, more than five in number, or that include high-fructose corn syrup.Good suggestions, although the guidance to avoid anything with more than five ingredients I will take with a grain of salt. For example, for the sake of convenience, I will continue to eat my organic boxed or canned soups, which have more than five ingredients.Avoid food products that make health claims.Pollan attacks the Food and Drug Administration and the American Heart Association for agreeing to approve or endorse products that make dubious health claims. He cites an example of the FDA approving a health claim made by the corn oil industry, along with the American Heart Association's stamp of approval on Lucky Charms, Cocoa Puffs, and Trix Cereals.Shop the peripheries of the supermarket and stay out of the middle.Some of the healthy food is in the middle of the store (for example, whole grains), and some of the unhealthy foods (like at the meat counter and dairy case) is on the periphery. In general, this is a good rule but should be applied with flexibility.Get out of the supermarket when possible.Great advice. Pollan endorses shopping at the farmers' market, buying food in season, and trying out unfamiliar foods (as happens when you subscribe to a Community-Supported Agriculture [CSA} share. ""Shake the hand that feeds you, and accountability becomes a matter of relationships instead of regulations or labeling or legal liability.""Eat mostly plants, especially leaves.For years food scientists have tried to extract the beneficial nutrients out of plants so that Americans don't need to eat so many plants. But the bottom line is that eating the plants themselves, instead of trying to get the nutrients in other ways, is the best choice. Period.You are what you eat eats too.If you choose to eat meat or fish, choose wisely. ""The diet of the animals we eat has a bearing on the nutritional quality, and healthfulness, of the food itself."" Pollan recommends seeking out meat from animals that have been fed on grass rather than seeds.If you have the space, buy a freezer.It will allow you to buy pastured meat in bulk and stock up at the farmers market when produce is in in season.Eat like an omnivore.Spice up your diet a little--try new foods. Don't stick to the same things at all times. Our diets, like our farming practices, need biodiversity to thrive.Eat well-grown food from healthy soils.It doesn't necessarily have to be organic, says Pollan. Many local farmers grow food in highly sustainable ways. Ideally, eat food that hasn't been transported miles across the country--eat organic and local.Eat wild foods when you can.Wild fish and animals are healthier than their farm-fed cousins. Be the kind of person who takes supplements.Pollan is conflicted about advising people to take a multi-vitamin. First he says that we should ""be the kind of person who would take supplements (because they tend to be healthier), and then save your money."" However, he does acknowledge the need for aging bodies to benefit from vitamins from fish oil.Eat more like the French, or the Italians, or the Japanese, or the Indians, or the Greeks.Traditional ethnic diets are more than the food itself--they also contain a cultural dimension, or how the food is eaten (for example, the French eat vastly smaller proportions than Americans do). But ""regard nontraditional foods with skepticism"" (such as soy products enhanced with ""soy protein isolate,"" ""soy isoflavones,"" and ""textured vegetable protein."" Apparently Americans now eat more soy than the Japanese or Chinese do--because the food industry injects soy into so many products. Also, ""don't look for the magic bullet in the traditional diet."" it might not necessarily be one ingredient that helps those cultures be healthier--it might be the combination of foods, or other factors. Have a glass of wine with dinner.Alcohol appears to reduce the risk of heart disease, but red wine especially appears to have unique protective properties. Drinking a little every day is better than drinking a lot on the weekends, and drinking with food is better than drinking without it. Experts recommend no more than two drinks a day for men, and one for women (otherwise you could increase your risk of cancer or other illnesses).Pay more, eat less.The cheaper the food, often the less healthy it is. Also, if you pay more, you're more likely to eat less of it. Pollan realizes that not everyone has the resources of paying more for their food...but many of us do. Especially if people examine how much they are paying for broadband, cable, and cell phones for everyone in the family.Eat meals.Sitting down together as a family. Eating the same things. Enough said? Pollan also advises doing all your eating at a table, and a desk does not count. I will take this with a grain of salt, because I eat my lunch at my desk at work. It's healthier for me to do so than to eat out every day. Don't get your fuel from the same place your car does.Gas stations sell processed, unhealthy foods. Don't buy them.Try not to eat alone.This is easy for me to do (except when I'm eating alone at my desk at lunch time), but not as easy for single people. I see his point, however. ""When we eat mindlessly and alone, we eat more.""Consult your gut.Stop eating when you are full. Or before you become full. Eat slowly.Eat with pleasure.Cook and, if you can, plant a garden.Since my husband and I embarked on implementing healthier eating habits for our family at the beginning of this year, we have eaten out less. It's much easier to eat more healthfully when you know what is going into your dishes. In particular, it's easier to feed our children healthy kids when we stay away from kids meals, which are often loaded with saturated fat and sugar, even in healthy restaurants. "
42,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11407396-srujan,4,"In a pill sized summary, the book tells us to "" Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" It opens with this and it is also all that it has to offer to us. But it ends up winding 200 pages filled with small portions of excellent food wisdom, some of which is pretty common today, and large portions of extremely boring, number crunching information, which I found so exhausting that I ended up not even bothering to fact check them: I just speed read them and moved on. I felt that what was 20, may be 40 page manifesto about eating in moderation, mostly local and vegetarian was stuffed with two beanbag worth of fillers to make it sound impactful. But those 20 pages are something that I found to a really interesting perspective on food. So hang in there for those, it was worth it.In today's age and time, an age that he calls 'An Age of Nutritionism' in the book, it is not an exaggeration that the food that is cooked in our homes needs to be defended. So the next question you would naturally ask is, ""From whom does it need to defended?"" Pollan says that it needs to be defended from the food industry on one side and the nutrition industry on the other. The food industry seems to push convenience on us, making it seems like they are here to serve at our command to make ""cooking"" nothing more than mixing a few dry and wet ingredients from jars and packets to something ""extraordinary"" without really ""slaving in the kitchen"", or without worrying about the what's and whys of tasty, appetising food. On the other hand, the nutrition industry is hellbent upon convincing us that eating by numbers and markers and portions is the only way to well being, atleast physical well being, because they certainly don't seem to be concerned about us losing our mental wellbeing as we become obsessed with counting and numbers. In other words, we must harness the science of numbers around micro and macro nutrients if we aim to feel healthy and hearty. And that is the purpose, the sole single purpose, of the act of consuming and cooking food - to fulfil these targets. It is a rat race in which your protein stats must win over your carb grams, your macros must tow the line and your micros must fulfill the requirements, or otherwise the battle is lost. They seem to thrive on making us orthorexics ( people with an unhealthy obsession with eating healthy ), like there is no middle ground, no way to do this without losing sanity.The idea that food brings a sense of community, a sense of belonging or even that it defines the threads of being a part of a family is not how discussions around food are centred. This book made me think about the filtration of habits and customs with every generation, from our grandparents to our parents to us, and wait, before you tell me about how we have no time, we all have day jobs, etc I am not talking about ""rituals"" ""rituals"" . I mean basic rules or patterns that our moms and grand moms followed in our daily routines. Like making Rajma on Saturdays or in our Gujarati homes, consuming moong in some form on every Wednesday. Consuming moong on Wednesday and feed the same to a cow is supposed to bring good fortune. That good fortune part I do not endorse, but tell me something, does following that routine does not bring you comfort? Don't you think that was a good way of maintaining diversity if pulses in our diet, and in turn, consuming a full compliment of amino acids even when on a plant based diet? Similarly, the consumption of fasting grains and root vegetables, sweet potatoes, millets, water chestnuts, Makhana, on a fixed, predetermined schedule, taught family members compliance for the sake of health, albeit disguised under religious regimens. But then it is upto us to think over the logic and reasoning in these supposedly rules and regulations. If you too find clever rationale in food practices of your region, pleased do share with me in comments.Another point that tugs at my heart is the belief that that foods are essentially the sum of their constituent nutrients. I am no expert but I sort of agree when Pollan says it is not a linear mathematical addition equation. I have nothing to show for as my credentials in the field of nutrition nor am I a scientist, but it somehow feels intuitive to me. Like how conversion of energy from one form to another ( heat to kinetic or kinetic to electric ) almost always involves a loss of energy, it is impossible to ingest x grams of a nutrient and expect that the same x grams of it is assimilated and absorbed in our bodies. If you enter x joules in a machine, the output will be x minus y joules ( the energy lost in transfer ) of energy in a different form. The same way, consuming a cocktail of nutrients in measured amounts assimilates in a myriad, complex way in our bodies. The equation has many unknown constants involved on both sides of equations and hence treating food only as a source of some number if nutrients is fallacy. Food is a tradition, food is a balm that soothes when mind and body are down and it also the primal fire that pushes us to achieve what we set our eyes on. Food gives us an identity, food traditions are a valuable inheritance. Food is also a means of expression, expression of joy, expression of sorrow, expression of pride and so much more. So, let's take a minute and look back, when was the last time you cooked to express?Another part of the book talks about who the government guidelines about food have nothing been a carousel of some abstract ideal pie divided into carbs, proteins, fibre, lipids and so on, or into food groups, like vegetables, grains, dairy and meat, depending on which industry lobbied the hardest in the last few years before the guidelines were revised. When low fat campaign was at its peak, the margarine industry made a whole lot of money before the dairy industry woke up and started lobbying harder. For a period of time, the egg was demonised until the egg producers association funded enough research to prove no connection between dietary cholesterol and the cholesterol levels in blood. These are but a few examples, I am sure there is more. When pharma companies can influence the standard set for healthy blood pressure figures or optimal blood sugar levels in medical practice, there is a lot that we don't get to see and hear. For every few basis points that these levels are reduced or altered, atleast a couple of millions more from the population come under the net of ""high blood pressure ailment"" or ""abnormally high or low sugar"" and have to start consuming medication under the advise of their medical care providers. If you can, please look up the data from last 100 years on the revision of these numbers and you will find how few people back then were prescribed medication, and how to many are prescribed today. Even ethical medical practitioners cannot do much against this kind of lobbying and the nexus between the policy makers and pharma companies. Then there is a matter of narrowing of biodiversity in food crops we grow. In America, wheat, corn and soy provide a majority of food calories, when we pick up food from departmental store aisle. Even worse, those food products look nothing like a dish made of wheat, corn and soya bean. We all know the adage, ""Shop from the aisles on the periphery of the store"" which means to avoid the processed food aisles mostly located in the bang centre of the stores in the US and the aisles that are most easily accessible. It is not that different in India either. But do we actually do it?So these are the questions that the book forced me to ponder on. Will I say that it is the only book that discusses these critical issues? No. Is it a must read? Ermm, no, if you have already read up enough in this and satisfied your thirst for perspectives on this subject, you can certainly skip this. But if you are keen and you do want to read more, take this up at leisure. Skim through the portions that get too obsessed with figures from researches and graphs and numbers. The rest of it is pretty interesting and certainly makes you rethink your priorities about food. "
43,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660832-kevin,4," Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. First line of the book, you can probably stop there if you are ready to follow that advice but if you need more convincing then this is a great read on the American diet and health.When corn oil and chips and sugary breakfast cereals can all boast being good for your heart, health claims have become hopelessly corrupt. The American Heart Association currently bestows (for a fee) its heart-healthy seal of approval on Lucky Charms, Cocoa Puffs, and Trix cereals, Yoo-hoo lite chocolate drink, and Healthy Choice’s Premium Caramel Swirl Ice Cream Sandwich—this at a time when scientists are coming to recognize that dietary sugar probably plays a more important role in heart disease than dietary fat. Meanwhile, the genuinely heart-healthy whole foods in the produce section, lacking the financial and political clout of the packaged goods a few aisles over, are mute. But don’t take the silence of the yams as a sign that they have nothing valuable to say about health. Be skeptical of manufacturers and more on point be skeptical of anything that your great grand parents didn't eat."
44,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4849771-zack,4,"This book is pretty critical of nutritional science, mostly revolving around its infancy, sharing some thought-provoking examples of missteps in overeager adoption. It makes a compelling case for considering the quality and ethics of food and food-sourcing ahead of the macro-nutritional breakdown. It's had a positive impact on my eating habits in the short term, and I'm hopeful that it will stay this way."
45,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2203551-carole,5,"I’ve been “studying” nutrition for almost ten years. All the different opinions about what we should eat and why have made my head spin. I doubted I could ever figure out what I should be eating in order to make myself truly feel well, although each one had some great ideas—But they usually came with rules that meant you had to dismiss an entire food group. In the long run, I found that unsustainable. This book finally put together all the bits and pieces for me. And it’s so simple! Eat food (whole food rather than food-like substances), not too much, mostly plants! Hooray! It’s rare that I find a non-fiction book so readable that I finish it in a day, but this one is so well-written that’s exactly what happened. I highly recommend it for others who might be confused about what to eat. "
46,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"A gratifying -- if sometimes terrifying -- book to read. It confirmed what I'd long suspected of the food industry, but it also torpedoed some of my own cherished beliefs about what is healthy or unhealthy. It also takes aim at federal regulatory agencies and organizations such as the American Heart Association. Truly, it seems we've been duped -- albeit willingly. This is a short book, and the abridged version I listened to was even shorter, but Pollan gets his point across quite succinctly. (I gather that these issues had been addressed in his previous book, The Omnivore's Dilemma). Essentially, he connects the dots for us: there's not much profit to be made from (healthy) unprocessed foods, but a great deal to be made from (unhealthy) processed ones. A huge, multi-tentacled industry has been built from selling us the latter, selling us ""food-like substances"" that have been stripped of much of their healthful qualities. All this while the food industry trumpets that their latest product has more essential nutrients or is packed with this or that vitamin du jour. However, it seems that if we want to live longer, happier lives, we need to go back to earlier models of traditional eating, and not spend every waking hour worrying about which ""nutrients"" or ""fats"" we're consuming. Pollan's analysis of how we can be both overfed and undernourished is impressive. What really hit home for me is the rise of obesity and diabetes, at a time when, ostensibly, Americans are more health conscious than ever. He's scathing in his treatment of nutritionists, and at times I felt he may have been overstating his case. But on the whole, I have to say he seemed remarkably level-headed, especially given the obvious maneuverings of the marketing and agricultural empires. It became clear to me that not only was mass-produced and distributed food generally bad for the environment, but it's bad for us as well. This book strengthened my resolution to do more vegetable gardening and buy local as much as possible. It was a much-needed reminder to be skeptical about dietary claims and health fads of all stripes.In closing, I have to mention that although I really disliked the reader for this book, Scott Brick (who narrated another book on the Great Influenza that I'd listened to this year), Pollan's writing was so focussed and interesting that I managed to completely ignore Brick's reading after an initial reaction of dismay. (""Oh no, it's HIM again!"") Thumbs up for Pollan, big thumbs down for Brick, whose ludicrously overemphasized mannerisms will grate even the most tolerant listener. "
47,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen,3,"To skip my thoughts on stuff only mildly related to this book, go straight to the capitalized lettering (or better yet, go to the publisher summary of the book):I really want to not care about this stuff. I mean, how bourgeoisie, what next the environment? cancer awareness? Shouldn't I be off helping 3rd world countries dig wells, or starting community gardens in depressed urban inner city neighborhoods? Well, I'm not. Instead I'm spending hundreds of dollars picking out (and subsequently hating) paint samples that might best suite my soon to be arriving overly priced, self-indulgent sofa. And while I'm doing that I'm listening to yet ANOTHER book that allows me to gain some more ""knowledge"" about the rudimentary elements of life that a good portion of the world does not have the time and or luxury to dwell on.OKAY: GUILT/IRONY/RIDICULOUSNESS ASIDE, HERE'S WHAT I THOUGHT OF THE BOOK:I'm not a huge NF reader, I tend to quite reading as soon as I feel (correctly or incorrectly) that I've ""gotten the point"", I may read a little further to be able to gain some incremental details that I can throw out at a family gathering just to hold my own and gain some credibility on said topic but other than that - it's back to the library for a nice graphic novel or short story. OH WAIT, I GUESS THIS IS ACTUALLY WHERE THE TALK ABOUT THE BOOK STARTS: The premise is so nicely laid out in the first paragraph, and I so agreed with it I probably would not have kept going where it not for the fact that it was an audio book and I was painting my house and wanting the comfort of another voice in the room.It was fine and he is a swell writer and all that and the refusing-to-die-grad-student in me really liked all the references to culture and food but it didn't exactly rock my world. It wasn't crazy heated like Foer's, Eating Animals and it wasn't crazy boring like, a text book - ?, His recommendations for shopping are logical and simple enough to follow if you like cooking. I guess my recommendation would be that everyone should read the first paragraph and if see if you think ""what, hey? that's some crazy shit"" then you should go on. If not, you're probably good to go unless you enjoy reading about science and history (in which case please be on my trivial pursuit team)."
48,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1048429-miriam-axel-lute,5,"So it feels a little funny to praise a book whose main recommendation is to develop eating habits that look strikingly similar either to mine or to what I'm already striving toward. But that's not at all to say that I didn't learn anything from it, or even that I didn't find myself if not identifying with, at least harboring strong veins of, the ""nutritionist"" philosophies he started off by tearing down. (I am, despite my fairly healthy eating, an inveterate supplement taker, for example.)In fact, I found the history and critique of ""nutritionism"" (basically the idea that you can look at the healthiness of food through amounts of individual nutrients, rather than whole foods or even dishes and cuisines) fascinating and compelling. The science behind the health claims in the supermarket is astoundingly bad, worse than I would have believed.I like Pollan's approach to making suggestions--irreverent, simple principles like ""Don't eat anything your great grandmother wouldn't recognize as food"" or ""Avoid foods with health claims"" or ""Avoid foods with things you can't pronounce"" or ""Eat mostly plants, especially leaves."" And I especially love that he makes a point of noting that there are lots of healthy diets--some high fat, some low, some vegan, some 100% meat and dairy (though those are mostly gone now).I do quibble with a few of his ""rules""--I know he was thinking of carrageenan and high-fructose corn syrup when he coined the great-grandmother rule, but I doubt any of my great grandmothers would have recognized some things that Pollan (and I) would other otherwise approve of--like tofu or seaweed. And I don't think abolishing snacking entirely (especially not because it's kinda wimpy--my word, his sentiment) is the right route to fewer calories, even though more mindful eating is a good goal.But these are small things in a otherwise rocking book. If you know people who keep cycling through fad diets trying desperately to lower their cholesterol or weight or blood sugar... give them this book."

The subtitle, ""Eat Food, not too much, mostly plants"" sounded like something that (as a vegan) I could get behind, even if Pollan himself isn't vegetarian. I liked ""The Botany of Desire,"" and also am liking ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" (haven't finished yet).This book is well written and contains much that I agree with. But it's not in the same category as these others because of his attitude towards science. Michael Pollan can do better.The reason for the low rating is that Pollan has essentially trashed science in favor of a vague admonition to eat foods that your great-grandmother would recognize as food. In other words, science is no help here. It's true that science is addled with ""nutritionism,"" as Pollan correctly points out, which is called ""scientific reductionism"" by T. Colin Campbell. It's also true that the studies are contradictory and often badly done. But this no reason to trash the scientific method: instead, look at the science and try to figure out what's wrong. As I read through the book, I asked myself, ""I wonder what Pollan is going to say about 'The China Study'?"" T. Colin Campbell specifically refutes one of Pollan's key contentions, about not eating too much contributing to obesity. Campbell shows that the Chinese eat substantially more calories and yet weigh less. I don't think this can all be attributed to exercise and if Pollan had bothered to read this book I think he could have seen why. Campbell also has some other points which bear on what Pollan says. Pollan has references to ""The China Study"" but these are clearly added at the behest of his fact-checker. It's clear to me that he hasn't read ""The China Study"" himself!My grandmother, Naomi Woodroof, was a food scientist. This book is an insult to the memory of my grandmother and our intelligence. Pollan's cavalier attitude towards science, in my view, negates all the positive aspects of this book. [/Rant off:]"
50,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,3,"This was The It Book in food a couple years ago, and I can see why. Its prescriptions are succinct and comprehensible, if not actually easy to follow. Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much. The ""eat food"" bit is about, y'know, food, and how much of what we eat is actually the nutritional equivalent of Styrofoam packing peanuts. It's a nice thought, and a pretty sound theory, but Pollan vastly overestimates the degree to which people below the upper middle class have access to food, as he defines it.And, well. Talking about nutrition is like talking about religion: everyone's got the one and only way to save you. And none of them are particularly credible to me. I made a deliberate choice years ago for the sake of my health -- psychological, I mean, not just physical -- to eat what I want, when I want, discussion over. My current interest in food science is first because becoming a better athlete requires more deliberation and nutritional planning on my part, and second because it's allegedly possible to treat a nebulous endocrine disorder of mine with certain dietary modifications. So I guess you could say my interest in food science is about performance -- change x and y inputs to improve a and b outputs. Digression. My point is that it doesn't matter how simple and sensible this book tries to be about food, food science is still barely past the 'world is flat' stage of development, and no one can agree even on Pollan's basic principles. Like how one of his big prescriptions is to cut out snacks and emphasize set, regular meals. Whereas speaking athletically and endocrinologically, that is the exact opposite of what the most credible research I can find says I should be doing. Many little things like that. It's not that I mind a field in flux, but I mean really, come on. It's like watching people argue over which Bible translation is the ""right"" one -- it doesn't matter how much it matters to them, or how much it might actually matter to me. The whole exercise is enough to make me say fuck it and abandon food science to its own devices."
51,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2036345-david,3,"I don't read much nonfiction. While reading this, I felt it could have been edited down to about 10 pages and I would have enjoyed it more. I realize he had to illustrate his points, but those examples of bad science or corporate dominance of the food industry were at times frustrating and weak. Using one of his examples, if I had to go out and find my own food, kill/harvest it and prepare it, I would most definitely find myself heatlthier thanks to many factors intrinsic to that overall lifestyle, including the nutritional value of the food. But I don't plan on living that lifestyle, and although that is an extreme example from aboriginal Australia to illustrate his problem with the Western diet, it also is a good example of the flaws of many of his arguments.That being said, the ""soundbites"" of the book are what I will continue to contemplate and I'm sure I will benefit from. ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."" Okay, man. I'm working on it. ""Shop in the periphery areas of the grocery store."" Check. Doing it. ""Avoid foods that make health claims."" This was the light-bulb idea that is resonating for me. I hadn't realized how many items in the market are labeled for some health benefit or other, and how few of those can be trusted. ""Get out of the supermarket whenever possible."" I'd love to, but farmers markets are neither convenient or reliable in my suburban neighborhood. Should I be burning more gasoline to reach a farmers market that only occurs once every few weeks, or should I do what I can to get my local grocer (within walking distance - and yes I do often walk there) to carry fresh and nutritious food? I think this book is an important starting point for us to begin questioning our nutritional science, our cooking, and eating habits. "
52,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/868378-lauren,3,"Michael Pollan is a purist when it comes to food, at least from his ideas in this book, and that could easily be translated as ""elitist."" In short, I didn't like this as much as Omnivore's Dilemma.For one, he berates ""nutritionism,"" which to most people would appear to say that the study of nutrition has little to no redeeming value. Acknowledging and agreeing with the limitations of such a reductionist approach to the science of nutrition, I would argue that the true field of nutrition is much more comprehensive, taking a holistic view of nutrition in terms of agriculture, food science, public health, culture, culinary practices, lifestyle factors, even history and definitely politics and governmental influence.And of course, I am a member of that true field of nutrition as a registered dietitian and foodie! O:PGranted, his overarching themes are reasonable and I agree with them, like eating more real, unprocessed food, more plant foods, and really changing the way we eat to enjoy it as a part of our culture. His finer points, however, are simply not options for the parts of the population who cannot spend the time or money required to prepare their own food from (organic/local) scratch. He seems to only espouse personal change/choice in this book, ignoring the current food system and all the other socio-economic hurdles associated with food/eating that influence those personal choices. If you put the ideas/suggestions of Omnivore's Dilemma together with the ones here, perhaps we would have a complete picture of how we got to where we are and what changes might be necessary to change it. We need to look at both sides of the supply/demand continuum to move forward (or rather, as it seems, backward) to a better food and agri-culture in America."
53,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/822729-rachel,5,"No wonder I've been so hungry. I've been starving myself with all those Fritos.I'm mostly a fiction girl who makes fun of informational books like this. In particular nutrition books, because I'm skeptical and cynical and an 80 year old trapped in a 32 year old's body. But this book won me over just in the introduction. Because along with being skeptical and cynical and 80, I'm also logical. And this books is packed with logic. It just made sense. All the science and nutrition used in the arguements seemed to be stuff that I had already known or believed - how the fact that we're not eating real food has a direct link, whether substantiated by science or not, to obesity, heart disease and diabetes. Which leads to how a country so obsessed with health and nutrition can be the most unhealthy country in the world.Pollan doesn't tell you what you should or shouldn't eat (Okay, he actually does tell you to not eat Twinkies.) This is not a diet book. Instead he gives you a few guidelines like eat real food that comes from the earth in good soil. See, doesn't that make sense? But you will be amazed the next time you go groccery shopping and have a look at the ingredients list. You can barely find bread that doesn't have unpronouncable items listed there.What I liked most is that it corrolated good eating habits with good attitudes towards food. The most striking section was when Pollan related a study done where people were shown a picture of chocolate cake and were asked to give a one word response. People in France, who love their food instead of fearing it said, ""Celebration"" while people in America said, ""Guilt."" That's very telling.Personally the word, ""Wahoo!"" came to mind when I thought of chocolate cake."
54,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1207684-bruce,4,"I find Michael Pollan’s books on food interesting to read and ponder. His writing seems honest, and he claims no more absolute authority than his well-supported convictions and opinions deserve. Each of his books builds on those that came before, and his insights develop convincingly.This present book, subtitled “An Eater’s Manifesto,” explores the uncertainties of what is called nutrition science, its continually changing recommendations and retractions, often allied and overly influenced by corporate economic interests and political forces, such that the public is flung from one extreme and one fad to another, often with adverse health consequences and with uncertainty and angst regarding diet.Pollan’s basic premise in this book is to eat food (in contrast to processed and manufactured crafted substances), eat less, and eat mainly plants. But he is far from evangelical or strident, encouraging flexibility and providing strategies that he has over time concluded will make eating a positive, healthy, and cultural event rather than the distortion that it has too often become today. He argues for respect for traditions that cultures have found useful, for ways of eating as much as for the contents of eating, and, a perennial theme in his writing, for moving the focus of food and dining to the local level. The text of the book itself explores these issues in detail, with gentleness and sensitivity.Perhaps one of the primary benefits of reading this book is the heightening of awareness that the reader experiences regarding what goes into his mouth and stomach. Such awareness can certainly be beneficial on several levels, including general health, preservation of our environment, and enhancement of the joys that eating can provide."
55,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/642144-nif,5,"I've been reading tons of books about food and the American food industry. I was afraid that this one would cover too much of the same ground as Nina Planck's Real Food, but Michael Pollan's take was quite different. He was more interested in how Americans got to this state of being so insecure about what to eat that we are willing to eat chemically engineered food substitutes marketed as ""healthy"" and ""nutritious"" instead of actual food that tastes good. Nina Planck has a real platform that says ""eat this!"" ""eat that!"" That said, I'm glad of input from both sides. I need all the reinforcement I can get to continue swimming against the tide of nutritionally suspect mainstream advice. I particularly liked Pollan's impassioned plea to view scientific reductionism with healthy skepticism. My understanding of the sciences of chaos and complexity has led me to believe that sometimes the whole really IS more than the sum of its parts. Michael Pollan's knack for making facts memorable came through once again. In some ways In Defense of Food is not as stunningly relevatory as The Omnivore's Dilemma. In other ways it was more poignant for me, coming as I do from a family that has suffered a great deal from ""nutritionism"" and ""Western diseases"" like heart disease and diabetes. This one is yet another ""must-read."""
56,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,4,"I have read quite a few of these non-fiction books. The kind that slams the research of others and then puts their own out there like it is revelation from God himself. This is the biggest problem I usually have with books of this type. This one is no different, but it wasn't completely slanted to one side. You can't drink all the kool-aid, but there is a lot here that is safe and harmless. I still give this 4 stars. First, it spent quality and a good quantity of time reiterating good advice. The kind that says: eat whole foods, eat leafy foods, don't over eat, be more active, be able to pronounce the things you are willing to put in your mouth, and so forth. They also pointed out the flaws that go along with research regarding nutrition and even pointed that out with their own research. It definitely had a finger squarely pointed at the government. I believe the government carries some fault for the mess we are in, but it isn't the government that forces people through drive-thru's super-sizing empty calories or down the frozen dinner aisle or buying a mega ounce soft drink or keeps people indoors watching TV. Another good thing about this book is that Scott Brick narrated this and I love Scott Brick. I could listen to him all day."
57,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,4,"There was not, I suppose, that much in this book that I had no clue about. Pollan's been writing op eds for long enough that I already knew most of his basic argument. That said, I agree with a number of his conclusions (although that doesn't mean I find them easy to carry out), and I still enjoy his style of writing. He doesn't go for the gross-out, or the manufactured outrage. His writing occasionally shades purple, but he usually seems ruefully self-aware about it. And I can't help but think that he's right. An awful lot of what we eat at this point isn't actually food. It's hard, really hard, while trying to parent a toddler in a two-career household and keep things clean and orderly and in budget and still have a social life, to avoid the amount of processed garbage. And we're a household that cooks most meals and buys from the farmers' market. Heck, we bake our own bread and desserts and have been known to make our own cheese. And my child still turns down all the delightful gorgeous produce and wants to subsist entirely on squeezer packs of apple sauce, plain white bagels, and Teddy Grahams. "

I would be sitting at Cartel, read a paragraph then find myself embarrassingly passed out in a chair at 3pm on a weekday. I couldn't read it in bed. When I read it on the sofa, my eyelids got heavy. The only way I could read this book was in transit-on the light rail, on the bus, these are the only ways I could read it when forced to alert and cold air blasting down my neck.So why even bother 3 stars? B/c I believe Michael Pollan. He is important. He may not be right, and I think his weirdness w/nutritionists is on par with Scientologists hating on psychiatry-really kind of witch-huntry. But his basic points about food about eating less, more greens, whole foods, etc really hits home.I saw a woman at work the other day eat a huge bag of chips, pour into her mouth, greasy bits clinging to her cheek....then I saw her open another one. Did I mention this was at 9:00 am?!? Pollans thoughts (but maybe not his writing) need to be pamphlet form so I can leave it around w/a coupon for fresh produce only somwhere. Christ."

Nothing new here for me, but it helps to keep reminding myself.The history of nutrition research in this book is interesting, and shows how pathetic is our relationship to food in this country.I think this book will have value for those who are currently in the grip of the standard trash food American diet. Pollan's recommendations will certainly lead them to a healthier position. However, he doesn't go far enough in his suggestions, presumably because he knows people are slaves to their appetites and won't follow TRULY health-promoting, disease-resistant diets. I have a lot of issues with this book, but I won't go into them, because they derive from my own biases and personal dietary experiences."

Some of his suggestions are common sense and things I've been doing for years--i.e., if the list of ingredients requires a chemistry degree to understand, IT IS NOT FOOD! Other points Pollan brings up were less obvious and more problematic. I would have liked to see him delve further into the inconvenient (and perhaps not merely accidental) truth that eating in the way he recommends (fresh foods in season, organic or small-farm raised, home-prepared meals, etc.) really isn't a viable choice for most lower-income Americans and especially for the urban poor who often only have access to convenience food-peddling convenience stores or lower-end grocery stores with higher prices for crappy produce.

He warns us that, to do otherwise, will affect both our health and our contentment. He points out many of the dangers of the ""western diet"" and supports his thesis with demography and specifics about food that is over processed to preserve it and send it around the world. He questions the need for (and effectiveness of) nutrient additives and the companies that tout them as better than the original. He makes a good case for the part food should daily play in conversation, celebration and relaxation. Not always easily read but a persuasive and, perhaps, life-changing call to action."

As a single mom, I surely can't afford to buy only organic and grass-fed foods, and I can assure you that I won't be giving up my microwave any time soon.

67,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"In short, the point of this book is to comprehensively answer the question ""What should the modern human eat, and how?"". Though at first glance it seems that this question has a plethora of obvious, simple answers, upon deeper inspection of the rocky ground upon which the reductionist ideology of nutritionism stands, Pollan convincingly presents counter advice to that of the traditional Western Nutitionist: Eating healthily is not about having more ""good"" nutrients and excluding the ""bad"" ones, but can instead be accomplished by the succinct yet profound advice of ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" Given this thesis statement, Pollan proceeds to eloquently elaborate upon this modern eater mantra, describing what he (and some nutrition scientists) considers ""food"", how to escape the modern ideology of nutritionism (the notion that ""food"" is really just the sum of it's nutrient components), and rules of thumb to live by with respect to what to eat (whole foods), how to eat (slowly, with family & friends), and why. As a whole, the book is a great, well-written argument against modern, western, reductionist nutrition science, and urges readers to eat local, whole (unprocessed) foods, with the people they love, avoiding any foodstuff that your great-grandparents wouldn't recognize as food. With more than enough well-cited nutrition research, this book presents a way-of-eating that is more than just a diet; Pollan succeeds in building a convincing holistic ideology about eating that just may bring modern western society back from the brink of ubiquitous avoidable chronic disease, if only more of us were willing to spend more time in energy in food preparation and consumption."
68,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46843663-candace,3,"Maybe more like 3.5 stars, it's hard to say. I had meant to read this ages ago, after The Omnivore's Dilemma which I really enjoyed. This one didn't hold up quite as well for me, for a lot of the reasons you can find browsing the other reviews: Pollan is a journalist, not a scientist, so many of his health assertions came off as anecdotal instead of being based on research. His style worked more in previous books where he was following food chains and describing his adventures therein, leaving the reader to likewise draw conclusions. Aside from all that, the base claim to eat more whole foods, try to avoid excessively processed foods, enjoy the food you eat, don't be afraid to spend time preparing it instead of watching TV, etc, is all good life advice, so if it can apply to you and you take it for what it is, I would recommend. His tone is particularly classist/""just don't be poor"" in some of these parts, where he says that buying whole foods isn't that expensive if you can justify spending money on cable TV and internet. In some ways it's not wholly wrong, but definitely spoken as from someone who never had to make that choice between foods with less ingredients on the label and having in-home access to information technology. Not to mention the millions of people who live with even less money so that they still don't have internet at home and also need to make hard choices at the grocery store. I should stop before I lower my rating haha!"
69,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27331649-nathan,3,"MIchael Pollan is always an interesting read just due to the way that he formats his books (though it probably helps that I am usually interested in the topics he writes about). He is able to string together history, science, and personal story to make an engaging reading experience. This one is no exception and helped to make it a good read. He takes a skeptical look at ""nutritionism"", which is defined as an ideology structured around the isolated nutrients of food instead of food itself. The issue he has with this is that it is reductionist due to the complexity of food and how our bodies and environment interact with said food. And of course, he looks into the ""SAD"" diet which seems to be doing more harm than good as levels of chronic diseases and obesity continue to riseHis recommendations for eating are pretty simple statements like ""Don't eat anything your great grandmother wouldn't recognize"" or ""You are what you eat eats too"". Nothing groundbreaking here, but it was a nice little reminder for someone trying to eat less processed food. Because in its essence, this book is a defense of whole food and a warning about highly processed foods. I didn't come away with any large revelations about food, but maybe someone else would. Either way, it is a quick read and a compelling narrative. "
70,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7827335-sarah,5,"This book has changed the way I buy, cook, and view food. The thesis of the book is ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" This is an easy way to remember the things Pollan talks about in his book. This looks like a simple phrase, but there is a lot of info packed into that statement. For example, what actually qualifies as food. A very interesting part of this book was when Pollan talks about the importance of sitting down and eating dinner at a dinner table with others. Here is a quote that really stood out to me: ""It is at the dinner table that we socialize and civilize our children, teaching them manners and the art of conversation. At the dinner table parents can determine portion sizes, model eating and drinking behavior, and enforce social norms about greed and gluttony and waste. Shared meals are about much more than fueling bodies; they are uniquely human institutions where our species developed language and this thing we call culture.""Overall fantastic read that I would recommend to anyone who is concerned about health and eating.

71,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15013052-deba-jyoti-khawas,4,"Michael Pollan has a great knack of making the complicated extremely simple. Like the first book I listened, Caffeine, this one is another great example of the same.Pollan, for this book, decides to take a big picture view of the social, cultural, economic and medical industries surrounding food and the act of eating in the current western diet. This allows him to point out many systematic trends and problems not found in information elsewhere.The book is also structured in a very logical way: Problems, effects and solutions. Each of the sections are limited in scope, but well researched. While at the same time, this book is not so dense as to scare off a casual person looking to improve health and eating.If I had to critique this book, one suggestion would be to carry forward this experiment for a long term and see if following Pollan's rules of eating actually changes someone's life in a meaningful way or not. Having said that, most of his suggestions seem very intuitive, logical, easy to keep in mind and track of. This book is surely worth the time you give it."
72,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27203016-michelle-curie,3,"You're served the core message of this book on its first page: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. Eating should be as simple as that. In the industrialised 21st century food comes in all forms, shapes and quantities is available to us. We don't have to fear starvation. We don't have to worry of having to eat anything we don't want to. But in a world where eating has never been easier, we seem to struggle the most. 
""I content that most of what we're consuming today is no longer, strictly speaking, food at all, and how we're consuming it - in the car, in front of the TV, and, increasingly, alone - is not really eating, at last not in the seven that civilisation has long understood the term.""
Pollan goes on explaining how we're being tricked today into thinking that the whole point of eating is to maintain and promote bodily health. This leads us to believing that we need to turn to ""health promoting"" food items to get the most out of what we consume. The flaws of the industry he explains make perfectly sense: there are people earning money from making us think that if we eat their food, we become better, prettier and healthier human beings. Pollan advices us to stay away from any food with health claims. Another problem that he talks about, but doesn't offer solutions to, is reductionist science. We have to admit that we know very little about nutrients and how and why food does what it does. Food is extremely complex and all of today's research and science of the field needs to be taken with a grain of salt, as we can be sure that not a whole picture has been painted in order to come up with report- and publish-worthy research. At several occasions Pollan simplifies, uses examples that feel a bit like a stretch or just not quite right, but the main message sounds reasonable: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."
73,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,3,"Pollan begins with a critique of ""nutritionism"" - which he holds as an ideology espousing ""that we should understand and engage with food and our bodies in terms of their nutritional and chemical constituents and requirements"" (27). His rationale is a catalog of poorly-conducted studies, false conclusions (the lipid hypothesis), industry influence, and abused findings that ignore complexity (margarine vs. butter). ""The problem with nutrient-by-nutrient nutrition science,"" according to NYU nutritionist Marion Nestle, ""is that it takes the nutrient out of the context of the food, the food out of the context of the diet, and the diet out of the context of the lifestyle"". (62) I diverge from Pollan substantially on the prescription: I do not think this is reason to give up on nutrition, but rather, is encouragement that we need to do better science. It is hard to find truth in nutrition - but not impossible. One only needs to look at the work of scientists like Valter Longo at USC, Christopher Gardner (author of the A to Z study), and each of the NuSI investigators to see that.His ultimate advice (""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."") is elegant, simple, and largely correct. Except for a section advising supplementation with multivitamins which to the best of my knowledge is not something that is supported by good empirical evidence (172).But I was put off by the fundamentally pessimistic voice. We can learn more through experimentation. It's a total fallacy that the local maxima embedded in traditional diets is the best that humanity can do. Just because fighting cancer is hard, and there have been false starts, doesn't mean that we should stop trying to develop new drugs. And nutrition is relevant to 7.4B humans - even a small truth is multiplied over a huge number of subjects."

So I'm pretty much screwed, but now I know even more reasons why I should feel bad about it.I don't listen to audiobooks very much so I don't have a lot to compare the narration to.

89,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3938672-kurt-pankau,1,"There's some good advice in this book, but most of it stops at the cover.This one angered me more or less from page one. At least a small portion of the blame must go to Scott Brick, who performs the audiobook with maximum condescending smarm. But Brick was reading from a terrible script, and the end result was bad enough that I found myself constantly reacting against it--even during the times when I knew Pollan's facts were right. He correctly, for instance, dives into the technical obstacles of doing good food science and some of the inherent problems of industrial food-production. But he mangles the data terribly in furtherance of a transparent agenda: to scare the reader into embracing ""whole foods."" And when I call his agenda transparent, I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. He name-check's Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" at least twice.The big bad wolf in his thesis is SCIENCE, and his arguments are profoundly nonsensical. Throughout, he conflates food scientists with nutritionists with science journalists with food marketers. A shortcoming of any of these is immediately translated into ""see how science failed?"" He's not even consistent there, though. Science is terrible when it leads to trans fats, but he has no qualms about citing anything vaguely scientific that might support his claims, and he takes this to the most ridiculous extremes imaginable. His sources include--and I'm not exaggerating here--a neurological ""condition"" that isn't in the DSM, an ""unproven"" hypothesis, and an untested one as well. The words ""The hypothesis hasn't been tested, but I'm convinced..."" are in this book. He's effectively saying ""No one's bothered to check this out, but it sure sounds good to me!""Even his own rhetoric shows up on both sides of his arguments. He frequently talks about the value of tradition, which he usually boils down to ""Mom."" ""Mom"" is the source of all cultural food wisdom, except in the introduction, where he describes the cooking of his own mother and talks about how both he and she have abandoned her traditional cuisine because it consists almost entirely meat. Similarly, saturated fats are basically harmless when he's talking about how foolish scientists got us addicted to trans fats instead. But saturated fats are to be avoided when he's talking about the nutritional benefits of grass-fed beef. Side note: he devotes a lot of ink to the folly of ""nutritionism,"" but is perfectly happy to use nutritional information to extol the virtues of grass-fed beef.He constantly decries food science as ""reductionist"" without really considering the implications. In a telling example, he talks about how there are health benefits of thyme, but argues that reductionist scientists would foolishly experiment to try and find out which of the chemical components of thyme make it so. But he ignores the fact that reductionist science is the only way to know thyme has health benefits in the first place! What kind of science would he have us do? ""You know, it seems like the Italians are pretty healthy. I guess we'll just leave it there."" Although that's effectively the argument he ends up making on behalf of the Italians, the Greeks, the French, and the Japanese (although you should avoid fish because of mercury). Tradition good. Science bad.And food science? Food science REALLY bad. It's as though every misstep that was made in an admittedly complex field over the past sixty years is proof that we should chuck it all and go to the farmer's market. Never mind that those missteps were caught by other scientists, and that often they weren't missteps at all, but the results of aggressive marketing and inept journalism. And I love farmer's markets, but they are not the solution to your dietary problems. They're a luxury for upper-middle class people who live in metropolitan areas. In fact--and perhaps this is what I find to be the most damning--all of his constipated reasoning congeals into food advice that can be summarized like this: Do all the trendy stuff that rich food-snobs are already doing.Seriously. This is a pseudo-intellectual pat on the back to the kind of people who buy their groceries from stores that only sell ""whole foods"" (there's a popular chain, but I can't think of the name of it right now). The book's from 2009, so it includes harsh invectives against high-fructose corn syrup. If it had been from last year, it would have been against GM foods and gluten instead. So yeah, this one clearly pissed me off.Read words. Mostly books. Not this one."

Some of his suggestions are common sense and things I've been doing for years--i.e., if the list of ingredients requires a chemistry degree to understand, IT IS NOT FOOD! Other points Pollan brings up were less obvious and more problematic. I would have liked to see him delve further into the inconvenient (and perhaps not merely accidental) truth that eating in the way he recommends (fresh foods in season, organic or small-farm raised, home-prepared meals, etc.) really isn't a viable choice for most lower-income Americans and especially for the urban poor who often only have access to convenience food-peddling convenience stores or lower-end grocery stores with higher prices for crappy produce.

He points out many of the dangers of the ""western diet"" and supports his thesis with demography and specifics about food that is over processed to preserve it and send it around the world. He questions the need for (and effectiveness of) nutrient additives and the companies that tout them as better than the original. He makes a good case for the part food should daily play in conversation, celebration and relaxation. Not always easily read but a persuasive and, perhaps, life-changing call to action."

97,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"In short, the point of this book is to comprehensively answer the question ""What should the modern human eat, and how?"". Though at first glance it seems that this question has a plethora of obvious, simple answers, upon deeper inspection of the rocky ground upon which the reductionist ideology of nutritionism stands, Pollan convincingly presents counter advice to that of the traditional Western Nutitionist: Eating healthily is not about having more ""good"" nutrients and excluding the ""bad"" ones, but can instead be accomplished by the succinct yet profound advice of ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" Given this thesis statement, Pollan proceeds to eloquently elaborate upon this modern eater mantra, describing what he (and some nutrition scientists) considers ""food"", how to escape the modern ideology of nutritionism (the notion that ""food"" is really just the sum of it's nutrient components), and rules of thumb to live by with respect to what to eat (whole foods), how to eat (slowly, with family & friends), and why. As a whole, the book is a great, well-written argument against modern, western, reductionist nutrition science, and urges readers to eat local, whole (unprocessed) foods, with the people they love, avoiding any foodstuff that your great-grandparents wouldn't recognize as food. With more than enough well-cited nutrition research, this book presents a way-of-eating that is more than just a diet; Pollan succeeds in building a convincing holistic ideology about eating that just may bring modern western society back from the brink of ubiquitous avoidable chronic disease, if only more of us were willing to spend more time in energy in food preparation and consumption."
98,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46843663-candace,3,"Maybe more like 3.5 stars, it's hard to say. I had meant to read this ages ago, after The Omnivore's Dilemma which I really enjoyed. This one didn't hold up quite as well for me, for a lot of the reasons you can find browsing the other reviews: Pollan is a journalist, not a scientist, so many of his health assertions came off as anecdotal instead of being based on research. His style worked more in previous books where he was following food chains and describing his adventures therein, leaving the reader to likewise draw conclusions. Aside from all that, the base claim to eat more whole foods, try to avoid excessively processed foods, enjoy the food you eat, don't be afraid to spend time preparing it instead of watching TV, etc, is all good life advice, so if it can apply to you and you take it for what it is, I would recommend. His tone is particularly classist/""just don't be poor"" in some of these parts, where he says that buying whole foods isn't that expensive if you can justify spending money on cable TV and internet. In some ways it's not wholly wrong, but definitely spoken as from someone who never had to make that choice between foods with less ingredients on the label and having in-home access to information technology. Not to mention the millions of people who live with even less money so that they still don't have internet at home and also need to make hard choices at the grocery store. I should stop before I lower my rating haha!"
99,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27331649-nathan,3,"MIchael Pollan is always an interesting read just due to the way that he formats his books (though it probably helps that I am usually interested in the topics he writes about). He is able to string together history, science, and personal story to make an engaging reading experience. This one is no exception and helped to make it a good read. He takes a skeptical look at ""nutritionism"", which is defined as an ideology structured around the isolated nutrients of food instead of food itself. The issue he has with this is that it is reductionist due to the complexity of food and how our bodies and environment interact with said food. And of course, he looks into the ""SAD"" diet which seems to be doing more harm than good as levels of chronic diseases and obesity continue to riseHis recommendations for eating are pretty simple statements like ""Don't eat anything your great grandmother wouldn't recognize"" or ""You are what you eat eats too"". Nothing groundbreaking here, but it was a nice little reminder for someone trying to eat less processed food. Because in its essence, this book is a defense of whole food and a warning about highly processed foods. I didn't come away with any large revelations about food, but maybe someone else would. Either way, it is a quick read and a compelling narrative. "
100,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7827335-sarah,5,"This book has changed the way I buy, cook, and view food. The thesis of the book is ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" This is an easy way to remember the things Pollan talks about in his book. This looks like a simple phrase, but there is a lot of info packed into that statement. For example, what actually qualifies as food. A very interesting part of this book was when Pollan talks about the importance of sitting down and eating dinner at a dinner table with others. Here is a quote that really stood out to me: ""It is at the dinner table that we socialize and civilize our children, teaching them manners and the art of conversation. At the dinner table parents can determine portion sizes, model eating and drinking behavior, and enforce social norms about greed and gluttony and waste. Shared meals are about much more than fueling bodies; they are uniquely human institutions where our species developed language and this thing we call culture.""Overall fantastic read that I would recommend to anyone who is concerned about health and eating. "
101,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15013052-deba-jyoti-khawas,4,"Michael Pollan has a great knack of making the complicated extremely simple. Like the first book I listened, Caffeine, this one is another great example of the same.Pollan, for this book, decides to take a big picture view of the social, cultural, economic and medical industries surrounding food and the act of eating in the current western diet. This allows him to point out many systematic trends and problems not found in information elsewhere.The book is also structured in a very logical way: Problems, effects and solutions. Each of the sections are limited in scope, but well researched. While at the same time, this book is not so dense as to scare off a casual person looking to improve health and eating.If I had to critique this book, one suggestion would be to carry forward this experiment for a long term and see if following Pollan's rules of eating actually changes someone's life in a meaningful way or not. Having said that, most of his suggestions seem very intuitive, logical, easy to keep in mind and track of. This book is surely worth the time you give it."
102,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27203016-michelle-curie,3,"You're served the core message of this book on its first page: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. Eating should be as simple as that. In the industrialised 21st century food comes in all forms, shapes and quantities is available to us. We don't have to fear starvation. We don't have to worry of having to eat anything we don't want to. But in a world where eating has never been easier, we seem to struggle the most. 
""I content that most of what we're consuming today is no longer, strictly speaking, food at all, and how we're consuming it - in the car, in front of the TV, and, increasingly, alone - is not really eating, at last not in the seven that civilisation has long understood the term.""
Pollan goes on explaining how we're being tricked today into thinking that the whole point of eating is to maintain and promote bodily health. This leads us to believing that we need to turn to ""health promoting"" food items to get the most out of what we consume. The flaws of the industry he explains make perfectly sense: there are people earning money from making us think that if we eat their food, we become better, prettier and healthier human beings. Pollan advices us to stay away from any food with health claims. Another problem that he talks about, but doesn't offer solutions to, is reductionist science. We have to admit that we know very little about nutrients and how and why food does what it does. Food is extremely complex and all of today's research and science of the field needs to be taken with a grain of salt, as we can be sure that not a whole picture has been painted in order to come up with report- and publish-worthy research. At several occasions Pollan simplifies, uses examples that feel a bit like a stretch or just not quite right, but the main message sounds reasonable: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."
103,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,3,"Pollan begins with a critique of ""nutritionism"" - which he holds as an ideology espousing ""that we should understand and engage with food and our bodies in terms of their nutritional and chemical constituents and requirements"" (27). His rationale is a catalog of poorly-conducted studies, false conclusions (the lipid hypothesis), industry influence, and abused findings that ignore complexity (margarine vs. butter). ""The problem with nutrient-by-nutrient nutrition science,"" according to NYU nutritionist Marion Nestle, ""is that it takes the nutrient out of the context of the food, the food out of the context of the diet, and the diet out of the context of the lifestyle"". (62) I diverge from Pollan substantially on the prescription: I do not think this is reason to give up on nutrition, but rather, is encouragement that we need to do better science. It is hard to find truth in nutrition - but not impossible. One only needs to look at the work of scientists like Valter Longo at USC, Christopher Gardner (author of the A to Z study), and each of the NuSI investigators to see that.His ultimate advice (""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."") is elegant, simple, and largely correct. Except for a section advising supplementation with multivitamins which to the best of my knowledge is not something that is supported by good empirical evidence (172).But I was put off by the fundamentally pessimistic voice. We can learn more through experimentation. It's a total fallacy that the local maxima embedded in traditional diets is the best that humanity can do. Just because fighting cancer is hard, and there have been false starts, doesn't mean that we should stop trying to develop new drugs. And nutrition is relevant to 7.4B humans - even a small truth is multiplied over a huge number of subjects."

He correctly, for instance, dives into the technical obstacles of doing good food science and some of the inherent problems of industrial food-production. But he mangles the data terribly in furtherance of a transparent agenda: to scare the reader into embracing ""whole foods."" And when I call his agenda transparent, I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. He name-check's Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" at least twice.The big bad wolf in his thesis is SCIENCE, and his arguments are profoundly nonsensical. Throughout, he conflates food scientists with nutritionists with science journalists with food marketers. A shortcoming of any of these is immediately translated into ""see how science failed?"" He's not even consistent there, though. Science is terrible when it leads to trans fats, but he has no qualms about citing anything vaguely scientific that might support his claims, and he takes this to the most ridiculous extremes imaginable. His sources include--and I'm not exaggerating here--a neurological ""condition"" that isn't in the DSM, an ""unproven"" hypothesis, and an untested one as well. The words ""The hypothesis hasn't been tested, but I'm convinced..."" are in this book. He's effectively saying ""No one's bothered to check this out, but it sure sounds good to me!""Even his own rhetoric shows up on both sides of his arguments. He frequently talks about the value of tradition, which he usually boils down to ""Mom."" ""Mom"" is the source of all cultural food wisdom, except in the introduction, where he describes the cooking of his own mother and talks about how both he and she have abandoned her traditional cuisine because it consists almost entirely meat. Similarly, saturated fats are basically harmless when he's talking about how foolish scientists got us addicted to trans fats instead. But saturated fats are to be avoided when he's talking about the nutritional benefits of grass-fed beef. Side note: he devotes a lot of ink to the folly of ""nutritionism,"" but is perfectly happy to use nutritional information to extol the virtues of grass-fed beef.He constantly decries food science as ""reductionist"" without really considering the implications. In a telling example, he talks about how there are health benefits of thyme, but argues that reductionist scientists would foolishly experiment to try and find out which of the chemical components of thyme make it so. But he ignores the fact that reductionist science is the only way to know thyme has health benefits in the first place! What kind of science would he have us do? ""You know, it seems like the Italians are pretty healthy. I guess we'll just leave it there."" Although that's effectively the argument he ends up making on behalf of the Italians, the Greeks, the French, and the Japanese (although you should avoid fish because of mercury). Tradition good. Science bad.And food science? Food science REALLY bad. It's as though every misstep that was made in an admittedly complex field over the past sixty years is proof that we should chuck it all and go to the farmer's market. Never mind that those missteps were caught by other scientists, and that often they weren't missteps at all, but the results of aggressive marketing and inept journalism. And I love farmer's markets, but they are not the solution to your dietary problems. They're a luxury for upper-middle class people who live in metropolitan areas. In fact--and perhaps this is what I find to be the most damning--all of his constipated reasoning congeals into food advice that can be summarized like this: Do all the trendy stuff that rich food-snobs are already doing.Seriously. This is a pseudo-intellectual pat on the back to the kind of people who buy their groceries from stores that only sell ""whole foods"" (there's a popular chain, but I can't think of the name of it right now).

127,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"In short, the point of this book is to comprehensively answer the question ""What should the modern human eat, and how?"". Though at first glance it seems that this question has a plethora of obvious, simple answers, upon deeper inspection of the rocky ground upon which the reductionist ideology of nutritionism stands, Pollan convincingly presents counter advice to that of the traditional Western Nutitionist: Eating healthily is not about having more ""good"" nutrients and excluding the ""bad"" ones, but can instead be accomplished by the succinct yet profound advice of ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" Given this thesis statement, Pollan proceeds to eloquently elaborate upon this modern eater mantra, describing what he (and some nutrition scientists) considers ""food"", how to escape the modern ideology of nutritionism (the notion that ""food"" is really just the sum of it's nutrient components), and rules of thumb to live by with respect to what to eat (whole foods), how to eat (slowly, with family & friends), and why. As a whole, the book is a great, well-written argument against modern, western, reductionist nutrition science, and urges readers to eat local, whole (unprocessed) foods, with the people they love, avoiding any foodstuff that your great-grandparents wouldn't recognize as food. With more than enough well-cited nutrition research, this book presents a way-of-eating that is more than just a diet; Pollan succeeds in building a convincing holistic ideology about eating that just may bring modern western society back from the brink of ubiquitous avoidable chronic disease, if only more of us were willing to spend more time in energy in food preparation and consumption."
128,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46843663-candace,3,"Maybe more like 3.5 stars, it's hard to say. I had meant to read this ages ago, after The Omnivore's Dilemma which I really enjoyed. This one didn't hold up quite as well for me, for a lot of the reasons you can find browsing the other reviews: Pollan is a journalist, not a scientist, so many of his health assertions came off as anecdotal instead of being based on research. His style worked more in previous books where he was following food chains and describing his adventures therein, leaving the reader to likewise draw conclusions. Aside from all that, the base claim to eat more whole foods, try to avoid excessively processed foods, enjoy the food you eat, don't be afraid to spend time preparing it instead of watching TV, etc, is all good life advice, so if it can apply to you and you take it for what it is, I would recommend. His tone is particularly classist/""just don't be poor"" in some of these parts, where he says that buying whole foods isn't that expensive if you can justify spending money on cable TV and internet. In some ways it's not wholly wrong, but definitely spoken as from someone who never had to make that choice between foods with less ingredients on the label and having in-home access to information technology. Not to mention the millions of people who live with even less money so that they still don't have internet at home and also need to make hard choices at the grocery store. I should stop before I lower my rating haha!"
129,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27331649-nathan,3,"MIchael Pollan is always an interesting read just due to the way that he formats his books (though it probably helps that I am usually interested in the topics he writes about). He is able to string together history, science, and personal story to make an engaging reading experience. This one is no exception and helped to make it a good read. He takes a skeptical look at ""nutritionism"", which is defined as an ideology structured around the isolated nutrients of food instead of food itself. The issue he has with this is that it is reductionist due to the complexity of food and how our bodies and environment interact with said food. And of course, he looks into the ""SAD"" diet which seems to be doing more harm than good as levels of chronic diseases and obesity continue to riseHis recommendations for eating are pretty simple statements like ""Don't eat anything your great grandmother wouldn't recognize"" or ""You are what you eat eats too"". Nothing groundbreaking here, but it was a nice little reminder for someone trying to eat less processed food. Because in its essence, this book is a defense of whole food and a warning about highly processed foods. I didn't come away with any large revelations about food, but maybe someone else would. Either way, it is a quick read and a compelling narrative. "
130,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7827335-sarah,5,"This book has changed the way I buy, cook, and view food. The thesis of the book is ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" This is an easy way to remember the things Pollan talks about in his book. This looks like a simple phrase, but there is a lot of info packed into that statement. For example, what actually qualifies as food. A very interesting part of this book was when Pollan talks about the importance of sitting down and eating dinner at a dinner table with others. Here is a quote that really stood out to me: ""It is at the dinner table that we socialize and civilize our children, teaching them manners and the art of conversation. At the dinner table parents can determine portion sizes, model eating and drinking behavior, and enforce social norms about greed and gluttony and waste. Shared meals are about much more than fueling bodies; they are uniquely human institutions where our species developed language and this thing we call culture.""Overall fantastic read that I would recommend to anyone who is concerned about health and eating. "
131,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15013052-deba-jyoti-khawas,4,"Michael Pollan has a great knack of making the complicated extremely simple. Like the first book I listened, Caffeine, this one is another great example of the same.Pollan, for this book, decides to take a big picture view of the social, cultural, economic and medical industries surrounding food and the act of eating in the current western diet. This allows him to point out many systematic trends and problems not found in information elsewhere.The book is also structured in a very logical way: Problems, effects and solutions. Each of the sections are limited in scope, but well researched. While at the same time, this book is not so dense as to scare off a casual person looking to improve health and eating.If I had to critique this book, one suggestion would be to carry forward this experiment for a long term and see if following Pollan's rules of eating actually changes someone's life in a meaningful way or not. Having said that, most of his suggestions seem very intuitive, logical, easy to keep in mind and track of. This book is surely worth the time you give it."
132,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27203016-michelle-curie,3,"You're served the core message of this book on its first page: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. Eating should be as simple as that. In the industrialised 21st century food comes in all forms, shapes and quantities is available to us. We don't have to fear starvation. We don't have to worry of having to eat anything we don't want to. But in a world where eating has never been easier, we seem to struggle the most. 
""I content that most of what we're consuming today is no longer, strictly speaking, food at all, and how we're consuming it - in the car, in front of the TV, and, increasingly, alone - is not really eating, at last not in the seven that civilisation has long understood the term.""
Pollan goes on explaining how we're being tricked today into thinking that the whole point of eating is to maintain and promote bodily health. This leads us to believing that we need to turn to ""health promoting"" food items to get the most out of what we consume. The flaws of the industry he explains make perfectly sense: there are people earning money from making us think that if we eat their food, we become better, prettier and healthier human beings. Pollan advices us to stay away from any food with health claims. Another problem that he talks about, but doesn't offer solutions to, is reductionist science. We have to admit that we know very little about nutrients and how and why food does what it does. Food is extremely complex and all of today's research and science of the field needs to be taken with a grain of salt, as we can be sure that not a whole picture has been painted in order to come up with report- and publish-worthy research. At several occasions Pollan simplifies, uses examples that feel a bit like a stretch or just not quite right, but the main message sounds reasonable: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."
133,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,3,"Pollan begins with a critique of ""nutritionism"" - which he holds as an ideology espousing ""that we should understand and engage with food and our bodies in terms of their nutritional and chemical constituents and requirements"" (27). His rationale is a catalog of poorly-conducted studies, false conclusions (the lipid hypothesis), industry influence, and abused findings that ignore complexity (margarine vs. butter). ""The problem with nutrient-by-nutrient nutrition science,"" according to NYU nutritionist Marion Nestle, ""is that it takes the nutrient out of the context of the food, the food out of the context of the diet, and the diet out of the context of the lifestyle"". (62) I diverge from Pollan substantially on the prescription: I do not think this is reason to give up on nutrition, but rather, is encouragement that we need to do better science. It is hard to find truth in nutrition - but not impossible. One only needs to look at the work of scientists like Valter Longo at USC, Christopher Gardner (author of the A to Z study), and each of the NuSI investigators to see that.His ultimate advice (""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."") is elegant, simple, and largely correct. Except for a section advising supplementation with multivitamins which to the best of my knowledge is not something that is supported by good empirical evidence (172).But I was put off by the fundamentally pessimistic voice. We can learn more through experimentation. It's a total fallacy that the local maxima embedded in traditional diets is the best that humanity can do. Just because fighting cancer is hard, and there have been false starts, doesn't mean that we should stop trying to develop new drugs. And nutrition is relevant to 7.4B humans - even a small truth is multiplied over a huge number of subjects."
134,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5376499-donna,3,"The author defends ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.""This was pretty decent. It did give me things to think about which is the main reason I sometimes read nonfiction. The main problem for me personally is that I hate nearly all vegetables and actively dislike nearly all fruits. So I'm pretty much screwed, but now I know even more reasons why I should feel bad about it.I don't listen to audiobooks very much so I don't have a lot to compare the narration to. It was ok, but seemed to be a little on the cheesy side to me - sometimes dragging out a word only served to draw me out of the information to marvel at 'TOK...sens' (toxins)."

Like, I do agree with his main premise: ""Eat food. Not too much. Mainly plants."" But his rhetoric was all over the place, using the same arguments to argue that something is bad or good, depending on his point of view. Also, he argues that food research often is wrong, then uses research without control group and a small sample size to support his own argument.

Though at first glance it seems that this question has a plethora of obvious, simple answers, upon deeper inspection of the rocky ground upon which the reductionist ideology of nutritionism stands, Pollan convincingly presents counter advice to that of the traditional Western Nutitionist: Eating healthily is not about having more ""good"" nutrients and excluding the ""bad"" ones, but can instead be accomplished by the succinct yet profound advice of ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" Given this thesis statement, Pollan proceeds to eloquently elaborate upon this modern eater mantra, describing what he (and some nutrition scientists) considers ""food"", how to escape the modern ideology of nutritionism (the notion that ""food"" is really just the sum of it's nutrient components), and rules of thumb to live by with respect to what to eat (whole foods), how to eat (slowly, with family & friends), and why. As a whole, the book is a great, well-written argument against modern, western, reductionist nutrition science, and urges readers to eat local, whole (unprocessed) foods, with the people they love, avoiding any foodstuff that your great-grandparents wouldn't recognize as food. With more than enough well-cited nutrition research, this book presents a way-of-eating that is more than just a diet; Pollan succeeds in building a convincing holistic ideology about eating that just may bring modern western society back from the brink of ubiquitous avoidable chronic disease, if only more of us were willing to spend more time in energy in food preparation and consumption."

His style worked more in previous books where he was following food chains and describing his adventures therein, leaving the reader to likewise draw conclusions. Aside from all that, the base claim to eat more whole foods, try to avoid excessively processed foods, enjoy the food you eat, don't be afraid to spend time preparing it instead of watching TV, etc, is all good life advice, so if it can apply to you and you take it for what it is, I would recommend.

He is able to string together history, science, and personal story to make an engaging reading experience. This one is no exception and helped to make it a good read. He takes a skeptical look at ""nutritionism"", which is defined as an ideology structured around the isolated nutrients of food instead of food itself. The issue he has with this is that it is reductionist due to the complexity of food and how our bodies and environment interact with said food. And of course, he looks into the ""SAD"" diet which seems to be doing more harm than good as levels of chronic diseases and obesity continue to riseHis recommendations for eating are pretty simple statements like ""Don't eat anything your great grandmother wouldn't recognize"" or ""You are what you eat eats too"". Nothing groundbreaking here, but it was a nice little reminder for someone trying to eat less processed food. Because in its essence, this book is a defense of whole food and a warning about highly processed foods. I didn't come away with any large revelations about food, but maybe someone else would.

This is an easy way to remember the things Pollan talks about in his book. This looks like a simple phrase, but there is a lot of info packed into that statement. For example, what actually qualifies as food. A very interesting part of this book was when Pollan talks about the importance of sitting down and eating dinner at a dinner table with others. Here is a quote that really stood out to me: ""It is at the dinner table that we socialize and civilize our children, teaching them manners and the art of conversation. At the dinner table parents can determine portion sizes, model eating and drinking behavior, and enforce social norms about greed and gluttony and waste. Shared meals are about much more than fueling bodies; they are uniquely human institutions where our species developed language and this thing we call culture.""Overall fantastic read that I would recommend to anyone who is concerned about health and eating.

Like the first book I listened, Caffeine, this one is another great example of the same.Pollan, for this book, decides to take a big picture view of the social, cultural, economic and medical industries surrounding food and the act of eating in the current western diet. This allows him to point out many systematic trends and problems not found in information elsewhere.The book is also structured in a very logical way: Problems, effects and solutions. Each of the sections are limited in scope, but well researched. While at the same time, this book is not so dense as to scare off a casual person looking to improve health and eating.If I had to critique this book, one suggestion would be to carry forward this experiment for a long term and see if following Pollan's rules of eating actually changes someone's life in a meaningful way or not. Having said that, most of his suggestions seem very intuitive, logical, easy to keep in mind and track of. This book is surely worth the time you give it."
162,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27203016-michelle-curie,3,"You're served the core message of this book on its first page: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. Eating should be as simple as that. In the industrialised 21st century food comes in all forms, shapes and quantities is available to us. We don't have to fear starvation. We don't have to worry of having to eat anything we don't want to. But in a world where eating has never been easier, we seem to struggle the most. 
""I content that most of what we're consuming today is no longer, strictly speaking, food at all, and how we're consuming it - in the car, in front of the TV, and, increasingly, alone - is not really eating, at last not in the seven that civilisation has long understood the term.""
Pollan goes on explaining how we're being tricked today into thinking that the whole point of eating is to maintain and promote bodily health. This leads us to believing that we need to turn to ""health promoting"" food items to get the most out of what we consume. The flaws of the industry he explains make perfectly sense: there are people earning money from making us think that if we eat their food, we become better, prettier and healthier human beings. Pollan advices us to stay away from any food with health claims. Another problem that he talks about, but doesn't offer solutions to, is reductionist science. We have to admit that we know very little about nutrients and how and why food does what it does. Food is extremely complex and all of today's research and science of the field needs to be taken with a grain of salt, as we can be sure that not a whole picture has been painted in order to come up with report- and publish-worthy research. At several occasions Pollan simplifies, uses examples that feel a bit like a stretch or just not quite right, but the main message sounds reasonable: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."
163,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,3,"Pollan begins with a critique of ""nutritionism"" - which he holds as an ideology espousing ""that we should understand and engage with food and our bodies in terms of their nutritional and chemical constituents and requirements"" (27). His rationale is a catalog of poorly-conducted studies, false conclusions (the lipid hypothesis), industry influence, and abused findings that ignore complexity (margarine vs. butter). ""The problem with nutrient-by-nutrient nutrition science,"" according to NYU nutritionist Marion Nestle, ""is that it takes the nutrient out of the context of the food, the food out of the context of the diet, and the diet out of the context of the lifestyle"". (62) I diverge from Pollan substantially on the prescription: I do not think this is reason to give up on nutrition, but rather, is encouragement that we need to do better science. It is hard to find truth in nutrition - but not impossible. One only needs to look at the work of scientists like Valter Longo at USC, Christopher Gardner (author of the A to Z study), and each of the NuSI investigators to see that.His ultimate advice (""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."") is elegant, simple, and largely correct. Except for a section advising supplementation with multivitamins which to the best of my knowledge is not something that is supported by good empirical evidence (172).But I was put off by the fundamentally pessimistic voice. We can learn more through experimentation. It's a total fallacy that the local maxima embedded in traditional diets is the best that humanity can do. Just because fighting cancer is hard, and there have been false starts, doesn't mean that we should stop trying to develop new drugs. And nutrition is relevant to 7.4B humans - even a small truth is multiplied over a huge number of subjects."
164,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5376499-donna,3,"The author defends ""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.""This was pretty decent. It did give me things to think about which is the main reason I sometimes read nonfiction. The main problem for me personally is that I hate nearly all vegetables and actively dislike nearly all fruits. So I'm pretty much screwed, but now I know even more reasons why I should feel bad about it.I don't listen to audiobooks very much so I don't have a lot to compare the narration to. It was ok, but seemed to be a little on the cheesy side to me - sometimes dragging out a word only served to draw me out of the information to marvel at 'TOK...sens' (toxins)."

Like, I do agree with his main premise: ""Eat food. Not too much. Mainly plants."" But his rhetoric was all over the place, using the same arguments to argue that something is bad or good, depending on his point of view. Also, he argues that food research often is wrong, then uses research without control group and a small sample size to support his own argument.

I thought the best message from this book is that there is and just one way to eat better than you are probably eating today. The rules that he gives are not really too complicated.

179,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3938672-kurt-pankau,1,"There's some good advice in this book, but most of it stops at the cover.This one angered me more or less from page one. At least a small portion of the blame must go to Scott Brick, who performs the audiobook with maximum condescending smarm. But Brick was reading from a terrible script, and the end result was bad enough that I found myself constantly reacting against it--even during the times when I knew Pollan's facts were right. He correctly, for instance, dives into the technical obstacles of doing good food science and some of the inherent problems of industrial food-production. But he mangles the data terribly in furtherance of a transparent agenda: to scare the reader into embracing ""whole foods."" And when I call his agenda transparent, I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. He name-check's Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" at least twice.The big bad wolf in his thesis is SCIENCE, and his arguments are profoundly nonsensical. Throughout, he conflates food scientists with nutritionists with science journalists with food marketers. A shortcoming of any of these is immediately translated into ""see how science failed?"" He's not even consistent there, though. Science is terrible when it leads to trans fats, but he has no qualms about citing anything vaguely scientific that might support his claims, and he takes this to the most ridiculous extremes imaginable. His sources include--and I'm not exaggerating here--a neurological ""condition"" that isn't in the DSM, an ""unproven"" hypothesis, and an untested one as well. The words ""The hypothesis hasn't been tested, but I'm convinced..."" are in this book. He's effectively saying ""No one's bothered to check this out, but it sure sounds good to me!""Even his own rhetoric shows up on both sides of his arguments. He frequently talks about the value of tradition, which he usually boils down to ""Mom."" ""Mom"" is the source of all cultural food wisdom, except in the introduction, where he describes the cooking of his own mother and talks about how both he and she have abandoned her traditional cuisine because it consists almost entirely meat. Similarly, saturated fats are basically harmless when he's talking about how foolish scientists got us addicted to trans fats instead. But saturated fats are to be avoided when he's talking about the nutritional benefits of grass-fed beef. Side note: he devotes a lot of ink to the folly of ""nutritionism,"" but is perfectly happy to use nutritional information to extol the virtues of grass-fed beef.He constantly decries food science as ""reductionist"" without really considering the implications. In a telling example, he talks about how there are health benefits of thyme, but argues that reductionist scientists would foolishly experiment to try and find out which of the chemical components of thyme make it so. But he ignores the fact that reductionist science is the only way to know thyme has health benefits in the first place! What kind of science would he have us do? ""You know, it seems like the Italians are pretty healthy. I guess we'll just leave it there."" Although that's effectively the argument he ends up making on behalf of the Italians, the Greeks, the French, and the Japanese (although you should avoid fish because of mercury). Tradition good. Science bad.And food science? Food science REALLY bad. It's as though every misstep that was made in an admittedly complex field over the past sixty years is proof that we should chuck it all and go to the farmer's market. Never mind that those missteps were caught by other scientists, and that often they weren't missteps at all, but the results of aggressive marketing and inept journalism. And I love farmer's markets, but they are not the solution to your dietary problems. They're a luxury for upper-middle class people who live in metropolitan areas. In fact--and perhaps this is what I find to be the most damning--all of his constipated reasoning congeals into food advice that can be summarized like this: Do all the trendy stuff that rich food-snobs are already doing.Seriously. This is a pseudo-intellectual pat on the back to the kind of people who buy their groceries from stores that only sell ""whole foods"" (there's a popular chain, but I can't think of the name of it right now). The book's from 2009, so it includes harsh invectives against high-fructose corn syrup. If it had been from last year, it would have been against GM foods and gluten instead. So yeah, this one clearly pissed me off.Read words. Mostly books. Not this one."

Other points Pollan brings up were less obvious and more problematic. I would have liked to see him delve further into the inconvenient (and perhaps not merely accidental) truth that eating in the way he recommends (fresh foods in season, organic or small-farm raised, home-prepared meals, etc.) really isn't a viable choice for most lower-income Americans and especially for the urban poor who often only have access to convenience food-peddling convenience stores or lower-end grocery stores with higher prices for crappy produce.

209,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3938672-kurt-pankau,1,"There's some good advice in this book, but most of it stops at the cover.This one angered me more or less from page one. At least a small portion of the blame must go to Scott Brick, who performs the audiobook with maximum condescending smarm. But Brick was reading from a terrible script, and the end result was bad enough that I found myself constantly reacting against it--even during the times when I knew Pollan's facts were right. He correctly, for instance, dives into the technical obstacles of doing good food science and some of the inherent problems of industrial food-production. But he mangles the data terribly in furtherance of a transparent agenda: to scare the reader into embracing ""whole foods."" And when I call his agenda transparent, I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. He name-check's Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" at least twice.The big bad wolf in his thesis is SCIENCE, and his arguments are profoundly nonsensical. Throughout, he conflates food scientists with nutritionists with science journalists with food marketers. A shortcoming of any of these is immediately translated into ""see how science failed?"" He's not even consistent there, though. Science is terrible when it leads to trans fats, but he has no qualms about citing anything vaguely scientific that might support his claims, and he takes this to the most ridiculous extremes imaginable. His sources include--and I'm not exaggerating here--a neurological ""condition"" that isn't in the DSM, an ""unproven"" hypothesis, and an untested one as well. The words ""The hypothesis hasn't been tested, but I'm convinced..."" are in this book. He's effectively saying ""No one's bothered to check this out, but it sure sounds good to me!""Even his own rhetoric shows up on both sides of his arguments. He frequently talks about the value of tradition, which he usually boils down to ""Mom."" ""Mom"" is the source of all cultural food wisdom, except in the introduction, where he describes the cooking of his own mother and talks about how both he and she have abandoned her traditional cuisine because it consists almost entirely meat. Similarly, saturated fats are basically harmless when he's talking about how foolish scientists got us addicted to trans fats instead. But saturated fats are to be avoided when he's talking about the nutritional benefits of grass-fed beef. Side note: he devotes a lot of ink to the folly of ""nutritionism,"" but is perfectly happy to use nutritional information to extol the virtues of grass-fed beef.He constantly decries food science as ""reductionist"" without really considering the implications. In a telling example, he talks about how there are health benefits of thyme, but argues that reductionist scientists would foolishly experiment to try and find out which of the chemical components of thyme make it so. But he ignores the fact that reductionist science is the only way to know thyme has health benefits in the first place! What kind of science would he have us do? ""You know, it seems like the Italians are pretty healthy. I guess we'll just leave it there."" Although that's effectively the argument he ends up making on behalf of the Italians, the Greeks, the French, and the Japanese (although you should avoid fish because of mercury). Tradition good. Science bad.And food science? Food science REALLY bad. It's as though every misstep that was made in an admittedly complex field over the past sixty years is proof that we should chuck it all and go to the farmer's market. Never mind that those missteps were caught by other scientists, and that often they weren't missteps at all, but the results of aggressive marketing and inept journalism. And I love farmer's markets, but they are not the solution to your dietary problems. They're a luxury for upper-middle class people who live in metropolitan areas. In fact--and perhaps this is what I find to be the most damning--all of his constipated reasoning congeals into food advice that can be summarized like this: Do all the trendy stuff that rich food-snobs are already doing.Seriously. This is a pseudo-intellectual pat on the back to the kind of people who buy their groceries from stores that only sell ""whole foods"" (there's a popular chain, but I can't think of the name of it right now). The book's from 2009, so it includes harsh invectives against high-fructose corn syrup. If it had been from last year, it would have been against GM foods and gluten instead. So yeah, this one clearly pissed me off.Read words. Mostly books. Not this one."

Other points Pollan brings up were less obvious and more problematic. I would have liked to see him delve further into the inconvenient (and perhaps not merely accidental) truth that eating in the way he recommends (fresh foods in season, organic or small-farm raised, home-prepared meals, etc.) really isn't a viable choice for most lower-income Americans and especially for the urban poor who often only have access to convenience food-peddling convenience stores or lower-end grocery stores with higher prices for crappy produce.

He points out many of the dangers of the ""western diet"" and supports his thesis with demography and specifics about food that is over processed to preserve it and send it around the world. He questions the need for (and effectiveness of) nutrient additives and the companies that tout them as better than the original. He makes a good case for the part food should daily play in conversation, celebration and relaxation. Not always easily read but a persuasive and, perhaps, life-changing call to action."

As a single mom, I surely can't afford to buy only organic and grass-fed foods, and I can assure you that I won't be giving up my microwave any time soon.

217,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"In short, the point of this book is to comprehensively answer the question ""What should the modern human eat, and how?"". Though at first glance it seems that this question has a plethora of obvious, simple answers, upon deeper inspection of the rocky ground upon which the reductionist ideology of nutritionism stands, Pollan convincingly presents counter advice to that of the traditional Western Nutitionist: Eating healthily is not about having more ""good"" nutrients and excluding the ""bad"" ones, but can instead be accomplished by the succinct yet profound advice of ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" Given this thesis statement, Pollan proceeds to eloquently elaborate upon this modern eater mantra, describing what he (and some nutrition scientists) considers ""food"", how to escape the modern ideology of nutritionism (the notion that ""food"" is really just the sum of it's nutrient components), and rules of thumb to live by with respect to what to eat (whole foods), how to eat (slowly, with family & friends), and why. As a whole, the book is a great, well-written argument against modern, western, reductionist nutrition science, and urges readers to eat local, whole (unprocessed) foods, with the people they love, avoiding any foodstuff that your great-grandparents wouldn't recognize as food. With more than enough well-cited nutrition research, this book presents a way-of-eating that is more than just a diet; Pollan succeeds in building a convincing holistic ideology about eating that just may bring modern western society back from the brink of ubiquitous avoidable chronic disease, if only more of us were willing to spend more time in energy in food preparation and consumption."
218,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46843663-candace,3,"Maybe more like 3.5 stars, it's hard to say. I had meant to read this ages ago, after The Omnivore's Dilemma which I really enjoyed. This one didn't hold up quite as well for me, for a lot of the reasons you can find browsing the other reviews: Pollan is a journalist, not a scientist, so many of his health assertions came off as anecdotal instead of being based on research. His style worked more in previous books where he was following food chains and describing his adventures therein, leaving the reader to likewise draw conclusions. Aside from all that, the base claim to eat more whole foods, try to avoid excessively processed foods, enjoy the food you eat, don't be afraid to spend time preparing it instead of watching TV, etc, is all good life advice, so if it can apply to you and you take it for what it is, I would recommend. His tone is particularly classist/""just don't be poor"" in some of these parts, where he says that buying whole foods isn't that expensive if you can justify spending money on cable TV and internet. In some ways it's not wholly wrong, but definitely spoken as from someone who never had to make that choice between foods with less ingredients on the label and having in-home access to information technology. Not to mention the millions of people who live with even less money so that they still don't have internet at home and also need to make hard choices at the grocery store.

239,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3938672-kurt-pankau,1,"There's some good advice in this book, but most of it stops at the cover.This one angered me more or less from page one. At least a small portion of the blame must go to Scott Brick, who performs the audiobook with maximum condescending smarm. But Brick was reading from a terrible script, and the end result was bad enough that I found myself constantly reacting against it--even during the times when I knew Pollan's facts were right. He correctly, for instance, dives into the technical obstacles of doing good food science and some of the inherent problems of industrial food-production. But he mangles the data terribly in furtherance of a transparent agenda: to scare the reader into embracing ""whole foods."" And when I call his agenda transparent, I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. He name-check's Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" at least twice.The big bad wolf in his thesis is SCIENCE, and his arguments are profoundly nonsensical. Throughout, he conflates food scientists with nutritionists with science journalists with food marketers. A shortcoming of any of these is immediately translated into ""see how science failed?"" He's not even consistent there, though. Science is terrible when it leads to trans fats, but he has no qualms about citing anything vaguely scientific that might support his claims, and he takes this to the most ridiculous extremes imaginable. His sources include--and I'm not exaggerating here--a neurological ""condition"" that isn't in the DSM, an ""unproven"" hypothesis, and an untested one as well. The words ""The hypothesis hasn't been tested, but I'm convinced..."" are in this book. He's effectively saying ""No one's bothered to check this out, but it sure sounds good to me!""Even his own rhetoric shows up on both sides of his arguments. He frequently talks about the value of tradition, which he usually boils down to ""Mom."" ""Mom"" is the source of all cultural food wisdom, except in the introduction, where he describes the cooking of his own mother and talks about how both he and she have abandoned her traditional cuisine because it consists almost entirely meat. Similarly, saturated fats are basically harmless when he's talking about how foolish scientists got us addicted to trans fats instead. But saturated fats are to be avoided when he's talking about the nutritional benefits of grass-fed beef. Side note: he devotes a lot of ink to the folly of ""nutritionism,"" but is perfectly happy to use nutritional information to extol the virtues of grass-fed beef.He constantly decries food science as ""reductionist"" without really considering the implications. In a telling example, he talks about how there are health benefits of thyme, but argues that reductionist scientists would foolishly experiment to try and find out which of the chemical components of thyme make it so. But he ignores the fact that reductionist science is the only way to know thyme has health benefits in the first place! What kind of science would he have us do? ""You know, it seems like the Italians are pretty healthy. I guess we'll just leave it there."" Although that's effectively the argument he ends up making on behalf of the Italians, the Greeks, the French, and the Japanese (although you should avoid fish because of mercury). Tradition good. Science bad.And food science? Food science REALLY bad. It's as though every misstep that was made in an admittedly complex field over the past sixty years is proof that we should chuck it all and go to the farmer's market. Never mind that those missteps were caught by other scientists, and that often they weren't missteps at all, but the results of aggressive marketing and inept journalism. And I love farmer's markets, but they are not the solution to your dietary problems. They're a luxury for upper-middle class people who live in metropolitan areas. In fact--and perhaps this is what I find to be the most damning--all of his constipated reasoning congeals into food advice that can be summarized like this: Do all the trendy stuff that rich food-snobs are already doing.Seriously. This is a pseudo-intellectual pat on the back to the kind of people who buy their groceries from stores that only sell ""whole foods"" (there's a popular chain, but I can't think of the name of it right now). The book's from 2009, so it includes harsh invectives against high-fructose corn syrup. If it had been from last year, it would have been against GM foods and gluten instead. So yeah, this one clearly pissed me off.Read words. Mostly books. Not this one."

Some of his suggestions are common sense and things I've been doing for years--i.e., if the list of ingredients requires a chemistry degree to understand, IT IS NOT FOOD! Other points Pollan brings up were less obvious and more problematic. I would have liked to see him delve further into the inconvenient (and perhaps not merely accidental) truth that eating in the way he recommends (fresh foods in season, organic or small-farm raised, home-prepared meals, etc.) really isn't a viable choice for most lower-income Americans and especially for the urban poor who often only have access to convenience food-peddling convenience stores or lower-end grocery stores with higher prices for crappy produce.

He questions the need for (and effectiveness of) nutrient additives and the companies that tout them as better than the original. He makes a good case for the part food should daily play in conversation, celebration and relaxation. Not always easily read but a persuasive and, perhaps, life-changing call to action."

247,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"In short, the point of this book is to comprehensively answer the question ""What should the modern human eat, and how?"". Though at first glance it seems that this question has a plethora of obvious, simple answers, upon deeper inspection of the rocky ground upon which the reductionist ideology of nutritionism stands, Pollan convincingly presents counter advice to that of the traditional Western Nutitionist: Eating healthily is not about having more ""good"" nutrients and excluding the ""bad"" ones, but can instead be accomplished by the succinct yet profound advice of ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" Given this thesis statement, Pollan proceeds to eloquently elaborate upon this modern eater mantra, describing what he (and some nutrition scientists) considers ""food"", how to escape the modern ideology of nutritionism (the notion that ""food"" is really just the sum of it's nutrient components), and rules of thumb to live by with respect to what to eat (whole foods), how to eat (slowly, with family & friends), and why. As a whole, the book is a great, well-written argument against modern, western, reductionist nutrition science, and urges readers to eat local, whole (unprocessed) foods, with the people they love, avoiding any foodstuff that your great-grandparents wouldn't recognize as food. With more than enough well-cited nutrition research, this book presents a way-of-eating that is more than just a diet; Pollan succeeds in building a convincing holistic ideology about eating that just may bring modern western society back from the brink of ubiquitous avoidable chronic disease, if only more of us were willing to spend more time in energy in food preparation and consumption."
248,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46843663-candace,3,"Maybe more like 3.5 stars, it's hard to say. I had meant to read this ages ago, after The Omnivore's Dilemma which I really enjoyed. This one didn't hold up quite as well for me, for a lot of the reasons you can find browsing the other reviews: Pollan is a journalist, not a scientist, so many of his health assertions came off as anecdotal instead of being based on research. His style worked more in previous books where he was following food chains and describing his adventures therein, leaving the reader to likewise draw conclusions. Aside from all that, the base claim to eat more whole foods, try to avoid excessively processed foods, enjoy the food you eat, don't be afraid to spend time preparing it instead of watching TV, etc, is all good life advice, so if it can apply to you and you take it for what it is, I would recommend. His tone is particularly classist/""just don't be poor"" in some of these parts, where he says that buying whole foods isn't that expensive if you can justify spending money on cable TV and internet. In some ways it's not wholly wrong, but definitely spoken as from someone who never had to make that choice between foods with less ingredients on the label and having in-home access to information technology. Not to mention the millions of people who live with even less money so that they still don't have internet at home and also need to make hard choices at the grocery store. I should stop before I lower my rating haha!"
249,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27331649-nathan,3,"MIchael Pollan is always an interesting read just due to the way that he formats his books (though it probably helps that I am usually interested in the topics he writes about). He is able to string together history, science, and personal story to make an engaging reading experience. This one is no exception and helped to make it a good read. He takes a skeptical look at ""nutritionism"", which is defined as an ideology structured around the isolated nutrients of food instead of food itself. The issue he has with this is that it is reductionist due to the complexity of food and how our bodies and environment interact with said food. And of course, he looks into the ""SAD"" diet which seems to be doing more harm than good as levels of chronic diseases and obesity continue to riseHis recommendations for eating are pretty simple statements like ""Don't eat anything your great grandmother wouldn't recognize"" or ""You are what you eat eats too"". Nothing groundbreaking here, but it was a nice little reminder for someone trying to eat less processed food. Because in its essence, this book is a defense of whole food and a warning about highly processed foods. I didn't come away with any large revelations about food, but maybe someone else would. Either way, it is a quick read and a compelling narrative. "
250,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7827335-sarah,5,"This book has changed the way I buy, cook, and view food. The thesis of the book is ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" This is an easy way to remember the things Pollan talks about in his book. This looks like a simple phrase, but there is a lot of info packed into that statement. For example, what actually qualifies as food. A very interesting part of this book was when Pollan talks about the importance of sitting down and eating dinner at a dinner table with others. Here is a quote that really stood out to me: ""It is at the dinner table that we socialize and civilize our children, teaching them manners and the art of conversation. At the dinner table parents can determine portion sizes, model eating and drinking behavior, and enforce social norms about greed and gluttony and waste. Shared meals are about much more than fueling bodies; they are uniquely human institutions where our species developed language and this thing we call culture.""Overall fantastic read that I would recommend to anyone who is concerned about health and eating. "
251,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15013052-deba-jyoti-khawas,4,"Michael Pollan has a great knack of making the complicated extremely simple. Like the first book I listened, Caffeine, this one is another great example of the same.Pollan, for this book, decides to take a big picture view of the social, cultural, economic and medical industries surrounding food and the act of eating in the current western diet. This allows him to point out many systematic trends and problems not found in information elsewhere.The book is also structured in a very logical way: Problems, effects and solutions. Each of the sections are limited in scope, but well researched. While at the same time, this book is not so dense as to scare off a casual person looking to improve health and eating.If I had to critique this book, one suggestion would be to carry forward this experiment for a long term and see if following Pollan's rules of eating actually changes someone's life in a meaningful way or not. Having said that, most of his suggestions seem very intuitive, logical, easy to keep in mind and track of. This book is surely worth the time you give it."
252,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27203016-michelle-curie,3,"You're served the core message of this book on its first page: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. Eating should be as simple as that. In the industrialised 21st century food comes in all forms, shapes and quantities is available to us. We don't have to fear starvation. We don't have to worry of having to eat anything we don't want to. But in a world where eating has never been easier, we seem to struggle the most. 
""I content that most of what we're consuming today is no longer, strictly speaking, food at all, and how we're consuming it - in the car, in front of the TV, and, increasingly, alone - is not really eating, at last not in the seven that civilisation has long understood the term.""
Pollan goes on explaining how we're being tricked today into thinking that the whole point of eating is to maintain and promote bodily health. This leads us to believing that we need to turn to ""health promoting"" food items to get the most out of what we consume. The flaws of the industry he explains make perfectly sense: there are people earning money from making us think that if we eat their food, we become better, prettier and healthier human beings. Pollan advices us to stay away from any food with health claims. Another problem that he talks about, but doesn't offer solutions to, is reductionist science. We have to admit that we know very little about nutrients and how and why food does what it does. Food is extremely complex and all of today's research and science of the field needs to be taken with a grain of salt, as we can be sure that not a whole picture has been painted in order to come up with report- and publish-worthy research. At several occasions Pollan simplifies, uses examples that feel a bit like a stretch or just not quite right, but the main message sounds reasonable: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."
253,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,3,"Pollan begins with a critique of ""nutritionism"" - which he holds as an ideology espousing ""that we should understand and engage with food and our bodies in terms of their nutritional and chemical constituents and requirements"" (27). His rationale is a catalog of poorly-conducted studies, false conclusions (the lipid hypothesis), industry influence, and abused findings that ignore complexity (margarine vs. butter). ""The problem with nutrient-by-nutrient nutrition science,"" according to NYU nutritionist Marion Nestle, ""is that it takes the nutrient out of the context of the food, the food out of the context of the diet, and the diet out of the context of the lifestyle"". (62) I diverge from Pollan substantially on the prescription: I do not think this is reason to give up on nutrition, but rather, is encouragement that we need to do better science. It is hard to find truth in nutrition - but not impossible. One only needs to look at the work of scientists like Valter Longo at USC, Christopher Gardner (author of the A to Z study), and each of the NuSI investigators to see that.His ultimate advice (""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."") is elegant, simple, and largely correct. Except for a section advising supplementation with multivitamins which to the best of my knowledge is not something that is supported by good empirical evidence (172).But I was put off by the fundamentally pessimistic voice. We can learn more through experimentation. It's a total fallacy that the local maxima embedded in traditional diets is the best that humanity can do. Just because fighting cancer is hard, and there have been false starts, doesn't mean that we should stop trying to develop new drugs. And nutrition is relevant to 7.4B humans - even a small truth is multiplied over a huge number of subjects."

I thought the best message from this book is that there is and just one way to eat better than you are probably eating today. The rules that he gives are not really too complicated.

He correctly, for instance, dives into the technical obstacles of doing good food science and some of the inherent problems of industrial food-production. But he mangles the data terribly in furtherance of a transparent agenda: to scare the reader into embracing ""whole foods."" And when I call his agenda transparent, I'm not trying to be hyperbolic.

The words ""The hypothesis hasn't been tested, but I'm convinced..."" are in this book. He's effectively saying ""No one's bothered to check this out, but it sure sounds good to me!""Even his own rhetoric shows up on both sides of his arguments. He frequently talks about the value of tradition, which he usually boils down to ""Mom."" ""Mom"" is the source of all cultural food wisdom, except in the introduction, where he describes the cooking of his own mother and talks about how both he and she have abandoned her traditional cuisine because it consists almost entirely meat. Similarly, saturated fats are basically harmless when he's talking about how foolish scientists got us addicted to trans fats instead. But saturated fats are to be avoided when he's talking about the nutritional benefits of grass-fed beef. Side note: he devotes a lot of ink to the folly of ""nutritionism,"" but is perfectly happy to use nutritional information to extol the virtues of grass-fed beef.He constantly decries food science as ""reductionist"" without really considering the implications. In a telling example, he talks about how there are health benefits of thyme, but argues that reductionist scientists would foolishly experiment to try and find out which of the chemical components of thyme make it so. But he ignores the fact that reductionist science is the only way to know thyme has health benefits in the first place! What kind of science would he have us do? ""You know, it seems like the Italians are pretty healthy. I guess we'll just leave it there."" Although that's effectively the argument he ends up making on behalf of the Italians, the Greeks, the French, and the Japanese (although you should avoid fish because of mercury). Tradition good. Science bad.And food science? Food science REALLY bad. It's as though every misstep that was made in an admittedly complex field over the past sixty years is proof that we should chuck it all and go to the farmer's market. Never mind that those missteps were caught by other scientists, and that often they weren't missteps at all, but the results of aggressive marketing and inept journalism. And I love farmer's markets, but they are not the solution to your dietary problems. They're a luxury for upper-middle class people who live in metropolitan areas. In fact--and perhaps this is what I find to be the most damning--all of his constipated reasoning congeals into food advice that can be summarized like this: Do all the trendy stuff that rich food-snobs are already doing.Seriously.

Some of his suggestions are common sense and things I've been doing for years--i.e., if the list of ingredients requires a chemistry degree to understand, IT IS NOT FOOD! Other points Pollan brings up were less obvious and more problematic. I would have liked to see him delve further into the inconvenient (and perhaps not merely accidental) truth that eating in the way he recommends (fresh foods in season, organic or small-farm raised, home-prepared meals, etc.) really isn't a viable choice for most lower-income Americans and especially for the urban poor who often only have access to convenience food-peddling convenience stores or lower-end grocery stores with higher prices for crappy produce.

He is an excellent writer and has clearly researched his writings very extensively.This book traces the evolution of food culture throughout the years, addressing how we choose what foods are good or bad to eat as well as the underlying government and political influences involved. There is so much to discover for a reader new to his teachings, but I still found plenty to learn even though I'm familiar with his work. Reading this book will most certainly cause you to view food, real food, in an entirely new light."
272,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,4,"Michael Pollan wants us to consider food in a larger context than simply its nutritional content. He warns us that, to do otherwise, will affect both our health and our contentment. He points out many of the dangers of the ""western diet"" and supports his thesis with demography and specifics about food that is over processed to preserve it and send it around the world. He questions the need for (and effectiveness of) nutrient additives and the companies that tout them as better than the original. He makes a good case for the part food should daily play in conversation, celebration and relaxation. Not always easily read but a persuasive and, perhaps, life-changing call to action."

As a single mom, I surely can't afford to buy only organic and grass-fed foods, and I can assure you that I won't be giving up my microwave any time soon.

277,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,5,"In short, the point of this book is to comprehensively answer the question ""What should the modern human eat, and how?"". Though at first glance it seems that this question has a plethora of obvious, simple answers, upon deeper inspection of the rocky ground upon which the reductionist ideology of nutritionism stands, Pollan convincingly presents counter advice to that of the traditional Western Nutitionist: Eating healthily is not about having more ""good"" nutrients and excluding the ""bad"" ones, but can instead be accomplished by the succinct yet profound advice of ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" Given this thesis statement, Pollan proceeds to eloquently elaborate upon this modern eater mantra, describing what he (and some nutrition scientists) considers ""food"", how to escape the modern ideology of nutritionism (the notion that ""food"" is really just the sum of it's nutrient components), and rules of thumb to live by with respect to what to eat (whole foods), how to eat (slowly, with family & friends), and why. As a whole, the book is a great, well-written argument against modern, western, reductionist nutrition science, and urges readers to eat local, whole (unprocessed) foods, with the people they love, avoiding any foodstuff that your great-grandparents wouldn't recognize as food. With more than enough well-cited nutrition research, this book presents a way-of-eating that is more than just a diet; Pollan succeeds in building a convincing holistic ideology about eating that just may bring modern western society back from the brink of ubiquitous avoidable chronic disease, if only more of us were willing to spend more time in energy in food preparation and consumption."
278,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46843663-candace,3,"Maybe more like 3.5 stars, it's hard to say. I had meant to read this ages ago, after The Omnivore's Dilemma which I really enjoyed. This one didn't hold up quite as well for me, for a lot of the reasons you can find browsing the other reviews: Pollan is a journalist, not a scientist, so many of his health assertions came off as anecdotal instead of being based on research. His style worked more in previous books where he was following food chains and describing his adventures therein, leaving the reader to likewise draw conclusions. Aside from all that, the base claim to eat more whole foods, try to avoid excessively processed foods, enjoy the food you eat, don't be afraid to spend time preparing it instead of watching TV, etc, is all good life advice, so if it can apply to you and you take it for what it is, I would recommend. His tone is particularly classist/""just don't be poor"" in some of these parts, where he says that buying whole foods isn't that expensive if you can justify spending money on cable TV and internet. In some ways it's not wholly wrong, but definitely spoken as from someone who never had to make that choice between foods with less ingredients on the label and having in-home access to information technology. Not to mention the millions of people who live with even less money so that they still don't have internet at home and also need to make hard choices at the grocery store. I should stop before I lower my rating haha!"
279,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27331649-nathan,3,"MIchael Pollan is always an interesting read just due to the way that he formats his books (though it probably helps that I am usually interested in the topics he writes about). He is able to string together history, science, and personal story to make an engaging reading experience. This one is no exception and helped to make it a good read. He takes a skeptical look at ""nutritionism"", which is defined as an ideology structured around the isolated nutrients of food instead of food itself. The issue he has with this is that it is reductionist due to the complexity of food and how our bodies and environment interact with said food. And of course, he looks into the ""SAD"" diet which seems to be doing more harm than good as levels of chronic diseases and obesity continue to riseHis recommendations for eating are pretty simple statements like ""Don't eat anything your great grandmother wouldn't recognize"" or ""You are what you eat eats too"". Nothing groundbreaking here, but it was a nice little reminder for someone trying to eat less processed food. Because in its essence, this book is a defense of whole food and a warning about highly processed foods. I didn't come away with any large revelations about food, but maybe someone else would. Either way, it is a quick read and a compelling narrative. "
280,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7827335-sarah,5,"This book has changed the way I buy, cook, and view food. The thesis of the book is ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" This is an easy way to remember the things Pollan talks about in his book. This looks like a simple phrase, but there is a lot of info packed into that statement. For example, what actually qualifies as food. A very interesting part of this book was when Pollan talks about the importance of sitting down and eating dinner at a dinner table with others. Here is a quote that really stood out to me: ""It is at the dinner table that we socialize and civilize our children, teaching them manners and the art of conversation. At the dinner table parents can determine portion sizes, model eating and drinking behavior, and enforce social norms about greed and gluttony and waste. Shared meals are about much more than fueling bodies; they are uniquely human institutions where our species developed language and this thing we call culture.""Overall fantastic read that I would recommend to anyone who is concerned about health and eating. "
281,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15013052-deba-jyoti-khawas,4,"Michael Pollan has a great knack of making the complicated extremely simple. Like the first book I listened, Caffeine, this one is another great example of the same.Pollan, for this book, decides to take a big picture view of the social, cultural, economic and medical industries surrounding food and the act of eating in the current western diet. This allows him to point out many systematic trends and problems not found in information elsewhere.The book is also structured in a very logical way: Problems, effects and solutions. Each of the sections are limited in scope, but well researched. While at the same time, this book is not so dense as to scare off a casual person looking to improve health and eating.If I had to critique this book, one suggestion would be to carry forward this experiment for a long term and see if following Pollan's rules of eating actually changes someone's life in a meaningful way or not. Having said that, most of his suggestions seem very intuitive, logical, easy to keep in mind and track of. This book is surely worth the time you give it."
282,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27203016-michelle-curie,3,"You're served the core message of this book on its first page: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. Eating should be as simple as that. In the industrialised 21st century food comes in all forms, shapes and quantities is available to us. We don't have to fear starvation. We don't have to worry of having to eat anything we don't want to. But in a world where eating has never been easier, we seem to struggle the most. 
""I content that most of what we're consuming today is no longer, strictly speaking, food at all, and how we're consuming it - in the car, in front of the TV, and, increasingly, alone - is not really eating, at last not in the seven that civilisation has long understood the term.""
Pollan goes on explaining how we're being tricked today into thinking that the whole point of eating is to maintain and promote bodily health. This leads us to believing that we need to turn to ""health promoting"" food items to get the most out of what we consume. The flaws of the industry he explains make perfectly sense: there are people earning money from making us think that if we eat their food, we become better, prettier and healthier human beings. Pollan advices us to stay away from any food with health claims. Another problem that he talks about, but doesn't offer solutions to, is reductionist science. We have to admit that we know very little about nutrients and how and why food does what it does. Food is extremely complex and all of today's research and science of the field needs to be taken with a grain of salt, as we can be sure that not a whole picture has been painted in order to come up with report- and publish-worthy research. At several occasions Pollan simplifies, uses examples that feel a bit like a stretch or just not quite right, but the main message sounds reasonable: Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."
283,1594201455,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63879552-sebastian,3,"Pollan begins with a critique of ""nutritionism"" - which he holds as an ideology espousing ""that we should understand and engage with food and our bodies in terms of their nutritional and chemical constituents and requirements"" (27). His rationale is a catalog of poorly-conducted studies, false conclusions (the lipid hypothesis), industry influence, and abused findings that ignore complexity (margarine vs. butter). ""The problem with nutrient-by-nutrient nutrition science,"" according to NYU nutritionist Marion Nestle, ""is that it takes the nutrient out of the context of the food, the food out of the context of the diet, and the diet out of the context of the lifestyle"". (62) I diverge from Pollan substantially on the prescription: I do not think this is reason to give up on nutrition, but rather, is encouragement that we need to do better science. It is hard to find truth in nutrition - but not impossible. One only needs to look at the work of scientists like Valter Longo at USC, Christopher Gardner (author of the A to Z study), and each of the NuSI investigators to see that.His ultimate advice (""Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."") is elegant, simple, and largely correct. Except for a section advising supplementation with multivitamins which to the best of my knowledge is not something that is supported by good empirical evidence (172).But I was put off by the fundamentally pessimistic voice. We can learn more through experimentation. It's a total fallacy that the local maxima embedded in traditional diets is the best that humanity can do. Just because fighting cancer is hard, and there have been false starts, doesn't mean that we should stop trying to develop new drugs. And nutrition is relevant to 7.4B humans - even a small truth is multiplied over a huge number of subjects."

It did give me things to think about which is the main reason I sometimes read nonfiction. The main problem for me personally is that I hate nearly all vegetables and actively dislike nearly all fruits. So I'm pretty much screwed, but now I know even more reasons why I should feel bad about it.I don't listen to audiobooks very much so I don't have a lot to compare the narration to. It was ok, but seemed to be a little on the cheesy side to me - sometimes dragging out a word only served to draw me out of the information to marvel at 'TOK...sens' (toxins)."

Like, I do agree with his main premise: ""Eat food. Not too much. Mainly plants.""

Also, he argues that food research often is wrong, then uses research without control group and a small sample size to support his own argument.
