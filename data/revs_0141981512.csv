0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1254616-nick,5,"If you're not familiar with Lovelace and Babbage, Sydney Padua's delight-filled webcomic, rejoice! It has now made the transition to print. You can pick up a doorstop of brilliant Victoriana-flavoured geeky humour, historically painstaking footnoting, and lovely art - and you should do so IMMEDIATELY. Let me just acknowledge right now that I'm not even trying to be objective: Sydney's comic always hit the sweet spot of my sense of how the world ought to be. Her riff on the (factually rather grim) story of Lovelace and Babbage and their not-quite creation of the computer in the 1800s is brain jazz. It's filled with digressions, anachronisms and sketch protrayals of famous Victorians, all riven through with an ebullient goofiness. This is history as I wish it was: bright, caring and full of zing. It's also the modern world through a Padua prism, with jokes about Twitter and Venn diagrams sprinkled into the dialogue. That said, there's also a truth here, as you can immediately see if you dip into Babbage's own writing: Sydney's portrayal of him as a Dickensian steam-age petrolhead with cranky uncle basenotes is spot on, and Lovelace - whose true historical upbringing was like something from a Warren Ellis comic about the Fascist precursors of the Superman concept - was every bit as quirky. There's something else going on, too, which is worth mentioning: this is a book about the creative process and the creative mind, with its fancies and magpie distractability, its excitements and sloughs of despond. I recognise the protagonists in myself and my friends and family, just as I do when I read Ray Bradbury's Zen in the Art of Writing or G H Hardy's remarkable A Mathematician's Apology. Creativity varies in its output according to any number of personality traits, but the process seems to be remarkably similar across disciplines: great artists, great activists, great poets, and great scientists share a veering perpendicular humour, and it's alive here, in this book.That's why I ran around like a four year old yesterday after Sydney dropped in my copy: because this book is full of life. Go. Get it."

Unfortunately, reading this work is not near as interesting as browsing through it. It consists of musings on what would have happened if Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace had actually built Babbage's difference engine. Almost every page has footnotes, many of the footnotes have very long endnotes, and occasionally an endnote will have a footnote. It's not clear whether the footnotes serve the panels or the panels serve the footnotes. Taken on its own the ""graphic novel"" part is pretty thin, and it's very difficult to get a reading flow going with the constant interruptions. There are some interesting appendices with excerpts from primary sources and a description of how the difference engine was supposed to work.Also, don't expect to get detailed insight into the technical accomplishments of ether Babbage or Lovelace. The author (whom I hate to criticize because she seems incredibly likable and talented based on this work) seems in over her head when it comes to technical details.Despite my review, the popularity of this book on Goodreads may convince you to ignore me and read it anyway (I don't blame you). I see that this title is available on Kindle. Don't even think about it - you need a hard copy."
2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30800-oriana,5,"Typically I wait to review J&C books until after we have our book club meeting (if I remember to actually review them at all), but I've just this moment finished Lovelace & Babbage, and it was so utterly splendid that I had to write about it immediately. I was pretty stoked about this one going in (I wrote an article about Ada on Atlas Obscura for Lovelace Day last year), but still I was completely blown away. This book is so charming, so monstrously intelligent, and so, so incredibly much fun. Sydney Padua is brilliant: a brilliant scholar, a brilliant researcher, a brilliant putter-together of seriously complex mini-plots, and just a brilliant entertainer overall. Here's a quick note on the book's (brilliant) structure: Victorian mathematician Ada Lovelace is most famous for having taken a short French paper about one of inventor Charles Babbage's (very complex) lectures and then translated and annotated it, her notes amounting to about 2-1/2 times the length of the original paper. Padua has written this book in the same way, with each comics page footed by an inch or several of notes, as well as extensive endnotes at the back of each vignette. All the extraneous material allows Padua to demonstrate the dazzling breadth of research she has done, from descriptions of each historical figure in endless articles and books and private correspondences, down to all these great askance mentions in obscure journals, even including a recipe for Ada's favorite toothpaste. (!!!)Padua opens the book with thumbnail histories of Ada (""It's not easy being the daughter of Lord Byron, a celebrity mad genius deviant sex god, and Ada was monitored by the entire country, it sometimes seemed, for signs of madness, genius, and deviant sex. She would gratify expectations of all of the above."") and Charles (""Babbage's long, illustrious, and varied career was characterized by both innovative genius and constant drama and strangely petty quarrels."") Then she moves into the parameters of the pocket universe in which the rest of the book will take place—one wherein Ada did not die young and Charles did build his Difference Engine, which would have been the very first computer had it ever made it off the page and into reality. And then we're off on adventures! Padua packs each one to the absolute hilt with 19th-century arcana, quotes from Ada and Charles' myriad written works, intricate tracings of how everyone in Victorian England knew one another, and cameos from a whole bunch of actual historical figures, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge (whose attempt at poetry Ada foils), George Eliot (whom Charles must save from the Curse of the Typos), and Queen Victoria (whose favor Ada secures via binary pictures of cats—LOL). The final and longest vignette recasts Ada as Alice lost in a mathematical poetical Wonderland, wherein Lewis Carroll's mathematical proclivities are brought to bear and the footnotes themselves emerge as a central character. There's also a larger-than-life cigar-chomping steam engineer, an attack on the Engine by Luddites, digressions on Euclidian geometry, and an appendix full of source material, including a triumphantly discovered letter exonerating Ada's (highly contested) genius whose footnote reads, in part, ""this was my introduction to the very great thrill of throw-down victory in Combat Scholarship.""Holy good god every bit of this is so stunningly wonderful. I can't believe how much I adored it! It's easily in my top 5 graphic novels evaaar. "

4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/270740-meagan,5,"Most important thing first: Where can one acquire action figures of these versions of Lovelace and Babbage? Because I need them. My life is not whole without them. I am 100% serious about this. Someone get on it.Now to details. This weird little book is delightful. It takes the already fascinating story about the friendship of two mathematicians developing the idea for the first computer, and then ramps it up. What would the world have been like if Babbage had actually seen this through and built his difference engine, rather than scrapping it unfinished in favor of the analytical engine, which he also never finished due to never ending improvements and tinkering with the design? Also assuming that Ada Lovelace hadn't died so young of cancer, of course. According to Sydney Padua, the world would have been awesome. It would have been Victorian Steampunk, fully realized. (And this is not so difficult to believe, really. Imagine - the Victorians with steam-powered computers built of brass cogs. The mind boggles.) Also imagine that Lovelace and Babbage teamed up to use the difference engine in the fight against the world's greatest evils - poetry and street music.I find it difficult to express how much I enjoyed reading this. From the way Lovelace and Babbage are drawn, to the appearances of George Eliot, (the epically named) Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Charles Dickens, and Queen Victoria herself. The humor was spot on. The author did her research, points out where her version differs from reality, and shares her sources. I want more. So, so much more. I want Saturday morning cartoons. Halloween costumes. Movies. And action figures. Seriously, guys. Who's making that happen?"
5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"This seemed like a comic perhaps more for my partner than me (and lo, she did love it), but I wanted to give it a try too after hearing some stuff about it on the radio… somewhere. And Robert kindly sent me his copy to peruse, so I had no excuse (and didn’t really want to find one anyway). I like the art — it’s cute, but not too cute; lively and character-ful, without feeling like caricature. And the sense of humour suits mine pretty well too.If you’re looking for a serious what-if about the Difference Engine, then this isn’t really your show; the comic itself is more about the characters, their endearing characteristics, their partnership. It’s based heavily on material surviving from the correspondence of and commentary on Lovelace and Babbage, but the events themselves are fanciful, often ludicrous, for the sake of a fun rather than “educational” comic. It works well, if that’s what you’re here for — and even if you aren’t, there’s a whole wealth of info contained in the footnotes and the appendices.One thing I did find awkward about reading this was how busy the pages are. Text! Everywhere! Here’s a footnote there’s a footnote and another little footnote! My brain is not very good visually at all, so I found it cluttered and distracting at times. Colour might have helped; maybe not.Still, overall fun and yes please to Ada Lovelace as hero.Originally posted here."

It pokes fun at itself, it makes mention of technologies that the reader will know to ease them into the world of Ada and Charles, it calls servants ""minions"" to add just the right amount of comedic relief, but it lacks fluidity. There is an overwhelming amount of footnotes, endnotes, technical explanations, passages from letter exchanges, etc. It becomes visually distracting and often does nothing to add to the graphic portion of the novel. I think that it's almost meant to be the other way round, where the graphic portion is only there to support the footnotes/endnotes. I admire the art, but overall I can't say I think this was a successful graphic novel. It's just too busy."

If mathematics can have imaginary numbers that are incredibly important for certain types of equations, then literature can definitely have imaginary histories that are incredibly important to our understanding of the world."
8,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is beautifully drawn and a wellspring of geeky, Victorian fun. Sydney Padua is an animator and visual effects artist who started a comic series to work out her obsessions with Ada Lovelace (widely credited as the first computer programmer) and Charles Babbage (widely credited as the designer of the first computer). Padua assembles the little we know about these historical figures and lays it out in illustrated/annotated form: Lovelace was the daughter of famous poet Lord Byron. She had an immense aptitude for math, and perhaps a bit of a temper. Babbage was brilliant and self-obsessed, but never actually constructed his difference engine, let alone his grander design for an analytical engine, despite funding from the crown. Lovelace and Babbage knew each other and collaborated: Lovelace contributed to the software side of what Babbage sought to establish with calculating hardware.Having reached the somewhat disappointing conclusion of the bare facts, Padua transports us into her Pocket Universe, an expanded alternate reality in which the analytical engine was not only built, but used by Lovelace and Babbage to solve crime, rejigger an economy, and parse written language. In this counterfactual space, Victorian figures both known and unknown to the real Lovelace and Babbage (Mostly known! It is fascinating to hear about interactions with the likes of Queen Victoria, Charles Darwin, and Charles Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll) play roles, and Padua synthesizes fun observations and snippets of research (much of it original) into a coherent narrative. She does so with elaborate and wide-ranging footnotes that provide equal parts geeky fun and tedium, depending on how interested you are in the topic at hand. Padua has fun with this, often at the expense of her own fixations. In some cases, the characters themselves intervene to block footnotes or blast them off the page. It's smart, it's playful, it's irreverent, and it's educational in the I'm-not-so-sure-I'm-ever-actually-going-to-use-this-but-my-goodness-it's-fun sense. It may not be for everyone, but it certainly is for me, and I benefited from many of the connections and references.And the illustrations! Padua has a loose, confident style that bespeaks skilled observation. She draws with a thick-and-thin line and a sense of caricature that recalls Bill Waterson's Calvin & Hobbes, but is suffused with rough hatching to evoke the engravings of the era (which are often worked into the illustrations). It's all very steam punk, which is appropriate: it's hard to get more steampunk in real life than Babbage's designs for the difference engine and analytical engine, with their towering columns of spinning cogs and number-carrying arms (a version of Babbage's difference engine was constructed in the early 21st century: you can see some of the amazing footage here). Much of the humor is conveyed through very subtle expressions and postures, and I spent a lot of time just staring at the drawings. At times you can tell that Padua was working quickly or roughly, but she is good at suggesting detail where real detail has not been rendered.While Padua is careful to state areas of ignorance and qualify examples of incomplete knowledge, there is so much good, interesting, well-researched and well-explained information here that I can't help but think of it as a scholarly work, even as we engage in caricature, wordplay, whimsy and parody. Highly recommended to all of my fun-loving nerdy friends."

Given the subject matter, it's hardly surprising that both history and math play a large part in the weird and somewhat silly imaginary adventures of nineteenth century math geeks. I expected that, but the sheer depth of research information is somewhat overwhelming. And by that, I mainly mean all the mathematics, because math is absolutely impossible for me to understand. Still, I greatly respect the sheer level of detail all that research has lead to. And you can actually read the book entirely without going through all the math footnotes, because those weird and silly adventures are actually fun to read. "

You'll be lost in these pages for months (at least I was) reading footnotes, not remembering or even caring what they're footnotes of, learning tidbits of useless knowledge, giggling at obscure nerd jokes or visual puns. But in the process you'll also get to know Babbage, Ada, and Sydney, three personalities that really shine through here. Through the eyes of Sydney Padua, we get to know these historical figures not simply from their accomplishments, but from what they COULD have done as well, in alternate parallel universes. Sydney's enthusiasm for these characters infects every page from a mind-boggling amount of research to lovingly drawn expressions. This isn't a stuffy history, it's exactly what history should be: fun, creative, exciting, and getting to know REAL people, facts be damned (I say that but everything here is BASED on fact, it's that she also riffs off of them and is not afraid to go down crazy conjectures that makes this book so unique and personal and not at all a boring history)."

The adventures are as heavily footnoted as the real history, so one can learn a great deal about the historical figures, the process of digging through history for evidence, and more. Great fun for all ages, although the really young would need an advanced reader to help."

Two brilliant minds, with personalities larger than life and 24 years of age apart, met one fateful day on June 5th, 1833. The rest, as they say, is history. (And copiously footnoted) *.   Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage were way ahead of their times in Victorian London. He was a wealthy inventor and the Cambridge Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, hailed in modern era as “father of the computer” having invented the pre-pre-pre-precursor to modern computers called the Difference Machine. In 1837, Babbage embarked on an vastly more ambitious project to build the Analytical Machine. A metal monstrosity, it can calculate long strings of numbers (up to 15 decimal places of pi). A tiny section of the Analytical Machine looks like this:  … But it was probably meant to look like this:   Babbage’s notoriety was well-known within the elite intellectual circle of Victorian Who’s Who. He wrote prolifically in diverse scientific pursuits, threw lavish parties, hung with literary heavyweights, has a personal vendetta against street music among many idiosyncrasies, and was forcefully opinionated. In short, Babbage was obnoxious and eccentric but was tolerated with amusement because he was A Brilliant Scientist. However, while Babbage was a numbers and technical whiz, being all about nuts and bolts, levers and cranks, formulae and ratios, he lacked creative vision. Entered Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess Lovelace, with her incredible leaps of the imagination. At a young age, Lovelace was steered into a rigid mathematics path by a mother determined to squash the poetic impulses that drove her father, the famous and infamous poet, Lord Byron, to madness.   Lovelace pursued science fervently, and implored her mother to ‘Pray find out all you can for me, about everything curious, mysterious, marvellous, electrical, etc., etc.” In her collaboration with Babbage, she wrote the first published algorithm for the Analytical Machine, by exploring its utility far beyond number-crunching to more abstract manipulation of music and symbols. Lovelace was on to a very futuristic concept, and for this, she is known as a visionary of the computer age. An excerpt from Lovelace’s, ‘Notes upon L. F. Menabrea’s “Sketch of the Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage”  ‘Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.’ Lovelace’s inherent “madness” - suspected bipolar disorder, a genetic trait through her father - manifested despite attempts to suppress it. Prone to illness, she succumbed to ovarian cancer at age 39 years, just 11 years after her first encounter with Babbage, who remained a loving friend till his own death as a cranky curmudgeon at age 79. Her calling card, inscribed with her cursive handwriting the word “Interesting”, was found in his deathbed possession. The Analytical Machine was never completed, but its inventor and its ""high priestess"" are remembered.   [* Footnotes1. The real story is thoroughly researched and generously illustrated by Sydney Padua in The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The Mostly (True) Story of the First Computer2. Shoddy review not worthy of the book, er, comic, book with comic? Graphics novel? No, comics in a book. Whatever. It’s fun. 3. Besides the real history, Padua gleefully re-imagined alternate what-if stories of the duo in a pocket multiverse. They are all funny, except the real one. Well, the real one is funnily portrayed, but people died and the machine wasn’t built. So, it’s funny, but not too funny. More like a quirk at the corner of your smile.4. Queen Victoria made an appearance. On a horse. 5. The real stars, Lovelace and Babbage, outshine their caricatures. Padua’s lighthearted interpretations and comedic superimposition added playfulness, but it felt a little short in capturing the emotional depths of this pair. Yes, yes, comics as a medium is usually two-dimensional but maybe I hoped for less slapstick.6. Many footnotes annotate the illustrations. Excessively many footnotes. Sometimes they run into pages. And pages. All good stuff though, they flesh out the pictures.7. Only 7 footnotes in my review.  ….. 8. Ok, I lied. Recommended for geeks and non-geeks alike who actually have a bit in common. We all can't live without our computers, can we?]"
16,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2492588-katie,4,"This is one of the most charming things I've ever come across: a sweet, fun graphic novel that explores the lives of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, often credited with being the creators of the first proto-computer in the 1840s. Sydney Padua skirts around the fact that both of their stories had relatively sad endings - Ada died young, Charles old and bitter - by spinning them off into their own pocket universe, where their Analytical Engine was actually built and used by the pair to go on thrilling adventures together. Like I said: super charming. Sydney Padua essentially lets her characters speak for themselves, which is essentially the best and worst part of this graphic novel. It's be best, because Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace are SUPER interesting on their own, and because Padua does a great job presenting the info in a lively and witty manner. This book is spilling over with fun historical anecdotes, to the extent that once every 5-6 pages I'd feel the need to write some of them down, or run off and share it with a friend. Babbage and Lovelace are A+ protagonists: Lovelace is the daughter of the infamous Lord Byron, trained from a young age to stay as far away from the unspeakable dangers of poetry and pushed into the more sober realm of mathematics (it didn't work, of course - her math quickly became theoretical, abstract, and poetic). She was also an expert horsewoman, a trait passed on to her daughter, whose travels through Arabia resulted in the arrival in Europe of 90% of modern Arabian horses found on the continent. One gets the impression that she was brilliant and imaginative (if, in the real universe, somewhat unhappy). I sort of want to be her now. Babbage was clearly a firebrand, a brilliant, emotional man who unfortunately was far better at planning projects than ever seeing them through. He threw lavish parties, was popular and gregarious but also moody and ready to spew forth a lengthy denunciation of his enemies. His Difference Engine was a behemoth of a calculating machine, a whir of gears and columns and pinions designed to mechanically compute vast numbers of sums. He was funded by the government, which was understandably less than pleased when he got bored of it and moved onto the more ambitious Analytical Engine, capable of carrying out programs beyond simple arithmetic. Babbage was genuinely furious and perplexed that the government, despite his failure to finish his project, did not fall over itself to give him more money. He also, later in life, became most famous in Victorian London for his impassioned campaign against street musicians. Sydney Padua does not waste this golden opportunity, and this graphic novel is a total delight to read. It would be worth it solely for the wonderful array of historical anecdotes to be found in the footnotes, and the lively & imaginative style that's present throughout. I do wish that the story itself was a little bit more ambitious, though. Rather than have a full, overarching narrative, Lovelace and Babbage go on several mini adventures, largely designed to have them interact with other characters of the period, like George Eliot or the inimitable Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It's fun, but I would have loved to see these characters take on a more ambitious narrative arc in their pocket universe. Maybe next time? I'll save the 5 stars for that hypothetical thrilling adventure. "
17,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29806153-high-plains-library-district,5,"Allow me to take a moment to review a book that could be considered a bit strange to a general audience. Let me see if I can describe what kind of book it is.It’s a graphic novel based on historical people and events. Kind of. Charles Babbage, an inventor, and Ada Lovelace, a mathematician (and the daughter of poet Lord Byron), are widely credited with the idea for the first computer. They called it the Analytical Engine and it was never built, but the early ideas of computer science are there. This is kind of their story, but you’ll also see other famous Victorians, like George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Isambard Kingdom Brunel (is that a great name or what?), and Queen Victoria herself.It’s also about science and technology. Sydney Padua did a lot of research about Lovelace and Babbage and about their work on the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine. She takes the time to explain the ideas behind these Victorian computers, and goes over the plans for the machines and how they would work. There are cartoon diagrams! If you’re interested in science and engineering from the Industrial Age, you’ll definitely find it here.It’s also, and this is my favorite part, a fictional account of what the world might have been like if Lovelace hadn’t died young of cancer, and if the duo had actually built their Analytical Engine. (Which is called by its calculator-like predecessor’s name, the Difference Engine. Because let’s be honest. Difference Engine sounds much cooler.) What that ends up looking like is an epic mashup of science and steampunk aesthetic. It’s a steampunk adventure starring scientists. The Difference Engine takes up an entire massive building (and is constantly growing), and a pipe-smoking Ada Lovelace and be-goggled Charles Babbage climb through the works to keep it in operation. There are runaway steam engines. There’s a wild herd of cats living in the machine. It’s the nerdiest fun I’ve had in ages.The final thing I want to say, and I’ve said it before, is that I want Sydney Padua to license her Lovelace and Babbage as action figures. Because having Lovelace and Babbage action figures would make my life as a nerd complete. Be honest. Who wouldn't want these two living on a shelf somewhere? No one, that's who.Here are some other books that might appeal to the nerd in all of us:There’s less narrative in Hark! A Vagrant than in The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage, but there is plenty of history and humor. If you like jokes about Napoleon and Shakespeare and the Brontës made in comic strip format, this is your book.For more of the sciencey steampunk stuff, try Clockwork Game: The Illustrious Career of A Chess-Playing Automaton. It tells the story of a chess-playing automaton – and Charles Babbage actually challenged it. History!Or, if you want to cut out all the fun and just have the straight science, you can learn more about the real Lovelace and Babbage in Architects of the Information Age.-Meagan"
18,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5916992-albert,4,"The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer by Sydney Padua is an irreverent and quirky view of what could have been the most outstanding scientific collaboration that didn't happen. Padua tells her tale in a graphic comic format with artwork reminiscent of early turn of the century (the 1900s) political cartoons. Its fun! Its awesome! Its over indulgent cheesecake for the geek universe!Charles Babbage is Victorian London's unrecognized inventor of what would become the modern day computer with his plans for a monstrous mechanical calculating machine. Ada Lovelace is the Countess of Lovelace and daughter of the mad and brilliant poet, Lord Byron. Ada Lovelace translates a description of Babbage's calculating machine with annotations that were three times longer than the original plans. These footnotes from Lovelace actually contain the first known general computing theory, a century before the first actual computer was built! Unfortunately Lovelace passed away before her paper was ever published and Babbage never built his brilliant machine. Sydney Padua creates an alternate reality where Lovelace and Babbage create their awesome calculating machine. A behemoth that grows and grows in steam powered engines, and gears, and analytics, and doo dads and just freakin' awesome stuff. They will open up and explore the wild and untamed dimensions of mathematics! They will create economic models to stave off depressions! The will battle the demons of spelling errors! And for the Queen herself, create dot matrix kittens!Tongue in cheek perhaps, totally geeky surely, but fun all the same. Original. Thought provoking. Full of ""what if"" and untapped potential. In Babbage, the blustering scientist whose uncompromising and attitude make him a social pariah, Padua has developed a character whose brilliance makes him an outsider to a society he frowns upon but needs to continue his work. In Lovelace, the pre-feminist in Victorian society whose love of mathematics is only rivaled by her fear and disdain for poetry and the arts. Poetry which is in too many ways her opium, her drug, her weakness as she abhors the immoral ways of her father. Together they could have accomplished the unthinkable and in The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage, they do. Granted by happenstance at times but isn't half the fun?A terrific read!"

I’m not totally sure what it is, but I had a terrific time reading it.When I say that I don’t know what it is, I’m referring to the ratio between fact and fiction. It certainly is a graphic novel, but with surprising points as both graphic and novel. Although it certainly feels novel, I’m not totally certain that it IS a novel, if you catch my drift.And if you like the kind of book where authors include lots of asides that induce laughter and add information while being both tongue-in-cheek and also true, you will love this book.It purports to be a graphic novel that started as a webcomic about the fictional adventures of an alternate Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, where they actually managed to build Babbage’s famous Analytical Machine and Lovelace wrote programs for it that were able to be input, instead of the real world where Babbage started lots of inventions but never finished them, and Lovelace died of cancer in her mid-30s, after having written a seminal article on computer programming that she never got to see put into use.This fictional world is much more fun. But in detailing the fictional adventures of our intrepid hero and heroine, the author manages to insert an incredible amount of real information, often in the form of footnotes and asides, that is taken verbatim from contemporary accounts of Lovelace and Babbage.And there are LOTS of surviving documents. The Victorians were very prolific (or profligate) writers, and Babbage and Lovelace were both quasi-celebrities. Lovelace was the daughter of Lord Byron, and Babbage, was, well, Babbage. He held a mathematics professorship at Cambridge that had been formerly held by Isaac Newton. Babbage was also infamous for misplacing government grant money, including a large grant for his Difference Engine. Babbage held large, well-attended parties, and famously argued with lots of people, many of them influential, about lots of things. In public and in writing.Both Lovelace and Babbage were well-known mathematics geniuses, and they were good friends. The exact nature of that friendship is subject to debate, but they wrote to each other voluminously.In other words, the author of this book had oodles of material to work with.While the story that emerges in the webcomic is definitely fictional, the underpinning facts are relayed in a way that makes readers laugh out loud, and provides a surprising amount of understanding about two figures who did so much to create the computer revolution that we now live in – even though they hadn’t a clue at the time.Escape/Reality Rating A-: I am still not sure whether to call this fiction or nonfiction, hence the combination rating for both escapism and reality.The depiction of Babbage and Lovelace as somewhat mad inventors whose invention has definitely gotten out of hand is hilariously funny. Seeing them both as quintessential steampunk engineers, while not factually correct, rings surprisingly true. This is an alternate future that would have been so much fun!At the same time, that these two figures have become posthumously associated with a movement as full of beautiful design and style as steampunk is its own kind of funny. In real life, neither of them was exactly known for their sartorial elegance. Or even their sartorial tidyness.The individual stories are both funny and have that sense of feeling true without actually having been true. The chapter where George Eliot submits her manuscript to the Difference Engine for analysis has a lot of true things to say about Victorian writers in general, George Eliot in particular, and the nature of computers and computing capabilities, all in one swell foop. And I do mean swell foop – this is all fiction but it all still feels true.Ironically, I also feel like I learned more about the real Ada Lovelace from this fictionalized, cartoonish version of her life and works than I did from a less fictionalized, and also less fun, biography, Ada's Algorithm: How Lord Byron's Daughter Ada Lovelace Launched the Digital Age. That felt like gossip for the sake of gossip, where in Thrilling Adventures every seemingly silly aside is both grounded in fact and makes a point about its subject.The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is a terrific, and terrifically funny book for anyone who wants to learn a little about the birth of computing and the outsize personalities of the Victorian era, while having a good chuckle."

The footnotes quite literally have a life of their own, and IMO are the best part of the book. Part research thesis, part flight of fancy -- say no more, you have me hooked. I feel like a significant amount more could've been done with the plot, but it's easy for me to say that. The way the characters were brought out, the satire of almost everyone involved, it's so fun and laugh-inducing. Reading books like this reminds me why I enjoy graphic novels, and more generally, why graphic novels are sometimes much more enjoyable than normal books."
23,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724491-paige,2,"There were some things I really liked about this book but on the whole I'm not sure how well it worked for me. First, Padua has done her research and it shows. My favorite part of the books were the footnotes, which were fun, informative, and thorough. The information wasn't just about Lovelace and Babbage but about the Victorian era, other personalities, math, the history of math. They were really fun to read and I think I would have liked a book composed entirely of her footnotes and endnotes. I liked her art too, though. It was expressive, cute, and creative.What I didn't like about this book was the ""graphic novel"" part. Basically the comic/story that came after page 28. There are about 16 pages of ""nonfiction"" biography about Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. But Lovelace died young and Babbage never made his computing engines. So Padua decided it would be more exciting to imagine an alternate universe where they were able to build the machine and come up with ""adventures"" for them to have. The problem for me was that I did not like this alternate universe. The adventures were boring or confusing. After a while I stopped even trying to read the comic and just read the footnotes and the endnotes, which made up the vast majority of the words in the book and stayed nonfiction even as the story veered into strange and unappealing territory--what if Queen Victoria visited? what if George Eliot dropped by to have her book analyzed and then got lost inside the engine? what if the Duke of Wellington made them use the machine to help the economy? These imaginary scenarios held no interest for me, did not seem well plotted, and were pretty tedious. It's really unfortunate because I thoroughly enjoyed those 16 pages I mentioned earlier about the actual Lovelace and Babbage, and I continued to enjoy the footnotes throughout. They were much more interesting than the story.Padua obviously put a lot of work into this book. I admire her scholarship. The information she presented about Victorian personalities and history, math, and the history of math and computing were especially fascinating, and the biographical details of Babbage and Lovelace were amusing. I liked her tone, her energy, her perspective, and I appreciated so much the inclusion of some of her primary sources (and information on where to get more--she has a great bibliography). It is quite impressive and I really want to recognize that. Unfortunately for me, she took all my favorite things about the book and turned them into the footnotes to a rather dull and uninteresting story instead of making them the story and illustrating more cohesively all the information she imparts in the footnotes and endnotes. If she ever uses her great creative and research skills to write a book that is not an alternate-universe steampunk fantasy--and I hope she does--I am definitely hunting it down and reading it."
24,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"Delightful, thoroughly researched, and discombobulated. Sidney Padua lovingly draws Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage's friendship, the (theoretical) invention of the first computer by Babbage, and the first computer program by Lovelace. Both were peculiar and memorable characters, whose friendship ranged from mathematical discourse to special fondness asnd squabbles. As Lovelace died young, which would make for a short book, Padua opts to keep her and their cooperation alive in a ""Pocket Universe"", where they embark upon adventures addressing Victorian era problems in economy, literature, inventions and mathematics. I particularly liked the exlanations of math jokes in Alice in Wonderland - the dialogue makes a lot more sense to me now.I thoroughly enjoyed the content, however the format was a real chore that deducted from my enjoyment a lot. The cartoons are quite silly and often contrast the dialogue which is quoted from comtemporary texts; they also contrast the immense amount of information conveyed through footnotes, endnotes and appendixes. The cartoons are large, the footnotes are small font, the endnotes are larger font, and I had to keep two bookmarks to flip between endnotes and story, which was already disjointed into cartoons and footnotes. The cartoons/footnotes are often self-referential, which lightens this a bit; but smetimes they dissolve into complicated charts and even Esher-like turns into sideways or upside down.Padua clearly enjoyed the book, and so did I, but it would have been a lot better with a more linear story-telling style."

It makes me want to read more about people as Alan Turning, Grace Hopper, Margaret Hamilton, and many mooooore.Then I remembered how in high school we were taught about the earliest generations of mechanical calculaters and how they evolve to modern computers, the story of Charles Babbage BUT there was NOT a single word about Ada Lovelace in the computer books back then. Dunno why. anyway ... The amount of researching that Sydney has put into this book is just tremendously tremendously impressing! And the funny & cool way she used in telling the facts and stories just made it even more awesom-er !! I was even laughing out loud at some parts while reading it on public bus!I think no one else would have illustrated it a better way. This comics simply cant get any better i think it is perfect. I was a bit lost at some of the mechanical details but it is always good to get general knowledge about these stuff. I just want to thank Al Rashied For bringing me a hardcover copy from UAE. Forever grateful. : )"

If you love history, mathematics, coding/computing/etc, then this is right up your alley. Go grab it right now! Others may find it very interesting as well, but may feel overwhelmed by all the footnotes/end notes/annotations/references. You could easily just flick through and enjoy the art, but I recommend slowing down and taking the time to read.

You can tell Sydney Padua did put in a lot of work because it is very well researched and the artwork is pretty awesome too but it just wasn't for me . Wasn't totally bad .

32,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7366675-morgan,5,"Do you fancy computer history, steampunk, and fine English literature? If you said yes to any of these than this comic book is for you. Keep in mind that even though this is a comic book this book has a ton of footnotes and reading material. In a way this is more of a non-fiction book with some comic book humor. This isn't your typical comic book. In someways this reminds me of a friendlier From Hell.I'm not really into computers, how they work, or the history for that matter. For me that can really boring. While this comic was mostly about that, what interested me more was Ada Lovelace's life and her relationship with her famed father Lord Byron. But wait, there's more! As I said before there is a lot of facts about English authors and literature for the 1800's. George Eliot makes a big appearance which I got super nerdy with excitement. Nice to see one of my favorite authors in a comic book. Maybe more people will read her books now.There are other author references too. At the end, there is a whole parody/homage to Lewis Carroll and his Wonderland. Yes Wonderland is an overused concept, but this comic focused on the mathematical part behind the story that others tend to forget Carroll was a mathematician. There is also an apprentice of Dickens, Collins, Gaskell, and a small cameo of Austen. It might help to do some Victorian reading before reading this comic book, while she gives you a good idea who they are, parts she don't really tell you much about the books they wrote that she quotes.If you like comic books, you might like this. Like I said before this really isn't a comic book. It uses the term lightly. Very little of the book is actually comics. It's more of a non-fiction book. The drawing my look cute, but this isn't kid friendly either. There were parts (especially the appendix pages) that were way over my head. I'm glad the author clearly took her time doing research. Some of the non-fiction comic books I question were they get there idea if they don't source enough.I'm interested to she if Padua makes anymore comic books. I like her art style, but I like how this was a different kind of comic book collection for me. I may have learned more about computers than I would have ever wanted, but it was worth it, and I have more respect for Lovelace and Babbage."

It also preferred to rely on tidbits from letters, magazines etc, Its definitely entertainment first, information second which i much prefer to a straight forward dry biography, however informative.Mathematics, apparently a no for me, despite liking math in general some of the stuff in this went over my head.The author also used Archive.org and googlebook scans to find some of her info which made me like this that little bit more as i love raiding those places for obscure books.Some notes on the physical object: My edition stinks, like literally, smells like paint or turpentine, of course this wears off after a while but not the best first impression. Not sure if its the ink or paper but i was actually holding it at arms length when i started reading it.Secondly the book is divided into comic, then footnotes below them and then additional endnotes after each chapter. Except its really annoying if you want to refer to an endnote as you can't easily find them, especially since there is no uniform length to any of the chapters. They should have blackened the corners of the endnote pages, so they could be easily seen when flicking through the pages... hold on.. one black marker and some time later ... ok done, now MY book has black corners on all the endnote pages, which can be found super easy :D .Note: Be careful with this, make sure to have a piece of cardboard behind the page, the black marker soaks though the paper REALLY easily."

I love love love books where fun chunks of the story and/or jokes happen in the footnotes (See: my new footnotes love shelf)! I loved how much research Sydney Padua did about Lovelace & Babbage and the awesome appreciation she has for primary source documents. There was so much glee in her tone! Aside from the footnotes, the very first part of this comic tells the true story of Lovelace & Babbage, their lives, their math, their friendship, etc. The rest of the comic happens in a pocket universe where they fight crime. I generally think steampunk stuff is kind of lame, but this was super fun. A lot of the action and characters were tempered with Padua's explanations of the implausibility, but since it takes place in a pocket universe who cares! Let everybody hangout together! Why the heck not!Recommended for fans of Victorian lit, fellow footnotes lovers, and STEM folks who love comics. "
35,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51524202-clelixedda,5,"This book is almost an instant favourite, it’s just so charming, funny, entertaining and educational (so it ticks all the boxes). The graphic novel part of this book consists of small musings of what could have happened if Babbage had actually build his analytical engine and Ada Lovelace had lived long enough to witness it. It is set in what the author calls a “pocket universe”, a two-dimensional world with elements of steam punk. The illustrations are great, but, to be honest, the foot and endnotes shadow the story part. They are extensively researched and the reader learns a lot about the lives of Lovelace and Babbage, and, more importantly, about their research work. Apart from that, they are also funny. What really sold this book for me was the second appendix, where the analytical engine is explained in some detail, with a lot of helpful (and awesome) illustrations. "
36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392101-scarlett-sims,5,"I knew I would love a graphic novel about Lovelace and Babbage, I just didn't realize how much. Padua has done some truly great research in telling the story of the two people who *almost* made the first computer. A lot of the ""adventures"" she describes didn't really happen, but they still contain lots of fun tidbits about many other famous Victorians. There are two appendices, one of which contains a handful of the primary sources the author unearthed while researching the book and they are really treasures. I will say, her voice is very ""millenial."" She apparently drew this as a webcomic first and she definitely talks like an Internet person. I grew up on the Internet so that sounds natural to me, but I imagine for some people it might seem jarring. I absolutely looooved this book!"
37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142980-rachel,3,"I was expecting a graphic novel about Lovelace and Babbage. I wasn't expecting a loosely organized set of long historical footnotes about Lovelace and Babbage, complete with primary sources in the appendix! This is not really a graphic novel. I feel like Padua could have integrated her information and her comic art better, to be more like a graphic novel. That said, this is something she did in her spare time out of a love for Victorian times and of course, Babbage and Lovelace. Her footnotes are humorous, splendidly researched, and plentiful. I found Ada Lovelace's upbringing fascinating, but most of the information was about her teenage and 20-something involvement with Babbage in thinking about computing machines. "

I have always been interested in Ada Lovelace so I knew I would enjoy it but I didn't expect how much sass and whit there was going to be. For that, I loved this story. You can tell the author did her research while creating this book. The footnotes alone make the read worth it. Each of the characters is built up out of the research that was done and feel completely real, as if I could walk up to them and have a conversation that would make sense for their personalities. I giggled my way through most of this read, I won't like. The computer, math and logic jokes were perfect. This is probably one of my favorite reads of the year."

The fact that 50% of it was focused on an under appreciated woman from history also definitely helped to keep me interested.The mix of primary sources and helpful foot notes throughout the fictional tellings made for a super engaging read. Padua brings characters to life in ways that only a cartoonist would but has obviously done so much research on the subject that everything feel informative and smart while also light and humorous. I'll admit that I couldn't understand all the math that was talked about in this but that didn't stop me from being captivated by the history.

41,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15425257-althea-j,5,"For a great review of this book, check out my friend Oriana's!! I read her's after I wrote mine and I like her's better :)https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...I love love this premise that combines rich historical context with crazy sciencey imagination. It's like a DC Comics Elseworlds story, except instead of using the DC canon universe as a jumping off point, Padua uses history as a jumping off point for her imaginative adventures.In order to deviate from history, you gotta understand the history first, so that gives a great excuse for the reader to delve into the historical context of Lovelace and Babbage. But annotated with funny footnotes, sourced with real historical documents, and enhanced by her graphic storytelling, it hardly feels like a history lesson at all!!! ---- My impulse is to see the educative capacity of everything I encounter, so I immediately was inspired to analyze this format and its potential as a teaching tool. In case that bores you, I'm shaving it down and putting it as a spoiler below. Here's the ""TL;DR"" of my review: I love the tremendous potential of Padua's multi-layered approach!!!(view spoiler)[After laying down some biographical/historical context, Padua then offers the parameters for the ""Pocket Universe"" in which her adventures take place. For example, to explain why there is no mention of Lovelace's boring husband:""The fundamental law of the Pocket Universe may be expressed as E=mc2[squared]where E represents Entertainment Value. Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace are so entertaining it is hardly surprising they are the massiest objects in the Pocket Universe. Conversely, consider Lovelace's husband, Lord Lovelace. After exhaustive investigations I have determined that his Entertainment Value, or E, is precisely zero."" (pg 41)And a footnote to her explanation of why the adventures take place in their own bubble outside of time:""This state of fuzziness holds, like much of the information contained in this comic, until it receives close scrutiny, whereupon it collapses."" (pg 41)The self-awareness of Padua's voice in the footnotes and appendices really brings the reader into her process of investigating her subjects. This effectively heightens the excitement of the subject matter because it cuts to the fun ""Aha!"" moment of discovery. It also brings the reader into how fulfilling it is to make connections. For example, ""Finding the Faraday letter... was my introduction to the very great thrill of throw-down victory in Combat Scholarship."" (pg 275)In a great section titled, ""Imaginary Quantities"" Padua puts forth the fundamental challenge of portraying history - there are no absolute Truths, only impressions gathered from various sources. She cites the warring schools of thoughts re: Lovelace - mathematical genius or ignorant imposter? Padua then makes her investigatory process explicit, describing her adventures with Google Books and the excitement of her own discovery of a primary document that recounts Babbage's own opinion of Lovelace. That he, ""knew her intimately and spoke highly of her mathematical powers, and of her peculiar capability---higher he said than of any one he knew, to prepare...the descriptions connected with his calculating machine."" (pg 242) This is a finding that is substantial in clarifying the issue in favor of Lovelace-as-genius, and in doing so, demonstrates the value of research and its potential reward.The adventures themselves offer multiple levels of information, the drawings/story portion offering a jumping off point for further investigation. The reader encounters footnotes on nearly every page, which offer historical context and commentary to the fantastical drawing/story. Padua essentially offers the dual voice of fun fiction and factually-rooted informational color on every page. An even deeper understanding can be found in the endnotes to each story section, and the primary documents included in the back of the book. Because all of these layers are linked with asterisks and annotational numbers, the reader can actively pursue and access deeper understanding in the moment that their curiosity is piqued by the story, making them an active participant in discovery.from my notes:pg 115Holy sh%$! This little historical adventure comic just snuck in some economic theory. I inadvertently learned the concept of the ""fiscal multiplier"" because it was a punchline to a joke. Usually my eyes glaze over with anything economics-related, but I was invested in poring over the footnote to understand the concept so I could ""get"" the joke. A great example of the intrinsic motivation to learn that lay within this format of graphic novel/semi-fictitious story with factual footnotes.I really enjoyed the inclusion of some of the primary documents that Padua encountered in her research. Like the recollection of Babagge speaking about ""The Difference Engine"" in the Sunny Memories excerpts:""He assured me that when it was finished it would 'analyse everything, and reduce everything to its first principles and so include future inventions, and in short almost supersede the human mind.'"" Aaaaand thusly, the computer was born. What a great find!I also liked Babbage's answer to that age-old question asked by every student in every math class ever -- Why do I have to learn this? It's not like I'm going to be using this in life.""In mathematical science, more than in all others, it happens that truths which are at one period the most abstract, and apparently the most remote from all useful application, become in the next age the bases of profound physical inquiries, and in the succeeding one, perhaps, by proper simplification and reduction to tables, furnish their ready and daily aid to the artist and the sailor.""In other words, learn your calculus, kids, so you can invent the next cutting edge thing we as a society can use to progress.Also, by the way, a great answer to the politicians that want to de-fund any efforts of science that don't currently have explicit application. (hide spoiler)]The information contained in this book spans so many subjects - math, science, economics, philosophy, history, etc. But I think the most important takeaway is the thrill of discovery and the adventure of acting on the impulses of curiosity. This is demonstrated in the characters of Babbage and Lovelace, as well as in Padua's inclusion of her own voice, and the book itself as a product of her own pursuit of knowledge. She portrays herself as a novice and includes her own excitement of discovery in her process, making the process of intellectual pursuit seem to be something that the reader could take on for themselves."

When I was 14 I actually got to meet and have lunch with Sydney Padua, which was (1) good because I was obsessed with the webcomic and transported at coming face to face with its creator, but also (2) bad because I was extremely awkward and weird even by 14-year-old standards and I made a complete fool of myself. They say you shouldn't meet your heroes in case they're a disappointment; actually you shouldn't meet your heroes because YOU will be a disappointment. Sydney if you're ever in Canada and you want to hang out again I'm 23 now and like 30% more capable of carrying on a conversation like a human being. Anyways, I love Lovelace and Babbage and their antics just as much as I always did. Also I'm going to fight everyone on this website who gave this book a low rating because there were ""too many footnotes"". There is no such thing as too many footnotes. Grow up. "
43,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6137009-aaron-burkhalter,4,"Sydney Padua walks a precarious tightrope holding together two fascinating historical figures, a lighthearted storyline and exhaustive footnotes telling a fictional (albeit based on reality) story of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, a mathematician and engineer respectively who are credited for attempting but never completing a steam powered, mechanical computer in Victorian England, which would have been the first had it come together.It's an idea that never should have worked. Wes Anderson's actually mocks in ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" the concept that Padua has taken and run with. Owen's very first line introduces him as a minor literary celebrity describing his latest book: ""Well, everyone knows Custer died at Little Bighorn. What this book presupposes is... maybe he didn't?"" Likewise, everyone knows that Ada Lovelace died at age 36 after working on what are by some considered the first earliest computer programs to be used in Charles Babbage's planned ""Analytical Machine."" Everyone knows that Babbage never completed the steam-powered computer. What Padua's book presupposes is... maybe Lovelace didn't die and they did complete the computer?In Padua's story, we are introduced to an alternate universe in which Lovelace and Babbage complete the analytical machine and flummox famous people of Victorian England with their antics. Queen Victoria arrives to witness the machine and is amused to see it print out a text image of a cat. George Eliot is lost in the machine chasing the only manuscript of one of her books which Lovelace and Babbage hope to digitize and study using computer punch cards. It's a precarious premise that works thanks to Padua's comedic sensibilities and the deeply interesting subjects in question. At one point in the story, we see an imagined conversation between Lovelace and Babbage at a party. Babbage is gushing over one invention that he did complete, a mechanical calculator called ""The Difference Machine,"" and Lovelace is in awe. In Padua's retelling, the two are seen as finally meeting an intellectual equal, someone who understands how the other's brain works. An onlooker quips that we're witnessing the invention of the geek.Padua is an accomplished animator — she worked on The Iron Giant — and her skills are well on display. The book, though comprised of still images, is alive with motion.The story manages to balance her comedic story, the ridiculousness of an alternate steam-punk universe and the exhaustively researched history all in one. Almost every page is amended with seemingly endless footnotes describing where the dialogue has come from (much is quoted from diaries and letters) and explaining obscure but often hilarious jokes at the expense of Victorian historical figures. The footnotes are necessary to anyone like myself, with limited knowledge about Victorian England. I imagine some well-versed historian could read through just the comics on the page and giggling through the entire book. I, however, need someone to explain to me why some mathematical joke is funny, and somehow the joke is not spoiled by the detailed explanation.If the book has a downside, it's that the footnotes on each page and the end notes closing each chapter can become a bit of a chore to read when you were hoping for a comic. But it won't do to skip them: The footnotes are themselves interesting, often essential to understanding the story and also offer an amusing interplay between the characters and the author. In fact, Padua frequently breaks the wall between the comic book story and the footnotes at the bottom of the page. Queen Victoria at one point orders the footnotes to cease. And without spoiling the ending (if a story like this is spoilable) the end of the story is pages upon pages of interplay between Lovelace and the footnotes."

(Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon and Norman Spinrad 's (?) Roma Eterna, and the recent computer game Dishonored 2, spring to mind as prominent examples of the genre, but none of them reaches the level of literary erudition of this book.) +++ Excellent visual explanation of the Analytical Engine's components and how they work, in Appendix II. +++ New and historically relevant material about the relationship between Ada Lady Lovelace and Charles Babbage, hopefully settling for posterity the important role Ada had in the symbolic, abstract interpretation of the capabilities of the Analytical Engine, including for algorithmic calculus (that is, computer algorithms). Although the author points to scholarly work where Babbage is credited with inventing the first algorithms for the Engine, she explains credibly and cites knowledgeably new source material supporting Ada's significant and innovative contribution (we are talking about prints from mid- and late-1800s, found by Sidney Padua). Overall, I loved the book and recommend it to everyone, and especially to computer scientists and others mathematically inclined."

On the surface, it's a graphic novel that starts with the true story of Lovelace and Babbage, then imagines an alternate world where Lovelace and Babbage actually created the Analytical Engine (a successor to the more famous Difference Engine). The real meat of the book, though is in the footnotes and endnotes where Padua cites her sources for the material used in the cartoons. She wraps up the book with a collection of letters and citations about Babbage and Lovelace, and a look at how the Analytical Engine was conceived. A great introduction to these historical characters and their work for an interested non-expert like me."

However, both died before any of the machines Babbage planned were ever invented. And so Padua imagines an alternate ending – a world where their Analytical Engine reached completion and adventures ensue.Padua’s art is wonderfully effective. Her black and white drawings are imbued with energy and life, and I’m completely jealous of her skill at creating such wonderfully expressive faces!In the foreword, Sydney Padua describes how the book began as a brief comic she created at a friend’s request for Ada Lovelace Day. When the end of her comic suggested an alternate universe, various corners of the internet thought she was planning a webcomic about steampunk style adventures between the duo. Although Padua had no such plans in mind, she began researching Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, and she wound up becoming utterly fascinated with Lovelace, Babbage, and the Analytical Engine. And Padua’s passion for her subject matter shines through at every turn, and the book is so much greater for it.Padua also found much potential humor lying in wait. For instance, Charles Babbage had a long lasting vendetta against street musicians. Even when Padua is departing on some flight of fantasy, she still provides extensive footnotes on historical information. I’m not kidding, there’s pages and pages of footnotes, and I highly suggest reading all of them. They’re both knowledgeable and engaging. I ended up learning a lot in the process of reading The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage, and like all the best books that dabble in history, it left me with a desire to go out and learn more.I can’t recommend this altogether charming collection enough.Originally posted on The Illustrated Page."
47,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34270033-katie,2,"I am so sadly disappointed in not loving this book. Unfortunately I developed an expectation of it before getting it, where I had imagined it was somehow a graphic novel biography. When I started reading it and it was like ""jk their life isn't interesting enough so now we will have a pocket universe where they have thrilling adventures and fight crime,"" I was on board with that too. However, it never clicked for me. I'm legitimately confused about how it has such a good rating, to be honest.Pros:- The art is just fabulous. I love it SO MUCH.- The found letters in the appendices are interesting.- The author obviously put a lot of effort into research and seems like a great person.Cons:- In my opinion this is neither a graphic novel nor a biography. Or it tries to be both, more accurately. Most pages are half cartoon half footnote. I think perhaps it might be enjoyable if you JUST read the cartoons and not the footnotes. I had half a notion to do that myself, and I'm guessing most people must do that and have a great time (thus the high rating). I would probably recommend that, as much of the information in the footnotes is also repeated in the appendices (at least the parts about Ada and Babbage).- Because of the large amounts of footnotes that are usually not very related to the comic, even the chapter stories feel incoherent to me. I have a huge problem with graphic novels that don't have a coherent story (at least in the individual chapters). I think this is why I generally dislike compilations of web comics.- Related to the above, I didn't realize this is a compilation of web comics. I'm still a little confused about that, but it seems to be true. It feels like it too, based on the lack of coherency imho.- While I love the idea of historical quotes and events being used in a fictional story, it's really confusing to me. I don't know if this means I hate historical fiction or just didn't like the use of it here. I almost would've liked the quotes being used in the cartoons WITHOUT the footnote saying where/when/how the actual quote originally came to be.WOW THAT WAS LONG I CLEARLY HAVE FEELINGS.tl;dr: if you get this, maybe just don't read the footnotes and you'll have a great time."
48,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16103061-kathleen,5,"OKAY SO.Ada Lovelace (or, as she's more properly known, Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace) is commonly cited as the world's first computer programmer. Since she died in 1852, you can see how revolutionary that is. Her partnership with Charles Babbage, who almost but not quite built the first computer (the Analytical Engine), and the ensuing paperwork helped Alan Turing to build probably the first functioning computer in the 1940s. Now, Ada Lovelace died at the age of 36 and Charles Babbage never really got his shit together enough to actually build the computer. In The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage, Sydney Padua asks the all-important question: what if Lovelace had lived and Babbage built his device?Answer: HILARITY.Padua wrote and illustrated a brief biographical sketch of Lovelace and intended it to stop there. Unsurprisingly it developed into this comic. It's really hard to describe in terms other than Padua's-- ""Lovelace and Babbage lived on and built a giant calculating Engine and used it to FIGHT CRIME and HAVE ADVENTURES""-- but that also doesn't quite do the comic justice and it certainly doesn't mention the hilarious one-shot about George Boole, Lovelace and Babbage's wars on poetry and street music respectively, and ISAMBARD KINGDOM BRUNEL whose name must always be written in all caps. It also doesn't mention that pretty much everyone in the comic is a historical personage and far more of it is taken directly from historical accounts than one would expect-- including Babbage's war on street music, which is a thing of glory and joy.I would recommend purchasing the book if only to have it, but you can read the comic at Padua's website and I believe you can also get some kind of app to read it in? IDEK, it's amazing, go and find it by any means necessary and then throw money at Sydney Padua so we can get more."

Babbage is credited as the father of the first mechanical computer (the Difference Engine) and the designer of the much more complex Analytical Engine (never built). Lovelace (who's father was the poet Lord Byron) was educated in mathematics and science from a very early age. She wrote (among other things) an analysis of the functioning and capabilities of the Analytical Engine, that contained was is regarded as the first computer program. The speculation in this book is, what would happen if they had actually been able to build the Analytical Engine and write code to program the machine. This speculation happens in a pocket universe where Padua can let her imagination flow. This book had a very interesting structure. Its the first book where I needed 2 bookmarks. Each page of each chapter had footnotes that related to the action in the various panels. There were also endnotes that further clarified the footnotes, as well as several appendices of various period documents (letters and articles) that helped emphasis the story.What both fascinates me and frustrates me is that I'm not sure what's true and what's fiction. Obviously the main story is fiction, but the footnotes and endnotes provide excellent historical backup, but in some cases, I think, ""that can't be true, can it?"". Its witty, self-deprecating and I thoroughly enjoyed it. While I knew of Babbage and Lovelace beforehand, this give me incentive to read more about them.8/10S: 1/21/15 - F: 2/8/16 (19 Days)"
50,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36607817-tony-zale,5,"The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is a graphic novel romp, but it also has plenty of meat on its bones. Charles Babbage was a mathematician and inventor better at dreaming up projects like a steam powered calculator than completing them. Ada Lovelace was the daughter of Lord Byron, pushed towards mathematics in the hopes disciplined study would save her from her father’s excesses. Together, they envisioned a world of computing that wouldn’t be fulfilled for more than a century. Author/illustrator Sydney Padua takes this theoretical reality and dresses it up in fiction; the dynamic duo actually build their computing machine and bring big data computing to the Victorian era. An ever-expanding computer made of gears and powered by boilers is a silly concept, but Padua skillfully incorporates passages from historic journals and correspondence into her dialog, bridging the gap back to the real Lovelace and Babbage. The book is heavily footnoted, providing additional context on the workings of Babbage’s machine, the duo’s connection with high society and figures like Karl Marx, Babbage’s pedantic criticism of poets and reviewers of his books, and oddities of the era’s mathematics like revolutionary France’s brief conversion to a 400 degree circle. These notes provide color and are a pleasure to read; they aren’t overly deep, but they display a level of research the reader won’t expect from a light graphic novel. This is an excellent package: a cast of eccentric, expressively illustrated characters and a fanciful look at Victorian engineering that doesn’t go too far off the steampunk deep end."

YAAAASSSS.I'm not giving this 4.5 stars, even though it easily could be, due to the footnotes. While I adore footnotes, gleaned lots of interesting info from them, and appreciate the satirical homage paid to Lovelace (her footnotes are famously longer than papers themselves), they distracted a bit too much from the comics the way they were presented. However, fear not! The comics are just as enjoyable if you ignore the footnotes (although you certainly won't get explanation for much of the historical tidbits that are worked into the comics). I conducted highly involved experiments.... heh, not really. I read through each story a first time, in full, reading the footnotes along with the comics, then did a second read-through of just the comics with no notes. I found it to be immensely educational the first time, and immensely amusing the second time 'round.Go read it peoples, it's the definition of adorkables. Even if you have no mathematical inclination at all, it's highly readable and AWESOME.

Sydney Padua's first collection of works about the steampunky and quirky duo sure is entertaining and humorous, but it really lacks a cohesive story that could have sustained my interest until the end.This comics (and almost a graphic novel) is the author's own interpretation of the life of Lovelace and Babbage, in a pocket universe where they have finished creating the Analytical Engine. This very premise topped with interesting foot and end notes and amazing artwork, oh I'm telling you the artwork alone is delicious to see, was unfortunately let down by the absence of a cohesive story. It is way far from a complete disappointment though, but I am a bit sad that so much material, well-researched documents and talent was seen in the book yet (almost hurts to sat this) it doesn't kept me reading it because there was no solid plot for them to keep going.I eventually finished reading it (comics plus the end notes) wishing that more could have been done to improve it."

With the exception of the Dodgson/Alice section, I wasn't compelled by their adventures or hijinks. I finally resorted to reading the comic through without stopping for footnotes and then coming back to read those to fill in the details. If I were to recommend this to a friend, I think that is how it should be read during the fictional accounts - read the comic through and come back to the footnotes.

Apparently they were great friends, Lovelace's Analytical Engine (while never actually built) was a plan for the first (steam-powered) computer, and Lovelace had all kinds of brilliant software ideas that would have taken computing out of the realm of arithmetic and into the realm of symbols.

Having read it, and the author's commentary, it's easy for me to understand how the author found the subject of Ada Lovelace's life so captivating. The remainder of this review is a description of how, and why, it had such a significant impact on me when I read it.For more than a quarter century, I recall thinking at almost all times that I disliked math. I then encountered a math teacher in college, Dr. Blaga Pauley, whose engaging and philosophical teaching style -- which felt more like a conversation about what was most intriguing about math than like formal education -- helped me realize that what I disliked so strongly was not math itself, but the way people seem to think it must be dictated and drilled. Math is, in fact, a beautiful realm of brilliant insights, elegant systems, intricate designs, and the power to create new understanding.I was not (within myself) ready to carry on with math as a more significant pursuit on my own, yet, and a variety of circumstances conspired to keep me from getting the kind of mentorship I needed to reach that readiness. It is difficult to break free from decades of being indoctrinated in the belief that mathematics is a bureaucratic, dreary, tedious field of academic irrelevance, and other (more comfortable, at the time) interests easily distracted me from taking my education in math any further than strictly necessary for all the interests I pursued instead. Even so, the ideas around math as presented by Blaga (before she passed away) stuck with me, and led me to collect a few books for later reading -- a ""later"" that, until now, never came.Along the way, I heard of this book, and someone gave it to me as a gift. Perhaps it was because I asked for it; I don't recall. Time passed, and this year (2019) I finally picked it up and read it. Reading this awoke in me a greater interest in the real-world intellectual adventures of the Countess of Lovelace (the evident originator of general-purpose programming as a field of study and perhaps even the foundation-layer of computer science) and Charles Babbage (the inventor of the Analytical Engine). More significantly for me, perhaps, is the fact this book is what seems to have finally pushed me over the precipice into a plunge into the depths of desire to really learn more about (and seek fuller understanding of) mathematics as a field of exploration rather than simple study. This book has changed my mindset again, like Blaga's instruction did almost twenty years ago, and I rather suspect that when I think back on this in a few years I will be able to say that those two events together have conspired to change my life.I do not know whether this book can help change anyone else's life for the better, but I recommend it without reservation to anyone considering whether it is worth reading. If you hesitated to dedicate time to it before reading this review, hesitate no longer. It really was an amazing experience for me, and I hope it will be for you, too."
67,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772327-christopher,4,"Oh my was this fun! I enjoyed the heck out of this book. My daughter enjoyed the heck out of this book. It's clear the author enjoyed the heck out of this book.So the book starts with a historical account of Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and the Difference Engine (and it's progeny the Analytical Engine) - presented in an entertaining storytelling style, complete with footnotes and endnotes - (akin to the Cartoon History of the Universe I, Vol. 1-7: From the Big Bang to Alexander the Great). So far, so good. But this section ends quickly and on a down-note with Lovelace dead of cancer and Babbage unable to get over himself to actually build any of his designs.But as we have seen in so much alternate history from The Difference Engine to Fiddlehead, the idea of a Victorian-era steam-and-cogs computer is just too good to let facts reign and history to have the last say. So Sydney Padua transports us to a pocket universe where the laws of physics are set to maximize entertainment value and the book roars onward, now looking increasingly like Girl Genius, Vol. 1: Agatha Heterodyne and the Beetleburg Clank only with a historically accurate cast of characters instead of a fictional one (well except for Minion the Footman).Oh, and the footnotes continue. Almost every statement uttered by Lovelace, Babbage, or various supporting characters in the book is straight from their own writings or supported with primary documents. And the supporting cast is broad from the Duke of Wellington, to Islambard Kingdom Brunel, to George Eliot, to Lewis Carroll/Charles Dodgson, to Queen Victoria herself. Eventually the footnotes themselves become a character in a Wonderland-inspired investigation into the truth of Ada Lovelace's character and contribution to the Analytical Engine and computer science as a field.And throughout this all, as we watch these absurd Victorian characters and learn about the design of the Analytical Engine and the logic of computing, there's another story being told. The author is able to show us so much about Babbage and Lovelace's personalities and victories because of the triumph of computing. The Google Books project and others like it have opened the world of historical primary sources to interested amateurs like Padua in a way that really has never been possible before. The author is able to wade into decades-old debates with a sharp pen and over-looked sources because of the work of Babbage and Lovelace's intellectual progeny who have continued the drive to organize, collate, and analyze the world's knowledge."
68,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27837035-heather-jones,5,"This is a delightfully informative and madcap graphic biography (sort-of) of Ada Lovelace and her relationship with proto-computer inventor Charles Babbage and his research. I found it reminiscent of such genre-fracturing works as Larry Gonick’s The Cartoon History of… series or Scott McCloud’s Understanding Comics in the way it simultaneously uses and subverts the conventions of graphic storytelling to bridge the worlds of education and entertainment. (No doubt there are many other works that do similar things, but I don't actually follow graphic novels much, so these are the ones I thought of.)It begins as a straightforward biography of Augusta Ada King, Countess Lovelace, daughter of the mad poet Lord Byron, and very arguably the first computer programmer. The visual storytelling is expanded by the use of footnotes (which often interact amusingly with the other graphic elements) and extensive endnotes that expand on technical points, or issues and personages contemporary to the main themes. (I read it in iBooks format and the e-text has been set up to allow easy movement between the main panels, the endnotes, and large-text versions of both foot- and endnotes.)But the author, having to her dismay hit the limits of pure biography, due to Lovelace’s tragically short life and Babbage’s failure to actually realize any of his amazing inventions, plunges on sideways into an alternate steampunk universe in which Lovelace and Babbage actually build the analytical engine and use it to…wait for it…fight crime! (And other adventurous pursuits.) Here the story explodes into a mash-up of actual history, deranged tour through the political and literary landscape of mid-19th century Britain, and technical manual.I loved how the story returned to the essentials of steampunk as a genre (as opposed to an artistic aesthetic) in highlighting the exploits of larger-than-life 19th century figures whose dreams and inventive imaginations outstripped the technology of the day. It does not, however, ignore the aesthetic side of steampunk, and aficionados will find all their favorite goggles, Rube-Goldbergian technology, and dashing women in gender-bending historic clothing.Whether you read the central graphic story purely as entertainment, or delve deeply enough into the technical appendices to understand just how Babbage’s engine was intended to work (and the reasons why it was unlikely to have done so), or split the difference by meditating on the ways in which a brilliant mind like Lovelace’s was betrayed and undermined by the age she lived in, this is a book I recommend in the strongest terms."
69,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5033966-kaia,5,"First things first, let's get some assumptions out of the way. 1) This book has a lot of footnotes and endnotes. I did not count, but there may be more footnotes/endnotes than actual graphic content. That being said, they are absolutely charming footnotes that I loved reading. Granted, the historical Lovelace is known for translating and annotating a speech by Babbage, where her notes were at least double the size of the original text, which may be intentional.2) This is a graphic novel, but it comes from a web comic so it doesn't have a fully cohesive feel. These are short, episodic stories, but there isn't any sort of overarching plot line.Now, these are two things that I would expect would work against this book, but Padua pulls this all off so charmingly. Here's the story--Charles Babbage is known for designing the first proto-computer, but never actually building one. He struck up a friendship with Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, who learned mathematics from a very young age to try to weaken any ""poetical"" influences from her father (this is a true story). Ada was fascinated by the machine and it's applications, and described how it could be used, including what some consider to be the first computer program. Alas, Lovelace died young and Babbage never built his machine. On a whim, Sydney Padua illustrates this story and ends with a panel wondering what could have been--if Ada lived and Babbage built his machine?This ""What If?"" sends Padua down a deep research hole into the lives of Lovelace and Babbage, and in the end she imagines this alternate (steampunk) universe where a steam computer exists and Lovelace and Babbage get into scrapes and adventures using it. Padua's enthusiasm for the topic and for the friendship between Lovelace and Babbage simply oozes from every page of this book. In the end, this unabashed enthusiasm is what sells the book for me.Many of the footnotes are very funny, comments on sources, on strange things she came across during her research, asides and did you knows about Victorian society (the niche Victorian genre of theological satire using cheese-mites, Uranus originally named George), and an abundance of Victorian lit/math/computer science jokes, with a few cat jokes thrown in for good measure.If you like Kate Beaton's Hark, A Vagrant!, you'll probably like this book. If you're interested in Victoriana or women in STEM or the history of computers or steampunk adventures, you'll probably like this book."
70,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43720549-randy-allain,5,"I have never been particularly drawn to the world of graphic novels or web comics, but the premise of mathematical renegades solving problems with a steam-powered Victorian computer convinced me to give this one a try. Sydney Padua's novel starts with a thoughtful biography of Ada King: Countess of Lovelace and daughter of Lord Byron. After explaining that Ada was pushed into mathematics to shelter her from poetry (the “Byron devil”), the book illustrates Ada's affinity for abstract math and her eventual fascination with Charles Babbage's plans for a steam-powered analytical engine. After working extensively with Babbage, obsessively annotating his plans, and writing hypothetical punch-card “programs” for his hypothetical computer, Ada died from cancer at a young age. Babbage never got around to building his analytical engine. Padua was so disappointed in this bitter ending that she constructed a “pocket universe” in which the mathematicians follow-through with their plans to build the engine....hence the, “thrilling adventures.”I would have rated this book a 3 or a 4 based on the comics alone. They were very interesting and the artwork was fantastic – but the comics never quite followed-through with the “thrills” promised in the title. Instead, the thrills came from Padua's impressive empathy for her characters and obsessive research. Not only is her love for the subject matter inspiring, it also provides a great window into the atmosphere of Victorian London. Just about every page of the book is filled with detailed footnotes explaining the historical basis for her characters, jokes, and adventures. All of the information Padua can't fit into the footnotes can be found in extensive endnotes following each adventure and fascinating appendices in which Padua provides her own sketches of the analytical engine (and many of its individual mechanisms) and some of her favorite primary documents. Yes, even the endnotes and appendices have footnotes - and on many occasions the footnotes go meta: they become scattered in explosions, Queen Victoria blocks them out for being too boring, etc. As an English nerd – I couldn't help but give the novel a 5-star rating."

I don't know, honestly. Though the book is highly text heavy, it's easy to skip over the historical notes and footnotes, if you prefer to just read the extremely cute and wonderful comics. Me, I read EVERYTHING. I'm not particularly what one would call a history nut, but if you give me background information on why a comment was actually hilarious given the context or how that line of dialogue actually came from a letter sent by Lovelace to ----- or diagrams of the Analytical Engine or anything really in cute little (and not so little) foot and end notes (and appendixes!!), I will be reading all of them.Some of my favorite panels were from The Client:(All the panels above from The Client are all rough comics and look much nicer and different in the book.)But the whole book is really just lovely and hilarious and absurd and beautiful. And as glad as I am that Padua gave readers a background on Lovelace and Babbage and their real life story, (which is drawn so ADORABLY, even when I was practically wailing at how sad it was), I am infinitely more glad that she wrote a version of their lives set in a Pocket Universe that plays out so much better."
72,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7706994-harshit-sahay,5,"This is far from a traditional book or even a traditional graphic novel, at least structurally. Hence reading it like one might not be the wisest thing to do. Originally a webcomic, this is a collection of the Adventures of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, in an alternate universe where they were far more successful than our current one. However, Sydney Padua uses the narrative of the universe as merely an excuse to have fun with the 2 central characters and their often glaring flaws, as well as their genius. This creates some nice comedic plots that involve other figures from that age and time as well. Padua uses footnotes as a mechanism of delving into THE ACTUAL history of this duo, providing us with snippets of information that add dimensions to their characters one doesn't really find in schoolbooks. The footnotes help Padua ground the jokes or punch-lines in the comic to incidents in the actual lives of its protagonists in a manner which is extremely elegant. Indeed, a lot of humour is also derived from self-awareness, especially the bits about the ""2-D Goggles"" and the concept of the Pocket Universe. Non-fiction works that deal with subjects in science often have a fatal flaw- a hand-wavy approach to actual science, and an unnecessary focus on often irrelevant details that just appeal more. Padua circumvents that by establishing a completely imaginary world where her imagination can runaway on fantastical adventures with no constraints on reality. However, to her credit, she delves A LOT into the history of the central characters and the world they inhabited in the form of footnotes and endnotes, which provide the reader with exposition and context for the comic, as well as the actual story. This is both incredibly well researched, and also incredibly funny. One can but appreciate the amount of work Sydney Padua put into this, to be able to quote almost any document mentioning either of the two during their lives. This is the best kind of book, one that teaches you things, and does so in a manner that'll leave you in splits."

There's something irresistible about Lord Byron's daughter having been a brilliant mathematician who wrote the first computer program. If she had lived longer, who knows what else she might have accomplished. I'll read anything about Ada. This book isn't the first alternate history Ada that I've encountered, but it's definitely the most fun conceptually. It's also the first graphic book I've seen with footnotes and endnotes. Some of the notes are as entertaining as the dialogue and captions. Unfortunately, not all of the content was entertaining. I'm not a mathematician. There are sections of this book that got too technical for me. I skimmed them. I did enjoy parts of this book a great deal, but there were others that I considered a snooze fest."

75,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862074-chris,5,"One part whimsical, pulpy comic and two parts historical anecdotes and footnotes in an amazingly well-designed package, this book is perhaps my favorite version of these stories published. Lovelace & Babbage has appeared previously on the web and (in limited form) in a standalone iPad app, but in this hardcover package it definitely shines. Just from a production standpoint, it stands out; multiple fonts, great layout work, and an incredible cover and dust jacket.Furthermore, there's content in this book that is, I believe, otherwise not available in other formats. I'm not completely sure, but I do not believe I've read the Alice in Wonderland pastiche featured in the final story ""Imaginary Quantities"" anywhere else. Nonetheless it is a standout addition to the L&B canon. In addition, there's some great appendixes with primary source documents (mostly letters from or about Babbage) which sheds some interesting insight into the two protagonists' real lives. There's also a wonderfully illustrated explanation of how the Analytical Engine would look and function.Just about the only thing missing is the major story ""Lovelace & Babbage vs. Organized Crime,"" the eleven part series where our mathematical heroes fight the dastardly plots of organ grinding street performers. But given that that story is probably as long or longer than all the other comics in this work, I can understand why it was left out. Perhaps we'll get a standalone book for that in the future?This collection sits firmly with other fictional-yet-nonfictional works like Logicomix or Action Philosophers. If you're a fan of those books, I genuinely think you'll like this one—and if you liked this one, pick up those other ones! They'll have fewer footnotes, but be just as entertaining and engrossing."

Cartoonist Sydney Padua uses the true story of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace as a starting point for her fantastic fictions set in a parallel universe in which the two great thinkers are able to find funding for their magnificent Difference Engine and put it to work in a variety of entertaining and useful ways. Though wildly imaginative, the book is heavily researched and annotated, and you’ll get to see Babbage and Lovelace interact with many familiar names, like Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens, while also learning about some of the era’s less celebrated heroes, such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.I was fascinated by the story of Babbage and Lovelace, two historical figures I knew next to nothing about, and I particularly enjoyed the detailed footnotes, which filled me in on the historical context of the duo’s adventures. Some of the mathematical equations and scientific theories were a little overwhelming for my English major mind, but Padua presents them in such a playful way that I didn’t feel intimidated. Whether you love science and math or enjoy literature and history, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage will have something to interest you.- John D.Click here to find the book at the Prince William County Public Library System.

77,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876605-kam-yung-soh,4,"A very entertaining graphic novel about how it might have been if Ada, Countess of Lovelace and Charles Babbage had managed to bring to life the Analytical Engine. The book starts with the real-life stories of Ada and Babbage, then branches off into a 'pocket universe' where the Analytical Engine is created and run by them.In a series of adventures, the pair hilariously show off the Engine to Queen Victoria who wants to 'RULE THE WORLD!', called to save Britain from a global financial crises, fight off the mathematical Luddites, try to mechanise fiction writing by statistically analysing a book by Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) and even try to visualise the third dimension (remember, the characters live on a two dimensional page).Probably one of the most hilarious short parts of the book is when George Boole (of Boolean logic fame) is reduces to mubbling ""Error, error,"" when asked a non-boolean question (not a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer) while being served a drink!The book is full of footnotes by the author pointing out historical, mathematical, engineering and computing references to the situations depicted. Making the book more true to life is the effort the author went through to ensure that the words being said in the novel closely match what Ada, Babbage and other characters (like Isambard Kingdom Brunel) actually said or wrote in real life.The book ends with a very technical appendix outlining how Babbage's Analytical Engine would have worked if it actually had been built.A very entertaining read indeed."
78,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18850156-stewart-tame,4,"This book was a genuine delight! Inspired by history, Sydney Padua drew a comic strip about Babbage's analytical engine and his relationship with Ada Lovelace. His engine was never built, and Lovelace died young of cancer, so the story doesn't end well. So she added a bit to the end of the strip about how, in another universe, the two went on to build the engine and fight crime. Just a throwaway gag to lighten the mood, make the ending less of a downer. Reaction from the internet was swift, and Padua found herself charged with creating more adventures for her intrepid heroes. And so a legend was born. There's much quirk and charm in this book. There are extensive footnotes, and footnotes to the footnotes--more of these strips are based in fact than might appear at first glance. Don't let the footnotes put you off, though, because there's a breathless enthusiasm to them that makes them a treat to read. Padua is enthusiastic about science and history, and it's contagious. Probably incurable, too. At various times her artwork reminded me of Phil Foglio, Larry Gonick, and even Will Eisner. The footnotes reminded me of Randall Munroe (of xkcd fame.) There's a nice cartoony roundness to her line that makes me smile. This is a marvelous book, particularly if one is a fan of science and/or history and/or steampunk, but even if none of those describe you, you may want to check this book out anyway. Very fun stuff!"
79,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63176142-surly,4,"I came across this comic at the Bakken Museum (a small but fun electricity-themed museum in Southwest Minneapolis) and was intrigued by the art, but didn't pick it up, and then checked out a copy from my local library. Now I'm sincerely regretting that I didn't buy it. Padua offers an affectionate portrait of the inventors of the computer (Babbage) and computer programming (Lovelace). While Padua imagines a world where they successfully operate a functioning computer, she bases her flights on a deep reading of the historical record, revealing her principals' personalities and their cultural context in Victorian England. The dialogue is witty and often funny (when not directly borrowed from the principals' correspondence) and supported by legions of footnotes and endnotes that are as entertaining as the images.The art is superb. I loved the character designs and how expressive Padua made them. And she also takes risks with composition, using perspective and page orientation to convey literary and mathematical concepts. For that matter, Padua uses Babbage's original diagrams to sketch out a simplified version of Babbage's unfinished computer, carefully illustrating how processes were accomplished mechanically, offering both visual and written explanations for the reader. It's the rare comic book that engages with both story and an intelligent analysis of the underlying science and history. Highly recommended. "
80,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27591228-lapl-reads,4,"Charles Babbage is widely credited with inventing the first computer, depending on your definition of “computer” and “invent”. You see, he never actually finished his masterpiece, the Analytical Engine. Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, was a mathematician who wrote programs for this nascent computer, making her the first computer programmer. Together they were innovators and eccentrics with genuine affection for one another. What could be more fun than a book based on their lives and collaboration? How about a graphic novel based on their story? How about a graphic novel full of extensively researched and annotated science and Victorian history, illustrated with a stylish steampunk flair? The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is all of this and more. The graphic novel takes their work and lives as a jumping off point and imagines an entire alternate universe where they had the time and means to finish their engine. (In the real world Ada died young and Charles was perpetually trying to pry more money out of the government.) With their analytical engine complete, alternate Lovelace and Babbage can turn to other issues: such as the use of cats in computers, explosions, and fighting crime. This is a fun story, packed full of information, charm, and history.Reviewed by Andrea Borchert, Librarian, Science, Technology & Patents Department"
81,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187833-rach,3,"I love the art and style of this book, and the history of these fascinating people that were so well-known in their own times, yet nearly forgotten in ours. I also love that the author decided to imagine a world in which Lovelace didn't die tragically young, and then went on to have exciting mathematical and mechanical adventures with Babbage.Where this book loses me is in the detailed explanation and analysis of the mathematics and computer science of the analytical machine. It's a lot to wrap your brain around, and after trying very hard to understand and struggling, I was reminded of the fact that I stopped taking computer science courses in college when it got to this point (the theoretical) and I no longer found it enjoyable. At this point in my reading, I decided I didn't want my difficulty in understanding the mathematics to take away from my enjoyment of the art and story, so I started skimming the sciencey bits. I am, in fact, an adult, and can therefore read and not read whatever I want! :PI would especially recommend this book to someone who enjoys and understands computer science, but it is also entertaining on a more surface level for someone like me, who has an interest in computer things and history, despite their lack of technical knowledge (and lack of desire to obtain said knowledge)."
82,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79487053-billy,5,"This is a lovely collection of comics, most of them set in an alternate universe in which Babbage completed his Analytical Engine, supplemented by extra information drawn from letters, memoirs and Babbage's own autobiaography. The art is distinctive and fun, and the main characters (Babbage and Lovelace) are joined by others that appear a few times (Brunel and Wellington), and other famous Victorians; scientists, authors and royals alike.The mixing of history, science and fun is delightful, and each is explored more in depth in its own section. The comics themselves are designed to be funny, while the footnotes and endnotes give more detailed information. The first appendix is a compilation of the author's favourite primary sources about Babbage and Lovelace. The second appendix is an explanation of the never built Analytical Machine, complete with diagrams to provide a clear view of the components and working of the machine.Overall this is a fun book that should appeal to those interested in Babbage and Lovelace, who may also enjoy learning about the Analytical Engine."

When that book also illuminates my knowledge of important historical (feminist) figures I've only read snippets about elsewhere, it scores more points. When it does so through a comic book form that employs a pocket universe that loops back on itself (both theoretically and narratively) and employs many of the technological wonders and famous figures of nineteenth century Britain in so doing, I marvel at this gem of a unique book that piques so many of my interests that I may need a difference engine to calculate the figure.

If I have just one criticism, it is that the footnotes during the comic, and the enormous notes after each story plus the historical appendicx made each story a little unhinged.

107,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237558-drew-perron,5,"The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage starts off as an entertaining history lesson and becomes so much more. It’s not just a cornucopia of imaginative and ridiculous alternate-history adventure - it’s a bloody well-researched cornucopia.Sidney Padua takes the real-life story of Charles Babbage, creator of the first computer[*] and Ada Lovelace, the first computer programmer[*] and sends it off course into an alternate universe where, instead of Lovelace dying young and Babbage dying old and bitter, the two of them construct a giant steam-powered computer and have adventures full of math and whimsy!And heck yeah it’s whimsical, full of fun, cuteness and emotion. The art is stylized, cartoonish, and full of detail, with flexibility and a sense of constant motion. And the writing is strong, with snappy banter and good characterization - Lovelace is a hot badass and Babbage is a funny nerd, but in ways that are multidimensional while still keeping the cartoonish fun. (The Alice in Wonderland homage is especially fun - one of the few such homages to truly get at not only the weirdness of the original but the mathiness, and sliding into a sad, gothic moment in a way that feels very Earned.) There are a lot of quotes worked in from the actual people, which are often recontextualized in hilarious and relevant ways (though if I was going to make a nitpick about the writing, it would be that sometimes, it’s a bit too quote-y).I learned a lot about Victorian England, too, and Padua doesn’t pull her punches. Babbage was miles ahead of his contemporaries in terms of computing, imaginative and forward-thinking - and a self-sabotaging jerk who believed in some really fucked-up stuff, like “de-skilling” work to give to common people (the foundation of modern wage slavery). Lady Lovelace was a firebrand who pushed at the boundaries of gender, but she wasn’t above high-nosed classism. And the two of them were both, of course, fully in support of Queen Victoria’s British Empire. Yet none of this makes them less fun or less likeable (in your humble reviewer’s eyes); the narrative is aware of their flaws and the flaws of their world, and plays skillfully with how these things look from a modern reader’s perspective.Not to mention the many other minds of the era that are so often overlooked. Isambard Kingdom Brunel! Marian Eveans! George Boole! Foundations of our modern era in ways we often forget, and welcome to see in humor wrapped around their quirks and our main characters’.(Though, a quibble: I feel like it might’ve been possible to include more of the types of people who are most often left out of the Official Accounts - people of color, for instance, who were very much at large and doing high-level work in Victorian London. On the other hand, this is a book that’s focused on thoroughly researched history, and sometimes the official accounts are all you have, especially when it comes to who intersected whose life.)And goodness is it thoroughly researched. The exhaustive footnotes! The even more exhaustive endnotes! Every page of this book is sourced to within an inch of its life, and there’s so much rich and detailed discussion of the real-life inspirations for every quip and joke. And then there’s the appendices! Fifty pages of appendices! Contemporary letters and magazine articles, by, from, and/or about Lovelace and Babbage! The workings of the Analytical Engine as designed, in exquisite detail!This book is marvelous, thoroughly and thoughtfully constructed. I really hope that there’s some enterprising educator out there using this as a textbook for a college class - or even better, high school! Worthy as hell![*] …sort of, it’s complicated - Babbage never actually built his computer. But honestly, they still deserve to be talked about in those terms - that’s part of the point of the book."
108,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48062493-satwik,4,"AMAZING! (purposeful AllCaps)It is stomach-crampingly hilarious, heroically original, an information torrent and a phenomenally well researched book. For me, the ingenious creativity of the central idea itself was enough to make my time reading the book worthwhile. But then, Sydney Padua, provides a thousand more reasons to love the book. To be honest, I began the book thinking it must just be a collection of comics carrying a light historic flavor and a slight nerdy touch. I now feel it is an understatement to say that the last statement was an understatement. The idea, as I said before, is refreshingly original and creative. The comics themselves are extremely funny, the kind of nerdy-tinged sweet humor which I personally enjoy a lot and actively seek out, especially in the graphical format. The art is fresh and has an undertone of light-hearted happiness about it, another thing that I thoroughly enjoy. Characters – ah, the characters! They are eccentric, weird, funny and really endearing. They’ll stay with you for a long time after finishing the book. The stories have tons of well-researched historical references, all excellently annotated (more on annotations later on), and history/science fans have lots to love with the occasional unexpected historical person cameo, or a subtle reference to some science work and so on. If this book does not immediately make you want to build a difference machine, you should probably check if you are not already dead.Annotations. Personally, loved them. They can also be, for some, a bit distracting or bothersome. A large proportion of the book’s size is because of extensive footnotes, tons and tons of end-notes – both full of detailed historical information, scientific trivia and justifications for some happenings in the comics- justification as to how that relates to what is actually known about these two figures from various sources, including very archaic articles and letters and so on (which the author has meticulously gathered to create a historically “relevant” narrative). If you like very detailed trivia, this would be a welcome thing. Furthermore, it is difficult to read the footnotes while reading the comic, but a lot of valuable information capable of increasing the appreciation for the comic is in these notes. I do not know of a way around this, but I personally read each comic twice, and read the foot/endnotes between the two readings in some cases, and read the footnotes alongside with the comic in others. I believe not reading them at all, or skipping a few of the more pedantic/obscure trivia parts would still allow one to enjoy the comics a lot, but that is mere conjecture.Overall, loved it a lot!"

There's 3 sections, one looking at the actual relationship between Ada Lovelace, and Charles Babbage, the second is a fictional look at what would have happened if the analytical machine had ever been made, and finally a set of appendices of original papers, letters etc. To be honest though, it's the middle section that’s the most fun. It's quite an interesting set up as well. They seem to be aware they are in 2-dimensional space, which doesn’t seem to make a lot of difference to their day to day life.It's the adventures though. With cameos from the great and good of the era, Victoria, Brunel, Dickens and my personal favourite storyline, Lewis Carroll. There’s a wonderful sense of adventure, and humour through it all, you get the feeling the author had a lot of fun writing it, and drawing it, and that sense of fun ends up on the page. A word of warning, the author does love her footnotes, and by love, I mean fills the pages up with them. There's footnotes for everything, from explaining the guests at a dinner party, through to what Ada thought should be the perfect toothpaste. I'll be keeping an eye open for what comes next, we can but hope for a sequel."

I mean, look, you can't go wrong with the characters, and to find out that The Big Names of Victorian Science were all mates and wrote to each other, and cross fertilised, is delightful.Sydney Padua has a mind which mixes poetry and science to bring you this lovely book, firmly bound, with many footnotes, which in some cases break the fourth wall.Well researched, many laugh out loud moments, educational, with a smattering of maths but not so much as to scare you, and walk on parts for Lewis Carroll, George Eliot, Charles Dickens, and if course various cats and the Difference Engine itself, and you have a grand book to read.Did I mention it was cartoons? Oh. And these are well drawn, and on occasion play superbly with space even to the extent of making the reader follow a flowchart which spans two pages, and one place where the reader had to physically rotate the book to follow the thread.So. Well written, well drawn, well constructed. A perfect little gem of a book."
111,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46056090-katy,5,"Unless you pay close attention to either women’s history or the history of computers, you’ve probably never heard of Lady Ada Lovelace. And I can almost guarantee you’ve never heard of Charles Babbage. And yet their ideas are what made the world the live in today—a world in which we carry small computers in our pockets—possible.Charles Babbage was a nineteenth century mathematician. Actually, Wikipedia describes him as a polymath and I think that suits him quite well. He was one of those people who had fingers in many different pots. It seems, though, that what he really liked to do was solve problems, which is how he came up with the idea that would form the basis of the computer in your pocket.As a solution to the problem of mistakes in the printed mathematical tables that were used at the time for things like navigation, engineering, and mathematics in general, Babbage developed the Difference Engine, basically a steam-powered machine designed to calculate the values of polynomial functions. From there he moved on to invent the Analytical Engine, a more complicated steam-powered machine designed to calculate all kinds of mathematical functions. It was to work using punch cards—an idea taken from the Jacquard Looms which used punch cards to encode the designs being woven into fabrics at the time—to program different mathematical calculations. Unfortunately, however, working models of his engines were not constructed during his lifetime.Ada Lovelace was a highly trained mathematician and a correspondent and friend of Charles Babbage. She was the daughter of the poet Lord Byron. Her mother, in an attempt to rout out any poetical instincts she might have, focused Lovelace’s education on mathematics from a very early age. And while Babbage may have designed a precursor to the modern computer, Lovelace wrote its first program. In the comments on a paper she translated from its original Italian, Ada Lovelace wrote an algorithm for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers designed for Babbage’s Analytical Engine.As far as history goes, this is where things generally stop. Babbage never built his engines—after his first attempt at building the Difference Engine failed, he had trouble getting more financing from the government—and Lovelace died of cancer at the age of 36. However, that didn’t stop Sydney Padua, an animator and visual effects artist, from imagining a more interesting and adventurous alternative history for the duo. And thank goodness.In the introduction to the book, Ms. Padua writes that she hadn’t originally set out to draw a comic with an alternate-universe story about Lovelace and Babbage. She had done a web comic, just for fun, about the real Lovelace and Babbage, but since the ending to the real story is pretty sad, she added a little something extra. “I threw in a couple of drawings at the end, imagining for them another, better, more thrilling comic-book universe to live on in.” It had started as a joke, but the idea caught on and the more Ms. Padua researched her subjects, the more she fell in love with them and the more she felt compelled to make “an imaginary comic about an imaginary computer.”The book starts out with a retelling of the true story of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage. But then it quickly moves on to more imagined territory, sending us into a world in which the Analytical Engine is not only built, but being used to solve all sorts of problems. The duo challenge their engine to solve the country’s economic problems, and end up sending it running amok in the streets of London. The Queen of England wants to use it to fight crime. Charles Babbage declares a “War on Error” and ends up losing George Eliot’s book, which she and Lovelace must try to retrieve, given it’s her only copy.Ms. Padua’s drawings are fantastically steam-punk-esque, which is fitting given the fact that Babbage’s machines were steam-powered. The Analytical Engine is massive and Lovelace is frequently drawn strolling through the hallways between its stacks of gears in jodhpurs with a pipe and a frown. Ms. Padua portrays Babbage as a lovable idealist and inventor, not always cognizant of the consequences of loosing his ideas on the world. Lovelace, in contrast, is the workhorse of the pair, often cleaning up after Babbage’s messes and clearly enjoying her work inside the Engine itself, adjusting gears and whatnot, keeping the Engine in tiptop shape.What makes the book truly magical however, are Ms. Padua’s footnotes and endnotes. While her comics are solidly constructed in the realm of fantasy, her footnotes and endnotes provide the historical bases for her flights of fancy. Clearly, she did a lot of research for this book. A whole lot. What she was able to dig up is amazing and her enthusiasm and love for these two rather eccentric characters shines through her writing.It was easy to fall in love with Lovelace and Babbage as Ms. Padua has portrayed them. I could see exactly what she meant when, in her introduction, she described Babbage as a “blend of Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Toad, Don Quixote, and Leonardo da Vinci” and how she wanted “alternately to shake [Lovelace], hug her, and throw her a parade.” Just dipping back into the book to write this review I found myself caught up once again in the stories and the characters that drive them. Long live Lovelace and Babbage!"

It is a great combination of fiction (the actual comic) and historical and mathematical aspects (all those interesting footnotes and endnotes). The book is well researched and beautifully organized. The mathematics presented is not over the top and it blends perfectly with the story from the comic. The historical aspects are well integrated as well (you get to read letters from Lovelace and Babbage, as well). "

127,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7821634-larou,0,"I think in every single post I have ever done on comics I have mentioned that I’m not really all that much into comics… with the occasional exception. As can be expected from that, I’m not an avid reader of web comics either: There’s the occasional visit to xkcd or Oglaf, but that is pretty much it – except, that is, for the single web comic I have been following religiously ever since discovering it (which fortunately happened quite early in its history), namely Sydney Padua’s The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage.This is one of those books where it is hard (if not impossible) to imagine anyone not loving it. The author’s immense enthusiasm for his subjects and his characters shines through on every single page of this volume and transmits itself to the reader thanks to the wonderful drawings, the stunning inventiveness and the catching humour with which Sydney Padua tells her stories. While these are not quite the historical Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace but alternative version who live in a pocket universe where the Analytical Engine was actually build, the author obviously loves her research and has dug up a huge amount of actual, real information, ranging from the fascinating to know to entertaining anecdotes to the outright bizarre, and she pours out this cornucopia of facts in a wealth of footnotes, end notes to the footnotes and footnotes to the end notes of the footnotes. For anyone familiar with the web comic this is a very close and nice approximation of all the links to Google Documents Padua likes to sprinkle across her pages (and of course there are footnotes there, too) and while not quite as extensive, bookish footnotes have of course the advantage of being more period-appropriate. Another difference to the web version of Lovelace and Babbage is that (at least to my untrained eye) she seems to have re-worked the graphics – on the web site you can follow the evolution of the author’s drawing style and see her control of and playfulness with the medium grow from comic to comic. The book on the other hand presents the (current) peak of her craft and is much more unified; it also contains a new story not on the website featuring Ada in Wonderland. Both “Organised Crime” and “Vampire Poets” are not in the books though – but one can hope for a future volume. Anyone not familiar with the web comic is in for the even bigger treat of encountering Lovelace and Babbage for the first time and experience the unfettered glee of seeing a historic injustice righted, our intrepid heroes rewarded with the appreciation they deserve while they use the powers of the Analytical Engine to fight crime in an almost-historical Victorian London. On the way, you will meet many of their contemporaries like you’ve never seen them before, from William Gladstone to George Eliot, from Queen Victoria to that irresistible sex symbol Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and much loud laughter, astonished gasps and delighted squees are bound to ensue. It is not all fun and chortles, though – Sidney Padua never lets the reader forget that it is alternative history she is drawing and that things did not work out that well for her protagonists in our version of history. Thus, she keeps a faint but steady current of melancholy running underneath her merry tale but at the same time always keeps their very real achievements in view, turning the comic into an homage to the indomitable spirit of discovery and invention (and quirky character traits). At the very least, do check out the website but I really cannot recommend this book strongly enough."
128,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11160237-andrew,5,"This review was originally published on The Serial BooksellerAda Lovelace was born in the early 1800’s, daughter of Lord Byron. Convinced that she was possessed of the dangerous and erratic Byron genes, her mother Anne Noel set Ada on a strict diet of math tutoring from a young age, forbidding her the study of poetry, lest it awake in her the same demons that compelled her wildly erratic father. Ada grew up with love of what she called the “poetical science” of mathematics. She became a close friend and co-conspirator of Charles Babbage, and contributed much work on his Analytical Engine, an early form of the computer. While she is credited with the invention of punch card computer programming Ada passed away at the young age of 37, leaving Babbage alone and his machine unfinished.But what if she didn’t?Sydney Padua has, through the use of charming and witty comics that are the result of an exhausting amount of research, delved into a world of alternative history and science fiction that features a healthy and energetic Ada and an incorrigible and eccentric Charles Babbage and their numerous adventures and escapades together. All accompanied by a faithful narrator who provides insight, jokes, and innumerable historical goodies from rare primary and secondary sources.All the while, the Engine grows in size and complexity. It attracts the attention of the Queen, Charles Dickens, and famous British luminaries that highlight the extensive and incredibly impressive array of contemporaries that Lovelace and Babbage shared. The story is broken down into vignettes that chronicle the life of the Engine as it grows and inserts itself into more and more parts of modern life. The Engine is put on wheels and made to help fix the British economy. It helps Lovelace and Babbage fight crime (Or so the Queen thinks). It grows to be the size of a city or a country and adapts to take on not just everything mathematical but also everything literary as well, correcting novels and sometimes destroying them when they get catalogued wrong.All throughout the book the ever present narrator breaks the fourth wall to interject with historical tidbits and judgments and punchlines into the story, occasionally bringing the whole production to a screeching halt. If all textbooks were told in the form of steampunk comics with the same amount of history and lore in them, no child would drop out of school.Babbage is easily frustrated and totally convinced that he knows what the Engine, the country, and the world at large needs, sometimes to the detriment of the whole operation. His mouth tends to run. Especially in front of the Queen. Lovelace is by turns the sweet and caring Matron of the Engine, and at others the wrench wielding Avatar of Knowledge and Progress, bravely swinging through the caves of the Engine and banging it back into place, all the while saving lost souls from the occasional mouse catching leopard.The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage chronicles the history of one of, well, history’s most intriguing duo’s and imagines a life better lived than the reality of an early death and a life lived in frustration. Though their lives were not perfect by any means, modern culture and technology owes everything to the designs of a man named Babbage, and the punch cards, mathematical brilliance, and poetic dreams of a woman named Lovelace. Sydney Padua has crafted for them a biography and a memorial worth cherishing. I do hope you enjoy it."
129,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7678068-kai-weber,5,"The best comic book I've ever read. I admit I'm not a fan of the genre and so I've not had too much exposure to it. And I admit that I loved it so much, because it is so much unlike the usual comic book, because it has so much text to read. The book is full with long foot-notes and chapter-end notes and it contains an appendix with excerpts from historical documents. But still, the main point is the comics, so how about them?The first chapter displays historical facts from the lives of mathematicians Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, with a very humourous twist, already. Charles Babbage designed the very first computer in the modern sense of the word, Ada Lovelace wrote an essay on how to program it. Babbage's steam-driven machine has never been built.The end of this first chapter then introduces the so-called pocket universe. What if Babbage and Lovelace actually had built it? So, we enter this ""pocket universe"" where Babbage's machine actually exists, and does lots of interesting things, like print a cat face for Queen Victoria, devours a manuscript of Thomas Carlyle's while George Eliot is afraid the manuscript is hers, arouses the protest of Luddites, or entices Lovelace to become Ada in Imaginary Numberland.There are passages that are hilarious (for example when George Boole comes by for a visit and talks boolean logic with Babbage's butler), there are passages that are meta- or even meta-meta-reflections on the book or the story, there are passages that are very instructive, giving brief outlines of little known historical facts, there are passages of wild, far-flung imaginations linking historical persons or bring joyful anachronisms. The author occasionally weighs in some of her subjective opinions on Lovelace and Babbage, yet she also manages to present lots of facts in a truly entertaining way. While appendix I has a selection of historical documents, appendix 2 is then another masterpiece in itself. Here the author has carefully drawn Babbage's analytical engine the way it had looked like if it had ever been built. She's explaining how it worked in a manner as simple as can be.This book is definitely not just for tech-lovers, but for anyone interested in one of the following things: Great inventions, Victorian England, English literature, non-linear story-telling, smart jokes, intricate allusions, cutely painted main-characters. (And I love many of the details in the painting style, as well. All lines are free-hand drawings, with dynamic verve and swing, except for the checks on Babbage's pants, which have obviously been produced with a ruler and are therefore physically highly unrealistic, but do say something about the rigidness of the character.)Besides the book itself I can also very much recommend an hour-long interview with the writer, which very much shows what a labour of love this book is, even though Sydney Padua has stumbled on the topic rather by accident: http://7thavenueproject.com/post/1192...I need a second, a third, a fourth volume, the sooner the better!"

131,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26434330-william-leight,5,"""The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage"" was one of my favorite webcomics during its relatively brief run four or five years ago, and though Sidney Padua seems to have more-or-less permanently returned to her day job as a movie animator, this wonderful book is a considerable consolation for the comic's apparent demise. The story of Charles Babbage, who invented the idea of the first computer, and Ada, Countess of Lovelace (usually referred to as Ada Lovelace to save time), who invented the idea of programming the idea of the first computer, is fairly well known by now, and Padua is certainly not the first to propose an alternate history (or, in this case, ""pocket universe"") in which Babbage successfully constructed his device. But she has almost certainly done far more research than any of her competitors -- as can be seen in the copious (and delightful, don't skip them) endnotes -- and the result is, despite cartoonishness and occasional anachronism (freely conceded by Padua), more real-feeling than, say, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling's ""The Difference Engine"". It helps, of course, that the characters were somewhat cartoonish in real life. Babbage was certainly a larger-than-life personality, what with his massive ego, his forthrightness when dealing with the kind of rich and influential people who might have funded his engines (Padua says that a pamphlet of his on the Royal Society might as well have been entitled ""Dear Royal Society of Important People: You Are All Corrupt Idiots""), and his lifelong feud with street music players. Lovelace, meanwhile, was raised on a strict diet of mathematics, for fear that otherwise the poetical tendencies of her father, Lord Byron, might affect her. No, seriously, that was how she became a mathematician (the fact that ""poetical tendencies"" might also have been code for hereditary mental illness -- Byron's father was known as Mad Jack -- makes this story only slightly less amazing). The comic practically writes itself . . . except of course that Padua still has to write it, and she does an excellent job of making Lovelace and Babbage real people with a believable friendship. The adventures themselves are quite funny, if not terribly thrilling, and feature a cross-section of eminent Victorians, including Isambard Kingdom Brunel, George Eliot, and Queen Victoria herself. ""User Experience"" is a particular standout, as Padua takes advantage of the comic format to trap poor Marian Evans in a succession of loops, flowcharts, and other pieces of a computer program. The endnotes provide a perfect complement of historical, mathematical, and computational information, and even the appendices, featuring a selection of primary documents and Padua's diagrams and explanation of how the engine would have functioned, are well worth reading. My only complaint is that it isn't longer: I would have loved for ""Lovelace and Babbage vs. The Organist"" to have been included as well, but at least it's still available online."

133,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16514040-keith-schnell,5,"Twenty-five stars.I have been following 2D Goggles since 2010, and like everyone else who discovered Sydney Padua’s work online, I had been eagerly awaiting this book. It does not disappoint – indeed, it is everything that it possibly could have been, and more. I can not stress enough that this is an absolute gem in every way – one which will have you by turns engrossed in the details of Babbage and Lovelace’s work, laughing out loud not just at the jokes but at the real-world antics of the Victorians who inspired them, and feeling genuine sympathy for the real people who are the subject of this book, particularly Ada Lovelace, who, more so than Charles Babbage, was dealt a pretty rough hand by the times that she lived in.To summarize, this book contains:-- A huge amount of original material not found in any webcomic.-- Charles Babbage in full Emmet Brown mode.-- Footnotes, which are actually very informative.-- Opium-guzzling, foul-mouthed, bipolar 19th Century computer scientist / aristocrat Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace.-- Endnotes explaining the footnotes.-- A truly impressive amount of original research by the author, most notably a heartfelt and convincing refutation, using original sources, of the vindictive and revisionist claim that Lovelace had little to do with the academic work published in her name.-- A reason for all the footnotes: Ada Lovelace’s only published academic work came in the form of extensive footnotes to another document that she had translated from Italian; in her time, women Just Did Not Write original academic papers, and this was all that she could get published. Lovelace’s footnotes, of course, like Ms. Padua’s, were seven times as long as the main document. They contained the first conception of a computer program and discussed applications for computer programming approximately 90 years before other geniuses got around to trying the same thing.-- Isambard Kingdom Brunel: the Victorian’s Victorian.-- A fairly clear explanation of the workings of Babbage’s impossibly complicated 19th Century steam-powered clockwork computer, the Analytical Engine (which was sadly never built due to Babbage’s total lack of management ability).The only thing wrong with this book is that it is not longer – Babbage vs. the Vesuvian Salamanders, anyone? Maybe they’re saving some material for the movie, starring Bill Murray and Wynona Ryder. "
134,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115626-nadine-jones,3,"I expected to love this and I wanted to love this, but ... I didn't really love this. This book is a charming mish-mash of genres: mostly biography, with a little history, a little science, a little historical fiction, a touch of multiverse, and a smidge of steampunk. And it's got that perfect touch of slightly self-deprecating humor that I really like, plus some really fun trivia.But overall, it's just a mish-mash. In many chapters, I was left wondering: ""why?"" Why go off on a tangent about economics? Why throw a bunch of authors into a room together? It felt like Ms Padua was just tossing random interesting facts at a wall to see what would stick. I guess that is the nature of a web comic: they are a collection, and not a cohesive whole. So to try to read it as a cohesive whole is to face disappointment.I wished there was a lot more about Ada Lovelace, too. I guess Ms Padua was basing her stories on historical documents, and since women didn't appear in the papers back then (except at birth, marriage, and death), she didn't find much on Ada, and thus focused more on Babbage, and others.Ms Padua is a gifted artist. Her caricatures are spot-on, and the expressions on the faces are delightful. She is also clearly enthusiastic about the historical trivia she has dug up, and her enthusiasm can be infectious.And the epilogue was wonderful.I'm really torn on what to rate this. For the art, the beginning, the section about imaginary numbers, and the ending, I'd rate it 5 stars. But the economics section and the authors section both felt so random, they gets 2 stars. So ... I settled on 3 stars. 3 stars with an honorable mention, or something.I'll definitely read more by Padua!Things I learned:* There was famous engineer in the Victorian era named Isambard Kingdom Brunel (I'm an engineer - never heard of him! Why don't engineers have to take a History of Engineering course in college??)* Wilkie Collins probably based the brilliant but homely Marian on Marian Evans aka George Eliot* Planet Uranus was originally named George from 1781 to 1850. I never knew this! This was so bizarre that I googled to check, and just like every other thing that I checked in this book, she was dead on balls accurate. (It's an industry term.) Okay, so the planet was actually named Georgium Sidus because back then scientists had a thing about Latin, but it was effectively George."
135,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2205560-laura,5,"I'm not sure if I can tell you in words how much I loved this book. Sydney Padua (or, at least, The Footnotes) frequently claims not to be ""a supergenius or anything,"" but I think she is selling herself a bit short. I fell in love with Lovelace and Babbage in 2011, when I stumbled across the webcomic that led to this book. Those webcomics were also gloriously researched and footnoted (almost exclusively from primary documents, including personal letters, newspapers, Victorian humor magazines and scientific publications), but those earlier strips are really in their ideal format here. I found that the best way to enjoy these comics was to read them twice: the first time, ignoring the foot- and endnotes (with a few exceptions in which they are part of the main plot, which will be obvious to the reader), and a second time reading only the notes, which, believe me, are just as entertaining and fascinating as the main comic itself.I really am just as much in awe of Sydney Padua after reading this book as I am of Lovelace, Babbage, Brunel, Eliot, et. al. The economy and cleverness of her scripts and drawings, which manage to be beautiful to look at, very funny, and touching all at once; her depth of understanding of the Victorian era, from the quibbles over imaginary numbers and economic models to who was throwing the best dinner parties; her obvious love for these personalities and her skill and conveying them to the reader through a few drawings and words (and wonderfully excerpted primary documents in the footnotes and appendices, of course); and of her ability to tie all of the above together into the book I just finished, which somehow is as light as a feather and an absolute joy to read despite having taught me a great deal about computer science, mathematical allegories in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and Victorian-era social networking. I can only end by saying that when I finished the epilogue and closed the book, I actually shut my eyes and hugged it without really understanding what I was doing or why. I just loved it THAT MUCH.One final note: If you loved this book as much as I did, I bet you will also enjoy Richard Holmes' The Age of Wonder. I love a good popular history of science, and it's my absolute favorite. There's some overlap of characters, too--hi, Herschel!"

Although Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine was never built during his lifetime, in Sydney Padua's The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer, he and Ada Lovelace team up to build their wonderful machine and use it to improve British lives.Borne out of a comic Padua created for Ada Lovelace Day, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage takes place in a Pocket Universe, in which time is a little...funny. Here, Augusta Ada King does not die of uterine cancer at age 36, nor does she languish in an unhappy marriage to William King-Noel, 1st Earl of Lovelace. Instead, Lovelace is free to explore both mathematics and poetry, the latter of which was largely forbidden during her short lifetime, due to the incestuous disgrace of her father: George Gordon, Lord Byron.Sticklers for historical accuracy will not be disappointed by The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage. Padua takes every effort to document when and where she found the inspiration behind her heroes' dialogue and motivations. The illustrator draws from the private letters of both Lovelace and Babbage, as well as contemporaneous newspaper and other reports on their friendship and society gossip. Lovelace and Babbage also includes detailed explanations of how the real-life Babbage's Analytical Engine worked, and dissects the all-too-common argument that Lovelace was a fraud who used her computer-genius friend to get ahead.The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is the perfect read for any history or literature buff looking for a steampunk-ish romp through the 19th century. By the time you close the cover, you'll be searching desperately for read-alikes."

She added an elaborate set of notes which eventually became longer than the translation itself, and which included what very well might have been the first computer program.In 2009 Sydney Padua began a web comic about the lives of Lovelace and Babbage which received an enthusiastic response and the expectation of more to come. Though it hadn't been part of her career plans (her animation skills are usually employed creating special effects for the movie industry) Padua embarked upon a sequel : a highly entertaining graphic novel which, like the Lovelace work of more than a century before, was enhanced with footnotes and endnotes that exceeded the length of the original work. This was one of the most entertaining books I have enjoyed in a long time: a clever and highly original graphic novel which becomes--through the author' notes--a scholarly and enlightening manuscript. Padua is not only a gifted artist (her drawing style reminds me a little of the great Will Eisner) but also a witty storyteller and a scholar to boot. She read extensively about Lovelace and Babbage and their era, and she gives us a wonderful look at Victorian England (HRH never looked for a chair before sitting down--wonderful!) as well as a comprehensible though not dumbed down explanation of scientific, mathematical and engineering concepts. (My country's need for STEM education might well be solved by a Padua-like approach of difficult concepts presented in an entertaining way.)*I hope that Padua will consider creating more scholarly-scientific graphic novels in the style of this one. As much as I enjoy Hollywood special effects, I can't help but feel that she has a unique combination of artistic talent, scholarship, intelligence and wit that could create any number of bestselling graphic novels.*I wish I had thought to honor Lovelace and Padua by using footnotes instead of parentheses for comments like the above, but--like Mr Babbage--I am not likely to get around to the improved version of this review."
138,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1130491-elizabeth,4,"After having read The Case of the Missing Moonstone, Sydney Padua's book came recommended to me through Goodreads/Amazon. Luckily, I have a fondness for good alternate histories & I was up for some more fun with Ada Lovelace & her cohorts. This graphic novel is a series of stories that takes place in a pocket universe after a silly time traveler reveals some future secrets to our heroes Lovelace & Babbage. We end up with Steampunk Victorian England, where there are gears on everything & time is, well, a little wonky. Lovelace & Babbage not only bring their collaborations to fruition by building a steam-powered computer, they get into all sorts of hijinks like creating the first cat meme for the Queen, solve a banking crisis & (my personal favorite) destroy the manuscripts of contemporary authors in order to study & purify language. (Guys, seriously, it's the best story: George Eliot & Ada Lovelace face-off & recite Latin at one another, Babbage talks like David Foster Wallace in his story ""Here and There"" & cats are everywhere. It's awesomesauce!)This is not your typical comic--there are extensive footnotes everywhere & Padua integrates them into the story with comedic effect. She has researched her subjects extensively & the effort shows both in her clever writing & her numerous annotations. Padua's art also, to me, evokes the best of Will Eisner's whimsy & Aubrey Beardsley's heavy black linework while maintaining its own distinct look. Lovelace and Babbage is informative & playful and proves Padua is equal to the likes of Kate Beaton & Randall Munroe. My only critique is that this collection works as individual stories exploring different aspects of the Victorian era, but they don't cohere to a specific ending. But this is explainable through the way the pocket universe is created--no endings are entirely possible there. Excellent nerdy fun for those with any interest in the Victorian age, math, history, literature or artistic reinterpretations."
139,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604883-cheryl-gatling,5,"Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage are real-life people who worked together in the 19th century to make a machine that could manipulate data. Babbage's Difference Engine was never completed, and his improved version, the Analytical Engine, never even begun, but the two friends spent years planning how it could be done, and how it could be used, making them pioneers in the field of computing.Sydney Padua tells the fascinating story of these fascinating individuals in expressive comics. Big-eyed Ada is by turns cool, thoughtful, and manic. Babbage is more of a big goof-ball, carried away with his enthusiasms. And they are fascinating people. Ada was raised to study mathematics in order to prevent her from following in the bad, passionate footsteps of her father, the poet Byron. She ended up passionately moody in the pursuit of mathematics, and how it could be used to program Babbage's machine. Babbage was obsessed with the mechanical workings of his machine, with how the gears and levers would fit together, and equally obsessed with how the government had slighted him by failing to provide funds. Also he hated organ grinders.Padua then allows herself the fantasy of imagining that the Difference Engine had been built, in an alternate ""pocket universe."" That's when the really thrilling adventures begin, as eminent Victorians, including the Queen herself, make their appearances. And there is much whirring, and clacking, and chuffing, as people wander the labyrinthine inner workings of the giant machine, dodging gears.The book is both funny and smart. In invented situations, characters speak words taken from their actual letters. Drawings are explicated by footnotes, and footnotes enlarged by endnotes. The author did years of research, and throws into the book all kinds of interesting tidbits and historical asides, as well as her personal opinions and snarky comments.She finishes by a technical explanation of how the machine would have worked. That part went mostly over my head, but I believe it is as clear an explanation as can be made.This book makes the history of computing fun. Fun, I tell you."
140,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50693647-k-mcdevitt,5,"Well, this was a strange but wonderful book! It's part biography part alternate history. It's the graphic novel story of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage as they build and use their first computer. It has plenty of footnotes that explain where many of the lines come from. As a woman in the computing industry, I've always looked up to Ada, Countess of Lovelace, for her role as the first ever computer programmer and her intelligence at pursuing a field of study that wasn't expected of a woman. And it was fun seeing and reading about her here with Babbage, as she comes into her own and as she worked with him on this project. But after this first story, it goes on to an alternate reality of sorts where the difference engine becomes a real thing. It doesn't change the very course of history, but it does create a lot of interesting twists, turns, and adventures. For example, the engine is so large Ada pretty much lives inside it... with a court of cats who catch the mice and sometimes play with the cards she uses to program it. There are visits by potential important funders. There's an uprising by actual ""computers"" and financial implications. There's also a great story with the writer ""George Eliot"" who puts her story into the machine and then desperately must get it back out again. And even though all these stories are absolute fiction, there are still huge footnotes stating source material for so many of the lines and decisions made within these stories. Some of the footnotes even have primary source notes. And there's even a story in which Ada Lovelace has an altercation with a footnote! Just goes to show that we may never have a complete picture of history. But it's fun imagining these stories happened in some alternate reality somewhere. I loved learning more about the two of them and seeing their relationship, however rocky it is at times and wonderful at other times. Seeing absent-minded Babbage and his ""fairy lady"" like this was entertaining and enjoyable. Definitely a strange but wonderful read!"
141,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7311271-julie-capell,5,"A delightful mashup of truth and imagination, this is a truly unique work of art and science. The author clearly did a lot of research, and packaged it in a way that made me want to know more. The Differential Engine imagined by Babbage in 18XX, is perfectly suited for graphic treatment. A thing of beauty, full of cogs and levers, all driven by steam, a full version of the Engine was never built* but clearly begs to be visualized. The author's design aesthetic is perfectly suited to this steampunk style and every page is filled with enticing drawings of the different parts of the Engine. Footnotes at the bottom of nearly every page, not to mention the endnotes after each chapter, elucidate the real history behind the graphic panels. The detailed information about the Engine itself would be compelling enough, but what makes the book truly special are the personal stories--both real and imagined--that Padua weaves in and around the engineering facts. The real bits, such as Babbage’s many accomplishments, are so astonishing that they are at times difficult to believe, but are well-documented by the author through primary references. The parts I found the most interesting were the ones in which Padua chronicles the feats of mathematics which Lady Lovelace, aka Ada Byron, daughter of Lord Byron of poetry fame, was wont to perform. She (probably) conceived of the world’s first computer program, needed to make Babbage’s machine actually work. That she did it within the incredibly male-dominated world of Victorian England is absolutely astonishing.Loved it so much I couldn't put it down. This should be read by all 7th grade girls, everywhere, right now. And anyone who is interested in computers. And anyone who has ever used a computer. Basically, everyone should read this wonderful book!* There is a Difference Engine, built in the 2000s, that is in the History of the Computer museum in Mountain View, California. I have seen it and it is indeed, a thing of extraordinary beauty."

For some reason, I thought it might ""grow on me"" and change how I felt overall. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.First off, and what I tend to lean very heavily on with my graphic reading, the art is gorgeous. Padua's lines and movement and layouts and character design and cats and and and... Everything in this book is worth noting when it comes to the artwork. Unless you simply hate her style outright, you will love the artwork.As for the story itself, I really thought this was more of a graphic novel / complete arc story when I bought it. Yes, it has a sense of movement, but it doesn't act as one story. Instead, it's a compilation of different adventures. While I didn't mind this format, honestly, none of the tales ever fully took off for me. Again, I loved the art, but what story it told... I found it hard to care about.This brings me to the best-worst part of the novel: the historical footnotes. I LOVED that her research informed every line and scene in this. Her research astounded me. The footnotes were quite interesting and added to the story in an awesome way. However, they were equally distracting, some taking so long to read that the flow of the original tale was not only up-ended but tossed out the window, too. I tried reading the story without the footnotes, but it fell flat, not seeming as rich as before. When I read the footnotes first, then went back to the story, I couldn't always remember what fact went with what, and it lost the richness, too. And--for me--reading both jumbled both fact and fiction to where it was hard to follow the story.In the end, this works as a much better non-fiction book about these two historical figures--even if the majority of it takes place in a fictional, pocket universe. And maybe it was simply me that had problems with this flip-flopping in the story. Regardless, the art is gorgeous and, for me, totally worth the price of admission."
143,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17620166-richard-holmes,5,"I'd heard of this book before, and probably of the webcomic it derives from, but for incomprehensible reasons I hadn't read either until recently when a Twitterite posted news of a new Lovelace and Babbage story, the first in quite some time. I binge-read what comics are still online (some which are in this book have been removed), then decided I had to read the book. I tried first getting it from the library as a Kindle book but found it too hard to read — text too small and, unlike with a textual ebook, not really enlargeable. So I put in a request for the paper and ink book and waited for it.Worth the wait.One of the most delightful books I've read in recent memory. The comics themselves are funny (""This must be Twittered! Wait. This is a fan.""), engaging, and wonderfully drawn. And they, like Lovelace's translation of Menabrea's description of the Analytical Engine, are supplemented almost to a tail-wagging-dog level with entertaining footnotes and endnotes detailing information about the historical Lovelace, Babbage, Babbage's Engines, and various people caught up in the story — I. K. Brunel, William Hamilton, Marian Evans (alias George Eliot), the Charleses Dickens and Dodgson, and others. The book concludes with extracts from various primary sources — including a couple of letters, hitherto little-known, that pretty much obliterate the notion that Lovelace was anything less than a highly skilled mathematician, a vital contributor to the development of computing, and someone genuinely admired and liked by Babbage — and an illustrated summary of the working principles of the Analytical Engine. That in reality Lovelace died at 36 and Babbage never completed his computation engines is proof, if any still is needed, that the universe in which we live is woefully defective.That Padua has produced this book is proof that it still has its great moments."
144,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12594253-alice-as-in-wonderland,5,"I’m not entirely sure if the sheer amount of exclamation points on the cover has clued you in, but this book is quite exciting. Just visually, the illustrations are wonderful and give an immediate likeability to the characters that Padua creates out of Lovelace and Babbage.If you’re not in the know, Charles Babbage was one of the first people to conceptualize the computer, and Lady Lovelace (the daughter of the (in)famous Lord Byron) was one of the first people to conceptualize the language that this computer would speak in. They are together considered the inventor of the computer and the first computer programmer respectively. Unfortunately, in our reality, the story ends less than ideally: Lovelace is lost to cancer at the age of 36, and Babbage’s inability to finish and fund his project results in it never being realized and him dying bitterly, though at the significantly healthier age of 79. All of this is related in the humorous and heavily annotated illustrations, rife with snarky jokes. Then Padua goes a step further. In the pocket alternate dimension of the book, Lovelace and Babbage are able to collaborate on the fully functional Analytical Engine unhampered by things like critical existence failure. The result is some of the most mathematically and historically informative graphic novels (which is spliced with so many footnotes that it becomes a history book in its own right) that I have ever read, despite a large portion of it never having happened.This book is alternate parts graphic novel, alternate parts a book about mathematics and computing, or a book about the history of Lovelace, Babbage & Co. or a fun Steampunk-y book filled with informatively incorrect interactions of some major names of the time period. I'd say it's got something for everyone. "
145,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46420210-daniel-allen,4,"In summary: I loved the art, I learned lots about Lovelace and Babbage, I laughed out loud a number of times, and was reasonably happy with the whole.I would've given this five stars if it had held together as a graphic novel, intead of 6 somewhat unconnected episodes of a web comic, followed by admittedly very enjoyable appendices of period letters and publications and finally an attractive graphical explanation of how Babbage's hardware worked.The art is gorgeous; the first episode of the web-comic will continue to hold pride-of-place on my office door probably forever.http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/love...The ""pocket universe"" where Lovelace and Babbage teamed up to fight crime was entertaining, especially with their 3rd comrade-in-arms, the one and only Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a 19th century engineering who *actually* changed the world within his lifetime; many times over.It suffered from the issue I have with many books with appendices: hitting the end of the regular book well before I expected. Nooooooo! It feels like we're left hanging after an entertaining visit with Charles Dodgeson and a trip through a looking-glass. In retrospect, the chapter headings, which were made like 19th century periodical advertisements, do hint very well what it was: a series of episodes rather than a unified story line. I'm also not sure we occasionally needed footnotes from footnotes from endnotes from explanatory text below the comic- this somewhat distracted from absorbing the content, which was interesting enough, and perhaps she could have worked it into only one nested footnote?"
146,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8218393-misty,5,"Absolutely fabulous. Padua's graphic novel account of the early years of Ada Byron (later Countess Lovelace) and her meeting with Charles Babbage was delightful, surprising, and riveting. I didn't want it to end. Her art is wonderfully whimsical (Ada's eyes in particular are so expressive) and Charles Babbage comes across as a goofy genius, lovable for all his flaws and temper. (And his plaid pants.)The later segments that imagine adventures for our impetuous and knowledgeable duo become more hilarious the more you know of the period--and Padua's extensive footnotes will ensure you come to know a great deal about the period, not just about the major figures (Queen Victoria, the Duke of Wellington, Thomas Carlyle, George Eliot, I.K. Brunel, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge all make appearances) but some of the major debates and the exuberant push toward knowledge and invention in which the early Victorians participated. The footnotes are so thorough that they have their own footnotes in the endnotes, and the endnotes have footnotes, too.Last but certainly not least, the appendices share all sorts of primary documents about our beloved heroes, and some fascinating graphs of what Babbage's Differential and Analytical Engines were supposed to look like. Padua knows her stuff (or does a good enough job winging it to convince this amateur), and moreover, her love of the imaginative possibilities for all the math--and the imaginative capabilities of our major characters, especially our heroine, the lamentably short-lived Ada--is wildly infectious. Ada's pipe and jodphurs have an expressive language all their own (so does her hair), and frankly, I couldn't get enough of the footnotes. I wish I could get all my history, mathematics, philosophy, and wild speculations about quantum physics and time in graphic form."
147,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36354969-michael-smith,5,"I’ve long been fascinated by Charles Babbage and his “difference engine” (almost always confused with his “analytical engine,” which was the first instance of the concepts which grew into the digital computer more than a century later), especially after reading Gibson and Sterling’s 1991 novel. Babbage was a first-rate mathematician (he held Isaac Newton’s Lucasian Chair of math at Cambridge, most recently occupied by Stephen Hawking) but Ada, Countess of Lovelace (the only legitimate child of the mad, bad, dangerous Lord Byron) was a certified math genius. Babbage was a terrific mechanic of the tinkering variety but Ada devised the high theoretical concepts behind the engine. Unfortunately, while Babbage lived a long life, Ada died of cancer at the age of thirty-seven, and the engine was never completed.But what if Ada Lovelace had lived on? What if she and Babbage had entered a long, successful collaboration and produced a working steam-powered mechanical computer at the peak of the Victorian Age? That’s the story that the author/artist tells in this fascinating and continually entertaining graphic novel. Her pocket what-if universe includes an Ada who wears jodhpurs and smokes a pipe, an industrial hyper-revolution aided by sheer computing power, and an irascible Babbage who invents not only economic modeling for the government, but also an automatic spellchecker to assist novelist George Eliot. Padua has done her research, too, as witnessed by the detailed endnotes to every chapter and her grasp of the social and political milieu of the mid-19th century. Her sense of humor is dry and intellectual and frequently off the wall. And her slightly wide-eyed drawing style absolutely suits her subject. This is a book you will want to reread several times, at several levels of seriousness -- and yet it’s the very definition of “a hoot.”"

Equally highly recommended for anyone who might not immediately profess an enthusiasm for any of those topics/genres and who generally don't pick up books in graphic novel format. Hands down my favorite book of the year so far.How do I love thee, Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage? Let me count the ways.*1. Footnotes. I have an incandescent passion for fiction with footnotes.** This book is full of footnotes. And endnotes. Some of the footnotes have footnotes! The footnote is a character in one episode!!2. Excellent demonstrations of the giddy joy of obscure research. Padua capsulizes this herself (in a footnote! yes!!): ""Finding the Faraday letter opposite was my introduction to the very great thrill of throw-down victory in Combat Scholarship."" 3. A fascinating look at how provision of scanned and searchable out-of-copyright materials online has created an entirely new playing field for said research.****Elizabeth Barrett Browning is mentioned at one point, as are most of the other notables of mid-19th century England intelligensia.** This started with Hans Brinker. I first read it as a library copy, and when I asked for a personal copy I instructed my parents to make sure that it was an edition with all the footnotes.*** My only slight qualm with Padua's opus, speaking ex cathedra as a librarian, is that when she cites Wikipedia as a research source**** pains my professional sensibilities.**** [But I have to admit that I myself am culpable from time to time in the matter of Wikipedia use. Don't tell!] "
149,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47719722-shelley,5,"This is an excellent graphic novel and an unexpected surprise. I know comics can tell stories in a visual way but the ability to present a mix of research and creativity really took me back. Ada Lovelace is one of my heroes and I loved how Sydney Padua brought her friendship with Charles Babbage to life. This 320 page epic comic presents a pocket universe where the Analytical Engine (I disagree with the author on the Difference Engine being the better name) actually came to fruition. The separate stories feature various cameos from Victorian life including the likes of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and George Eliot. Each comic strip has extensive footnotes that wryly contextualise the action with history. Padua also brilliantly evidences the fact that Babbage and Lovelace were partners in the development of the first computer, with one developing the hardware and the other concentrating on the software. There have been attempts to discredit Ada Lovelace and give all the glory to Babbage and it is for this reason that I was touched by the author's reaction to finding a letter which states that Babbage declared that Lovelace had the greater understanding of the capabilities of his machine. Babbage's beliefs should be the final say in the matter, for he was no sufferer of fools.Padua clearly fell in love with the era and the technology. She brings the Analytical Engine to life in a way that no dull biography or textbook ever could. This is a graphic novel that should be admired by fans of the genre and those who are not. Any one who questions the capacity of the graphic novel to inform as well as entertain should pick up a copy of 'The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer'."

151,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5836431-leslie,4,"This graphic novel was a really fun read and it made me want to know more about the titular characters. Lovelace and Babbage are credited with doing some of the first work in making computers a reality, though they did not see their work come to fruition in their lifetimes. In addition to Lovelace and Babbage we get to see other historical figures in this novel, such as Queen Victoria, Charles Dickens, and George Eliot. Most of the graphic novel takes place in what Padua calls a ""pocket universe"", or an alternative universe in which Lovelace does not pass away from cancer and the pair do actually make their Difference Machine. This graphic novel has so many bits a pieces and so it can be read in different ways depending on how much time you want to invest in it, or whether or not you are interested in different aspects. The endnotes and footnotes make up almost as much room as the comic itself. Sometimes they are complementary and help to understand what is going on in the graphic sections, and sometimes they are more like interesting tidbits. There was also an extensive appendix with examples of the primary sources that Padua used in her research, and while I wasn't too interested in that (hello, reason I am not a history major), I think it could be very interesting to others. For the most part I enjoyed the footnotes and endnotes and it was as if I were watching Padua write and construct the stories as I was reading. It certainly would have been a less rewarding read without Padua's research and witty commentary."

This is one of the zaniest, biggest-hearted things I've read in years. Belly laughs and tearful eyes, all in one, plus a generous dollop of Complex Numbers, Computation and Boolean Logic. This book deserves to be remembered, along with Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, as one of the great modern paeans to mathematical genius.The book is a mixture of brilliant scholarship and absurd fantasy. In her footnotes, prologue and epilogue, Padua introduces us to the ""real"" Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, two of the nineteenth century's greatest failed visionaries. In the 200-or-so pages sandwiched between these slices of reality, she introduces us to Babbage and Lovelace, heroes of a steampunk alternative universe, hobnobbing with the greats and solving huge problems with the power of their massive computer. There are cameos from all your favourite Victorians, from Brunel to Eliot, wicked puns, rambling scholarly footnotes written in the most energetic style, pointed satire (the chapter on Economic Models is particularly impressive) and mystical adventures in the strange universe of pure mathematics.Ada Lovelace herself once dreamed of a ""poetical science,"" and described herself as a ""fairy"" tripping through the purple realm of numbers—Padua's vision is true to that of her heroine's."
153,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10383735-sarah,5,"AMAZING! Ada Lovelace is getting more attention these days, but until this book came out, finding primary source material - or any reputable information about Lord Byron's logical, innovative daughter - was very difficult. Padua's research is diligent and outstanding, and her fondness for Lovelace and Babbage makes the blending of historical fact and speculative fiction a very fun read. The (mostly) fictional graphic novel, featuring the most adorable Queen Victoria to ever appear in print, Charles Dickens, and George Eliot, is funny and warm and satisfyingly technical. The logical engines never finished by Babbage are sketched and brought to well-imagined life, and then used to fight crime, because if you have awesome protagonists and a thinking engine,  of course you're going to fight crime.Highly recommended! High school ages and up, probably, although I would have been tremendously excited to read it in middle school. Definitely a good source for librarians and folks interested in promoting STEM + women in science topics. (Particularly excellent for Padua's discussion of the publishing career restrictions faced by women in that era, and the way women worked around them! While Lovelace and her contemporaries in the Victorian era were banned from publishing original research, they could ""translate"" and ""annotate"" the works of their male colleagues... and brought about some awesome advances to their fields.)"

While the truth is stretched *just a trifle* in her comic book history, she footnotes all the actual stuff, so that with only a little effort you can determine which elements of her story are mathematical fact, and which poetical fancy. But why bother? Why not just abandon yourself to one of the most perfect (mostly true) tales of Victorian England, that makes the whole steam punk thing finally make sense. With a flick of her wrist, Padua inserts Lewis Carol, Charles Dickens, George Elliot and the grandaddy of all things hysterically steampunkish, Isambard Kingdom Brunel.There're a million and one footnotes in this comic, but the book totally works without them, if you believe my 9 year old son. So, this is either a one sitting giggle fest (without the footnotes) or a serious examination of the state of information technology in the age of steam, with excurses for various different mathematical musings, London society gossip, and reproductions of contemporary newspapers as apposite."
155,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18673428-johan-haneveld,5,"9+ I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I can hardly call it a graphic novel, as most of it is text (in footnotes and notes to the footnotes, and appendixes), mixed in with comics and diagrams. But however you choose to classify it, it's an absolute delight. The style of the comics reminded me of Gotlib (whose 'Waanzin waanzuit' I enjoyed back in the day), with a lot of absurdist humor sprinkled in. The humour is also to be found in the footnotes, which are not dry at all, at one point playing a pivotal role in the story. There's a lot of fun information here, about Victorian society, the lives of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace and their characters, interactions with authors and architects and the working of the first computer (which was never really completed). Coupled with hilarious original sources this paints an interesting picture of the 19th century as a time in which science and logic wrestled with societal expectations and illogical convictions (e.g. that women were physically incapable of doing mathematics ...). There's a bit of an alternative universe presented here, in which the analytical engine was finished, but those stories also serve to illuminate real world persons and ideas. So I came away from this book both satisfied with my enjoyment and enriched by new knowledge. And for all its 'stuffy' subject matter it was a relatively quick read.

Brilliant, witty, and popular despite (maybe because of?) a fascination with computers and technology, the popular nerd is a rare bird. As is Lovelace and Babbage.Ms. Padua – a special effects artist by day – takes her artistic skills, mixes them with some excellent research, and ends up with a novel that asks the question: What if Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage had created a computer in Victorian London?So, yes, technically, this is fiction. But the amount of research that went into it – the footnotes are copious – makes it smarter than a lot of serious non-fiction. This is the second fictionalized version I’ve read of Ada Lovelace in recent months (the other is a children’s book that pairs her with Mary Shelley), and I much prefer this version. This fictional Lovelace is much more rooted in fact, and even with the pipe smoking, she’s a much better scientific role model for girls (which I think is what her purpose was supposed to be in that very, very loose-with-history children’s book). I will say that the plot of the novel is not the strongest, but there’s such a sense of whimsy that pervades the book that I didn’t care. Highly recommended. "

If I could give it 10 out of 5 stars, I would in a heartbeat.First off, the actual telling of true historical events in the beginning was amazing for both the content it covered and the delivery which was fresh and inviting without talking down. Then there was the Pocket Universe, which was so fantastically done! And that's all before you even get to what happens in the Pocket Universe which is the bulk of this work.As a computer scientist who has read and studied the history of computers for a long time, this definitely spoke to me on a lot more levels than it would the average person (I was gifted this due to my love of Ada Lovelace), but I doubt that a reader new to this story, with no knowledge of CS, would have trouble.This book would be especially great for young girls/women who are taught that computers have always been the work of men – which is flatly wrong on so many levels. Books like this help to remind us that not only were women involved from the start, everyone is equal before the computer and everyone can contribute.Plus that panel of Ada Lovelace saying, ""I am the high priestess of this engine,"" is the stuff of dreams."
158,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/163750-nicole,4,"The illustrations are adorable—not just cute, though many of them are, but wonderfully detailed and brilliantly expressive.Sydney Padua’s affection for her protagonists is contagious. Babbage is a charmingly eccentric genius here and Lovelace is a brilliant steampunk badass, though the historical record of them is not so kind. Lovelace and Babbage’s friendship is depicted in such a charming, warm, meeting-of-the-minds way. The epilogue with them strolling off through the guts of the engine, engaged in happy conversation warmed my heart—with a little bit of melancholy, as their real lives weren’t so happy.Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away I studied calculus and got good grades; but “use it or lose it,” as they say, and I’ve forgotten pretty much all my higher math. I’m not particularly mechanical, either, nor can I write computer code. So some of the technical material in this book went over my head, and I just have to take the author’s and footnoted sources’ word for it. It is fascinating how some people’s minds work, though.I took a class in grad school covering Victorian literature in tandem with Victorian-era history, and it certainly wasn’t as entertaining as this book. "
159,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/601119-jenn-estepp,3,"Maybe I am just not smart enough - or smart enough in the right way - to really love this book? I love the elements of it and I think much of it is fascinating, and I like the art but not it does not necessarily add up to a statisying reading experience as a graphic novel? Maybe because I sort of expect some narrative linearity and this sort of felt more like Padua took the webcomics and then wrote really extensive footnotes to explain them to people who might not have understood or got all the jokes and then that is what got published? Which is fine and enjoyable, sometimes, but also led to some skimming and wishing for a little more of the thrilling adventures and little less of the puns and anecdotes and esoteric explanations. I mean, if you are going to go to the trouble of creating a pocket universe wherein pretty much anything can happen, why not make more things happen? Maybe the first part of the title misled me into not paying so much attention to the latter part of it. Nevertheless! I did actually enjoy it and I did learn some things, but I didn't love it and I wanted to so I am maybe a little sad about it on that front. "

In reality, Ada Lovelace died very young of cancer and Charles Babbage never actually built his machine, but in The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage, Sydney Padua presents an alternate history with a happier ending. Originally a webcomic, this one is a cross between nonfiction, alternate history, and steampunk with a lot of math and science thrown in for fun. The black and white illustrations tell the snarky, humorous story of what could have been, along with extensive factual footnotes based on the writings of Lovelace and Babbage. This was not something I would usually pick up, but I ended up enjoying the comics themselves (the footnotes did get a little overwhelming). Not easy to nail down who would like this, but it would need to be someone who likes their graphic novels with steampunk, science, math, and/or history."
161,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4401053-phil-scovis,4,"There is at least one other alternative history that imagines a Victorian-age computer: Gibson and Sterling's ""The Difference Engine"". That one is a boring disappointment for so intriguing a premise. This one makes up the difference, as it were.In graphic novel format, Charles Babbage and Lady Lovelace come to life, along with the other real-life steampunk characters of Michael Faraday, George Eliot, Lewis Carroll, Isambard Brunel, and a who's-who of Victorian personages.The stories are pure fantasy, but every time they seem to go over the top into ridiculousness, there's a footnote to an actual quote from the writings of Lovelace and Babbage. Like any great Victorian romance, there's plenty of ironic social commentary. With constant maintenance-- and a great deal of noise-- the ponderous Analytical Engine fights crime, spell-checks great literature, and wrecks the economy. The book is thoroughly researched, right down to the explanations of how the fabled machine works (or would have worked), complete with meticulously-drawn illustrations."
162,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5607334-olivia,3,"I really love the idea of this book. The author heard about these historical characters in passing, wanted to learn more, did research, and made a comic (first in web format then published in print). I enjoyed the fact she loved the research so much she included PAGES of footnotes and endnotes and snippets from primary sources. However, being the person that I am, I felt like I had to read it all or at least skim it. Frankly I am not the type of nerd that could *really* get into the content like she did. This book is for math and computer science nerds who also like comics.Her style is lovely and is one of the main reasons why I picked this up. The book itself also has a great style that works in with the story well. My appreciation for her love of research and her drawing style gives this 3 stars. The extra information just took me out of the stories and I enjoyed it less than if I could get into the primary sources and footnotes (or maybe if I just ignored them all)."
163,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/199559-alice,4,"What an amazing book this is! The author has to be a genius herself for coming up with such a fascinating conceit: Babbage and Lovelace actually work together in an effort to create the first computer. The book is full of source material (actual) as well as loads of made-up stuff, but we are warned by the sub-title that this book is a ""(mostly) true story of the first computer."" The drawings are detailed, fabulous and full of life. The book is funny, irreverent, inscrutable at many times (for those of us who aren't mathematicians or mechanically-inclined). That, however, didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying this romp. Anyone who likes math or who is interested in computer history will find this book enjoyable. I loved its sense of humor, its homage to history through its use of source material, and I admire Ms. Padua for being so darned clever and smart. This book took a huge amount of research; hats off to the author!"

It's funny, informative and, at points, surprisingly moving.First off - the research and depth of this book are intense (in a good way). I learnt so much while reading it about not only the title heroes, but also about maths, history and economics, although I did find myself skipping parts of it because it went too in depth in each of the topics and was a bit heavy - ""What's this? A graph in the middle of my graphic novel? The horror!""This book is an achievement in itself, and I encourage anyone with an interest in Victorian history and computers to read it.That being said, you have to have good eye sight as well. I was reading the hardback version of this book, and sometimes I was squinting so hard to read the footnotes (and there are a LOT of footnotes) that I had to stop because I had such a headache.Isambard Kingdom Brunel's entrance is my favourite part of the whole thing."
165,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80247437-thomas,5,"I salute Sydney Padua for coming up with one of the most brilliant ideas in the history of graphic novels.I love this art, the depiction of these characters is wonderful. This book is clever and beautiful and well researched. I don't often buy graphic novels but this one is special. The real-life story behind it is fun and amazing and tragic. I love that it doesn't take itself too seriously, breaks the fourth wall at the right times and just made me want to know more about these people and the world they lived in. However, I honestly don't think the pipe was necessary and don't understand why the author added it. I get that that not everyone will agree with me on this, some will consider it a feature rather than a flaw, I suppose. In the interest of full disclosure, I should admit that my feelings on this are driven by a deep down revulsion for tobacco in all its forms and smoking in general. That doesn't stop me from loving this book because it's just that good."
166,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6676200-joe-santoro,4,"I'm of two minds on this... on the one hand, it's an absolutely fantastic way to dole out history... Padua's cartoons do a fantastic job illustrating her points, be it an historical fact she wants to share, or a bit of satire on today's world. The research is a triumph of using google, really. I'd love to see others use a similar method to tackle other historical topics.On the other hand, there's not much in the 'thrilling adventures' category... mostly it's just Ms. Padua having famous people visit Lovelace and Babbage as a starting point to tell us stuff. While there are some great steampunk-ish designs of both the difference engine and a few other random things.. calling this a 'novel' or a 'story' is not really correct. It's a series of anecdotes, really.If that sounds like your cup of tea, and you want to be greatly amused while leaning a bit about some underrated historical figures, this is definitely the book for you."
167,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60854850-alex-chan,5,"Really enjoyed it. The book is part-comic, part-footnote, with the footnote commentary providing snippets of a biography for Babbage and Lovelace.I found the comic sections very funny, and now I have all sorts of fluffy feelings for Babbage and Lovelace in the Pocket Universe. But where it really shines is in the history – it’s clear the author has spent a lot of time researching the pair. Lots of new and interesting facts, and a comic turns out to be a great way to convey aspects of their character.My one quibble is that I struggled to find the flow. Read the comic, then re-read for the footnotes? Footnotes as I go along? A mix of both? That slowed me down a bit.Meta: this book has sat on a shelf for a while, in part because it was a gift from somebody who shortly after fell out of my life. Worth the wait, and has also provided an excellent connection with Chris H at work."

I understand why the author wanted to use so many footnotes, but there were so, so many that it really interrupted the flow of reading the stories. I felt like the graphic narrative and the footnote commentary were fighting for my attention and it made me tired. So in the end, I ended up skipping most of the footnotes. If there had been far fewer, I expect I would have enjoyed reading them, too. (""If I had more time I would have written a shorter letter."")"

Padua's playful and clear-eyed spirit hovers over the otherwise threadbare and sad story of Lovelace and Babbage -- she died young of cancer, he died old and embittered of terminal grumpiness and lack of fulfillment -- and turns it into a delightful romp through some of the more entertaining and fascinating by-ways of Victorian life. Thomas Carlyle, Charles Dickens, the Queen herself, ""Lewis Carroll"" and many more -- they all make cameo appearances and illuminate the special duality of Victorian life: so advanced in some things and backwards in others. A truly wonderful introduction to Victorian history and the personalities that animated that wonderful age. "

The attention to detail that Padua put into both the art and the research that she shares in the footnotes is commendable. Technically only about a third of the book is a graphic novel because the vast majority of the pages and space is taken up by very interesting, detailed, and insightful footnotes and endnotes. It's not for the faint of heart.If you're interested in the topics of mathematics and the origins of computers, then this is a book that will keep you turning pages. If you're looking for a quick romp with just the basics, then keep looking because this is a book that requires attention and dedication. "

The comics would go quickly, but those footnotes are weighty, funny and completely necessary to get the full picture.

The cartoons are brilliant--my favorite sequence is the part with George Eliot--but the extensive footnotes (be prepared, oh reader!) tell the real story.

218,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/238527-dioni-bookie-mee,4,"This graphic novel was not like what I expected in more ways than one. I didn't know the story of Ada Lovelace apart from the popular claim of her as the first computer programmer. I knew even less about Babbage. So my bar of knowledge was pretty low, but I would say that this graphic novel has an incredible amount of information and research. There's an awful lot of footnotes, and the footnotes have footnotes! I'm the type of person who usually read footnotes, but even for me the amount of notes here are way beyond any book that I've ever read, graphic novel or not, that I have to admit I skimmed some of them. Almost every single page has footnotes. This initially bothered me quite a bit because it slowed down my reading a lot, but after a while, I accepted the style and at times treated the footnotes as the actual content and the images are there to illustrate the footnotes. It's as if someone has collected all the noteworthy information about Lovelace and Babbage and present them in bullet points and accompanying illustrations. So in terms of enjoyment, I'd say it's a mixed bag, but I certainly learned a lot about Lovelace and Babbage.Another really interesting point is that if you know as little about their story as I did, you might be surprised too to find that they did not have many ""adventures"" at all in their lifetimes. Ada Lovelace was way ahead of her time (it must still be tough to be a female mathematician today, but in mid 1800s?) and she died young. Meanwhile Babbage, widely considered as ""father of the computer"" never actually finished the said computer in physical form. The computer existed in his lots of notes, but he never got enough funding to build it physically. Interestingly as I just finished a Coursera course titled ""Build a Modern Computer from First Principles"" - I recognised that many of Babbage concepts indeed sound very similar to the computer of today. Because Ada died young (36), she and Babbage did not have a lot of time together (Babbage died an old age at 79. They met when Ada was 17 and Babbage 42.) From the paper evidence (letters) it did seem that they were truly kindred spirits and found in each other an intellectual partnership. Charles Babbage focused on the machines, very much on the hardware, while Ada saw the full potential of the machines as being more than calculating machines (there are a couple of machines or more, the most famous being the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine). Her realisation was to be ""the essential root of computer science that by manipulating symbols according to rules, any kind of information, not only numbers, can be operated on by automatic processes."" She encouraged Babbage to build his Engine and that she shall be its ""high priestess"". Considering how well known they are today and the roles they've played in the history of computer, it's quite poignant to find that Ada only published one paper before dying of cancer a few years later, while Babbage never finished any of his machines and died a bitter man. In Ada's time too as you can imagine, it was not an acceptable thing to be 'too smart' and that the fragile ladies must be protected from hard science lest it disrupts their disposition. People, probably up til today, even doubted that Ada was the person writing the published paper. Because gender. As if there aren't enough fascinating points, Ada was the child of Lord Byron the ""wild"" poet, and she was raised the way she was, learning mathematics and science, to subdue her 'poetical gene'. Her mother (who was a 'keen amateur mathematician' herself) basically raised Ada to be the opposite of her father as much as possible. Really amazing explanation of her education. The real story of Ada Lovelace and Babbage stopped at page 29 of the 317 pages of the graphic novel. The rest is the made-up adventure stories, the imagined world where Lovelace and Babbage would continue their partnerships, in possibly a more modern, more kinder world, where such partnership would thrive. The world where the Difference/Analytical Engine and the first Computer was actually built for the duo to solve problems and sometimes create havoc. I was skeptical at first, but gradually found it really fitting and adorable. Like the author Sydney Padua, I too was really sad at page 29. It was an odd feeling to be sad about something that happened so long ago, and only because I had only found out about it. So the rest of the book was like a balm to soothe that sadness. Let us imagine for a few hundred pages, an alternate world where a very smart young lady can be an ass-kicking mathematician and the first world programmer, platonically partnering with an equally smart older man of quirky personality who totally respects and admires her. Yes this computer programmer would very much love that world."

I did not exactly dislike it but I think this is a to warn those too impressed with the high star average rating. Padua has written a family friendly books, as in no bad words or graphic sex, but what exactly she has written is hard to divine. To get back to it, Graphic “thingie” because I do not get what this book is supposed to be or whom it is primarily about.There is actual history behind this book, so it might be a graphic history or bio. Except that most of the graphic content is made up or unattested to as portrayed. So maybe it is a fictionalized history, so Graphic Novel. The barrage of overly long footnotes are intended to document the basic events so maybe a history. But there is also a din of science and such so maybe a science book. Well actually the footnotes become such a drag that even Ms. Padua not only admits that they are too many and too long ,she even posts dialogue and illustrations over a few as a way of admitting she needed to be edited.Critical to the purpose of this book is to honor the real mathematical contributions of Lady Lovelace. Except that she never seems to be much more than a side kick to the nerdy, classic Victorian English enthusiast and inventor Charles Babbage. We get pages of detailed explanations of how Babage's proto computer, whichever machine none where finished, was supposed to work and almost no examples of Lovelace's math or programing. So who is the star of this book? Does Lady Lovelace get her proper recognition?Did I mention that the Thrilling Adventures all take place in an alternative time line pocket universe? Most of the stories are stories of things that never could have happened and the rest do not appear in the record of this universe.Let’s try this another way:If you can filter past the incredibly long and convoluted footnotes (Suggestion: if you footnote a letter you do not need to included entire letter just to prove you did your research.) there are some fun little made up stories about math and economics and stuff. None of it having much to do with the Babbage Analytical Engine, or was it the Difference engine? lt;, hardly matters, neither was ever finished.Or if you can filter out the events that never happened there are some intelligent discussions of economics and various other technical or mechanical things, including a layout of how the Babbage engine, which ever one it was might have worked if it had been finished.Lady Lovelace does appear and we do get her biography. Not much on her math or programming, but the general opinion was that she was good at both and never esp respected for it, er them.If you have read this far and are unsure what he Amazing Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage is about or what it is relating or basically: is it worth muddling through. My work here is done."
220,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3088726-mark-schlatter,5,"I really must insist that if books like this exist that the universe do a better job of informing me about them.This is a collection of a webcomic by Sydney Padua which starts with the historical facts of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage and their efforts (never completed) to construct the first computer (the Analytical Engine), with Babbage providing the hardware and Lovelace the software. At the end of the first episode, Padua embarks on a flight of fancy to a Victorian England where the Analytical Engine was actually built. That ending (just a few pages) caused Padau's audience to demand more, and thus the subsequent episodes recount the interactions in a parallel universe between Lovelace, Babbage, the Engine, and most of nineteenth century English society, including (but not limited to) the Queen herself, Robert Carlyle, Lewis Carroll, and Luddites. All throughout, hilarity ensues. Here's some of what I love about this book:1) Padua's artwork is a wonderful blend of the detail of Mad Magazine-era Jack Davis and the facial expressions of Kyle Baker. Beyond that, she clearly loves drawing detailed machinery. The result is a wonderful blend of the technical and the hysterical.2) Every page has footnotes (some of which get involved with the goings-on of the page itself). Every episode has endnotes referencing the footnotes. Some of those endnotes have footnotes. The tri-fold level of recursion is quite pleasing.3) There is a scene in the middle which resembles the ""through the factory"" climax of Monsters, Inc. Except that the scene features not Sully and Mike, but George Elliot, and there are copious references to the frightening trend of destructive reading for archival preservation.4) The last episode involves visual play on the development of non-Euclidean geometry while simultaneously referring to the bifurcation of academic opinions on just how talented Ada Lovelace was.5) Padua is thankfully obsessed with primary sources, to the extent that the backmatter is an introduction to how Charles Babbage was used as a metaphor for calculating prowess in Victorian newspapers. At this point, practically anything I can say about the book is potentially reductive and pales next to its splendor. Read the damn thing."

There were multiple footnotes on almost every page, some quite long, then endnotes after each section and 15 pages of historical documents in the back. I enjoyed some anecdotes, but after so many, it just became overwhelming. It was more random fun anecdotes than a story. It’d be great if I’m just reading a blog, “Today, I found out this about Lady Lovelace and Baggage!”. I love historical fiction and I enjoy when the author takes time at the end to explain research discoveries, what was true, what was changed. Its generally just a few pages. In this book, I imagine altogether it must account for at least half of the pages.At least some of these anecdotes could have been incorporated into a more biographical story. The name-dropping of intellectuals of Victorian London could have been made a story instead of long footnotes.Much time is spent unnecessarily on explaining the pocket universe. A simple “in an alternate universe” would have sufficed, especially since not much interesting really happened the pocket universe. Queen Victoria visits requesting use for crime-fighting and author George Eliot nearly loses her novel to the Difference Engine. The banking crisis part was better and significant in linking to the potential of computing complex analysis. The “Imaginary Quantities” chapter was great, exploring Ada’s character more, her strengths, her insecurities, her faults as well as discussing skepticism as to how much she actually contributed.I very much enjoyed seeing the engine imagined as real and the intricacies of how it worked. I liked this more in Appendix II looking at individual components and detailing the actual design. I didn’t read each description, but the pictures and what I did read provided enough for me to get a good understanding of how it worked. I less enjoyed the parts in the pocket universe when the Difference Engine appears as a labyrinthine mechanical cavern.My favorite random anecdote was Babbage’s letter to the poet Lord Tennyson, explaining how “every minute dies a man, every minute one is born” is statistically inaccurate and apparently the word minute did get changed to moment.

She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. Charles Babbage was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer.Padua's debut graphic novel transforms the collaboration between Lovelace and Babbage into an inspired and speculative story. Lovelace was a talented mathematician and helped translate a paper on Babbage's ideas for an Analytical Engine, the world’s first computer. The notes she added to the translation were so cleverly detailed that experts today recognize them as the first example of computer programming.Although Lovelace died a few years later and Babbage was left to tinker with his Analytical Engine until his death, Padua imagines an alternate reality where they build the engine and use it to have thrilling adventures and fight crime.The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer is written and constructed extremely well. The immensity of Padua's research and the wit and allusions of her prose are striking, saying as much about what drove her to explore the possibilities of her protagonists' relationship as about the protagonists themselves.All in all, The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer is a wonderful graphic novel that hypothesis what would happen if Lovelace and Babbage didn't die before completing their Analytical Engine."

I doubt there is a woman working in IT who wouldn't cite Ada Lovelace as a personal hero. And yet how much do we actually know about her? Well thanks to this book, the answer to that is now ""quite a bit thanks"". It's a brilliant mix of well-researched history, maths, engineering and total geekery. Oh yes, and footnotes. If there's one thing Sydney Padua clearly loves even more than the heroes of her book, it's a footnote. So much so, that the footnotes even become part of the story at one point!It starts with a bit of history, telling us the story of Lovelace and Babbage, their friendship and the work they both did. One of my absolute favourite facts is that Ada was more than a bit sweary. Anyone who's ever sat at their desk turning the air blue with their cursing when some errant software won't behave as it should will automatically have an affinity with the potty-mouthed countess. Once the facts have been dealt with, Sydney Padua sets the pair loose in an imaginary universe to have all sorts of adventures. These involve a number of other marvellous characters, including George Eliot, Isambard Kingdom Brunel (my personal favourite guest appearance) and Queen Victoria. Fantastic though this all is, much of it has at least a link to actual events or writings and this is where the footnotes come into their own, explaining where the inspiration for the action and dialogue is from. The whole thing is beautifully and expressively drawn - particularly Babbage's Difference Engine which is a character in its own right in all its steampunk glory.In the final section there are extracts from some documents and letters about our heroes along with illustrations and descriptions showing how Babbage's inventions would have worked. Geek heaven!"

You're the brains and I'm the ...... brains""[Lovelace] ""I think you perceive the difficulty."" This book is such a wonderful mess. It’s presented as “The (Mostly) True Story of the First Computer”, but I can’t quite agree with that. The book consists of comics, short and long, gigantic footnotes and complicated computer information. In Lovelace & Babbage, the author has visualised a fantasy world – universe actually – where the first computer was built in the Victorian era, by scientist/engineer/mathematician/genius Charles Babbage and mathematician/programmer Ada Byron (daughter of the famous poet), Countess of Lovelace. In reality this computer, called The Analytical Engine, was never realised, for Lovelace died young of cancer and Babbage always had improvements to make to the designs. He died a bitter man.In this universe, however, called ‘The Pocket Universe’, Lovelace and Babbage finish the engine and have sort of adventures. The ‘sort of’ is the only downside of the book: the ‘story’ consists of bits and pieces. There is no real development or climax or plot whatsoever. Even though I didn’t understand the science talk, I still found it very interesting to read and explore the mathematics in the Victorian era and the personalities of Lovelace and Babbage. The book is extremely well-researched. The tone is comical and amusing. It's filled with facts and anecdotes. I hope to read it again sometime.Bonus points for the beautiful edition I own.Babbage did finish a simpler version of the Analytical Engine, called The Difference Engine. It’s absolutely fascinating to see it work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be1EM...."

An illustrated (rather than graphic) dual biography with fictionalised elements and copious foot and end notes to explain what has been fictionalised, why it’s been fictionalised and what the actual truth of the matter is.The joke about the Planck Length level of detail being unnecessary in the story’s pocket universe (especially is backgrounds) is genuinely hilarious* while the author’s assertion as to the etymology of the phrase “balls out” sent me straight to Google (spoiler: she is telling the truth). By the time I’d finished reading the whole thing it made me want to go and read Babbage’s On the Ecomony of Machinery and Manufactures which is a sentence I never thought that I’d utter let alone actually mean.I do think that the author is a little unfair to dismiss Lord Melbourne in quite the way that she does especially when one considers the tangled history between his family and Ada’s but for that she can be forgiven. Other than that the actual history referenced is so fresh and relevant that one could be forgiven for thinking that jokes about computer crashes (Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, 1862) and the constant flame war that Babbage has with pretty much everyone are straight out of 2018. One absolutely dreads to think of Babbage on Twitter, though I would wager almost any amount that his followers would be in the millions.In conclusion, if you have any interest at all in:ComputersHistoryEminent VictoriansCrazy poetsEven crazier mathematicians IllustrationLiterature, orPocket universesthen you need to read this book.*I may not be doing it full justice here."
226,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15427028-kim-moravec,5,"As a woman with a background in computer-science research, I'd heard of this book but gave it a wide berth for two reasons. The first is that fictionalizations of science and technology tend to be stiff and ""worthy,"" and the second is that Ada Lovelace's legacy is often overhyped by well-meaning but non-technical feminists, which irritates me. My boyfriend, an artist and clueless about technology, bought me the book. To please him, I read the first few pages…and was hooked. Sydney Padua has an incredible talent for pulling fantastic stories from historical material. She's developed a great format in which the story trundles along at a quick, witty pace at the top of the page while extensive footnotes at the bottom of the page put it in historical context. In addition, her illustrations and characters are lively and beautifully laid out. My boyfriend, who is less clueless about this topic, suspects her animation background is the cause.Padua also deals with Lovelace's underwhelming legacy in the most wonderful of ways: she invents a pocket universe in which the Analytical Engine really is built. In it, Babbage and Lovelace tackle a runaway economic model, rescue hapless novelists from the bowels of the engine, and wander through the third dimension. A few poignant pages are devoted to the sad and early ending of the real Lovelace's life, and the footnotes deal with her disputed legacy in detail. I was both thoroughly entertained and felt I learned more about that time period and the historical characters within it. Apart from recommending this book to readers, I also think it serves as an incredible example of how to do historical science writing very well, especially in graphic novel format. "
227,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52614951-tod-hilton,3,"An interesting concept and implementation: using real history as a starting point for fictional stories about two famous characters. Fictional history isn't a new concept, but Padua's implementation is certainly unique (at least, in my experience). The author combines comics (aka: graphic novels) and text to tell the story...in great detail. Admittedly, I found it overwhelming and difficult to find a rhythm to my reading at first. Switching back and forth between the comics and supporting text, not wanting to miss anything. After about 30-40 pages I realized that the text was sometimes way more than I cared to read and I learned to skim it, catching the highlights and interesting points. For those who really want the nitty gritty details, Padua provides all of them (with source references even).Once I found a flow in my reading, I enjoyed the stories with supporting history and facts. It's apparent that Padua is a fan of mathematics and Lovelace and Babbage, taking the time and effort to be thorough in the research and presentation. It's quite impressive! Padua's art is entertaining and well done. All of the different representations of the difference engine (actually, analytical engine :) ) are wonderfully done! And the characterizations of Lovelace and Babbage are excellent, full of emotion and expression. A top notch artist, for certain!I picked this up from The British Library while visiting and it's a wonderful souvenir. "

Throughout the book, this type of humor pops up again and again, and the use of footnotes and then endnotes to the footnotes plus a bit of first person insertion for various comments makes it quite an enjoyable read despite all of the page flipping and working back and forth between the graphics and all the notes. It's also a great way to pack a lot of historical information into the story without actually disrupting the story...if you want to read the book without caring about the details, it's more than possible. That being said, I'm not sure there would be much there without them - the actual scenarios are a bit far-fetched without much of a plotline if you don't take into account the fact that they are mostly ways to get a bunch of different information about Lovelace and Babbage worked in. Still, for what it seems to be - a fantastical exploration of two actual people with a lot of research behind it but a bunch of fantasy thrown in for good measure - it's a fun read.#genresgalore => graphic novel selection"

She brings a graphic novel, a comic satire of victorian life, a thumb up at the scholarly debate, and she pretty much punches back in the 18th stole her jokes. This book is fun, full of interesting information about mathematics and full of satirical looks at Victorian great and good. Initially, she created a small graphic novel about Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. Ada is the mathematician who wrote about the first computer programmes when describing Babbage wonderful machine The Difference Engine. There is SO MUCH Sydney wanted to share that she created footnotes to rival Terry Pratchett at the hight of his writing. However, at the end of the novel, she realised there was so much more to laugh at/tell us about. So she created a pocket universe where Babbage did build his machine. We are introduced to imaginary numbers, Bolian mathematics and more. She manages to bring George Elliot, Lewis Carrol, Charles Dickens and a host of other Victorian writers while helping us fall in love with Babbage and Lovelace. If you are a math nerd, a steampunker or a retired academic, this is a fun book for you. I loved this book because I am bored to tears with computers but Sydney made them funny and fun. THIS IS MY BOOK OF THE YEAR! "

The premise is great: Babbage and Ada Lovelace actually build the world's first steam-powered computer and have adventures. (In real life, Babbage never did b/c he couldn't manage a project to save his life, and Ada wrote an imaginary program for it in a paper, but died of cancer at a young age. She's famous for being Lord Byron's one legitimate daughter.)Each page is incredibly dense and a marvel: mechanical drawings, puns galore, and every footnote one could ever want and then some. The author did *so* much research and clearly loves these characters because of/despite their flaws. I found I got overwhelmed if I tried to take in too much at once and that I most enjoyed the book a few pages at a time, which I think is why it took me a few tries to get started.That being said, there really isn't much plot: we have the prologue and maybe 3 stories about Babbage, Ada, and the Analytical Engine. So I was left with a feeling of having read a not insignificantly thick book but also not much having happened? Again, a bit odd. Definitely recommend for folks already interested in the subject and the history of computing, and I especially liked the prologue. But it may not be accessible to a super wide audience and I'm not sure I'll revisit it. 3.5 stars."

Since my husband and I both have computer science degrees, one of the highlights of our trip to England in 2014 was seeing the remains of Babbage’s works on display in the Science Museum.The author, Sydney Padua, learned about Ada Lovelace from a friend in a pub in London:As anybody else would do, I looked up “Ada Lovelace” on Wikipedia. There I found the strange tale of how, in the 1830s, an eccentric genius called Charles Babbage only just failed to invent the computer, and how the daughter of Lord Byron wrote imaginary programs for this imaginary computer. p. 7.The rest of this book tells their stories in a delightfully eccentric way with comics, footnotes, and endnotes.

232,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43002799-emily-morrison,5,"SO fun. A sort of graphic novel, about Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, who basically pioneered the first principles (logic, punch cards, machinery) that led to the modern computer, back in the 1800s. Same time as Charles Dickens and other people like that. Lovelace was the daughter of Lord Byron, and because it was feared she would suffer the ill-effects of poetry, she was steered well clear of it into the sciences and ended up becoming a brilliant mathematician. Babbage did all sorts of stuff, but he developed an engine which is kind of the first computer. Anyway, the book is fascinating- a blend of technology, literature, social commentary, history, and hilarity. Sadly Lovelace died young, and Babbage didn't get to accomplish what he wanted with his machine, so the author sets up a ""pocket universe"" and imagines a time where they DID succeed. But she uses all sorts of primary materials they actually wrote and draws in other characters of the time- Queen Victoria, etc. And so each of the short graphic episodes is followed by fascinating notes of the time period. I liked this so much I wrote a letter to the author. "
233,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14178892-stan,3,"This is one unique book. First, I bought it not knowing it was a graphic novel. Graphic novels MUST be read analog--with a real book. It was kind of tough getting the full experience of the book in digital format. Nevertheless, this is a really clever book. Essentially, the author (a graphic artist/animator) has done lots of research about Babbage (inventor of the computer) and Ada Lovelace (well-known mathematician/computer), and rather than just writing their history, tells their story in a very creative way. She uses the artwork, of course, but lots of footnotes and endnotes. The graphics sometimes cover events that never really happened. And it extends the imagination by putting people actually inside of the mechanical computing machine. It was a little weird for me. It is a pretty easy read. And done in a very clever manner. So, kudos to the author for pushing the norms. In that sense, I am glad I read it. I would never spend a month reading a book like this, but...So, I won't necessarily recommend it, but if you are feeling like reading something that is unusual, quirky, fun, and you are feeling adventurous, you ought to read it.

The book is laid out with the graphic/comic story occupying the top and middle of each page, with footnotes at the bottom, then endnotes to the footnotes at the end of each chapter, and occasionally footnotes to those endnotes! I liked some of the ways that Padua plays with layout (characters in-frame joking about the footnotes, jumping off the frame, etc), but in the end, it was all a bit much and made it harder to follow. Maybe it would have been less tiresome if the end notes had been all at the end of the book so you could easily flip back and forth from one place? As it was, every time I started a new chapter, I had to flip ahead to try to find the end notes at the end of that chapter and mark the page so I could reference it. The constant back and forth really messed with the flow of trying to follow the story, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to read the end notes in one chunk, either. "

The parallel between Lovelace's paper (her notes being several times longer than the translation of Babbage's work) and the format of this comic is ingenious.I'm not sure one can describe it as a graphic novel per se—often there are more footnotes than artwork, and the footnotes have endnotes, which then can have footnotes of their own. And then there's an extensive appendix or two. It'd almost feel as though the artwork were just there to hold up all the research, except that the artwork is carefully considered as well and does some creative manipulations with the format to tell a compelling story.If I were to read it again I might start with reading just the panels, then re-reading the whole thing with all the footnotes and endnotes and footnotes and appendices to glean all the context. As it is, the moment I finished I felt I'd need to go back and read the panels all together again."

He was the inventor of computing engines, the never-completed Difference Engine for computing mathematical tables, and the never-even-started Analytical Engine for general purpose computing. She is often considered the first computer programmer for including examples of programs for the Analytical Engine in her writings. A lot of research went into the book, with a lot of details on the work of Lovelace and Babbage, their often tumultuous relationship with each other and other scientists, and details on how the Engines might have been constructed and used.The author writes fondly of the two, despite their foibles, with a good sense of humor. Some of the sections describe their actual lives and achievements, while others describe an existing alternative future of possibilities if they had actually been able to construct the Analytical Engine, and the ways it could have changed the world."
237,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937389-anna,3,"Starts with the historical story of Lovelace and her eventual partnership with Babbage, but then the author's affection for this pair and frustration at all that might have been if one hadn't died so early led her to create a touching and often funny tribute spinoff where, in an alternate universe, Lovelace and Babbage continued their work on the Difference Engine, with much satire of Victorian intellectual figures and circles thrown in (I especially enjoyed the 3-page chapter on Mr. Boole of Boolean searching fame). Heavily researched, a big chunk of the book is made up of footnotes and technical appendices, but for the most part these can be safely ignored by readers more interested in the entertaining stories than the technical or historical background without feeling lost. A decent entertaining (and educational) read for people interested in history, Victorians, computing, or the quirky evolution of intellectualism during the Industrial Revolution."

Although most of the book takes place in a fictional ""pocket universe,"" this graphic novel is replete with primary sources, footnotes and endnotes. In fact, there were so many notes to the story, it was easy to get lost tracking down the details of the references. The facts are dense and complicated and quite technical and left me feeling more like a luddite than I thought I was . I'm new to the realm of graphic novels, but I found the images whimsical and captivating. The author clearly held the lovable protagonists in high esteem. Although the technical details were a bit too detailed for a lay person, I still enjoyed the delivery. I would highly recommend this title to those interested in the history of technology or mathematics."

I only checked this out from the library, but somewhere down the road I may purchase it and just slowly reread all the notes and things. The stories were okay. I just didn't care too much for them overall. The footnotes (and footnote's footnotes) were interesting and welcome, but really disrupted the story. I found it was more enjoyable to just read the story without reading the footnotes until later (which is why I think subsequent reads will be better). I guess what I didn't like were the stories (didn't *dislike* them either) and the overload of notes. However, I feel maybe it's best to just choose to read the comic portion first before then delving into all the notes. Once I get more time to sit down and enjoy picking apart all the info, I'll revisit my rating!Either way, definitely fun and unique. If you have a chance to read it, I definitely recommend. "

The comics are fun & whimsical, but a the same time heavily footnoted with factoids and tidbits that the author got researching old letters & memoirs & other writings from the time. This is a book for a very specific group of people - those who like webcomics, history, math theory, mechanical diagrams, footnotes, and endnotes to those footnotes. I enjoyed it, but a lot of the math/technical stuff went over my head. I'm giving it a 4-star because it is very well-crafted and well-researched, though my own enjoyment would only be about a 3-star (because jargon). "

It is also clear that quite a lot of research went into this book and I can appreciate that.That being said, it took me over a year to finish this, because I just couldn't bring myself to pick it up for weeks at a time. My main issue was the lack of flow of the story. Basically, the comic has lots of footnotes. And endnotes. And FOOTNOTES TO ENDNOTES. Having to constantly flip back and forth between the main narrative and the additional notes made me feel like I was reading a bad scientific article. What is more, I often felt like the anecdotes in the footnotes were more interesting than the main story. Overall, the novel felt like a drag, and I am really disappointed, because on paper it should have been right up my alley."

The artist/author has done her research and so the story is peppered with anecdotal footnotes. However, after this first chapter, the book turns to historical fiction as short episodes imagine Babbage and Lovelace actually building their device and altering history. This sound great, but most of the comics aren't very entertaining and because the overly extensive footnotes are necessary to best interpreting the comics, the constant back-and-forth shifting from comic frame to paragraph after paragraph of explanation is disruptive and exhausting."

However, I got extremely bogged down by the author's extensive footnotes. Although I didn't count them, it wouldn't surprise me if a third to a half of the book was made up of these notes—not what I would expect in a ""graphic"" novel.

Loads of footnotes and endnotes provide almost too much info and cause distraction from the minimal story. But, it's still Lovelace and Babbage and steampunk! My appreciation for the material was greatly aided by my existing familiarity with both characters. I loved the inclusion of other historical figures. And of course the Wonderland chapter was one of my favorites even if the connection to Lewis Carroll was tenuous. The black and white art really served the story given the historical setting. I felt like the Analytical Engine was mostly used to touch upon a series of other contemporary topics rather than focus on what it might actually have been put to use to achieve. Still a fun read."
245,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/800923-andreana,3,"This book is a very fun extended what-if on what Babbage and Lovelace could've done if the Analytical Engine were actually built. Padua clearly has an animation background; the art is simply delightful, and if she illustrated more historical books, more people would definitely care about history! However, the highest rating I can give it is 3 stars on account of the book's architecture. There is daresay excessive use of footnotes and endnotes, and it makes reading it quite the head-bobbing experience. While there's a fun gag with them later in the book, it makes for very inefficient reading, and makes the book less a graphic novel and more an illustrated collection of historical notes and letter excerpts.

It's a fun introduction to Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, the God parents of modern computing, put forth in such a way that the reader is thoroughly entertained and informed at the same time. Sydney Padua fills the pages with both lovely graphic panels and painstakingly researched footnotes.

Not quite biography, not quite historical fiction, this book exists somewhere in between categories -- in its own little pocket universe, as it were. It starts of in standard historical biographical style (albeit with much more entertaining drawings than a typical biography). It then veers off into what-if territory, letting Lovelace and Babbage actually finish building an analytical engine, and then sneaking some historical information in through the characters they meet. Very fun, and although Padua SAYS she is trying to not do comics, I hope that she ends up making a lot more comics indeed."

Rejected Princesses also uses very brief notes or refers you to an end note. While I loved the energy and enthusiasm and the idea of a pocket universe where Lovelace and Babbage were successful, too many of the references were over my head or required a search through long footnotes for this to be completely enjoyable for me.

Great writing and artwork from Padua, although I have to admit to occasionally straining to read some of the text - the publisher really should have gone for a slightly bigger paper size.Very much the author's interpretation of the life of Babbage and Lovelace - due to, as you'd expect, scant details of the time - but his level of research and copious footnotes and appendices (*almost* as much as Moore's work on From Hell) you have to concede that this book probably the most thoroughly accurate depiction of the two Victorian computing geniuses.

Following their true, wacky, crazy story, the author adds an imaginary tale of what might have been, including real people and true historical events along the way, included in lengthy footnotes. The drawings are silly, appropriate for a children's tale, and the story is told in that style, but it is too technical and complicated for a children's story. Whimsical?

I loved the drawings and dialogue and stories BUT the excessive amount of mathematical, scientific and engineering detail (paragraphs and paragraphs of the stuff!) made this graphic novel really hard work. As I understood about 1/10 of that, in the end I had to skip all the extraneous information and just concentrate on the graphics. The facial expressions, storylines and banter between all the characters in this novel are hilarious and hugely enjoyable. "

I simply wanted more than a biography that only takes 7% of the book. Amazing research work tho."

It's not a graphic novel, if that's what you're looking for, but I enjoyed the format and feel like I'm much better educated about some fascinating characters in scientific history."

I liked Padua’s voice. I also came looking for more facts about Ada Lovelace, rather than a steampunk adventure, and ended up getting (and enjoying) both."
288,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82682275-gabriel,4,"I really enjoyed everything about the comic. The art, the footnotes, and the portrayal of all the characters was compelling. I struggled a bit due to the lack of overall narrative, but I think that was my expectations playing against me. All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone who's into history, comics, computers, or feminism. "

Some moments, such as those dealing with imaginary numbers or Newton's Three-Body Problem, tend to betray a certain lack of understanding, but who cares! This is joyous, exuberant fun, and honest enough not to pretend to any false expertise."

Newfound respect for Ada Lovelace as not just a programmer but a computer *scientist* and symbol-wrangler. And the book reminds me of the ""original"" steampunk vibe, harking back to Sterling's The Difference Engine. Amazing how much of modern computing is contained in these victorian era cogs and attitudes."

It’s a beautiful blend of historical storytelling and comic absurdity, delightfully illustrated and with extensive (awesome) footnotes that really become part of the story (at one point, literally). Would recommend for fans of computing or scientific history, 19th century literature, the Victorian era in general, playful graphic novels..."

A comic that is also a non-fiction book that is also a fictional book about Lovelace and Babbage. Super educational. I could read this over and over and find new and interesting pieces! Can not recommend it more!"
293,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43741754-lori,4,"what happens when a poet, a mathematician and an artist enters a room? this beautiful and intelligent piece of work is the right amount fascinating, educational, and fun for those who love to soak themselves in footnotes. the imagination aside from necessity is truly the mother of invention.I think I spent more time reading footnotes than enjoying the art because I felt dumb and incapable of grasping the math & science involved. And I would just like to thank Lord Byron for bringing Ada Lovelace into this world to bring us into her magic realm of imagination."
294,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898081-josh,4,"I loved the hyperbolic pun! This book is like browsing in a friends very well stocked library. Don't go in expecting one, nice tidy story or through line. There isn't one. Instead, just let your eyes wander and let the fun little digressions and tidbits wash over and through you. An enjoyable experience and enjoyable precisely because of the copious footnotes and digressions. "
295,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58159462-tori-pfau,3,"Love the illustrated format of the book. Much of the book is also comprised of footnotes and appendices which help flesh out the historical and technical aspects of the story. They can be funny, but also very technical, so admit to skimming most of those parts."
296,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23807620-lisa-spoelstra,5,"Ridiculously witty and ingeniously intelligent, this Victorian steampunk adventure offers a humorous and inventive look at the story of Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, and the ill-fated Analytical engine if their lives had taken place in a two-dimensional Pocket Universe."
297,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56234968-karrie,3,"I enjoyed the book, but I wouldn't recommend this book to be taught to a whole class. The information within the footnotes is fantastic and well-researched, but the small font may be difficult for some readers. The comic is amusing, and the puns and the double entendre are well written. The author's enthusiastic voice propels a reader to continue to the end. I would recommend the book for student interested in science and/or history who has an above-grade maturity level. "
298,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2551190-loretta,5,"The storylines are cheeky, the artwork expressive, and the footnotes, florid. But the main reason to read this historical fiction comic is to imagine what might have been if the inventors of the computer and of computer programming had been able to realize their extraordinary visions."
299,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23794296-julie,3,"The comics are wonderful, and the research supports the story well. However, there is a huge amount of historical information for a relatively small amount of narrative, and it is hard to absorb everything and remain engaged. "
