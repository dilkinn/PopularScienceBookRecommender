0,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,4,"This is a fun read, and wonderful just to pick at…. The New Scientist is a prestigious science magazine with a learned readership from around the world. The book contains a selection of eccentric, serious and funny questions that have been submitted to the magazine over the years, with about three responses to each question – these being responses from New Scientist readers working in different disciplines.To give you a flavour of the book – herewith some of my favourite questions….The mineral water in my local shop has a label telling me it is from a 3000-year-old source, yet there is still a ‘best before end’ date on it approximately two years in the future. If the water has been in its aquifer for 3000 years, why should it go off in a sealed bottle?Why do cooked foods taste different after they have cooled from the way they tasted when they were hot?Why are fizzy drinks such as lemonade, cola or champagne far more appealing than the same liquid once it has gone flat?If I tap my nose with my finger I only register a single touch, yet the sensation from nerves in my nose has only a few centimetres to travel to my brain, whereas the one from my fingertip has to travel about a metre up my arm and shoulder. Is this an illusion arranged by my brain, or is the brain unable to distinguish between two events so close together in time? Can anybody explain?Why are some people left-handed and others right-handed?Why do mosquitoes bite one individual and not another?Do fish get thirsty?Do polar bears get lonely? I’m not being flippant, just attempting to find out why animals such as humans or penguins are gregarious, while others such as polar bears and eagles , live mostly solitary lives.Hummmmm……Who cannot help but be intrigued by such wonderful puzzlings?And herewith - very briefly and tersely - my favourite answers to these questions.(view spoiler)[
  

 Re. minteral water. The ingredients of the plastic of the bottle may eventually contaminate the water.Re cooked foods v food that has cooled. “Only a small amount of the taste of food is detected by the tongue…The majority of what we call ‘taste’ is more specifically described as ‘flavour’ and it comes from odour identified by nasal olfactory cells. That requires the flavour molecules to be wafted up from the mouth. This is more readily achieved when food is hot.”Re fizzy drinks that have gone flat.“Carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid in the drink, and it is this which gives the drinks their appealing ‘fizzy’ taste – not the bubbles….When the drink goes flat, most of the dissolved carbon dioxide has been released back into the atmosphere.”Re. tapping nose with finger.“You do register two touches…..The illusion arises because you have many more sensory receptors on your fingertips than on your nose, and they are more sensitive in different ways…..Your brain just chooses to disregard the sensory stimulation of the skin on your nose because it is a much less rich source of information.”(C....Actually I must have very sensitive nose-skin, because I can feel both sensations) *___*Re. why are some people left-handed and some people right-handed.The simple answer is they have inherited genes for right-handedness….. The genes involved are a little strange, because while one makes people right-handed, the other only makes it random as to whether an individual is right or left-handed.Why humans alone among animals are 90% right-handed is a separate question, with the answer going back 2 million years. This is when human brains became asymmetric and the neural equipment for the fast, precise movements for speech and finger dexterity became localised in the left hemisphere. Why it is the left hemisphere is unclear.Re. why do mosquitoes only bite some people.“Attractiveness to mozzies correlates with obesity, maleness, temperature and sweat.”“While it is true we all produce a bouquet of natural chemicals some of which attract biting insects, a fortunate few give off an aroma that apparently masks these attractive chemicals and so prevents these people from being bitten because the mozzies can’t track them down.”Re. Do fish get thirsty.“Marine fish, which have a low salt concentration compared with that of seawater, will constantly leak water through their body wall… To replenish this lost water marine fish need to drink, so it would be easy to argue that they get thirsty. The surplus salt they ingest by drinking seawater is excreted by specialized cells located in the gills.Freshwater fish, on the other hand, are unlikely to become thirsty. Because they live in a more dilute environment, they have the opposite problem: water flows inwards and dilutes their blood. The freshwater fish there need to excrete excess water, which they do in much the same way we do, via dilute urine.So we can see that marine fish get thirsty and drink, while freshwater fish avoid drinking but pee a lot.”Re. Do polar bears get lonely?“Bears and eagles rarely associate with their own kind because individuals need to defend their own feeding territories in which food is often scarce. Polar bears live in an environment where the food resources are too limited to sustain a large community, so it makes sense for them to be the only predator in this particular niche. When food is plentiful both bears and eagles will gather together with a reasonable degree of amity.”“In zoos, where security and food are not constraint, polar bears often seem happy to have the stimulus of company.”
(hide spoiler)]This is the perfect antidote to all those silly questions and puzzles in Christmas crackers, and the general ennui of days of too much festive imbibing. Something to keep the family perky and interested over the holiday season. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,4,"Oh how I love anything relating to New Scientist magazine. As a subscriber to the magazine I just had to see what this book was all about. It's an intriguing and fun, lighthearted read."
2,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36725393-alison,3,"I didn't realise this was essentially letters from readers asking questions and a variety of responses from others (some experts, some not so much) so was a little bit disappointed in it. I had hoped for something a little more definitive and also something with a little more humour (which the cover and title suggests) but it's still an interesting read. I may have skimmed over a few questions I wasn't particularly interested in or with complicated answers I couldn't follow but there's probably something here that would interest most people."
3,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14073119-christie,3,"A collection of science related questions submitted to the NewScientist website. The chapters as correlated to the topics on the website http://www.newscientist.com/lastword, which are:Food and Drink; Domestic Science; Our Bodies; Feeling OK?; Plants and Animals; Our Weather, Our Planet, Our Universe; Troublesome Transport; Best of the Rest. There were some interesting questions that were selected to be included in this publication and a nice way to gain some knowledge on subjects you may never have given much thought or have always wondered about. Some of the answers can be a bit contradictory as there is almost always often more than one contribution for an answer to the question posed. Nonetheless, it is a starting point for stimulative thought on scientific questions and was an enjoyable read. "
4,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5966790-xanthi,2,"I didn't enjoy this book as much as I was hoping to. Some of the questions were just plain inane. The 'vegetarian' one towards the start of the book was down right stupid and I am glad that someone with some sense piped up (someone from my city, I am pleased to note). Some of the questions are rehashing issues I have seen already tackled on Mythbusters. Some of the answers are just hocum (see the one that touts the paleo diet) and some go technical that they lose me half way along the line. So, all in all, a patchy book."
5,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46538050-lance,3,"I really enjoyed the range of topics covered in this book. Highlights included the genesis of eggs within eggs, detailed descriptions of chemical nucleation sites, the truth about how smarties get coated evenly, how striped toothpaste is made, whether one can fool forensics by getting a blood transfusion before committing a crime, aging an adult human, the Levy flights of insects and the mechanisms for airbag deployment. It was also good to see so many insightful responses from British readers. Thank you range of tropics Baby Adam!"
6,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16133915-jbussen,3,"(Science-y) Not as fun as this type of books usually are for me. Not as humorous as I'd like. Just not that much fun. Some of the questions were like something out of a college course with like responses. Lots of science-y type Q&A. But it had enough of the, How do they make round chocolates like Whoppers that I can give this book at least a pass and a i'm happy I read it. Although I did skip a bunch of the questions I found uninteresting. Why does red wine lighten with age while the reverse is true of white? Answer? Science. Chemical process is explained. Meh. Not my bag. But if it is your have at it."
7,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10543840-conrad,3,"A collection of letters to New Scientist magazine along with readers' answers. Very entertaining and informative, I'm a sucker for this kind of pot pouri science book. Difficult to give it a star rating because it's a collection of questions and answers but three seems fair. I didn't realise when I picked it up in the second hand book shop that it was published in 2008, so many of the topics are now outdated. But it's still and entertaining read with an old fashioned feel of eccentricity with even the silliest questions given thoughtful and well reasoned answers. I enjoyed it."
8,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7870039-michael,4,"Hugely entertaining and instructive, if nothing else a must for the downstairs loo"
9,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57490318-ngela,3,"I found this book quite interesting, a good idea the system of answering and question."
10,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84032832-tim,2,wouldn't rave about it partly okay but as the saying goes ask a silly question get a silly answer
11,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4742723-michaela,3,It was interesting but some of the questions have too many answers some of which are very long and alot of the time give similar answers.
12,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36280980-warren-gossett,5,"11 years old, but still brings up interesting scientific questions and oddities."
13,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64886157,2,The facts weren’t as fun as the previous book
14,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57250290-isabelle,2,"I ended up mostly skim reading this book as though some of the questions were really interesting, other questions I found to be a bit obtuse and not very interesting.A really interesting question was about why red wine becomes light as it ages whereas white wine becomes darker."
15,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30257272-joe,2,"One has to have an astoundingly inquisitive mind to be interested by all the subject-matter here, and the sorting into subjects is only moderately helpful - personally, I found myself interested by most of the physics-oriented questions and few of the biological ones; but while one could understand that the 'Our Bodies' section would be largely biology-based, it wasn't a perfect divide. Further, letters and emails sent into New Scientist are barely where one would expect to find exceptional writing, and, for the most part, this holds true. The format also lends itself to a superficial discussion of a good number of topics, and very little more than the surface is scratched.Thus, while I feel I know more for having read Do Polar Bears Get Lonely?, if one asked me what specifically I felt I knew more about, I'd struggle to answer; nor do I feel as though it was a book I particularly enjoyed reading."
16,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Something else from the Kindle store that caught my eye for use as a palate-cleanser/relaxing read before bed. I don't know what draws me so much about non-fiction lately, but this was perfect for my purposes. It's a collection of questions submitted to New Scientist, and the responses sent in by subscribers, on a whole range of random questions, like whether spiders get thirsty and whether elephants sneeze.It's no good for finding out the answers to questions of your own, if you don't happen to share the questions asked by the readers of New Scientist; it's not like an encyclopedia in which information can be looked up. The questions are only loosely grouped together in sections. Still, very good for learning all sorts of random and interesting things.(Yes, spiders get thirsty. Yes, elephants sneeze.)"
17,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4331887-steve,3,"Dip in and out at random, or read the whole thing straight through - this is another fascinating selection of scientific questions and answers from New Scientist magazine. Effectively written by the reader, books like this are only ever going to be as good as the quality of questions and answers themselves. Thanks to some very knowledgable and fluent contributors, this one's pretty good. It doesn't require heavy concentration, so sit back and let the facts wash over you - or buy it as a gift for someone else. It's that kind of book."
18,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485015-claudio,5,Do Polar Bears Get Lonely? is a rely good book if your interested in weird questions that people may have came up with out threw out there life like do elefantes snees? the anser was rely good because it had a personal experience and a scientific anser explaining it and baking it up and the personal experiences are rely explained in as much detail as there can be in the story.I will recommend this book to any one that is looking for weird questions and try to look for new experiences to try out later on your life this book is rely good 
19,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/614430-todd,4,"I found this to be a fascinating book with many answers to bizarre questions, submitted by readers of New Scientist magazine. I liked that there were often multiple answers given by so-called experts in various fields. The respondents were very, very UK-centric, which would be my only minor complaint about it, even though most all of the questions were not country-specific at all. Perfect book to pick up and put down when you have five minutes of time to kill."
20,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5855324-tim-corke,3,"Fascinating insights into the questions you've always wondered about and answered by those in the know.. A great coffee table book to pick up and browse but if like me you enjoy reading cover to cover it still works...Some of the questions are a little odd but the format is great and I'm sure will form the basis for an iPhone app. It will appeal to pub quizzers, QI viewers and those with a 'but why?' outlook on life!! "
21,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15654628-nigel,3,"If I could, I would give this two and a half stars. It gains the extra half plainly because there are slightly more interesting questions than downright pointless ones. Questions such as ""Could hamster power be an environmentally friendly answer to the impending energy crisis"" and ""How long would it take an average cow to fill the Grand Canyon with milk"" make me query the intelligence of our so called intellectual scientific community."
22,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/921981-ria,5,"A fascinating book that covers a wide range of scientific subjects.Our bodies, transport, plants and animals, all are dealt with in easy to read question and answer scenarios.Told with humour and a straightforward approach (though some replies to the questions are a little too scientific and high brow) this is an enjoyable and informative book and is great for just randomly picking up and reading in short bursts.Loads of information packed into a relatively small book.Well worth reading."
23,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7923651-tristan,3,"This is a collection of questions asked by and replies provided by the readers of the New Scientist, published originally in the Last Word column. By its nature, this is an episodic read but ranges from the interesting to the fascinating. What is also fascinating is how a community can share knowledge in this way and the ease with which the (without doubt selected) explanations make their points without becoming obscure or facile."
24,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748081-nicola,3,"Didn't enjoy this as much as some of the other 'Last word' compilations from New Scientist, but some of the Q and As were quite interesting. People out there really do know some random stuff!A good book to dip in an out of rather than reading all in one go (my excuse for taking so long to get through it!). "
25,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16536568-lena,3,"Honestly read portions of the book that appealed to me, for example the 'Food and Drink' and 'Our Bodies' sections. Some of the questions were interesting and the layout of several responses was good too. A nice book to read, but it's unlikely that I'll read it again or read any of the other New Scientist books in this format."
26,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41490805-keyvan-mas,3,"I liked chapters 1 & 2 the most. The rest was superficial and with a few exceptions, boring. Featuring some non-intriguing questions, this book is somehow hard to finish. Personally, I've decided I'm not gonna go around this kind of books again, but still doubting whether the ""question everything"" (also from newscientist) is exactly the same kind of read, or..."
27,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46751853-wkofangmar,5,"This book blew my mind. Who knew broken glasses could be so interesting? Before you abandon this book, think of the fact it conveys. All of the 'stupidness' you believe this book contains actually may help you. And which rational human being to ever live on Earth doesn't want random facts to clog up their brain?"
28,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/365504-jennifer,3,"The answer is no, polar bears don't get lonely because they're supposed to be solitary by nature so that they don't have to share the scarce resources of the arctic. Plus various other fun facts when one is bored on a Sunday afternoon."
29,1846681308,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5049271-gabby,4,It's a good book with lots of interesting questiong that I tend to ask - but never get an answer to :) But some of the answers can get very long and scientific so I didn't tend to read the middle parts of the long answers ;)
