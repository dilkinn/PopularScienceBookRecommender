0,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1672313-sandy,5,"I should preface this by saying that I love learning about science, especially chemistry.I wondered at the outset if I would ever finish this book because it contained over 600 pages about the history of science, but I found myself turning pages much faster than expected. Gribbin does a fantastic job of keeping science history interesting by intermingling fascinating tales about the lives of several prominent scientists and squabbles had amongst those great thinkers. He manages to mention almost every notable scientist (that I can think of) from Ptolemy to present, with accompanying details that are often new to the reader. I found his description of the relationship between Hooke and Newton to be particularly interesting. It is the relationships among all the different scientists that is handled in great light in this book. Gribbin acknowledges which scientists came before or after others, those who lived and worked along side one another, those who were close friends, those who built on the ideas of others, and those who were great competitors. For example, Robert Darwin found an unusual fossil near his home and brought it to the Royal Society where he met Newton (the Society’s President at the time). His son Erasmus Darwin was a great thinker and mingled with James Watt, Ben Franklin, and Joseph Priestly. Erasmus’ son Robert Darwin was a physician. His son was Charles Robert Darwin, now famous for his ideas on evolution by natural selection. Thus, Charles Darwin’s great-grandfather had met Isaac Newton. Three scientists independently “discovered” a wealth of information pertaining to heredity and were about to publish in 1900, when one learned that Gregor Mendel had already published it in 1867. The true nature of scientific discovery is described well. The author argues, “It is the luck of the draw, or historical accident, whose name gets remembered as the discoverer of new phenomenon.” “Geniuses maybe; but irreplaceable certainly not.” His only exception to these criteria is Isaac Newton, without whom the author thinks science would have been held back a very long time. Fascinating, Exciting, Science!"
1,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2686359-cf,4,"Phew! A really great history of science starting with the 15th century and working right up to the present day. Focusing on not just the scientific discoveries but the scientists themselves, this gives a really human feel to the story of science. We get to know a little about everyone's life, from Copernicus to Einstein. Also touching on a bit of the classical Greek period, where philosophy overlapped with science. Gribbin's style of writing is comprehensive without being too much. He acknowledges that he cannot fit everything in, but still makes sure we know where to find more information. This is separated into all the differing types of science, astronomy, physics, touching on mathematics, astrophysics, and more. I enjoyed this, and even though parts of it were a bit past my intelligence to fully understand, it will be good to use in future as a reference. I would like to read more of John Gribbin's popular science books. "
2,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1187210-blair,3,"I started out loving this book, it gave glimpses into the men who helped form science. When we approached the modern era, a time when some of the scientists discussed are still alive possibly, the tone changed... the book stopped being about the people and more only about the science. It was this change that threw me off... I suppose there is a valid reason to not continue the quirks to include something like Richard Dawkins has had a propensity to wear short shorts in public places (which I have witnessed), but it was precisely that the insights into scientists like Newton and Linnaeus were so fascinating to me.Plus the soap box on the end about how sociologists and historians malign science by not giving it its merited status and instead ""consider"" it as not quite theory and merely subject to the whims of people... I thought that was unnecessary."
3,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17575692-js-found,5,"You'd want to get this book for your kid. Along with Carl Sagan's Cosmos and both TV adaptations. Because science, properly taught or written about, can be very exciting for a kid to learn. This is the story of all its wonders told by bios of the people who invented and discovered them. 400 years of science are elegantly compacted into this synthesis, but Gribbin writes with such ease and clarity, with all the pleasures of narrative history, that you don't notice you're learning science. Not the tedious memorization of facts in a school textbook. This is science as it was discovered, when the scientists had no idea what they had found out, and what they were learning. It's really a suspense tale. A scientist will do an experiment, not sure whether it will work or not, not knowing what he will discover, and whether his hypothesis will be proven right, or at least not wrong, or whether he will stumble upon something else entirely. Something perhaps revolutionary that will permanently change life and the world forever. Gribbin structures the story by time and scientific subject. We start with Copernicus and Galileo and end with quantum physics and the latest cosmology. In between chemistry, evolution, genetics, geology, electromagnetism and the nature of light are elucidated. The bios help ease the learning by humanizing it: science becomes the discoveries of flawed people, from all classes and walks of life who had desires, fears, rivalries, and lived through turbulent historical times, like everyone else. The story of science is a continuum--men and women from all through time building and expanding upon the work of the people who came before. An essential book for any science library."
4,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,4,"Overview books are tricky, and most fail. Many things have happened, y'know? And a book that includes a great deal of them often turns into...well, into a list of things that have happened. This is why all textbooks suck.So one has to pick and choose, and the choice necessarily creates a perspective. You've picked up these select threads, which leaves you inevitably with that picture. And the trick in writing a good overview book is to end up with a picture that's interesting, compelling, and most of all, coherent.I only read 100 pages of Gribbin's book and then set it down, because I have this complicated reading schedule and it called for these 100 pages and then something else. I'll come back to the rest later, when it arrives on my mental syllabus. But so far, I think Gribbin is picking the right threads. I like the line he draws from William Gilbert, of whom I'd never heard, to Galileo. It was neat; I liked learning about Gilbert, and I liked his take on Galileo. He's fussy about who he chooses to mention, and how much, and in relation to whom else, and it's working for me.I look forward to getting back to this. I even have hopes of bumping it up to five stars when it's all over."

If you want to see how discoveries of vaccination, microbes and viruses, anaesthesia etc... fit into a larger context of science development, you better look elsewhere. Names of Jenner, Pasteur, Koch, Flemming and multiple others are found nowhere on its pages. There you may encouter only subtlest hints on how major events in chemistry, physics, biology and in scientific method in general affected medicine.Yet, since it was more or less unambigously declared by the author, the abscence of such narrative could not be considered a book's flaw.

In producing this ill-gotten lumpen-tour, which manages to leach all the interest out of what should be a fascinating magical mystery-tour, all you have managed to illuminate are the deathly pedestrian contours of your own imagination-starved mind.Should anyone be tempted by this dismal tome, be aware that, despite its 600+ pages, its coverage of biology is scant and cartoonlike. The view is almost exclusively that of an ill-read physicist."

The history of science is fascinating. To think of how much our knowledge has grown in just 500 years and exponentially over the past 200! It really wasn’t so long ago that most “educated” people believed the stars controlled our destiny and to protect ourselves from magic we needed to burn fellow humans to death.The early scientists were heroic as they challenged the orthodoxy of state and church.The first half of Gribben’s history is fascinating, Likely because I could understand 80% of the rudimentary science. As time passed my understanding plummeted and so did my reading pleasure. I’m sure a more scientifically astute reader will get more enjoyment from this history than I. "
8,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,4,"A history of science told in many lives - each chapter focusing on one aspect of the history of science, with the chapter itself being a chronologically ordered story of scientific lives. In that aspect, it's very much like Bell's Men Of Mathematics (GR link, my review), not only is The Scientists structured similarly, the humorous tone and fun anecdotes are similar too:Henry was painfully shy and hardly ever went out except to scientific gatherings - even at these, latecomers sometimes found him standing outside the door trying to pluck up enough courage to enter, long after he was a respected scientist in his own right. He communicated with his servants by writing them notes, wherever possible; and there are several stories about how on unexpectedly encountering a woman he did not know, he would shield his eyes with his hand and literally run away.Since the author himself is a astrophysicist the focus is a bit more on physics, cosmology and astrophysics than on medicine or biology - two chapters are on biology (one on Lyell -> Darwin -> Wallace, one on Mendel -> many more I haven't heard of before (nice! Ever heard of Miescher?) -> Crick/Watson), only one part of a chapter is on medicine, one chapter on geology, the rest is physics (but that is a truth of the history of science - for a long time, Western scientists focused more on the stars and mechanics than on the human body).Some more aspects I noted:- Science shifted from a (often rich) gentleman's hobby to a full-time profession sometime around Darwin's life. I got nostalgic for a time where you could just work your whole life for a king without having to fill out grant applications every few years; but then again, you'd be dependent on the king's whims and mortality. Plus, with only a few outliers it was practically impossible for a ""poor"" person to even begin with scientific work.- The descriptions of Galileo's and Bruno's troubles with the church are great - none of the usual ""martyrs for science!"" stuff, more (correct) focus on political and theological problems here. The history of scientists has, weirdly enough, quite a few arians in it.- Gribbin goes through great pain to make it clear that to become ""a name"" in the history of science, it's often not some mythological personal genius, but luck of being the right hard-working person at the right position at the right time. He often details the people who also made the important discovery at the same time as the ""famous"" discoverer made it, but for some reason, have been forgotten by history.- Fallopian tubes are called ""tubes"" even though Fallopio originally described them as ""brass trumpets"", i.e., tubas - ""tubes"" is a mistranslation.- Gribbin is no fan of Newton - although his discoveries were manifold and important, his rather extreme personality made work for other scientists very hard, and the cult of Newton's personality after Newton's death kept progress in some areas of science behind. Gribbin correctly points out that Newton didn't receive the knighthood for his scientific advances, but as ""a rather grubby bit of political opportunism by Halifax as part of his attempt to win the election of 1705"".- Especially towards the end this book gets more dry, almost as if Gribbin had a deadline coming up and slogged through writing it- Dalton discovered colour blindness, as he himself suffered from it. Imagine making that discovery!!- Gribbin's not a big fan of Kuhnian scientific revolutions, as the structure and the afterword of this book make it clear. To him, scientific progress is developed ""essentially incremental, step-by-step"".Recommended for: Scientists, people interested in history or the history of science"
9,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5624130-emma,4,Phew! I was suffering from some serious scientific history fatigue towards the end of this book.Gribbin has produced a very interesting book here. The absence of the more obscure characters in the history of science or the lack of detail about them was disappointing as was the strong focus on physics but even so this book was enjoyable. Gribbin sums up scientific discoveries and theories well and provides the reader with interesting details about well known scientific figures. There are a lot of gaps in the scientific record when reading and I was getting tired of being told that such and such a theory was beyond the scope of the book but Gribbin is a good story teller and communicator making up for some of the aforementioned shortcomings.

12,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3094832-steve,4,"High 4. This exceptional work tackles such a broad subject while maintaining absolute clarity of subject matter for the general reader. The author explains his choice of starting point at 1543 as marking both landmark publications in the fields of astronomy and biology respectively of Copernicus’ ‘On the Revolution of Celestial Bodies’, and Andreas Vesalius’ ‘On the Structure of the Human Body’. Copernicus revolutionised astronomy by proposing an alternative to the geocentric Ptolemaic model of the universe, which had held sway since the second century AD. Yet, Copernicus also bridged classical and modern science, as his theory of a heliocentric universe did not rest on empirical methods. He even had misgivings, which delayed publication of his ideas, fully formed as early as 1510, that his model did not adequately explain how the stars appeared fixed, given the implicit motion of the Earth around the Sun. Upon publication, soon after his death, his ideas did not spark wide sales or a religious backlash due to a preface written by a Lutheran pastor stipulating that they constituted one theoretical mathematical model and not any accurate depiction of the Universe. Gribbins states that Vesalius, like Copernicus, drew inspiration from ancient thinkers, specifically, Galen. With human dissection frowned upon in the second century AD, the latter’s work, based on studies of animals, thus contained inaccuracies. Vesalius had no such limitations, enjoying the tacit support of the city authorities in Padua to time his human dissections in the wake of public executions. Thus, overcoming the shortcomings in Galen’s research, he greatly advanced knowledge of human anatomy. One of those to profit from Vesalius’ successors at Padua University was William Harvey, whose later marriage to the daughter of the physician to Elizabeth I, Lancelot Browne, led both to his appointment as physician at St Barts, and as court physician to both James I and Charles I. These duties meant his momentous discovery of the circulation of the blood was completed in his spare time. What established Harvey as a key figure in the history of modern science was his use of empirical reasoning to establish his theory. Previously, it was assumed veins transported blood for use by human tissue, while arteries carried the ‘vital spirit’ from the lungs. Harvey demonstrated by simply measuring the capacity of the human heart that blood must be continually circulating, and that both veins and arteries played a role. The next influential figure in astronomy, Tycho Brahe, was a firebrand from the ranks of the nobility of Danish-controlled Sweden. His 1572 observation of a supernova led him to dismiss previous theories of the stars being fixed and permanent, and fired his obsession to plot more accurate projections of the movement of heavenly bodies. As his own star rose, the Danish monarchy sought to raise their prestige, giving him his own island of Hveen in the Danish Sound to establish as his home and his own observatory complex. Yet, in 1588 Brahe’s arrogance alienated the monarchy, forcing him to seek refuge as mathematician to the Holy Roman Emperor in Prague. The wealth of observational data Brahe accumulated thereby came into the possession of Johannes Kepler, employed as the former’s assistant in 1601 after years of correspondence. In contrast to Brahe, Kepler had no advantages of birth, his father being an impoverished noble and wastrel, forced to eke a living as a mercenary soldier, before simply disappearing. Kepler’s adherence to Copernican views not only led to his shelving plans to enter the Lutheran ministry but brought him at odds with Brahe’s request that his data be used to support the Ptolemaic model. Despite his eyesight being devastated by childhood smallpox, preventing him observing the heavens himself, his immense powers of mathematical reasoning allowed him to use Brahe’s data to ‘flesh out’ the motion of the planets, especially their elliptical orbits round the Sun. Though his later work would be hindered by the turmoil of the Thirty Years’ War, and defending his mother against charges of witchcraft, one of his earlier ideas would inspire the work of those who were to follow; namely, his assertion of a force keeping planets in thrall to the Sun, which he termed ‘vigour’. In the author’s opinion, the first individual truly deserving comparison with the modern scientist was William Gilbert due to his tireless testing of his hypotheses on electricity and magnetism. He was not only the first to study these forces since the ancient Greeks, but also to employ wholesale empirical techniques. Even Galileo regarded him as the founder of ‘experimental science’. A gentleman amateur and last personal physician to Elizabeth I, he would finally publish his findings of 18 years of study in 1600, three years before his death. Not only did he discover the rules of magnetic attraction and repulsion, and identify the Earth as one enormous magnet (thereby naming the extremities of magnets as ‘poles’), but so thorough was his research that no new substantial discoveries would be made in this field till the 1820s. Moreover, by arguing that the orbits of the planets were held constant through the force of magnetism, even suggesting distant stars might be Sun-like bodies with their own orbiting habitable planets, his work influenced Kepler. This is not to deny Galileo’s prominence, who undoubtedly published the first modern scientific textbook with his ‘Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences’. This summarised his work on mechanics, spelled out his belief in the scientific method, and stated mathematical rules governed the workings of the universe. After his trial, Galileo’s book had to be smuggled out of Italy, becoming a European bestseller decades after its original publication in 1638. It is impossible to assess Galileo’s influence on scientific thought without linking it to his clash with the papacy, with its implicit conflict between faith and reason. As Galileo’s reputation grew so his support for Copernican views, declared heretical in 1616, caused greater scrutiny from Rome. Though his position became more uncertain with the deaths of his principal protectors in Rome in 1621, he was invited to author a book detailing the two rival models of the universe. This was with the tacit suggestion that he could teach both models, but not openly support the Copernican one. His ‘Dialogue on the Two Chief Systems’, published in 1632, adopted the traditional format of presenting ideas through an imaginary dialogue, but made serious miscalculations. Not only did he use the names of two dead ex-associates, rather than fictional characters, to pitch for the Copernican model, but also had them gradually win over the impartial commentator. Finally, in naming of the defender of the heliocentric model in homage to Simplicus, the Ancient Greek commentator on Aristotle’s work, he lay himself open to charges that the name could also imply a ‘simpleton’. Though passed for publication by the papacy’s censor, a papal commission was subsequently set up into the work, summoning the author to Rome to face charges of heresy. Although the trial was a victory for Galileo’s Jesuit enemies, his supporters were eventually able to commute his sentence to one of enforced confinement at home. Descartes’ importance to this story is his influence on the development of mathematics, and physics. Serving as a military engineer in several European armies, he was able to refine his mathematical reasoning, and establish that the position of any object could be represented as a co-ordinate of three numbers, marking the foundation of analytical geometry. His family’s substantial wealth allowed him to renounce his military career to pursue independent studies around Europe between 1629 and 1633, during which time he prepared a huge treatise on physics. News of Galileo’s trial delayed him publishing his work, but his devout Catholicism did not deflect him from stating that the world was governed by the laws of physics, thereby vouchsafing his influence on European scientific thought in the century to come. A contemporary of Galileo and Descartes, Robert Boyle was the leading light in the establishment of the scientific method in England, drawing on the inspiration of Francis Bacon, who stated that all research should spring from data to furnish explanations, rather than initiate with a theory and proceed to establish facts to support it. Despite his eponymous First Law, his most famous work is contained in ‘The Sceptical Chymist’, published in 1661. In this work, he coined the term ‘chemical analysis’ to determine the composition of materials, and declared that all matter was composed of constituent particles. Yet, he also sought to bring Baconian rigour to alchemy, rather than discard it completely. In discussing the relative merits of Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton, Gribbins states an unbiased historian would be unable to distinguish between their contributions to science. Hooke rose from humble beginnings, working as a servant to richer students to fund his studies, and providing tireless assistance to Boyle, whose patronage and generosity gave him access to the Royal Society. Aside from transforming this gentleman’s club into the archetypal scientific forum it became, his greatest work, ‘Micrographia’, was published in 1664, marking the first substantial publication on microscopy. Moreover, Hooke coined the term ‘cell’, was the first to claim that fossils represented former life-forms, stated light was composed of waves, and nearly uncovered oxygen a century before its actual discovery. From the outset Newton was obsessive about his research, often experimenting on himself to the point of nearly going blind from staring at the sun, or by inserting a needle in his eye to study the resulting coloured images. Many of his discoveries date from his early career, due to the distraction of his life-long interest in alchemy. Yet, the secretiveness of his character and his work allowed him to claim timing of discoveries which may have been at odds with reality. Moreover, not only did Newton dismiss others’ genius in terms of his own, but he commonly held grudges. In the author’s view, Hooke’s greatest mistake was to incur Newton’s hatred and die before him, allowing Newton to rewrite history. Their altercation resulted from Newton learning of Hooke’s disgruntlement at his failure not to acknowledge the influence of the latter’s work on his. Unquestionably, in correspondence stretching over a decade before publication of Newton’s ‘Principia Mathematica’ in 1687, Hooke provided many insights to further the former’s work, for which he should have received credit. To illustrate this, Hooke referred to planets exerting ‘gravitational power’ towards their centres. More importantly, he also stated that all bodies placed in motion would continue in a straight line, unless deflected by another force – now known as Newton’s First Law of Motion. Such was Newton’s determination to avoid accrediting Hooke’s work any value that his epic publication on light and colour, which he sat on for 30 years, was not published till 1704, 12 months after his rival’s death. Newton’s scientific legacy is immense, including the development of calculus, allowing the accurate measurement of change over time. There is no doubt that Newton developed this first, nor that Leibnitz arrived at the idea independently, and that the latter’s is the more comprehensible version. Yet, were it not for Edmund Halley’s constant haranguing, and soothing of Newton’s moods, together with his willingness to fund the printing, none of Newton’s ideas may ever have been published. Halley, whose inventiveness equalled that of Hooke, should be considered as the first true post-Newtonian scientist. He first came to prominence, as a confident undergraduate, in querying the veracity of astronomical data with the newly appointed first Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed. Though once regarded as the latter’s protégé, Halley’s affairs with married women and colourful lifestyle clashed with Flamsteed’s prudish character. This fact, combined with the Astronomer Royal’s attitude that, due to his limited salary and need to provide his own instruments, his work was his own, led to his refusing to share any data with Halley and others who wished to record more accurately the trajectory and position of heavenly bodies. Gribbins regards Halley’s analytical mind to have been on a par with that of Hooke’s, and notes his main achievement was in mapping the position of the stars. Though, credit for the publication of his definitive version of the star catalogue in 1725 should partly go to Newton, who petitioned Queen Anne for a royal warrant to access Flamsteed’s data after the latter’s death. The author notes that in many scientific disciplines in the wake of Newton, this history becomes adorned by a long list of developments from many quarters so that science became the protagonist at the expense of many of the individuals who contributed. Yet, this work still provides fascinating accounts of some whose name became so influential. First among these is Linnaeus, whose obsessive compulsive need to establish order resulted in his classification of every botanical species. One astonishing detail is that he achieved this monumental feat whilst simultaneously pursuing his medical studies. To him can be attributed the binomial system we know today, and though the idea of identifying a species through two-word names was not his, he systematised it. It is also Linnaeus who first classified species according to hierarchical relationships down from class, order and genus. More controversially, in his revised 10th edition of 1758, he was the first to classify mankind in the same vein, placing us under the order of primates, stating courageously ‘If I were to call man “ape” or vice versa, I should bring down all the theologians on my head. But, perhaps I should still do it according to the rules of science’. Gribbins highlights that the crediting of scientific discoveries has often been down to pure luck with the work of many enthusiastic and gifted amateurs failing to achieve the acclaim their work would merit. As such, there was nothing original about the idea of evolution by the time Darwin entered centre stage. However, as the author stresses, what was distinct about the work of both Darwin and Wallace was their originating a sound scientific basis behind the theory. Darwin’s own grandfather, Erasmus, had published his own ideas on evolution based on observations drawn from human intervention in the breeding of certain species, even suggesting that all life may have originated from one common source. Upon returning from the voyage of the Beagle in 1836, Charles Darwin became convinced that evolution was a fact of life, but had still not identified the mechanism which lay behind it. The author reveals that a key step in him solving this was his reading of the work of Thomas Malthus in the autumn of 1838. The latter’s work, especially on those factors which kept animal populations in check, such as pestilence, predators, and the availability of food supplies enabled him to leap to the conclusion that the key behind evolution was the ‘struggle of the fittest’ in response to such pressures. Though his theory was fully-formed by 1842, Darwin did not rush to publish it, afraid of upsetting both his wife’s and the general public’s religious beliefs, and unleashing public disapproval. Yet, in his second edition of the ‘Voyage of the Beagle’ published in 1845, he added material, scattered across paragraphs, which, if read as a whole, would spell out this theory on natural selection. Moreover, a manuscript penned by him a year earlier was left among his papers with a bequest to his wife that it be published after his death. Alfred Russell Wallace had been a run-of-the-mill surveyor till he took the courageous step of funding his own expedition as an amateur enthusiast naturalist to South America between 1848 and 1852. Though he lost a younger brother to yellow fever and his specimens to the ocean floor when his ship home was lost at sea, Wallace continued to pursue his dream of unlocking the mystery of evolution in the Far East. This region was virgin territory to such research ensuring any specimens he collected would be both more scientifically valuable and lucrative. Throughout this 8-year expedition, he would maintain a close correspondence with Darwin, who was one of Wallace’s customers for specimens. Within their exchanges Darwin hinted at publishing his own theory of evolution without providing concrete details, and this merely served to drive Wallace on to form his own ideas. Totally, independently, Wallace also hit upon the connection with Malthus’ theories, and sent a paper in the spring of 1858 to Darwin outlining his ideas requesting the latter’s views. Despite being shocked at seeing the possibility of his own ideas being pre-empted, Darwin honourably sent Wallace’s paper onto his friend Charles Lyell, intending that it should be proposed for publication. The latter, keenly aware that Darwin was enmeshed in arranging the funeral of his infant son from scarlet fever, took the matter into his own hands, deciding to publish the paper with a preface consisting of Darwin’s own outline of his theory from 1844, and thereby ensuring the latter’s place in the pantheon of great scientists. As Gribbins reveals, though one would expect Wallace to harbour resentment at these events, he himself always refereed to the theory of natural selection as ‘Darwinism’ and would even write that the greatest satisfaction he could derive from his own work was that it acted as a spur to his contemporary to publish his ‘Origin of the Species’. Such levels of respect were mutual as it would be Darwin who would rescue Wallace’s reputation, which had become tarnished from his tinkering with spiritualism, and his financial security, by petitioning Queen Victoria to grant Wallace a pension for life in recognition of his contribution to science. There is not enough room here to give mention to many other eminent scientists who grace the pages of Gribbins’ history, and the author litters each story with fascinating detail. Perhaps, this is the one weakness of the book in that it does attempt to cover such a vast terrain of scientific endeavour that at times the reader becomes exhausted at the number of stories within the overall narrative. However, one of the abiding strengths of this work is the manner in which the author is able to shine the historical limelight on those who have slipped into the shadows. One such individual rescued from obscurity by Gribbins is Edward Tyson, who should be regarded as the father of comparative anatomy. Though professionally a doctor at the infamous Bethlehem Hospital in London, determined to reform the climate of abuse which pervaded the asylum, his most important legacy to science was a series of landmark dissections he performed in the 1680s and 90s as an enthused amateur scientist. In the first, assisted by Hooke, he discovered a porpoise’s mammalian internal structure. In the second of a young chimpanzee in 1698, he would anticipate Darwin in listing 48 areas of resemblance closer to humans than other monkeys. Another noteworthy figure worthy of rediscovery is Robert Recorde. It is to him we owe our basic language of mathematics, without which scientific research would not have made the rapid progress it did. As a graduate of both Oxford and Cambridge, this native of Tenby, South Wales, would introduce in his works of the 1540s and 50s the mathematical symbols ‘+, -, and =’ but would himself be destined to die unheralded in a debtor’s prison."

Some links between scientific breakthroughs are worth telling. However the levels of details John Gribbin goes into is not adapted to the story telling of WHOLE science. Some parts are amazingly long and detailing minor facts like the social or political backgrounds. Interesting as they are, they don't deserve dozen of pages at once... Many other parts are very short and the author often states ""this is not the place to go to much into details"". After reading I felt like knowing a lot more but missing a lot more as well. Mathematics are totally missing (no Gauss, Poincaré, Fermat, almost no Leibnitz, Euler...). Biology, Chemistry and most of all Astronomy is well represented. I found some parts fascinating like the invention of the telescope, the discovery of radioactivity or the measurement of the age of the Earth."

John Gribbin is a good writer who makes the Western world's scientific discoveries accessible to someone like me, who has no training in physics, chemistry, or biology. I had fun reading this book."

I cannot imagine the amount of time it must have taken for the author to research the history of science and how it has brought us to where we are today. As a non-scientist, I enjoyed reading this even if I do not understand all of the findings. The author goes to great lengths to include a bit of history on the scientists, some of whom had previously been lost to history by more notable names. The reader will leave with a greater understanding of scientific progress against the backdrop of human history, and how much we have learned through human determination and curiosity in a really small window of time.

I am a community college instructor of physics and astronomy, and often read history of science books so that I can add interesting details to class lectures. This book has helped me see the interconnectedness and persons behind the development of the various sciences: biology, chemistry, physics, geology, and astronomy. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to understand the people behind the evolution of natural philosophy into modern science."

Otherwise, it's a tremendous excursion through the minds and achievements of 'modern science"" which has, until quite recently, dominated the globe. Indian, Chinese and Islamic science don't get a look-in here at all, which is a pity. In reality, some of the shoulders of giants upon which Isaac Newton stood came from these other great traditions.  Nevertheless I still enjoyed it, was entertained and educated by it."

26,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45930887-moxi,5,The most interesting science book I’ve ever read.
27,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3038974-steve-van-slyke,3,"This book is similar in some respects to Bertrand Russell’s A History of Western Philosophy which takes the reader on a tour of the great philosophers from Aristotle to Kant, Locke and Voltaire. In this case the journey is from Ptolemy, Copernicus and Gallileo to Einstein and Feynman with a lot of stops in between.At times the author delves a little deeper into the personal history of some of the scientists than was necessary for this reader. And being British and understandably writing primarily for his home audience, he at times assumes a greater knowledge of, and interest in, British history than perhaps the typical American or non-Anglo reader might possess. But these are only very minor criticisms.Overall I found it an enjoyable read, and in some instances quite surprising. For one example, in the late 1500’s Giordano Bruno not only stated his full support of the Copernican model of the solar system, he went on to state that because the stars were apparently infinite in number that “there must be life elsewhere in the universe.” Bruno was obviously way ahead of his time and rather than being burned at the stake as a heretic he would probably be working for NASA if he were alive today.Another example of this sort was in when in 1783 John Michell predicted the existence of black holes based on his knowledge of the speed of light and the density and gravity of stars. I had no idea the concept of black holes went back that far. At least up to the time of Darwin it seems as if most of the scientists were born wealthy and often originally destined to become priests, ministers or monks. Many studied medicine or law, which aside from theology were the two other main professions of the time. It was the rare individual who managed to distinguish himself in science but also came from humble means.In this book and in others I am glad to see Alfred Russell Wallace often being mentioned in the same breath as Charles Darwin, and Robert Hooke with Isaac Newton. And in the same vein it was in this book that I learned that a woman, Rosalind Franklin, had most likely discovered the structure of DNA prior to Crick and Watson, and that they had even relied on her data and X-ray photography (without her knowledge) in order to construct their model of the DNA double Helix. After reading more about Franklin in Wikipedia I learned there is biography of her by Brenda Maddox Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA. I’ve added it to my To Read list. Perhaps some day, Franklin’s name and accomplishments will be at least as familiar as Wallace’s.I would have loved to have given this book four stars instead of three were it not for another minor criticism: the overuse of long parenthetical phrases.. For example, on page 433: “If energy is put in by jiggling the stretched rope (equivalent to putting energy into an electromagnetic field by making a current flow first in one direction and then in the other in a long wire or an antenna system), you can send ripples down the rope.” The phrase in parentheses is longer than the sentence it modifies! Wouldn’t it have been simpler and clearer to say, “If energy is put in by jiggling the stretched rope you can send ripples down it, which is equivalent to putting energy into an electromagnetic field…..etc.” No parentheses, no confusion. I frequently found myself having to read such sentences twice to be sure I understood the meaning. The editor is as much or more to blame as the author."
28,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25618483-kimberly,5,"The Scientists is a fantastic book describing the history of Western science through the lives of many well known and even more lesser know scientists. The book is grouped chronologically into five parts, each of which is further divided into chapters by scientific discipline. I appreciated this format because it preserved the overall historical arc while organizing the development of various fields into coherent stories. The chapters are rather long and packed with information – this is definitely not a quick read – but it was not boring or tedious (at least for this science enthusiast – I would not recommend it for the average reader.) The explanation of the science seemed geared at someone with an understanding of general biology, chemistry, and physics. One of the things I appreciated most about this book was that it did not turn into a compilation of biographies of individual scientists. Rather, Gribbin did an excellent job of using the biographies to trace the progress of scientific knowledge as well as highlight several themes about the nature of science and scientific inquiry over time (as promised by the subtitle). At the same time, he shared amusing anecdotes about many of the scientists that made the history personal, interesting, and inspiring. One of the only challenges of reading this book was keeping the names of all the scientists straight, particularly when a few showed up in multiple chapters. Partly this is due to the nature of many of the discoveries; sometimes a particular field was so “hot” that more than a few scientists were contributing significant findings. But I would have appreciated a few more references back to the scientists’ works to remind me who they were. I'll admit that I was a little disappointed by Gribbin’s conclusions at the end. He chose to begin the book with Copernicus and his heliocentric model of the solar system and then wrapped the book up with the discoveries of galaxies beyond ours. He tied these two together by stating that science has essentially proven that we are insignificant. While this theme makes a convenient literary bookend, it felt like he was selling science short, as if all science was doing was poking a finger at us and teaching us a lesson. Rather, when I finished the last chapter, I felt awed and fascinated by how beautiful science and its explanations of the world is, and I was expecting a more profound conclusion from Gribbin. Perhaps this is a matter of personal preference and perspective. But I did really appreciate his conclusion regarding scientists themselves. He claims that it is not greed or desire for fame that drives most scientists, but a burning curiosity to understand the world around them, which I thought was profound. Overall, The Scientists was an excellent read, one that further ignited my passion for science, and I am planning on buying a copy for myself to own soon. I recommend this to anyone who has a deep interest in science and the people who have been a part of it over the past few centuries. "
29,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,4,"An attempt to tell the history of science from Copernicus till the present in 600 pages. A whirlwind of the scientists' names, biographies and brief explanations of the scientific work of each. A reviewer criticized Norman Davies's Europe: A History being really a history of Poland in disguise; Gribbin's book is really a history of astronomy in disguise. Much more attention is given to astronomy and physics (Gribbin is an astrophysicist by education) than to biology and medicine, and none to logic and computer science; when Fourier series are mentioned, it is said that they are still used today by astronomers measuring the variability of stars and quasars.The century between 1850 and 1950 was of course when science advanced the most: in 1850, conservation of energy had just been discovered by Mayer and Joule, and in 1950 quantum electrodynamics was being actively developed by Feynman, Bethe and others. By the law of diminishing returns, much less has been accomplished since then despite a much greater number of professional scientists and a much greater percentage of the gross world product being devoted to scientific research. However, the 17th century was the coolest.Gribbin doesn't believe in Kuhnian paradigms; he does believe in a shift from mysticism to science around 1600, with Kepler still a mystic and Galileo already a scientist. I am unconvinced by his examples that there is really such a large difference between the two. Copernicus believed that planets revolve around the Sun in circles because the circle is a perfect figure; we believe that the laws of physics are invariant with respect to translation in spacetime because this is simpler than if the laws of physics were invariant with respect to translation in spacetime except in a certain part of space for a million years, where they were different. "
30,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7071848-jeff-kissel,3,"The Scientists takes a semi-biographical view of the people behind scientific progress as it covers the history of the developments from the Renaissance to the present. Since there are so many notable characters throughout science history, each can only be devoted a few paragraphs (or pages if they are more unique) and most of the biographical aspects covered are focused on areas related to their ultimate scientific contributions. As science developed and branched into more specialized areas, so does this book by splitting the chapters into chronological segments focused on a particular discipline. The book ends by bringing us to where science stands at the time of the writing and emphasizes the amount of progress made in a relatively short time.As with any book of this scope, it was a lot to take in and could be dry reading at times. However, Gribbin did a good job of keeping it interesting by injecting some personal details or sidenotes (don't skip the footnotes!) throughout. The material was so comprehensive there is no way to absorb it in a read-through, and it is written in more of a novel structure so would be difficult to use as a reference material. However, it was worth the time I devoted to it and I will take away whatever my memory allows. A key area of emphasis was the incremental nature of scientific development. This humanizes some of the giants that we learn about in school by showing how much background work was being accomplished to enable them to make the ""breakthrough"" discoveries while also giving due credit to some of the ""unsung heroes"".I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed books like Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"" and Hawkings ""A Brief History of Time"" or other books similar in nature."
31,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7916772-silent-count,2,"This book offers glimpses into lives of the the prominent scientists from Galileo (roughly the late 1500's) to the present moment. It was easy to tell that it was written by an author with a passion for the subject and a delight for sharing his interest with the reader. He's also taken some pains to create coherent, story-like threads from the often disjointed timeline of progress in the various branches of science.Unfortunately, I'd have severe reservations about recommending this book to anyone but the most hard-core science groupie. Despite what are obviously good intentions, this book suffers from two problems; it's too long (the hard-cover is 600+ pages), and the prose. One problem feeds on the other. Given the length and breadth of the subject matter, the length is understandable but the often leaden prose makes it long, hard slog to get to the end of the book.The thing which this book most vividly, if inadvertently, conveyed to me is not the progress made by the scientists discussed but the progress made in medical care. There are numerous mentions along the lines of, ""so and so was the 3rd surviving child of seven children, his other brothers/sisters died young/in child birth/of disease (which are now easily preventable)"".While the decrease in the mortality rates of both mothers and their children is a wonderful thing, it is not what I expected to be left with when I started this book. It does make me curiously optimistic about the future that many of our day-to-day ""problems"" are rather trivial by comparison."
32,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42794870-nate-the-candid-scientist,3,"John Gribbin's ""The Scientists"" is more or less the story of how the field of science evolved into what it is today. Along the way, Gribbin also gives character to the famous scientists that we've all heard of (e.g. Newton and Copernicus) through rich storytelling. This made the book real enjoyable for me! However, as the book chronologically arrives at modern times, Gribbin begins to forgo such stories and instead goes into lengthy discussions on the de-individualization of the scientist, the interdisciplinary efforts that led to the great discoveries of our times, and ends with a (almost existential) discussion of how unimportant humans are in relation to the universe as a whole.Now, the main issue I have with this book is John Gribbin's writing style. As a scientist, I know that run-on sentences can be the bane of our existence, yet Gribbin seems to love them. Unfortunately, this makes the book difficult to read at times (especially when he tries to explain scientific theories), and makes me hesitant to recommend it to those not well-versed in science. All that being said, Gribbin's book ultimately provides an interesting look at the evolution of science, and he really does put things into perspective. While the book is certainly not one you should just causally pick up, I would still recommend it for anyone interested in the history of science."
33,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3153305-angela-benedetti,5,"John Gribbin has chosen to tell the history of Western science through the biographies of the scientists who created it, giving the reader a wonderful sense of how the different approaches, discoveries and fields link up, as well as an appreciation for science as a very human activity. The advances are explained well and clearly, and the lives of the scientists themselves are shown briefly, but with appropriate quirks, warts and strange coincidences intact.I particularly like how Gribbin debunks the notion of the sudden revolution in science, showing instead how new theories, no matter how suddenly they might have been sprung upon the larger world nor how perpendicular they might have been from earlier ideas, are all built upon a foundation of steady accumulation of data and ideas. Scientific advance comes when the time is right, and two or more researchers or teams are often racing (whether they're aware of it or not) to be the first with a new idea. The new builds upon the old, and when it's time for the next step, somebody is going to take it.This is a good book for the professional or afficionado looking for a larger picture, as well as for a newcomer who wants a thorough but not too detailed introduction to the development of science in the Western world."
34,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7320304-n-n-santiago,4,"Nice biographical detail (I knew Newton was crazy; I didn't know he was a total asshole too), though it can get a bit too much at times. For someone who left contact with the study of science in secondary school, I found the science mostly followable for about two thirds or so of the book. It also brought back some clear flashbacks of old classrooms, with the sudden realisation, 'ah, so  that's what they were talking about,' and a small pang of regret that I wasn't more in to it at the time.The author makes the point that he believes in and has written the book to demonstrate his belief that scientific progress moves forward in increments, building on what came before, rather than the more fashionable (at least in historic and sociological circles) view of science consisting of a sequence of 'revolutions'. This makes for a smooth narrative flow, and it can be quite addictive reading. I would recommend taking advantage of this, and not taking a break like I did and reading another book when I was about 150 pages from the end, as it somewhat broke the fragile foundations of scientific knowledge I had ghosted in to being by fusing the text's short descriptions with my own hazy memories. "
35,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97514712-karen-davis,5,AWESOME book! One of my favorites!
36,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038815-jc,5,"John Gribbin has a remarkable ability to explain science to non-specialists in a detailed, informative, and yet quite entertaining manner. This book mostly skips what one might call the pre-history of science, the science of classical Greece and other pre-Copernican ideas, except where it helps explain the context of what came later. Gribbin starts instead in the Renaissance and builds from there. Mixing biographical information with the discussion of what individual scientists added to the growing understanding of our universe, and tying together geology, astrology, biology, astrophysics, and other fields, Gribbin paints a picture of science as a whole, organically interconnected endeavor. This book would work for both the interested layman as well as for the professional scientist who enjoys reading about the back history. And, it can certainly serve as an inspiration to future scientists in its portrayal of some of the great minds in the history of science as being in the heads of quite ordinary people."

Unfortunately books that hold the name History of Science are few . I've read a translated version of this book stands in tow volumes ( 400 pages for each ) I skipped most of them , Gribbin was focusing very much on the personal lives of the scientists ( as the title indicates ) he was trying to do for science as Plutarch did for philosophy and Vasari for art, I mean the Lives  . A book of history of science based on the lives of the scientists is a bad idea I think , it works in art , literature and even in philosophy but not in science, for there is no individuality in science . The personal live of an artist effects the way he thinks and draws , but I don't think that the death of Darwin's daughter effected the way he looks at the species . I don't deny the laborious and hard making of this book but it was better to mention these things briefly and discuss what is really matters , not the opposite ."

The Scientists by John Gribbin is a great and amazing book. It is influential and inspiring. While it may look very boring and to much to read on just science, it teaches you the history of the great scientists and how these people impacted the world today. It shows you the importance of almost every main science topic in the world. To me this book was a very good book, it gave me a better perspective on science, and the world. Through this book you can learn and create ideas of the world. For all those science lovers out their this book is for you. The reason why is that, me as a science lover, learned a lot and gained more knowledge of each scientist and each subject they studied. In the end this book was one of the most fantastic books I ever read. I very much encourage you to read this book, even though it is a very big book, it is worth the time.

There were parts of it and aspects that I liked, but also some things that I didn't like. The author made an attempt to summarize the scientific discoveries of the last several centuries (hence the 616 pages), and he was careful to do so in terms of the scientists rather than the science itself. I liked getting a nice, overall picture of how different developments came about and how they affected each other. I also liked reading some of the insignificant personal details about the lives of the scientists because I never learned things like that in my science classes. But at times there was just a little too much detail, and the author was far too liberal in his usage of parentheses. I also sensed a holier-than-thou tone throughout the book, as if the author was some great philanthropist condescending to explain all these difficult scientific concepts to the poor ignorant masses."
40,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937989-ksenia,4,"I picked this book up from a clearance table without knowing anything about it. I love both science and history. This book was incredibly interesting and made science much more personal to me. The lives of these people connected ambition, hard work, and good luck. I particularly liked the recognition the author gives to lesser-known scientists, pointing out how the Newtons and the Einsteins of the world built upon the knowledge and hard work of many people whose names we don't recognize. He brought the famous scientists down from the clouds a little bit without taking away from their genius. The second half of the book was a little bit more difficult for me to enjoy, as there was a lot of dense science packed into 250 pages. Overall, it is a great book, and I felt smarter with every page. I recommend it to anyone interested in science. "
41,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6752970-peter,5,"I really liked this book a lot. It complements Asimov's history (Isaac Asimov's New Guide to Science) in that whereas Asimov often does a very thorough job of explaining the key experiments on a technical level, Gribbin goes into the personality and influences of each scientist. Gribbin also explains the connections between each scientist's work and the advances in technology making the work possible. Gribbin's main thesis throughout the book is that science advances through 'evolution' rather than 'revolution'. Each new advance was built upon a theoretical or technological foundation laid by those who preceded it. The ""coda"" at the end gives a very thoughtful defense of science against the ""constructionist"" attack by philosophers and religious fundamentalists who would have you beleive that science is just words. Gribbin explains why that is so wrong. "
42,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31526875-francisco-rodr-guez,5,"I found particularly fascinating how wrong the first scientists were in the things they first studied. From our privileged position in history these scientists may seem almost blind to the obvious, yet when you try to think from their point of view you realize that they are almost always thinking brilliantly and with an amazing perseverance. They frequently err, but what else can they do? Being completely blind to nature, with no one to teach them, they had to open their way through its secrets by guessing and most of the time getting it wrong, and, some precious times, succeeding.This book increased enormously my appreciation for Science. It made me love some scientific topics which I previously considered boring, thanks to almost experiencing the views of those who dedicated their lives to them.One of the best books I have ever read."
43,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260292-erik,2,"A bit chatty and gossipy. ""Newton was probably a homosexual"" Really? Do we know this or are we just drawing conclusions here? Gribbin does pay more attention to the minor figures in the story and that is good. He is probably right that people like Hooke suffered from bad press thanks to Sir Isaac's rewrite of history. But to credit Hooke equal with Newton on the discovery of the inverse square law (essentially a guess on his part) is going too far. He didn't do the math so he doesn't get the credit. For learning the science along with the history, I prefer Toulmin's Fabric of the Heavens and Architecture of Matter. I don't think students will understand the breezy one-liner treatment of certain issues, where full explanations and diagrams would help."
44,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10224329-laura-walin,2,"This was a bit too tedious reading (took me five months) to rate it ""I like it"" although there were bits and pieces that were more fascinating to me than others. In teh final pages of the book it became clear to me why it was so: The author himself was an astrophysiscist while I myself am a biologist. Hence, the biology parts where more or less familiar to me, and the physics parts were not that well popularised (in my view :)). But I must admit that quantum physics were quite captivatengly presented."
45,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5982358-derek-bridge,4,"This is impressive: the lives, the times, the ideas of so many Western scientists from the Renaissance on. In a couple of places, the science is not explained as well as one might hope, but this is forgivable in a book that has such scope. The themes (evolution rather than revolutions in ideas; ideas having their time, meaning that any one of several contenders might be famous for their discovery) are well brought out. Notable too is how the 20th century heralds a change from significant individuals to a much more collective enterprise."
46,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24904401-matt,3,"An interesting read. At times I found myself skipping through parts that seemed irrelevant to the main scope of the book, other times the reading proved to be more fruitful, and I felt I was 'discovering' fresh and pertinent insights into the private motivations of these science heavyweights. Knowing the historical contexts that surround some of the most fundamental discoveries in science has helped me to build a deeper understanding of how society affects the development of science and technology and visa versa."
47,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1615305-the-tick,3,"The first part was interesting, but about halfway through, the author chooses to drop a lot of the biographical focus in exchange for more information about the science itself. I wish he hadn't--I was reading this for the biographical element, and I found those parts much more interesting than the actual science bits. The last few chapters were basically a rehash of what I learned in various high school and college science classes except for some of the astrophysics, and I had a much harder time staying interested."
48,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90667692-albert,2,"The first part of the history of science was a nice read, and interesting. After 38%, when biology kicked in, I lost interest. The remaining pages I just skimmed over, reading parts of Einstein’s work and quantum theory and then finished. So this one goes to my DNF shelf. Too many scientists and too much detail about their lives for me.Update after half a year: not having gotten beyond the 38% mark sounds more like two stars to me now, so downgrading from three to two stars."
49,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/229372-charles,4,I like how the author connects all these big ideas and people to demonstrate the way the scientific process (and progress) builds off of the past. The self correcting nature and continual honing of scientific understanding remains the best way we have to learn about and understand the world we live in. 
50,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8080638-a,4,"A seriously thorough compendium of western scientific thought and the individuals behind it. It tries to be more readable than it is, but I think the impulse towards accurate, measured information is more useful than a book that tries to be entertaining at the expense of precision. Haven't made it all the way through, but I'm slowly working on it."

I wasn't sure how much I would like an assigned reading book, however, Gribbin has told the history of science in a way that makes you feel like you're not reading a history book. It reads like a novel rather than a textbook. I really enjoyed this book because of how he managed to tell the story."
54,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/752725-renjith,4,"Wonderful book, must read for all science enthusiasts. John Gribbin tells the story of science through its inventors from Galileo to Richard Feynman, from telescope to QED, from ether to quarks. Inspiring. Must read."
55,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447512-matthew-degriselles,3,Overall a very good book about the history of science and the people who made the discoveries. I would say the first half of the book was the most informative talking about how everything led up to each discovery. The only part I disliked was that the second half of the book was so rushed. 
56,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3289903-matthew-white,5,"Fantastic! Runs through an amazing history of various concepts and left me buzzing; that's right, buzzing! And no, I wasn't smoking illegal substances at the time. Totally worthy of time and energy. "
57,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3233713-guenterwahl50,0,"A very detailed history of science only I miss the geographical location and the innovation like is consecutive series of discoveries in a cluster of institutions, are there regional spatial distribution of innovation, did all science happen in London and Cambridge? "
58,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5892974-nichole,3,"This book took my MONTHS to get through. Very dense with political history and lots of dates. I am glad I read it because it's important stuff that I should learn, however, it could have been presented better."
59,0812967887,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5834201-astarzak,4,"Combining two of my favorite subjects, science and history, I found this book highly interesting and entertaining.
