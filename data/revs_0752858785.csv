0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"I am fairly sure this was recommended on a management course. Entertaining read, well illustrated. Not sure how accurate it is, I tried out some of the ideas such as sitting side by side or at an angle to somebody rather than opposite across a desk at them. I certainly felt better for doing so but then the book told me that I would!The downside for me is that I started to become absurdly self-conscious. Was I standing in an optimum way, sending out the best messages? Were my feet pointing in the right directions? If somebody's body language is negative should I try to counter it by offering them something to hold? Does any of this stuff really work or is it just silliness? Is the conscious embrace of silliness the most sensible approach to interaction with fellow humans?The serious downside is that there is a lot of assertions made in the book with very little evidence and what evidence there is tends to fall back on one study or one anecdotal example which leaves one wondering quite how generally applicable the guidance is, particularly outside of the UK. On the other hand having been the retreating party when talking with somebody whose notions of allowable personal space where much smaller than mine(view spoiler)[ from a distance and at the incorrect angle it must have looked as though we were dancing the quickstep  (hide spoiler)], I wish that this book was read more widely - I eventually ended up backed up against a wall trapped by a water cooler feeling distinctly unamused."

You will be able to tell if someone is genuinely agreed with you or simply is faking so.2. It would be easier for you to see if someone is lying or hiding something.3. When to tell if your message being conveyed and that your subjects are open and receptive to your arguments. 4. How to use body language to power up your position, radiate a dominant outlook and literally be more effective.5. You can tell if someone is interested in you or others.6. In the book, there are lots of mistakes pointed out to be avoided in business situations and especially has a lot of advice for women to obtain a more firm stance in their meetings.And much more interesting topics ...I highly recommend this book to anyone who seeks communication skills and wants to appear more competent in his/her social or business interactions as well as to those whom with high ambitions of having an upper hand in their day-to-day meetings with others.If you desire to consume more advanced topics in this subject, I'd also recommend:• Emotions revealed• Unmasking the face• Telling liesAll by the psychology guru and deception expert: Paul Ekman"

They make huge sweeping generalizations (they said Britain, Germany, etc. have been world powers is because their populations often mirror body language...... What??? And also that heavy smokers haven't been breast-fed whereas non smokers have been) and completely lost their credibility. Then the gender differences they pointed out always seemed to paint women in an unforgiving light, to say the least. You can get all the basic information via Google and spare yourself the sensationalized sweeping generalizations. "
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2416724-raluca,3,"3.5/5.This book was very difficult to rate. On one hand, it's a pretty comprehensive guide of human gestures and postures, aided in their understanding by suggestive illustrations. On the other hand, I kept getting the feeling that the authors were trying really, really hard to sell me a commercial version of body language. Often, things were exaggeratedly emphasized in a clickbaity way and I would not have been surprised to see chapter titles such as: ""You will not believe how your boss is dominating you!"" or ""Seven ultra-secret signals she's into you!"".Searching for information about the authors, I see that neither of them is a psychologist or scientist of any kind. They're just really, really good salespeople who've found their niche. That makes me a bit skeptical about the validity of the interpretations they offer.There are other clues that make me doubt the content. One is the studies cited at the end. The book often contained phrases such as ""studies show"" or ""research says"". However, if I wanted to read about the study mentioned in chapter X, point Y, and flipped the pages to the end of the book, surprise! Instead of showing the research in the order it is cited, it is shown alphabetically. That means that I have to wade through a few hundred cited sources to see which applies and I am pretty sure this was done on purpose. The other objection I have with the studies is that most of them are from the 70s. (The newest ones are from 2003.) That leads me to believe that a) a lot of this research has been debunked/updated/couldn't be replicated and that b) the authors purposefully selected only those sources that had a vague resemblance to the point they were trying to make and stretched the interpretation in a sensationalist manner.A few other things bothered me. One was the ""old gramps who's trying to be hip"" cringe humor. The second was the outdated examples and references - it really shows that the book hasn't been edited for a newer audience, but is still stuck somewhere in the 80s-90s (in mentality too). Then there were the problems I had encountered in the previous body language book I had read, although to a lesser extent here.First, the book had a really strong emphasis on man vs man or man vs woman relationships.Second, there were very few references to woman vs woman relationships. (In fact, the authors presented a very petty/catty attitude between women as the only plausible one. What about female friends? Is the notion that alien?)Third, all the interactions between men and women were interpreted in a sexual manner. (What about the young man arguing with the old woman in the bus over the position of the window? I bet the authors would say that the opening and closing of the window is a suggestive sexual allusion or whatever.) More so, women were seen as always submissive in their gestures in a man's presence. (I'm not going to go into that.)Fourth, men were also presented as some sort of primitive grunting beasts ready to jump at each other's throats... OK, I am exaggerating, but the authors did seem to see them as very simplistic beings incapable of any kind of complex thoughts. (I find this particularly insulting.)Again, I think that most of the things mentioned in the paragraph above have a very high commercial value and while they might carry some form of truth (yes, there are differences between the two sexes), they have been exaggerated for the public, because this is what sells and this is what the public wants to hear/read.All in all, this was another book I used as research for the series I am writing. The best thing about it is that a) it's comprehensive (there are even chapters about mirroring another person's body language or height differences or seating positions) and b) it has useful illustrations. I recommend it to other (aspiring) writers, just be careful to take it with a grain of salt.(As a bonus, checking this book, I realize that my characters' body language has been pretty well-written, just too detailed and hard to follow at points.)"
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2898778-ellen-maze,4,"As an author, I am naturally a student of observation, so this book had the potential to be of great service to me not only in my writing, but in character-building and expression. I enjoyed the read. Unlike some other Body Language books, this one has a lot of photographs, and at the risk of sounding sophomoric, they really added to my understanding of the text. The chapters/categories made a lot of sense, and the information moved along with little unnecessary repetition. I think everyone who reads this book will have their eyes opened, and begin to read body language everywhere they go. The only thing that bugged me was that the authors used evolution to explain much of the human's use of body language. I didn't find their theories believable, and evolution explanations really weren't necessary. I would expect some reference to the ape-man, Neanderthal, etc, but these authors referred to them with a fervor akin to proselytizing. This shortcoming is the only thing that held me back from leaving 5-stars. Skimming those sections was easy, and the book is well worth the read and the purchase price.

5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8107877-gabriela,5,"Allan Pease and Barbara Pease apply their experience in medicine, biology and psychology to illustrate the workings of the brain and how this influences our body language. In the Definite Book Of Body Language, the authors show us how we can use our knowledge of the brain's functions to understand people's emotions and behaviors.I have to say that neuropsychology and behavioral science have always fascinated me. There are many books out there about these topics. But I found this one particularly interesting as it covered real life examples which you could see yourself applying or identify body language behavior and what the other person in communicating. The authors have used real life examples and offer various exercises that you can undertake to practice reading people's emotions and behaviors.I would recommend this one to everyone really. Whether you are interviewer, a manager, a teacher, businessperson, someone looking for a job, or for a partner, this book can help you understand other people's behavior and perhaps overcome communicational barriers. It does serve as a great premier especially if you are not entirely familiar with the psychology of body language. "
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489698-r-nair,3,"I am not saying that if the authors claim ""water is wet"", you need to ask for a second opinion. Ok I lied, you need to ask for a second opinion. There are parts that are genuinely riddled with sweeping statements and superfluous information, but to be fair, there are also parts that actually are interesting and are based on psychological studies done on human behaviour and the resulting body language. The problem lies in separating the proverbial wheat from the chaff. Since some claims are questionable, all claims are questionable and it doesn't hurt to educate yourself on claims that seem too neatly packaged to be true. Winnowing and Google go hand in hand.So, in summary -- Interesting read if you suspend scientific rigour and logical disbelief at certain points. - Good book to skim through to get a better grasp on reading your audience or improving your body language but not one to be taken word for word and read through with firm conviction in all the claims made.- Get a second hand copy for yourself and speed-read the book in a day or two."

Has anyone I know noticed this about me? I personally had never noticed. Does it unnerve you as the book says it would? I wonder if they are learned behaviors that I picked up because most of my friends have been male through my adolescence and young adulthood. I did not view myself as a dating option for them, but a social equal. Or am I simply more a more aggressive than average woman? Hmmm...makes me want to observe myself better."

It is a fantastic insight into understanding the people around you.I highly recommend this book to martial artists and students of self defense classes, because Allan discusses topics your instructors allude to, but quickly pass over, because they don't have the time to cover this subject in depth. Realistically, anyone who has to deal with people should read this book. From a self defense point of view, it's easier to avoid trouble if you can read the people around you (but it does take practice).I purchased this revised edition a few years ago because it contained a lot of additional information. While it would be impossible to remember everything discussed by the author, it is definitely worth your while to absorb as much of the information as you are able."

And then let me follow that up by saying this is not the book I would recommend reading. But, I do think this book was really helpful and it was eye-opening and for the most part it was really interesting. I'm glad I read it and I learned a lot from it and I will most likely be re-reading it and studying it from time to time to learn more. Along with all that good information, there was enough stuff in this book that was awkward, inappropriate, or wrong (nearly every page talked about evolution and I don't agree with that) that I wouldn't even be okay having the book sit somewhere where people could pick it up and read it. I bought white-out for me to fix a few of the issues (like illustrations that really aren't okay), so that was helpful. So, this book was helpful, and the information for the most part was stuff that I think was important to know (even when it was awko-taco) - I just wouldn't be okay handing the book to most people and recommending it.

19,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2170861-carrie-wilson,4,"This book is a well-researched summary of proxemics, gender and cultural differences in non-verbal communication, facial expressions and much more! A few tidbits you'll learn from this book: female brains are designed for multi-tasking (which is explains why we can watch TV, read a book, and chat online while drinking coffee); smiling is seen as a subordinate action and women tend to smile much more than men, something likely hard-wired into our brains; organs that are transplanted retain cellular memory so that recipients assume the mannerisms and gestures of their donor (!); in courtship, women are the initiators a whopping 90 percent of the time.There is much more to this book--these examples are teasers. The only downside to the book (and it is quite a small one) is that the authors list their references in the back in alphabetical order-- I prefer endnotes or footnotes or MLA style citation because I usually like to see the original sources for studies when I read non-fiction. Since this book is written for a general audience, I doubt many people are put off by their referencing style. I also didn't care for the line drawings--again that is such a nit-picky criticism, but really! They could have done a better job with the illustrations. . . I recommend this book to anyone human interested in fellow humans.  "

It's fascinating, and disconcerting, to read how many things we do unconsciously that are so denotative about our motives and thoughts. Moreover, another intriguing concept is the fact that another person's actions, gestures or body language can engender a sense of benevolence, aversion or even hostility in us towards that individual, without us being able to comprehend why we feel that way.The book is full of examples from real-life personages, some of which are highly entertaining and amusing.It certainly teaches you a lot about hiding insecurities and looking more confident.

34,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91977885-michael,4,"Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition. It's about matching what you see and hear in the environment in which it all happens and drawing a probable conclusion. However, most people only see the things they think they are seeing. Early research on communication shows that the total impact of a message is about 7% for spoken words and 38% for vocal, i.e., the voice's tone and 55% for non-verbal. This means that words are used primarily for conveying information and data. For example, a study done between 1970-80 revealed that a person with a strong argument usually wins in a phone conversation. However, in the round table encounter 60 to 80 percent accounts for body language, and usually, the people make initial impressions within 4 minutes of the conversation.According to the book, some people, especially women's, are more perceptive than men - 'women's intuition.' Being perceptive means able to spot the contradictions between someone's words and body language. When we say we have a hunch or gut feeling, we usually mean that their words and body language do not much. And overall, women are good at picking them. In addition, it is usually easy to read children than adults. This could be that adults have less muscle tone in the face. An interesting fact about body language is that it is easy to misread it, yet it is hard to fake it.While talking about body language, it's important to note that it can be different across different cultures, though some body languages like nodding the head, shoulder shrug, smiling are inborn and are usually the same across cultures. For accurately reading body language, the book presents 3 rules.	1. The reading of gestures should be in clusters. This is to mean that an individual gesture might not give or mislead. Gestures are words, and clusters are sentences in body language. To read them correctly, it needs at least three testers in a match. 	2. Look for congruence between gesture clusters and verbal language. If the gestures and the verbal language do not much, women tend to take the gestures. 	3. Gestures should be read in the context. For example, a person sitting in a cold bus waiting with hands crossed (defensive) and chin down (critical/hostile) should not be interpreted negatively.The HandsPalms of a hand are vocal cords of body language because they did more talking than any other body parts. Three are 3 main palm command testers	▪ Palm Up : is a used as a submissive non-threatening gesture.	▪ Palm Down : shows immediate authority.	▪ Palm Closed : shows the speaker figuratively beats his listeners to submission.Fingers also play a role, where a pointing finger gives negative feelings. Also, squeezing your finger into your thumb to make an OK gesture while giving public speech is considered authoritative, but not aggressive.Handshakes can also be used to show dominance- down Palm, submission-up Palm, and equality-vertical.While encountering power player giving down Palm the following two techniques help to disarm. 	1. Step into the left foot first and then move the right foot ahead of the left foot, then put the left foot again in the same position as the right foot. Practically this might be hard to use since most right-handed people tend to step their right leg first but helps a great deal because you are invading their private space. 	2. While a person presents a Palm up position, then put your left hand over his right to form a double handler and straighten the handshake. Also, while posing for a photo with a handshake, its always good to be on the right side as it gives a Palm down advantage. Touching while shaking hands, with the other hand, creates a powerful result. When you meet someone new and shake hands, extend your left arm, give a light touch on elbow or hand as you shake, and repeat their name to confirm you heard it correctly. Facial SmilesNatural smiles produce characteristic wrinkles around the eyes. The fleshy part of the eye between the eyebrow and the eyelid moves downward, and the end of the eyebrows dip slightly with open mouth for true similes. False smiles only pull back the mouth. Smiling attracts people and signifies a submission signal. Also, laughing simulates the body's natural pain killers and feel good enhancers, like the endorphins, helping relieve stress and heal the body. Thus is used as a therapy in hospitals. People who have trouble laughing at the tough things in life often turn to drugs and alcohol to achieve the same feeling that endorphin induced laughter produces.The 5 common types of smiles include: 1. The Tight-lipped Smile : is a kind that stretches the mouse tightly across the face to form a straight line concealing the teeth. This smile sends the message that the similer has withheld opinions or attitudes that will not be shared with you.  2. Twisted smile : is another kind where it shows opposite emotions on each side of the face, one happy one angry. This smile show sarcasm in the western world. 3. Drop-Jaw Smile : is when the lower jaw is dropped to show the person is laughing or playful. 4. Sideway looking up smile  is a playful and secretive pose that affects both genders. Its orientation is, head turned down and away while looking up with a tight-lipped smile. 5. Permanent Smirk is always smiling that everyone wonders what you have been up to.Laughing is more than 30 times as likely to occurs in participants in a social situation than in a solitary setting. This shows that laughing has less to do with jokes and funny stories and more to do with building relationships. Thus people tend to laugh more and longer in a social situation than each will last alone. Women will find a person that makes her laugh more attractive.Arm SignalsAny crossing of the arms in front of the body is perceived as unfavorable. By folding arms, a barrier is formed, i.e., unconscious attempt to block out what we perceive as a threat or undesirable circumstance. When a person has a nervous, negative, or defensive attitude, it will be manifested by folding the hands. Thus, it useful to avoid crossing your arms under any circumstances unless your intention is to show you don't agree or don't want to participate.Types of crossed arms are:	▪ The universal cross arms on the chest to show its defensive. So while giving speeches, if most of the listeners are crossing their arms, the speech needs to be turned to a kind where it turns to a receptive position. On another way to break this is to give the listeners something to hold in their hands like a notebook and pen. It's also good to use arm chaired to avoid people sitting this way, which in turn blocks their listening. 	▪ Fist Clenched Arm crossed shows hostility as well as defensiveness. A verbal or physical attack could happen if it is combined with a tight-lipped simile or clenched teeth and red face.	▪ Double Arm Grip is a self hugging position that shows a negative restrained attitude. It can be seen by doctors in the waiting room, first-time travelers on air. It depicts the person is feeling insecure and not buying what you are selling.	▪ Thumbs up cross arm shows defensiveness with a self-confident attitude. 	▪ Broken zipper position is used by men to protect their vulnerable area. It creates the feeling of having someone else holding your hand. Women's take hugging themselves position where one arm hung while the other takes hold or touches the other arm.	▪ Cuff Link Adjust is used by celebrities to disguise their nervousness.Hand and Thumb GesturesHumans have 27 small bones and dozens of tiny muscles to move the joints. There are more nerve connections between the hands and the brain than in any other part of the body. Because of that, hands can tell what is the person is thinking more easily. The common hand gestures include:	▪ Rubbing palms together to show positive expectancy. If it is slow, it looks sneaky or devious, but the faster shows excitement. 	▪ Thumb fingertip rub to show gesture about money. 	▪ Clenched hands placed centered to the face elbows resting to the desk while sitting shows frustration, restrained anxious or negative attitude. If placed on the desk centered to the body while elbows are at the same level, they show the same attitude with less degree and the less with standing position. 	▪ The Steeple used by superior to subordinate interaction and indicates a confident or self-assured attitude. As a general rule, this gesture should be avoided when you want to be persuasive or win others person confidence as it can sometimes be read as smugness. The Lowered steeple, hands-on thighs can be used to show assurance. 	▪ Face platter is used by ladies to show their faces, usually presenting themselves for a man. 	▪ Hands in the back with Palm-in-Palm show superiority and confidence. The gripping hand wrist shows frustration and anger. The higher it's up, the more the person is frustrated. 	▪ Thumps protrude is a sign of power authority. They can be in Arms folded with thumb us pointing upwards and thumbs out from the pocket.Evaluation and Deceit SignalsLying is the oil that greases our interactions with others and let us maintain friendly social relationships. Such are called White Lies because their goals are to make others feel comfortable instead of telling them the cold hard truth. Malicious Lies are, however, deliberate lies that set out to deceive another for personal benefit. When children lie, they use the hand to face gesture, i.e., putting the hand on the face. For adults, their umber of gulps of saliva increases, which is especially noticeable for a man as he has Adam apples. The following are the eight most common lying gestures. 1. The mouse cover : the hands cover the mouth as the brain subconsciously instructs it to try to suppress the deceitful words that are being said. While you are talking, if someone covers their mouse, it shows that they feel you are hiding something.  2. The nose touch : The human nose expands with blood during lying. This is followed by nose touching repossessed.  3. Itchy nose : is also a response like a nose touch that is used to disguise own deceit words or listener who doubts the speaker's words.  4. Eye rub : is the brain attempt to block it the deceit doubt or distasteful thing it sees, or to avoid having to look at the face of the person who is being lied to.  5. The Ear grab : is a signal that says, 'I don't want to hear it.' It is also a signal that the person heard enough and want to speak.  6. The Neck Scratch : is a gesture that shows doubt or uncertainty and is characteristic of the person to say, I'm not sure I agree. 7. The Collar Pull : is another gesture of telling lies.  8. Fingers in the mouse is an outward indication of an inner need for assurance, so giving a node guarantees a positive move. Evaluations gestures are shown by a closed hand resting on the chin or cheek, often the index finger pointing upward. Rubbing the back of the neck is also another reaction caused by feeling frustrated or fearful. Slapping the back of the neck tells your are being pain-in-the-neck for the issue while slapping the forehead shows reminding the forgotten thing and not intimidated by you mentioning it.Eye SignalsThe eyes are the most revealing and accurate of all human communication signals because they work independently of conscious control. In general, pupils will dilate or contract as your attitude and mood change from positive to negative and vice versa. When someone becomes excited, their pupils can dilate to up to four times their original size. Conversely, an angry, negative mood causes the pupils to contract to what is commonly known as beady little eyes.When people are lying, they are likely to dramatically increase their blinking rate, an unconscious attempt by the person's brain to block you from their sight because they have become bored or disinterested or feel superior to you. In such scenarios, to rattle the person while taking extended blink, quickly step a pace to your left or right.There are three geographical areas-gazing kinds, people look upon while talking to each other. 1. The social gaze : looks on the triangular area on the other persons face that is between the two eyes and noise. This gaze perceived as non-aggressive. 2. The Intimate gaze : looks at the lower body first to establish what sex it is and up between the eyes and below the chin. Women's has a wider peripheral vision that helps her to look at top to bottom while looking at the face. However, because of male tunnel vision, he needs to gaze up and down in a very obvious way. This is the reason why men are accused of ogling women's body at close range though research shows that women do more of it than men. 3. The Power gaze : looks at the triangular area between the eye and middle of the forehead. This gaze is used to treat a person who intimidates or the person you want to make shut up.Other gaze form, The power stare, gives more authority. It is done by looking at the person in narrow eyelids and without blinking. To perform this, move your eyeballs first and then let your head follow while making your shoulders remain still.Another interesting thing about the eyes is the movement they follow while trying to remember something. If a person recalls something that they saw, their eyes will move upward. If they recall something, they heard- they look to the side and tilt their head as if they are listening. If they are recalling a feeling or emotion they'll look down and to the right. And when they are talking to themselves, they look down and to the left.To keep control of where a person is looking while showing something, use a pen to point to the presentation and, at the same time, verbalize what he sees. Next, lift the pen from the presentation and hold it between his eyes and your eyes.continued in the comment section..."

I think another book should be appended so that we can analyse different real situations and put together all we know about body language in practice."

What stopped me from giving it only 1 star is that despite the many things I disagreed with, I found anyway a couple of useful pieces of advice. Overall not recommended."
38,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17413971-jinkm,1,"I got this book from the library because I have problems reading another person's body language. However, from the first page I got the feeling this book wouldn't be for someone like me. I saw the other books the author's have written. Here is the list:Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read MapsWhy Men Lie and Women CryWhy Men Can Only do One Thing At A Time and Women Never Stop TalkingThe Little Book of Men and women In my opinion, it's obvious the authors probably subscribe to the belief that men and women are totally and inherently different. And that they probably also believe in inherent gender roles, which, again, in my opinion, is bollocks. But hey, I thought, let's not judge. People's opinions and beliefs evolve and everyone has questionable opinions. That doesn't mean they don't know what they are talking about when it come to body language. So, I decided to give it a try.Eleven pages in I see ""Body language is an outward reflection of a person's emotional condition""Now, as someone who others describe as very stoic and stone-faced and as someone who has trouble with expressing emotion, I found this to be a little narrow minded. I constantly have to explain to people that ""No, I am not angry, I am thinking."" ""No, I am not attacking you, I am trying to have a serious discussion with you, please ignore my angry looking eyeballs."" ""No I am not a serial killer, I just have a very intense face sometimes, okay?!"" XD However, I am willing to consider this is the case for most people and I came to learn about others, so I carry on!  Unfortunately, immediately below the above quote, as an illustrative image to show an example of body language, they inserted a conveniently angled picture of Prince Charles so that it looked like he was grasping a large-chested woman's breasts with the caption of ""Prince Charles finds a bosom buddy"". Now, I'm all for humor and recognize that it makes reading about scientific subjects easier to digest. However, I found this tasteless and inappropriate. Red flag #3. (And it wasn't even the only sexual innuendo :S) However x2 though, we don't require our 'experts' to have appropriate senses of humor, (NASA scientists as an example :D). They are there to make a point and instruct, not to tickle our funny bones SO, I read on. :/ (If you can't tell, I'm a little hard-headed and have trouble listening to my own intuition.) The Final Straw - Not knowing the definition of words- The authors say ""Women have an innate ability to pick up and decipher non verbal signals, as well as having an accurate eye for small details"" I disagree, but I've already decided to ignore their outdated gender opinions. Just in the next paragraph, though, they totally contradict themselves. The authors cite a Harvard study that showed that women have a greater ability to read emotions in situations. Okay, that is in line with what they said, BUT they go on to say in the very next sentence  that men in 'nurturing' careers, like art (what?), acting, and nursing, as well as gay men, scored as well as women. They then go on to say that women are so very good at reading emotions because they ""practice reading signals early"". Which to me, seems to be the exact opposite definition of 'innate'. That's a definite sign of a dodgy book. Now I have a logical reason to quit. Good, I quit. Best decision I've made today. I feel good about quitting. You can tell, because my stance is open and I'm smiling. No really, I'm smiling. It might only be slightly more curved than straight line, but it's a smile.  My recommendation: find a different book to read. One that is more up to date and perhaps is written by some one who is more interested in solid academics than telling crass jokes. Two thumbs down."

The authors, professionals with vast experience in business, use their professional experience, latest data and researches to, in a colloquial and brief language, expose to the general public importants tips to interpret behavior in the professional and personal situations. The book deals with meanings gestures offered by the eyes, hands, feet and other expressions and body parts. Moreover, it exposes how elements found in the environment can influence the course of a conversation: how, for example, the position of your chair in relation to the interviewer can assist you in gaining a place of employment or assist in selling a product or service. These tips are very important when you have the notion that the interlocutor form an opinion about the other in just 4 minutes of talking, appealing, unconsciously, much more to the visual attributes and gestures than the competencies inherent to the career or quality of the curriculum. In fact, you'll never get a second chance to make a good first impression.Although richly illustrated, the weak point of this simple language book is the lack of depth. The Definitive Guide to Body Language deal only with situations illustrating it without specifying or explain motivations, it is a behavioral manual. Let, therefore, gaps that can only be fulfilled if the reader looking for more technical books in the area. If the goal is get tips, this is a good book. But if the intention is to look hard into the study of body language, this is a book that can be considered only introductory.***Sinais pouco evidentesDeterminados grupos gestuais emitidos pelo corpo geram influências negativas ou positivas no inconsciente do interlocutor, esta é a tese defendida por Allan e Barbara Pease no livro Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal. Os autores, profissionais de vasta experiência no mundo empresarial, utilizam-se da sua vivência profissional, dados e mais recentes pesquisas para, numa linguagem coloquial e breve, passar para o grande público importantes dicas de interpretação e comportamento em situações no âmbito profissional e pessoal.O livro trata de significados gestuais oferecidos pelos olhos, mãos, pés entre outras expressões e partes do corpo. Além disso, expõem como os elementos encontrados no ambiente podem influenciar nos rumos de uma conversa: o quanto, por exemplo, a posição de sua cadeira em relação ao entrevistador pode auxiliá-lo na conquista de uma vaga de emprego ou auxiliá-lo na venda de um serviço/produto.Essas dicas são muito importantes quando se tem a noção de que o interlocutor forma uma opinião sobre o outro em apenas 4 minutos de conversa, apelando, inconscientemente, muito mais para os atributos visuais do que para as competências imanentes à carreira profissional ou qualidade do currículo. De fato, a primeira impressão muitas vezes é a que fica.Embora ricamente ilustrado, o ponto fraco deste livro de simples linguagem está na falta de profundidade. Desvendando os segredos da linguagem corporal limita-se a exemplificar situações sem especificar ou explicar motivações, trata-se de um manual comportamental. Deixa, por isso, lacunas que só podem ser preenchidas se o leitor procurar por livros mais técnicos dentro da área. Se o objetivo é captar dicas, este é um bom livro. Mas se a intenção é debruçar-se sobre o estudo da linguagem corporal, este é um livro que pode ser considerado apenas introdutório. "

He brings the different aspects into conscious thinking of how these things developed by evolution and have been hardwired into brain to interpret.I cannot emphasize more on how fantastic book it was! It has helped me immensely, especially the courtship gestures!"
41,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95025914-wilmington,2,"I have read and enjoyed Allan and Barbara Pease's other bestsellers Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps and Why Men Lie and Women Cry: How to Get What You Want Out of Life by Asking and therefore was really looking forward to reading this book. It was quite a disappointment. Half of the body language described seems perfectly obvious to me. Some of the explanations were useful, but others were dubious or downright mistaken.It didn't start well when on page 7 the caption under Schwarzenegger showing the thumb up explained that it meant five in Japan, which is utterly false. I can forgive one mistake, but not dozens, and the book is filled with them. Here are other examples.On p. 18-19, the authors say that shaking the head from side to side to indicate 'no' is universal. Are they forgetting that in India it means 'yes' ? Over one billion people is not a minor exception.On p. 20, under the title Universal Gestures, the first example is the shoulder shrug to show that a person doesn't know or doesn't understand. In France it means that the person doesn't care or that it can't be helped. Perhaps their meaning of universal is not the one universally understood by English speakers ?On p. 109-110, they say that figures E and F are insults in Japan, and figure L means 5 in Japan and 1 in (continental) Europe. None of that is true.On the next page, under 'Why We are All Becoming American', they say that the middle finger raised is originally an American insult that became adopted in other countries because of American TV and movies. It actually originated in Ancient Greece and Rome and has been used in many European countries (especially Mediterranean ones) for a very long time. The authors claim that the American Ring gesture to mean OK is now recognised in many countries due to American influence. It may be recognised, but is hardly ever used in most of Europe and Asia, where it often has a different meaning. They carry on with the words for toilet becoming Americanised, but what does this have to do with body language ? It is also a fallacy, since most speakers of English today are non-native speakers, and Europeans are far more likely to use the word 'toilet' than 'bathroom' because the word 'toilet' exists in most European languages.On p.114, they claim that the French greet each others with a double kiss and the Belgians with a triple kiss. The truth is that the number varies from one to five in France, depending on the region and generation. In Belgium it is only once among French speakers, and usually none among Dutch speakers like in Britain.On p.119, they explain that the American OK sign means zero in France and money in Japan, but they are not done the same way and therefore cannot be misunderstood easily. The OK sign is done with the three other fingers open (pointing up). The French zero is done with the middle to little fingers closed, aligned on the index finger. The Japanese zero is done with the hand placed horizontally, open fingers pointing sideways, and the palm pointing towards the body.On p. 171, we read that the Japanese are the only ones that don't 'eyebrow flash'. Again it's not true. That's an East Asian thing.After the ignorance of other cultures come the scientific errors. On p. 171, the authors say that, contrarily to humans, ""apes lack eye-whites, which means that their prey don't know where the ape is looking or whether they have been spotted, giving the ape a greater chance of hunting success."" Really ? It's a surprising theory to say the least, since all apes aside from humans, and all monkeys are vegetarian.I also wonder what they mean when on p.192 they write ""by animals, birds, fish and primates"". Animals sound redundant here.In the section of personal space (p.193), they explain that lions have a territorial space of 30 miles or more, but that lions raised in captivity have a personal space of only several yards. They confuse personal space (safe distance between two individuals, even of the same family) and the lion's hunting territory, which isn't personal but used by all the lionesses (as it is the females that hunt) belong to the same clan. They make the same confusion afterwards by mentioning countries, cities and other non-personal boundaries. It's sounds highly unscientific and unprofessional on the authors' part to make such a simplification on a book about body language.I wasn't happier to read on the next page that they were going to compare the personal space radius in (and I quote) ""Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, North America, Northern Europe, Scandinavia, Canada or anywhere a culture is 'Westernised' such as Singapore, Guam or Iceland"". Wow ! What's the point of saying Great Britain and Scandinavia is they say Northern Europe ? Why say North America and Canada ? But much worse, why on earth would they consider that Iceland is not part of Scandinavia and believe it is not a Western country but a Westernised one like Singapore ? Do they have any idea of how uneducated that sounds ? On p.202 they insist again on saying ""Northern Europeans and Scandinavians"" as if Scandinavians weren't Northern Europeans. It might be useful for them to look at a world map some time.On p.199, trying to justify that people become more aggressive when their personal space is invaded, the authors claim that ""areas that have the highest human population density also have the highest crime and violence rates"". This is another factual mistake. Countries with very high population densities like Japan, the Netherlands, England, or even India, tend to be more peaceful and have lower crime rates than sparsely populated countries like most of Africa or South America, or even the USA.On p.268, Mr and Mrs Pease claim that ""Twice as many women smoke as men"". This is completely wrong. The WHO data shows that in average, worldwide, smoking is five times as prevalent among men than women. There is hardly any country where women smoke more than men, and in some Muslim countries the percentage of smoking men is one hundred times higher than for women (for example in Morocco and Algeria).After the factual mistakes come the dubious theories. On p.260-1, we read that one of the most common forms of mirroring is yawning, and that ""It was one thought that the purpose of yawning was to oxygenate the body but we now know that it's a form of mirroring that serves to create a rapport with others and to avoid aggression"". The problem with this theory is that yawning is most commonly done when people are alone or with close relatives at home, and therefore doesn't serve to avoid aggression.I also want to add that the quiz at the end of the book is terrible. The pictures are very unclear and it's hard to find all the signals even after reading the descriptions."

As it turned out, since body language is so tied up with emotions, almost all of the indicators were immediately recognizable. More importantly, they matched with an emotional understanding of what it feels like when exhibiting that indicator, and it feels like when I see others. This made information easy to absorb, and once it did it stuck.The most thought provoking concept in this book is what I mentioned earlier--emotional state and body language are mirrors of one another. That is to say, not only is your body language an expression of your emotion, but your feelings can be affected by changing your physical expressions. One of the more striking examples of this is the idea that if someone has a negative attitude, expressed with crossed arms, you can influence their emotional openness by handing them a pen or cup of coffee, requiring that they uncross their arms.So far, I am primarily becoming more aware of my own body language rather than reading others. That's fine by me--not only is it useful to know what messages you are subconsciousness sending others, it also makes me more aware of my own emotional state.One questionable bit about this book--it makes heavy use of bold claims about gender and other topics that contradict common wisdom. I don't know how supported these claims are, but I take much of the alleged science with a grain of salt.* In part, this is because I kept spacing out or losing my place, so I know I was missing bits."

In any social aspect of life, being able to recognize and use knowledge of body language to our favor can make a difference. Allan and Barbara Pease use their business and research backgrounds to uncover a general overview of body language for use in personal and professional situations. They cover hands,arms, smiles and laguther, cultural differences, hand and thumb gestures, evaluation and deceit signals, eye signals, personal space, legs, thirteen most common gestures, mirroring, signals of cigarettes, glasses and makeup, how the body points, courtship/attraction signals, ownership/territory/height signals, seating arrangements, and interviews/office politics. They also include an assessment at the end. Reading this book brought to light many things I already knew, but never thought about, and gestures I never encountered. I enjoyed the straightforward read, and the helpful visuals accompanying the explanations. I would've preferred less emphasis on business when they assumed in several sections you're persuading someone to make a sale, and more on social situations though much of it is applicable. Also they cover gender differences quite a bit which is useful and link it to biology which I found interesting. Still from a social perspective it's helpful to keep in mind the varieties of each genders' differences rather than to accept the general assumption. That said, I also enjoyed the research studies cited.Overall, this book is a great resource for anyone looking to improve their communication and relationships personal or professional, and especially those in helping/people professions."

However, I live in Japan, and none of the quote *offensive* gestures mean anything to anyone under thirty five. The business relations section for Japanese was suprisingly off. I mean, every time someone bows, they inspect your shoes? Most of the folks I meet here change from their outside, nice shoes into crappy indoor ones, so everyone's shoes look kind of beaten up when we meet everyone inside :). I'm more suprised at the fact that they didn't research carefully or emphasize more useful Japanese mannerisms, that it is far harder to tell what the Japanese are thinking through body language. They behave differently than Westerners, and many body cues, such as hand gestures, don't apply. The feet gestures, however, are dead on. I find that section useful, but then again it was generally applicable to everybody. As for the book's style, of course, it could have been ghostwritten- it lacked a personal flavor for me that it would have had with an original author. Despite my complaints about its Japanese culture section and writing style, I still give this book a high score. I just found the information fascinating. So many things are being hidden by folks when they talk, but not when they move...it simply blows my mind."

At the time I didn't find it important; but in both personal and professional relationships, body language is crucial in understanding how the other person feels. This book provides a good overview of common body language gestures. I've been told by some, that reading body language can be contradictory. One sign another gives doesn't mean that's how they really feel. Luckily, this book reinforces this cautionary statement by teaching to read body language in clusters and to keep in mind the context in which the body language is given.This book is pretty well laid out in terms of grouping gestures by body part which are by chapter. It makes quick reference a little easier - although I don't feel this book is intended for a reference book. The read itself is really quite quick and easy. Toward the end, there's a self-test chapter to help solidify the knowledgeThe reason why I gave this book one 4 stars is because in some ways, a ""quick guide"" would have been nice. A quick study guide in this only means a smalll chapter recapping all the gestures discussed. A reference, if you will. That could be used to increase the utility of the book to a study guide too."

54,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17486478-aziff,4,"There are many body language books out there but none have I found to be as illustrative, interesting or as informative as this. Body Language explores the subtle physical signs we let out and interprets them in sweeping ways, often using examples (public figures like Bill Clinton) to nail down points. And not only limited to body language, A. Pease also jabs in the usage of external accessories such as spectacles which I found amusing and also enlightening. The sitting arrangement in a meeting, how one positions their arms, where your foot points; these are among the different subject areas this book sheds light on."

Of course it takes some practice to really master the techniques you learn in this book, and you'll be a bit overwhelmed and confused at first...it gets better over time however. With this book you can connect better with people; communicate more effectively, and get across the nonverbal information you really want to convey in a variety of situations, from giving speeches or presentations to being in a job interview. Lot's of VERY valuable information in this book; highly recommended!"

The pictograms,they help a person to understand the idea and analyze body language before they help the reader to translate the situation and analyzed own style.

I think parts are research based but claims like most women are not good at running and accountants don't have good social skills took away some of the book's credibility in my eyes not to mention somewhat insulted me. However, it is a light read, written without a serious tone so it is still worth reading in my opinion."

80,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2928730-luke,2,"The pinnacle of body language study. This book creates a whole tonne of interesting claims regarding our body language and what it means. Whether or not it truly represents our thoughts, people who read this stuff (which is every woman on the planet) are already judging your thoughts based on the way you hug yourself, dart your eyes around or whatever other habit you have.Personally, I enjoyed the book since it gave many insights into behavioural science, which I never knew. A whole host of body language tips have been gained and its best to read these notes again and again so it sticks. -women have a greater number of areas within the brain for evaluating other's behaviors: 14-16 compared to men's 4-6 areas. -when walking down a crowded street a man will pass by a woman w chest towards her but she will pass w chest away to protect her breasts.-when putting on a jacket a man does right arm first woman does left arm first. This is due to man using left side of brain and woman using right side of brain-universal signals include smiling, frowning, nodding, shaking head. The nod is an affirmation signal learned in infancy to display submission. The shake of the head is also learned in infancy when we turn our head from side to side to reject our mother's breast, or an approaching spoon.-as people get older their gestures become more subtle versions of their younger self such as covering the mouth when telling a lie turning into raising finger to mouth and then scratching nose-other lying gestures include defensive body positions, closed palms, contracted pupils, eyebrow lifts, corner of mouth twitches.-displaying one's palms indicates trustworthiness and honesty. Palms shown in the past have meant no weapons or ""this is my allegiance""-palms behind back, crossed arms or in pockets looks untrustworthy. A palm up indication should be used to demonstrate submissiveness or nonthreatening behavior.-couple walking hand in hand, dominant partner walks slightly in front and has palm facing backwards.-palm close finger pointed during conversation indicates beating the listener with a mace-interestingly, an index finger to thumb signal either open or closed fist shows the speaker is thoughtful, goal-orientated and focused-handshake initiation is most common among alphas, 88% of successful senior management execs will go on for the dominant ""upper hand"" handshake position.-some women give a soft handshake to imply submissiveness. This highlights their femininity and implies that domination of her is possible (lol)-counter the power player's palm down handshake by using the double hander and turning the hand upright.-left side advantage: those photographed appearing on the left are seen as more dominant. Also body positioning away from the other person seems to make a big difference too-the double hander: mix with direct eye contact, reassuring smile, confident repetition of the receiver's name, inquiry about receiver's state of health. It shows trust depth and should be used in a situation where a rapport exists.-a real smile can be seen by the crow's feet at the corner of one's eyes-smiles are a sign if submission, and are also contagious. Innocent truth tellers increased their frequency of smiling because they are submitting. Liars will not smile as much. -tight lipped smile sends the message that the smiler has a secret or withheld opinion. Rejection signal!!-average adult laughs 15 times a day. Average child 400 times a day-laughing produces endorphins, which are natural painkillers and make you fell good. You also will get sick less and have a stronger immune system.-Norman cousins self medicated himself with funny movies and outrageous laughter which completely healed his terminal ankylospondylitis. He write about it in ""anatomy of an illness""-laughter has only 15% to do with jokes and funny stories, most is to do with building relationships. The more social a situation is, the more often people will laugh and the longer each laugh will last.-making women in your group laugh at your jokes will likely make men in the group think you are unfunny due to him dominating the conversation and jealousy-toddlers hide from things they are threatened by, when we cross our arms we are also creating a barrier because we feel threatened, uncertain or insecure.-breaking crossed arms: give em something to hold. Ask them if they have a q or an opinion, lean in and extend open palm, then lead back when its their turn to speak-a partial arm cross involving one arm only is similar to a hug from our mothers when we were younger. This is another type of signal that conveys distress or tense.-similar again is the male's protecting of your balls by placing two hands clasped together in front of your zipper.-rich ppl will adjust their watch or cufflink due to insecurity or simply create an arm cross by touching something there such as a cufflink-any movement that involves placing the arm across the body is a sign of nervousness including checking wallet contents, rubbing hands together, clasping hands-arms on armrest is position of power, inside armrest is seen as defeated or weak-lightly touching somebody's elbow or hand is powerful. It works better in countries where touching is not the norm. Above or below the elbow does not give the same result. It is useful when shaking hands.-liars gulp or swallow more frequently-see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil. Any gesture that involves eyes ears mouth or nose may be a deceit or hiding away from what the person thinks is deceit.-when we become excited our pupils dilate up to 4 tines their original size. An angry mood causes pupils to contract to a small beady size.-pupils dilate when we are aroused.-pupil dilation has been used in the past to assess poker hands.-the eyebrow flash is a friendly gesture for greeting-eye widening =submissive-looking up cluster= submissive-orgasm face and body language on girls turns guys on-to build good rapport, your gaze should meet theirs 60 to 70 per cent of the time. When you like someone, you will look at them a lot.-men are better than women at looking for targets over long distances. Women are better at close range and peripheral vision.-women try get a man's attention across a room by holding his gaze for 2 secs and then looking down. -intimate gaze area is the triangle between the two eyes and chest. If you use too early in courting you are giving the game away.-power gaze area is two eyes and third eye triangle. Great for intimidating someone or someone who won't shut up. Especially useful is the power stare - try not to blink, narrow eyes, focus closely. This is what a predator does before it strikes its prey.-extended eye gazing creates intimacy-a person's eye movements indicated what they are thinking: up left (recall picture), down left (talking to oneself), down right (recall feeling)-physiological changes occur when a person steps inside your intimate zone. These changes include increased heart rate, adrenaline release, blood is pumped to the brain and muscles. -to feel comfortable keep your distance but as the relationship increases in intimacy, others will allow us to move closer into their zones.-people on crowded trains are all attempting to mask their emotions. They ate described as miserable or unhappy but really we are describing a blank emotionless face. -feet are hard to control when lying. Often people can control their hands and face but feet twitching and moving are a give away.-open legs display masculinity, closed legs protect masculinity.-68% of dental patients lock their ankles, which increases to 98% during an injection. This represents holding back a negative emotion, fear or uncertainty.-ankle on thigh while sitting is powerful and comfortable look.-slow head nodding indicates listening and interested.-tilting head to one side shows submission, interest and generally smaller. Exposes neck.-hands on hips displays readiness for assertive action. also takes up more space and makes them look dominant.-when someone is using dominant or controlling body language. You can get up close to their personal space to disarm them. -the ""catapult"" - elbows out hands on back of head, ankle on thigh, leaning back or to the side. Indicates a ""know-it-all"" attitude and intimidates most people.-people who feel similar emotions and are likely to be experiencing a rapport, will begin to match each other's body language and expressions. It begins in the womb when our body functions and heartbeat matches the rhythm of our mother. We are therefore naturally inclined to mirror.-when people spend a lot of time together they start to look alike. Same goes with pets. And we often choose pets that look like us.-mirroring someone's body languages tell others that we like them. -mirroring a dominant body language cluster can force the other person to change position to something less threatening.-making the first movements - into a room, body language changes etc - displays leadership.-babies that were largely bottle-fed represent the majority of older smokers and the heaviest smokers. -the body and feet point in the position that the mind wants to go. Look for this when you suspect that the other person does not want to be in the conversation.-men protect their front, women their back. Avoid facing a man directly because you will come across as aggressive, to a woman it will come across as a sexual interest.-crossing the knees toward another person shows a sign of interest or acceptance of that person when sitting down. -foot pointing indicates the person we find most interesting or attractive.-outer genital lips are proportionately same thickness to facial lips. -lipstick mimics the reddening of genitals during sexual arousal. -leaning on something demonstrates your possession of it. Leaning on a wall or doorway can intimidate others.-floor test: hard to reprimand someone when you are lying on the floor and they are standing over you. Reverse the positions and it will be very intimidating.-most powerful position at table is at the head, facing the door.-speech: don't say you're nervous. Use steeple position, open and close palm positions, protruding thumbs and arms unfolded.-68% information retention for those at the middle front. Side front is 58%. Middle middle is 50%. Back side is 28%.-a fire creates comfort and warmth. It recreates the effects of the fire that burned at the ancestral cave feasts.-observers of a person in the first 15 seconds of an interview were asked their impressions of the person and it almost always paralleled that of the interviewer.-researchers in the field of linguistics have shown a direct relationship between the amount of status, power or prestige a person commands, and their vocabulary range. Highly ranked socially and in management positions coincides with increased skill at communication and word choice.-good orators also use less gestures when they speak. Probably due to the fact that their words alone convey their intended meaning.-nine rules for great first impressions at an interview. 1 reception - remove jackets, if possible. Try to carry less into the interview. Always stand in reception. Stand w hand-in-hand behind back, slowly rock back and forth on feet. Or use steeple. 2 the entry - walk in no hesitation, at same moderate speed. 3 approach - smooth motion, put down stuff, shake the person's hand then take a seat. Shows them confidence and that you are not prepared to have your time wasted. 4 handshake - palm straight, match their strength, let the other person decide when to end the shake. Don't shake across a desk. Use person's name twice in first 15 seconds and never speak for more than 30 seconds. 5 sit - if you have to sit opposite, turn seat to 45 degrees or angle your own body. 6 seating areas - not on sinking couch. 7 gestures - fewer gestures. People w power don't move much. Mirror if appropriate. 8 distance - respect their personal space. 9 exit - pack your things calmly and leave sharply after shaking their hand. Make sure the back of your shoes are shined. -if someone keeps you waiting take out a book or make a phone call to shoe that their disorganization is not inconveniencing you. Same goes if there is a lengthy interruption during the interview. -6 positive body language tips: face - animated face, smile regularly (teeth is good). Gestures - be expressive but don't overdo it. Head - triple nods when talking. Head tilt when listening. Keep chin straight. Eye contact - amount that makes people feel comfortable. Posture - lean forward when listening. Stand straight when speaking. Territory - stand where you feel most comfortable. Mirror - make it subtle."

The Definitive Book of Body Language by Allan and Barbara Pease is an international bestseller for a reason. Allan and Barabara are able to use their past experiences and research to engagingly convey their messages of body language. This book covers a wide range of topics, from what handshakes may convey to what head rubs show; it has it all. To complement this information, humorous illustrations are given. The entirety of the book effectively informs the reader about signals they may have been missing all these years or how they should be applied. The Definitive Book of Body Language is a great book. The information this book gives is extensive to the topic. The book covers a wide range of topics relating to how handshakes can show dominance. “Dominance is transmitted by turning your hand so that your palm faces down in the handshake,” (Pease 43). The book further explains this is because in the old Roman times, leaders would essentially greet each other with an arm wrestle which would show who was more powerful. A completely different part of the body that was covered was a head rubbing gesture. When someone does this, it is because they are frustrated or fearful and feel a tingling on the back of their head. The book attempts to explain why this occurs by making an analogy to when a dog raises their fur, “ … goosebumps- attempting to make your nonexistent fur pelt stand on end to make yourself appear more intimidating because you are feeling threatened or angry,” ( Pease 161). The Definitive Book of Body Language covers a spectrum of topics. Another reason why this book is successful is because it has great illustrations to accompany the text. These illustrations are very engaging and fun to view. Multiple photos and drawings are shown throughout the entire book every page or two. This book needs illustrations because they help the reader comprehend exactly what action the book is speaking about. For example, the book doesn’t even describe the figure four leg clamp on page 221. The authors decide to use the visual of it instead, so they can write about what that action shows. “This is a sign of the tough-minded, stubborn individuals who reject any opinion other than their own,” (Pease 221). The book utilizes images because people comprehend information better visually. The last reason why this book is entertaining is because of the humor. The entire book uses humor which is one of the reasons readers are drawn to continue reading. For example, one of the subsections is named, “Why We Laugh and Talk, but Chimps Don’t” (Pease 81). In another section called, “The Permanent Down-Mouth,” (Pease 85) it uses humor to shed light on a more disappointing fact that people who frown are often avoided. To lighten the mood, the authors wrote, “ If you discover that the Down-Mouth has crept into your repertoire, practice smiling regularly, which will not only help you avoid looking like an angry canine in later life, but will make you feel more positive. It will also help you avoid frightening little children and being thought of as a grumpy old cow,” (Pease 85). The humor in this book will make people laugh out loud. The Definitive Book of Body Language is a fantastic book. The combination of information, visuals, and humor make it shine. I would recommend this book to anyone. This book would especially be interesting to people who want to learn what they can do to demonstrate a certain trait. Salespeople and careers requiring negotiations would greatly benefit from this book as well. I rate this book 4 stars."
82,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5065386-wan-faizuddin,3,"In overall, the book is light and easy to read. The words used is simple, there are a lot of photos and illustrations and the author tried to crack some jokes here and there to make this reading not to sound too serious. I took a mere 3 days to read the whole book.This book targets itself for readers who are constantly having human interaction in their daily lives such as politicians trying to get more votes, law enforcers trying to interrogate, managers trying to be in control, business person trying to make sales and deals and even between men and women to assess interests in a relationship. It teaches you to pick up situations when a person says something but his body language is giving away signs that he is feeling or thinking otherwise. Women are more alert in reading body languages than men do.The content includes signals of hand shakes, facial expressions, arm signals, hand and thumb signals, recognizing deception, eye signals, leg signals, personal space, style mimicry and sitting positions. The author also acknowledged about cultural differences and comparison with animal interactions. They even include a special section on how to tackle interviews and also a helpful scenario based test to recap what have you learned throughout your reading.I have mixed feelings about this book. I do learn a lot of new things that I was not aware of. Although the author claims that the contents of this book is evidenced from social experiments, I somehow doubt the authenticity and the reliability of the methods they use for these 'researches'.I am skeptical on how do I apply this new knowledge. After reading this book, I am becoming more aware of my own body language and the body language of others. This book also guides you on how to engage with the situation, by either being assertive, submissive or even it is best to simply walk away. However it makes me feel unnatural to my own body and I tried to consciously manipulate situations to my preferred outcomes. You will up to a point be more judgmental towards others and there are more times that you are aware that you are even more hopeless at controlling situations up to your liking. Humans are manipulable but not always predictable.As my final words, this book touches an interesting new field of interpreting body language that is only being focused in the recent 20th century. This book is far from being perfect as a definitive guideline, but with future revised edition, it will get better and more specific. Read this book if you want to understand yourself better, or even to try to manipulate others. It is a double-edged weapon that is up to you what you are using it for."
83,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59266200-maynerd,3,"It took me FOUR months to finish this book, and I'm not even sure why, haha. It wasn't boring, sometimes decently informative and yet something about it put me off.The writing sounds like two people who think they've unlocked the secret to reading minds. They talk like body language is a legit science, and reading it is one of the most essential skills a person can have, and also all humans are basically apes so it's pretty easy to figure out human beings once you've figured out apes.Women who hold out their wrists out, or hold the 'face platter' are sending out courtship signals and men who sit in the 'figure four' are hostile/competitive.Uh, no.We're far more complex than that, sometimes the book's description of these body positions is exaggerated (clapping on the back of the person you hug does NOT mean you're insincere, face platters are also used to disguise boredom, holding up your wrist can also means you forgetting something, etc, body language is not as black and white as the book can sometimes make it seem). I don't know what people the studies cited have observed (for example the conferences they cited where apparently 90% of the audience assumed the critical face hold, or defensive crossed arms at given cues) because I've never seen such prompt body language exchange in people--and I'm one of the observant sort.To be fair, the book does state in it's intro chapter that body language signals must always be considered in clusters, isolated signals can occur in response to any number of stimuli in the environment (crossed arms could mean a person's just cold, etc). A lot of the information is useful (the kinds of gazes, how to spot a liar, etc), while some just sounds bogus, like the one about why some people wear their sunglasses on their heads, and even the bit about why we laugh.In my approximation,45% of the book is good, proper, useful information (remember to look for clusters!)25% stuff women would consider common sense (maybe some men too)10% nonsense20% super basic, everyone-knows kind of fillers.You're not missing out on a lot by not reading this book. If you do get your hands on it, just read the parts that interest you, not everything is worth reading in there. Best not read it at all actually, so I can always have a slight upper hand over you, lol!I recommend the book to people who've been told their too dense or insensitive, like and men who can't tell the difference between a sincere and insincere smile, and women who don't know when to stop talking. But just remember, look for clusters, and, when clusters aren't always conceivable, body movements can have multiple meanings, don't follow the book word for word."
84,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73700235-madam-j,2,"So, I guess we'll get the first thing out of the way right off the top. The author does not disguise the fact that he has ""no education in psychology, neuroscience, or psychiatry"". He's a musician / insurance salesman who happened to be able to utilize previously understood body language concepts and apply them in such a way that he effectively became a personal salesman- selling himself as an expert on body language.Whether this is good or bad will depend on your intent when reading the book, and your desired outcomes.As a general summary of information that you could Google, this is a pretty good curation of pre-existing information. Where it falls apart for me are the sweeping generalizations, blatant sexism, outdated examples, and quoting of ""studies"", which they do reference, but not in a way that is user-friendly. Additionally, a lot of the studies are outdated and I am highly suspect that even the newer ones are cherry-picked.As a quick reference, and viewed as pop psychology, it would be a quick fill-in for my purposes, which would only be in regards to general character interaction or scene staging.Despite the overwhelming problems, there are some good sections, and a few good ways to deal with space invaders and serial hand shakers. They do also make it a point to repeatedly state that no gesture should be taken in isolation, but that one should look at the ""cluster"" of cues before interpreting what they're looking at.From a proper scientific standpoint, I would take this book with a huge grain of salt, and would not recommend using it as a ""definitive guide"" or ""authoritative guide""."
85,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73781465-benjamin-m-fertig,5,"Excellent and informativeThis book gives an overview of reading nonverbal cues that people give and receive. Learning to interpret clusters of signals can improve social interaction in both business and personal lives. I found this book to be extremely informative and easy to read. It draws on both academic research in psychology and other social sciences as well as the authors’ lifelong careers as business consultants. I learned a lot but not as much as I thought I did based on the scenarios illustrated at the end and the answers provided. Will have to use this book as a general reference and refer back to it in the future. Looking at nonverbal cues has given me a different perspective for looking back on meetings (one on one and group) I’ve had at work and in social situations. Some of the info is a bit outdated - particularly the signals used when smoking at work, which has been a no-no in the US for awhile now. So the book has been useful to me and worth the price. This book may be of interest to anyone in a role working with lots of people, decision makers, and in situations involving negotiation of some sort. One section handles the cues given off by office furniture arrangement. I wish the authors discussed how to better arrange a cubicle which doesn’t have the luxury of space or the option to set how visible it’s occupant is, or it’s location relative to other colleagues/roles. The next thing I need to know is how to read all these cues through videoconferencing, where there are sometimes lags or low resolution or imperfect camera angles and such!"
86,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14219722-edoardo-albert,4,"It’s a shame I didn’t read this book when I was 17. Or indeed 27. I would run through a check list in my mind: Reasonably presentable – check Not actually smelling – check Teeth brushed – check Able to hold a conversation with a member of the opposite sex – well, by 27 I could check that. At 17, no.So why could I not find a girlfriend? By 27 I had quite a few female friends. I actually enjoyed female company. But as for a girlfriend? Not a sniff.Turns out that I was completely clueless about body language. Women might have been signalling to me left, right and under their eyelashes and I wouldn’t have recognised anything other than a large sign held up with the words, “Kiss me now” written on it in capitals. A book on body language would have served me in very good stead back then.Of course, in today’s world, fraught with the consequences of misunderstood sexual signals, a large sign saying, “Kiss me now,” might well be the best way to proceed. Thankfully, I am married – although the book’s been helpful in reminding me to watch out for wifely signals too, although the wonderful woman has long known my blindness to anything less subtle than a flying brick – but I do wonder whether young men and women today can rely on these hard wired body language signs: for the simple reason that sometimes the body wants to do what the mind later regrets.My advice: read the book, then get the invitation in writing first."
87,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104861627-bernard,4,"To understand this book, we need to understand just how complicated the subject matter is.Some people swear by body language and will declare this book to be a tome of wisdom. Others will point out that there are many different interpretations of body language.Here is the perfect example. Crossed arms means closed thinking. Many people will argue that it is more of a comfort pose in times of stress. Which interpretation is correct? The short answer is BOTH. Add in the fact that no gesture can be taken into account without examining the surrounding factors and that everyone has a different interpretation of which factors matter in a given situation and you begin to understand the problem...This book is clear about its interpretations. It glosses over the fact that all of its interpretations seem to be based on college research. It does, however, very vigorously and convincingly advocate for reading body language and just how important it is, since it is MORE than 50% of the message! I am a firm believer that body language matters a great deal. As long as one is willing to be flexible in their approach, body language will help one to understand the entire message. If one tries a one size fits all approach, they are going to get it wrong a lot.With the warning above clearly understood, this book is thorough and well worth reading. "
88,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115781715-zb,1,"About halfway into this book I realized the overt sexism in the authors' understanding of body language. They seem to adhere to strict gender roles that don't necessarily apply in the modern age, and a lot of the analysis of women and gay men is quite offensive. For example, at one point, they write, ""the sight of a woman's thighs is distracting to almost all men and detracts from her message."" Later, they write ""to some men, when a lady says 'no' she means maybe; when she says 'maybe' she means yes; but if she says 'yes' she's no lady."" The misogyny, bigotry, and predatory tone underlying these statements is unacceptable. Additionally, I think the entire book is very repetitive, and at some times, the authors directly contradict something they have said before. It simply does not make them seem credible. Lastly, a lot of their information was not cited to specific studies. Instead, it felt as though they were making arbitrary conclusions based on what they observed in their daily lives. Personally, I didn't find it very compelling. This book is also very angled towards business contexts. I have heard that Joe Navarro's book on body language is much better, so I would suggest buying that instead. Do not waste your money."

Also, those parts that really stand out to individuals can easily be re-read to truly gain the importance of what is being spoken about. You really can take so much from this. The basics of body language people probably think they know. For instance, the typical arms folded & look of boredom. However, this book really exhibits much more detail as to why people do such things & you can take away so much to practice yourself around others or take up a new hobby of people watching & learning a conversations simply by observing & not listening. It is a great read & suitable for any level reader. Those who have less knowledge on anything related to body language can easily follow the context. Additionally, those who seek guidance into the business world or simple engaging more in social scenes can read this book & take away guaranteed new information that can be put to use & aid them in future encounters with other people.Truly recommend!

Anyway, I truly do not understand if what the author was trying to show is whether muslim women are stupid or shy, but all I know for sure is that when they wrote this opinion, they were being incredibely stupid and highly ignorant! Dear Mr. Allan and Mrs. Barbra Pease, I do not blame you for expecting to find a naked woman in a bathtub as you inspect a british, american, or swedish house. But I assure you that Arabs and muslims do not lead disgusting lives and would never even take off their head scarves if they're expecting company! And believe me, YOU wouldn't dare to enter their houses without informing them, because you know you'd be dead! So next time try to be more educated and do not use false, insulting examples that are not even based on personal experience. Also, as you speak about different cultures, have some common sense stick to comparing between countries and do not jump to religions!"

Some of the information may not be totally accurate, for example on the chapter about cultural differences there's a lot of stuff that I found to not be true about my country. The book also presents a lot of the differences between men and women. I found it to be a realistic depiction of how the genders operate but some people may find it sexist. Not sure why, ain't gonna argue either.It's a bulky book but there are lots of illustrations so it's not very tiring to read. Took me a week to finish and most of the stuff I learned will stick with me. The last chapter features a test to check what you've learned and it summarizes the most important tips in one page.Body language is often overlooked but there's a reason they say that actions speak louder than words. Reading the body language to understand how the other person is feeling really feels like a super power.Highly recommended!"
92,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1487102-doni,4,"Its strength is also its weakness. The authors talks very authoritatively, as if there is never any uncertainty about what someone's body language means. At first this is off-putting, especially when they make claims about biological differences between men and women's brains and also that nodding of the head is an inborn behavior consistent across cultures. Much later, they admit there are more complexities such as the Indian tendency to waggle heads sideways as a means of nodding. They catalogue so many bodily indications of negativity, that it seems it would be hard to avoid expressing this unless one were to keep hands spread wide with palms up. There was little room for subtlety or uncertainty. That said, the authoritative tone became quite convincing. The extent of information offered in this book could be quite overwhelming. So, I would take what the authors claim with a grain of salt, which they don't seem to make allowances for. But I also think this book is worth reading."

The authors explained the body language in a very simple manner with illustrations to deliver the idea clearly. The book is divided to small chapters, of which each has description, examples, illustrations, and a summary. It is so stunning to be able to understand people when they do not speak, via their movements and gestures. Its a bit difficult to be conscious to control your body language when you do not want to be understood by others, and at the same time to focus on others body language and what is happening in the surroundings at the same time, however by going through the book you will notice yourself progressing and it'll be a fun subject for you.A great book that I recommend it very much."

It's an interesting insight into the hidden meanings behind certain gestures, stances and micro-expressions, but I think only worthwhile reading for a low-level awareness of the language of the body. I would warn people off trying to reverse engineer good social interactions via replicating positive body language and steer them toward doing genuine work on their emotions, beliefs, relationships and life (in general) in order to manifest positive signals naturally and honestly. However, you may find this book helps you confirm someone is flirting with you or point out a behavioural habit worth stopping that's turning people off (no-one should ever give a crusher-handshake!). If anything people should practice becoming more present in their day-to-day life, observe people, try to 'feel inside' them and hypothesise about their emotional-state or contextual situation from that and see if they gain understanding in an embodied way."

He took the hint, read the book from cover to cover, and put his newfound skills to use to see if the girl liked him. She was sending him every signal the book covered to say she WASN'T interested in him romantically. While disappointed, he was so impressed at her elaborate way of saying that she wasn't interested that he wasn't even mad. He then recommended the book to me because there was a guy I liked. I used the book to discover that the guy WAS interested in me, so I summoned up all my courage and told him I had feelings for him.Long story short, it turned out my friend's girl was actually interested after all and hadn't even read the book herself - she just thought it sounded like a book he'd like.

The book is filled to the top with examples of the knowledge applied to different scenarios, allegedly in an astounding number of different countries and cultures. I give it 3 stars due to the fact that a relevant amount of quoted studies are not convincing enough, and in fact, the way in which they rely solely on seemingly invented studies to make themselves trustworthy makes it even more difficult to blindly consider their numbers/facts as 100% reliable.Overall 3/5"

However, it suffers from an outdated form of delivery that is no longer considered sufficient for a learned reader. That said, I think it is the most comprehensive source for this kind of information I've come across. It still beats reading an online article about the same topic.

Allan and Barbara Pease have done an excellent job bring body language to a mass audience. Now I have better understanding on how to portray positive (and sometimes negative) signals in a range of contexts - be it at work, church, home or social."

Body language is one such area where sometimes we say something but our body unknowingly gives out subtle contrary signs. If we can read some one like a book, who wouldn't love to first guess other people. FBI interrogators and Leaders are really good at this game."

It has some good advice (eg. how to do a good handshake) but I am fed up with how condescending and objectifying it is. To be fait, it objectifies everyone, with the end result that it comes off as sexist and racist and classist. It is gender essentialist to the extreme, and though iirc it does mention homosexuality once or twice, it largley ignores the existence of queer and disabled folks.Most damingly, though, IT DOES NOT CITE ITS RESEARCH. It says ""research shows"" quite a lot, but doesn't say what research, or where, when, or who conducted it, unless it is research specifically conducted by the authors. Ugh."

The book is made from short paragraphs from career long observations, bodily gesture analysis and descriptions. Full of illustrations, photos for better understanding of specific gesture.Rating this book is hard. Nothing outstanding yet an essential must read to better oneself. Book has stood the test of time. Nothing thought provoking yet oftentimes you’ll find yourself in “ah, this is obvious, how have I not noticed it before?”, “I knew about it just didn’t pay enough attention” situations.Conclusion: 4 out of 5 stars. A genuinely enthralling read that’s helpful in everyday situations. Short chapters, full of illustrations and e.g. for gestures. Easy and helpful. The author kept cross-referencing other works of his, which gets annoying at points. Also, reading from cover to cover was very monotonous as many gestures and things seem obvious.

Be alpha.What are three action items I learned that I need to implement as soon as possible?All kinds of ways to see incongruence although lying is difficult to detect you can avoid obvious lying.What else did I like about the book?You can observe results immediately - you become observant and socially suave - if you simply internalize good body language.Which other books or movies were mentioned or recommended?A ton.What were the most memorable quotes?""Selling gave me the opportunity to meet people and study them at close range and toevaluate whether they would buy or not, simply by watching their body language. This skill also proved a bonanza for meeting girls in discos. I could nearly always predict who would say 'yes' to a dance with me and who wouldn't. I joined the life insurance business at the age of twenty, andwent on to break several sales records for the firm I worked for, becoming the youngest person to sell over a million dollars' worth of business in my first year. This achievement qualified me for the prestigious Million Dollar Round Table in the USA. As a young man I was fortunate that the techniques I'd learned as a boy in reading body language while selling pots and pans could be transferred to this new area, and was directly related to the success I could have in any venture involving people.""""Albert Mehrabian, a pioneer researcher of body lan-guage in the 1950s, found that the total impact of a message isabout 7% verbal (words only) and 38% vocal (including toneof voice, inflection and other sounds) and 55% non-verbal.""""Like Mehrabian, he found that the verbal component of aface-to-face conversation is less than 35% and that over 65%of communication is done non-verbally. Our analysis of thou-sands of recorded sales interviews and negotiations during the1970s and 1980s showed that, in business encounters, bodylanguage accounts for between 60 and 80% of the impactmade around a negotiating table and that people form 60 to80% of their initial opinion about a new person in less thanfour minutes. Studies also show that when negotiating over thetelephone, the person with the stronger argument usuallywins, but this is not so true when negotiating face-to-face,because overall we make our final decisions more on what wesee than what we hear.""""If you've ever visited a fortune teller you probably came awayamazed at the things they knew about you — things no one elsecould possibly have known — so it must be ESP, right?

The authors make a lot of generalizations that are sexist and optimized for more formal, hierarchical organizations. As a female at a tech company, a good portion of the book was irrelevant. As such, I found a lot of their conclusions given a set of body cues to be oversimplified and misleading. That said, their focus on how different actions may be interpreted made me think more about how I present myself and how I can communicate most effectively. As my first foray into body language, this book gave me a set of tools to better decode and intuit people in complex situations and I found their grounding of some behaviors in evolution fascinating and an interesting way to think about our natural behavior."

After reading the book I realized I was always using my index finger while talking and I was always coming up aggressive while introducing myself to strangers.I also especially liked the part where they talk about improving boss to employee relationships through re-arranging boss's office to be more welcoming.I like how the authors cover all the social situations where reading the person's body language may be beneficial and provide examples from their professional life of how they improved their client's social standing by improving their body language. This ranges from politicians to managers in corporations.The only beef I have with this book is the overall use of outdated Freudian psychology. For example, Hitler kept his hands in front of him on certain photos because he was embarrassed by the fact that he has one testicle, or that smokers smoke because they weren't breastfed as babies.If you manage to disregard the stupidity of those evidence-less statements, I guarantee you will find the rest of the book quite useful."

Pease is a funny guy too. What annoyed me was the quiz in the end. You are given little drawings and you need to count your points for each. Basically to detect what is going on on the picture. Which is fine. But you get points (or you don't get them) for things that are not even possible to see. Example: there was a drawing I didn't get points for because it said ""his feet are pointing towards there, he wants to leave"". But there was no feet on the drawing-you could only see guys torso. "

It's a book that I see myself reading over several times, both to refresh what I've learned, to pick up details I missed the first time, and to focus on improving my nonverbal communication in several steps.First step, supplied entirely from this book: I'll never again sit down while waiting, and I'll always stand with my hands behind my back or with my thumbs hooked in my pockets / waistband. Those two things convey confidence and value, say the authors, and just tinkering with it definitely filled me with those feelings as I stood that way.I'll definitely retain this book in my library.Some quick notes:* If you're sensitive to talk about sex roles / differences between the sexes, you're not going to like this book. Not one bit. The authors (a husband-and-wife team) make it clear that as much as we might tout equality, there are simple physiological and innate psychological differences that affect how we relate to one another.* The book is organized in short chapters, each focusing on a given part of the body or specific circumstances: Stance, office layout, eyes, courtship, legs, etc. Each chapter is short, concise and full of useful information.* The authors make several factual claims -- for example, about how a given behavior was formed in our ancestors, or (again) differences between the sexes -- without directly citing evidence; some of this can come off as spurious. (In fairness, there is a reference section at the end that cites well over 100 sources.)* The authors often note where the interpretation of body language differs between cultures. This is especially notable for hand and head gestures, which are noted at the start of the book.* There's some cross-selling of the couple's other books within this text. It's not obtrusive, however, and I'm half of the mind to go ahead and read more of what they have to say (were it not for my already ludicrous backlog of unread books).* The authors greatly enjoy puns. Their humor can run just a bit uncouth. Again, hypersensitive people are probably best off not reading this book."

It is simple, to the point and the illustrations helped a lot in understanding. Also loved how they designed the book to be opened and read at almost any page at random which would help afterwards if you want to check a certain topic.On the other hand, I disliked the idea of using the evolutionary theory and comparing us to apes in order to explain some of the human gestures as I believe it's unimportant and wasn't convincing enough in most of the cases. However, this accounts a small part in the chapter so you may skip it..Adding to this, I found that the authors tried to keep it simple that you may find yourself familiar with many. Furthermore, sometimes the tips weren't reliable, but it was helpful anyways for a beginner.Finally, I'll have to mention that this book has a side effect; you'll be under some pressure for being more self-conscious and watching others' moves which is kinda disturbing but it's fine when you get used to it.Understanding the body language is very important to the humans' relationships so don't hesitate to get this book and find yourself some tips for leaving good first impressions and others for giving presentations."

The other 70% is made up of the non verbal signals and gestures that come from the rest of the body (in other words body language). Assuming this to be true, it's therefore important for anyone interested in communicating effectively to fully understand the implications of body language and learn how to use it to effectively interact with all types of people.  The Definitve Book Of Body Language by Allan and Barbara Pease is the international bestseller on the subject of body language and therefore a good place to start. The first 100 pages of the book are great and a journey of discovery into the the world of body language, with every page revealing something new. Many of the points made are logical and obvious if thought about hard enough but it is still fascinating to read how the way we use our body in everyday situations can be interpreted and ultimately influence the outcome of our interactions with others.   The book uses a number of real life examples to highlight the points it makes, some of which provide a shocking insight into events and situations of the past 10 years. One example that springs to mind and thta is regularly referred to in the book is that of Bill Clinton when he was going through the scandal of his affair with Monica Lewinski. The book manages to pin point various moments during that time where the body language of the former US president communicated a resounding ""I did it"".  After the first 100 pages the book becomes a little bit repetitive and was more of an obligation than a pleasure to finish. Nevertheless I would still recommend it to anyone interested in communicating effectively, whether it be to better manage business situations or to attract more women. During the two weeks I was reading the book I became very ware of both my own and other people's body language and a number of the lessons taught in the book I still use on a regular basis. "
257,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22374205-steven-lijnden,4,"Only a small percentage of communication is done through words. Most meaning is transmitted by the way we say things – inflection, tone – and through body language. Unfortunately, this body talk is a lot more open to interpretation, on both the sending and the receiving side and can get confusing if people come from different cultures. If somebody holds up his fingers in a V sign, he is signalling victory to some people, while being very rude to others.There are those who have a natural knack for the subtleties of non-verbal communication, more instinctive than conscious, which gives them a distinct advantage on all social fronts, be it at home or at work. But by becoming more aware of how we carry ourselves and what signals we are sending and receiving, it is possible to be a little more suave and persuasive. Allen and Barbara Pease give their readers some useful pointers to this effect in their book The Definitive Book of Body Language: How to Read Others’ Attitudes by Their Gestures.It’s a fast and funny read – though not always as funny as the authors intend it to be – and centres mostly on body language for business purposes. There are fascinating facts in here for everyone – though some might leave you a bit sceptical – and, as is often the case with reader-friendly social science books, sometimes things seem oversimplified. Also, the Peases suggest several practical and entertaining social experiments that I wouldn’t advise trying on hapless friends, since you might end up real lonely, real fast.The authors delight in pointing out the differences between men and women, the men turning out to be fairly deficient when it comes to reading body language. The emphasis on man vs. woman should come as no surprise, since they previously devoted a book to it:Why Men Don’t Listen and Women Can’t Read Maps: How We’re Different and What to Do about It. Both books provide information and entertainment in equal measure and just might improve your life.www.popcultjunk.com"

It shows how different signals are used and who uses them. The book shows the different types of movement people make without even knowing it. It gives examples of when someone is saying one thing with their words and something else with their body language. The Definitive Book of Body Language also shows how to act around people of different cultures. I learned that people of different cultures interpret hand gestures differently from country to country. It also explains how to get an edge in an interview and how to feel more comfortable around others. The book uses pictures and words, like a picture book to fully explain what the text is trying to say. It also has activities in the back of it so that if you want to practice it you can. The authors, Allan and Barbara Pease, do a great job of explaining everything that they talk about in the story. They have proof behind it with scientific tests and lots of data to analyze from surveys on humans. The book was very good and was interesting. You can apply everything you learn in this book into your life. One quote gives an example of when someone is lying, what they do. It states, ""The hand covers the mouth as the brain subconsciously instructs it to try to suppress the deceitful words that are being said"" (Pease 148). This quote is one of numerous examples of the book telling the reader what someone will do without even knowing it. Another quote that tells the reader something that people show with their body language when with others. It says, ""Mirroring the other person's body language and appearance shows a united front and doesn't let either get one-up on the other"" (Pease 253). This quote shows again how the book does a great job talking about people's body language and how it's a very useful tool for someone if they can understand it."

Everyone could discover the underlying thoughts and emotions of others by interpreting their body language. This book guides you how to crack peoples gestures and thereby reveal their true intentions.We get to know what others are thinking while speaking, whether they are lying, Whether they are interested in talking with us, Whether he or she is attracted towards us, Is there a love sign or power play while talking. The book even explains in both gender perspective because the body signals, gestures, openness, personal space and evaluation tactics are different in men and women.   How to crack whether a girl is interested in you or how to interpret whether a men is flirtatious are clearly depicted in this book. The major advantage is that each page of the book consist of several pictures to convey the idea clearly. It helps to read further with much interest and helps in greater absorption.  Once we mastered the skills of interpreting body language of others we could reap success in interviews, negotiation, debates, meetings and conferences. Body language interpretation enhance our confident level to a greater extent and we could always bond quickly with others and can create a very good and positive impression on others.  What People say is very often different from what they think or feel. If we can disclose their intentions and feeling and act accordingly we could be successful.  I enjoyed reading this book as the authors wrote each page with funny narration and pictorial representations. I suggest this book for everyone who is interested in the word Body Language . This international bestseller is truly a collective reference guide for all the non verbal communicative cues.The Definitive Book of Body Language. My rating 5/5Regards Anish Antony"

As a teenager I thought this book was close to revolutionary, like it would give me that secret edge to decoding people and getting my first kiss from a girl. Rereading it as an adult and I realise that this book isn't revealing essential and hidden knowledge at all. It does function as a much needed tool to remind the reader of our composure and it's effect, however if I wasn't so lazy I could most likely have inferred a lot of what the book teaches by simple observation. Let me not be so ungrateful as the book decodes a lot of body language for us time poor humans, and does a job that us brainiacs aren't necessarily incapable of, but lack the patience to actually pursue. This book is very much a starting point for people who want to become more 'social conscious'. Sadly I was hoping that because I've aged that if I read it with my new found wisdom gathered through ageing that I would be able to (with a little or lot of) focus be able to improve the relationships in my life. It falls far short of this mark, and if you want it to actually be a life changing read then you need to find more texts to read which aren't so simply written for the peasants. And you probably also need to be a bit less like I am, a lazy person that stays at home to often, and more of a go-getter who actually forces themselves in to new situations with the tenacity to reflect and learn from them as well. I fail not just for believing a book could motivate me to be more successful socially, but also for being stupid enough to equate socialising to a text in the first place."

But does that stop us self-appointed socioanalysists who picked up the book in the first place? No!tDBoBL explores and defines meaning of a wide range of vocab in body language, including hand gestures, standing/sitting stances, eye movement, personal space, perceived height, and seating arrangement. I'm always hesitant to accept writing so openly sure of its own accuracy, but there were a number of of obscure things discussed that I found true (like how short people are often frequently interrupted in a seated group of people--until they stand up). Social experiments are my way of enjoying too much company, so if the book was worth anything, it is a particularly intriguing set of practices to try to observe and correlate rationale when stuck in a crowd. And to try out to see the difference in reaction.There were plenty of photographs and illustrations, which make the book far more understandable, and faster to read. The writing is concise, and is quite entertaining, especially when analyzing some famous photographs.I'd recommend this to those who would enjoy a very easy sociology read, those who'd like to be more aware of how they come across/other signal through body language vs. speech, or those like me who are on just on a quest to try to figure people out :)"

It’s something that most of us pay very little attention to, and if we did, we would have noticed a lot of things about the people around us. This book talks about body language in great details. It describes, sometimes with the aid of images, different body shapes and gives their significance. It is not, however, a list of shapes. The book aims to build a model in our heads, which we can use to analyze the way the person we’re talking to is seated, the way they’re looking at us, and the way they’re moving their limbs, among other things, to decide how they are feeling, and maybe even predict what they are going to say.I don’t like books like these sometimes because they sound like a cookbook for life and such a thing definitely does not exist. However, this particular book did not sound like that. It did have some parts that suggest that everything is so easy and that you can crack a human’s mind by doing so and so, but I found this to be rare, and not even very strong; a positive aspect in this book.I do recommend this book, especially to those who deal with customers (Actually, to everybody who deals with other humans face to face on a continuous basis, so all of you!). If you cannot read the non-verbal language, then you surely have been missing a lot. "

The book is very up-front about the limitations and difficulties involved with obtaining useful information about body language and I think that the more practical insight that can be going from a book about this involves you being able to manage what signals you are putting out, as opposed to reading other people. I only frame it that way because being able to read other people consistently would clearly take allot of effort on the part of the reader and would involve multiple readings and allot of practice. Paying attention to what you are doing with your own body and knowing what is going inside yourself and then making changes to your own body language...seems to be a much more realistic goal for most people. A book like this should be required reading for anyone that is required to give lectures or speak to large groups of people. There is valuable information in this book that could make you aware of the most effective ways to communicate with an audience, as well as how to glean cues from the crowd on how you are doing at getting through to them. This information would allow a presenter to ""read"" a crowd and shift appropriately to ensure the audience perceives the present well and gets the most out of the experience."

I'll grant that it has some useful ideas about reading body language, but they're nearly impossible to suss out from the conjecture, sexism, overstated claims, and outright falsehoods. Even the formatting is terrible, with ""summaries"" that don't always summarize and subsection headings that have the same font as the section headings.Some of the most egregious examples: 1) Violent crime rates in cities are blamed exclusively on crowding (causing intrusions into personal space) mere pages after evidence is offered that people in cities have smaller personal space requirements than those in suburban or rural areas. 2) The authors state explicitly that the hands are farther away from the brain than the chest. 3) Single examples are offered up repeatedly as evidence of universal trends. 4) Quiz answers at the end refer to things in the pictures that clearly aren't there.I guess these authors must be masters of manipulating people with body language, because that's the only way I can imagine this book ever got published."

The book is well-structured and each chapter and most sub-chapters are summarized. It really increased my awareness of my and other's body language.The message of the authors on learning body language is it is the way the body unconsciously expresses the things we do not speak (thus when we're lying or simply thinking about something, our body will express the truth). Accordingly, they argue that it is good for someone to study body language to become aware of their own and other's body language such that they can communicate effectively (e.g. adjusting your message based on the other person's body language).Although, if its true the body will always find a way to express the truth I hardly doubt one will be able to 'suppress' their body language. Maybe it will become more subtle, but won't the body always find a way to display the truth? As the authors note, the best liars are those who deserve Oscars."

Usually, such books don’t have scientific valid information, but this one is filled with studies and experiments. Some of the information were shocking, other weren’t. This is basically the manual for communication that we’ve been looking for. Here are some of my favorite parts: “Artists, musicians, surgeons and those whose occupation is delicate and involves use of their hands generally prefer not to shake hands.”“Smile constantly. Everyone will wonder what you’ve been up to.”“Men are equipped with a form of tunnel vision that makes them far better than women at seeing directly in front of them.” “Women’s peripheral vision extends to at least 45 degrees to each side, above and below, which means she can appear to be looking at someone’s face while, at the same time, she’s inspecting their goods and chattels.” “People described as ‘cold’ and ‘cold fish’ are usually also physically cooler than people because their blood is drawn into the leg and arm muscles for the ‘fight or flight’ response created by tension.” "

For example, folding hands indicates a person is covering his body from something he wants to avoid or something doesn't want to be a part of. Basics like this will help even amateurs to get on board with a complex subject with ease.Many of the examples given in the book have 'office' connotations, like interview tips, business meetings or even casual talk with your colleagues. They are just as applicable to outside office environment.There are gesture comparisons between women and men throughout the book that are truly impressive. This helped me better understand the opposite sex.The book provides a ton of information and if you are someone new to this subject (like me), don't expect to get most of it with only one reading.

There are many pictures/photographs used throughout this book depicting universal body language signals.This book also has an interesting section on seating arrangements/office set-ups, the signals these arrangements can send and then gives specifics on how to arrange seating according to the type of meeting one wishes to hold.I teach communication courses and this book is always one of the books I put on the recommended reading list.If you want an excellent resource book on body language then this book is well-worth reading."

Please note that the body language interpretations by these authors is only correct as a whole and on average. Just because someone crosses their arms doesn't mean their defensive; it could be because that's the way they want to naturally place their arms or maybe it's because that's where their arms are comfortable. I liked this book because it taught me a lot more than what I was expecting and it was an easy painless read. It was humorous at times. Long lengths of text were accompanied by images or photos to help reading go by faster and painlessly. I also liked that the authors kept referring to body language locally and outside the US. If not I'd be worried that many Americans would read this book and think ethnocentrically that body language in the US is the same everywhere on the planet. Good jobI may consider picking up other books by them.

I found myself focusing more on the other person body langauge than actually listening and being present, I always considered what I will have to say next based on the body language of the other person or group of people, which is something I dont usually do and is exhausting. Although the context is correct, sometimes we just cant figure out why someone would make such gestures, we can't read their minds, for all we know he might have been thinking about pizza while we were discussing world war 3. I won't change my rating for the book, it offers rich insight, it helps you build up little confidence, its how you use it that matters"

You must weed through the chaff to get to the wheat, so to speak...It is a long book, but has heaps of pictures and drawings so you can get the essence of what they are describing. What I got out of this book was the ability to now be more aware of all body language including my own and what signals we send with body language, and to remember we are always communicating. As well I had some good reminders of things.I would suggest this would not be a great Kindle book. I recommend if you want to get a good overview of body language, but know, in advance, that a lot of the material you will know already, and that there is a lot you will have to skim over.Cheers, M"
277,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46917424-rami,5,Almost halfway through it. It is a good useful book and I will definetely skim it again and take some notes. The writer appears to be very American and very Republican in his examples though.Edit: Just finished it. I am going back through it to make a bullet point summary of all the main points. A great book to start deciphering social/business interactions.

I'd say that the book gave me an idea about the items but they came about it in a way that I thought was interesting (yet vague) - they talked about how animals use their body language to communicate various things. A lot of the book talked about how our bodies do things subconsciously. It was quite unsettling to think that our bodies literally have a mind of their own but as soon as I started looking at my body language (in recent days) I'd have to say I think there's at least an ounce of truth in it (no matter how much I don't like it).Well, that, and I've been having conversations lately about things that came from the book, so it at least provides some good conversation starting material!"
279,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/942820-umugaba,4,"I have read: La synergologie, this is an addition to the body language books than I am reading.70% of our communications is based on body language, I enjoyed reading the books and I am certainly understanding people around me in a better way. I can come up to you and say one thing but the way I hold myself saying that one thing tells more about what I want to say than the actual words than I am using. Being a good communicator is one my main goal, this book helped a lot. ex. the hand shake: in business relationship, I am now aware of who to trust, who not to, who to be careful with based on the hand shake alone, then I will observe the rest of the conversation to either confirm or infirm the initial assumptions. Careful not to take quick conclusions is golden. what I like the most is being in a meeting and watch the interaction of the participants, it's amazing."

I'm reading it pretty slowly due to other things taking my attention, but every time I read it I take some good knowledge from it and use it in an everyday situation. For instance, I was quickly able to tell when a female co-worker was feeling uncomfortable around another male in a group meeting. I even realized why she was feeling uncomfortable as he was being agressive, but not in a very direct manner. Women pick up on these things much more than men do and before I read this book I wouldn't have noticed either as being an issue. I was also able to tell when a co-worker was lying to me more than once... While I did not confront him, it gave me the ability to work around him and get my job done. I have also been paying close attention to people's handshakes, as well as mine. This book is just awesome."
281,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9961919-jon,4,"A pretty nice overview of different types of body language that one might not otherwise be aware of. That it, reading this has converted me from not just having a general impression of how people are acting/feeling, but lets me point to particular aspects of their behavior indicating what they think. This makes it a lot easier to determine what's going on in situations that might otherwise be a bit hard to read.Although the authors include a fairly long list of references, I would have preferred for the particular pieces of evidence to be placed where they're relevant in the text itself. As it is, most of the advice comes across as really handwavy, and it's not clear how much it can be relied upon versus how much of it is just a placebo effect where I _think_ I understand the body language but really it's just me being overconfident because I see a few signals in the book."

I appreciate a need for this kind of book but it wasn't always what I needed. The meanings behind each tell was also concretely stated while I learned in the other book I read that such set meanings really aren't practical - most people aren't specifically feeling one thing just because they use that move, it's more a range.The way tells cluster wasn't as well explained in this book and as a result each movement stands as out some specific idea when in reality people use them all together. It's not that he didn't express that this happens so much as it wasn't explained as well ass the other book I read. I liked the greater depth they went into explaining different positions and movements though that the other book didn't get into."
283,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5887368-ernest,1,"To the extent that this book made me more conscious of my own body language when communicating to others and caused me to be (more) aware of other people’s body language when I have a reaction to what they are communicating, this book had value. However, I generally found the book to be simultaneously both too vague in its broad, sweeping assertions and too specific in what it claims minute nuances of body language mean, are based on and project. As such, much of the book came across as too much based on the authors’ own beliefs, especially of the reasons of certain behaviours, rather than based on research and conclusions. I do appreciate that this is not an academic text (there were references given at the back) and that there is some good material in there. Yet it is not worth the effort to read through that much mediocre dross to find the limited gems."
284,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3350394-quin-herron,3,"I'm interested in language, generally speaking, and while body language remains on the periphery of modern psychology (probably because people continue to make needlessly outrageous claims about it) I was looking for a broader understanding of the topic. This book stared at me from the bookstore shelf and I recently picked up a copy, albeit an older edition.While it did give me the vocabulary I was looking for, I was mostly distracted by the writing style, which seemed geared toward people who had zero empathy and wanted to learn body language so they could maintain control of a business situation. There's probably a much more technical version of this book out there written for counsellors or psychologists, but I doubt it would be quite as accessible. I'm glad I've finally got this one checked off."

Ever since, I formed the habit of observing people's non-verbal language in conversations and public speaking. As the name suggests, the book is a comprehensive introduction into body language - what we often neglect but also very important indicators of mood, emotions and motives. The book is divided into sections about different groups of body language: posture (including sitting and standing), eye movement, hand gesture, leg and feet, etc. With simple graphic illustrations and real photographs of famous people, the book explains and analyzes the historical contexts and ""hidden messages"" behind the photographed body language. I highly recommend this book for everyone, as a foundational course in body language. "
286,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35492067-sian,4,"I liked this book. The information covered was very "" things you didn't know you knew"" to me. You see these things every day and know in an unspoken gut type way what they mean but to see them explained and illustrated by pics of real life instances on page was illuminating to me. Now I ""see"" people communicating via body language like Ive never seen before. Some of the things talked about such as hooking the thumbs in the waistband of pants, I thought to myself, I never see anyone do that, maybe in a cowboy movie but then the next time I went to the grocery store there it was, 2 male employees displaying these dominance behaviors. I was surprised. I'm definitely paying more attention to these things than before. The book is somewhat elementary, I'm sure there are much more finely detailed analytic's on the subject but for the lay person it was pretty good. "
287,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1154545-stacey,1,"I'm sure there are other books out there that contain the same or similar insight into and information about body language. This one seemed to be geared toward an audience with a very short attention span; very redundant, summaries at the ends of chapters; ""sayings"" that repeat what has already been said in a very mundane, interrupting sort of way; bad layout... The book was just not an enjoyable read.The information itself can be very valuable, but I think this book is particularly relevant to a small section of society (those in marketing) and some of the information, especially the historical foundation for some gestures and 'sentences' seemed to be pulled out of thin air, without any real research supporting the historical reference."
288,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1355576-myth,4,"This book was easy to read, clear and there were even visual aids. It's like a manual and doesn't weigh you down with information you won't remember or use. There's the added authenticity of their own experiences in coaching people, as well as take examples from studies. Because it's a book based on observed behavior there are times when stereotypes play a major role. I found myself uncomfortable with some of the stereotypes, seeing as I know people who don't fit. I myself do not fit the typical stereotype. I assume that's because of a ""learning disorder"" I have that would make my thinking process differ from the norm.Aside from not relating to the stereotypes, it was an informational read and will be a useful tool.

It's funny, could be teaches you and gives you information about people and their life, also when they are honest or liar. You will think while talk to someone or look at him.Body Language is an interesting subject. It's some times we should pay very little attention when someone is talking to us, It's important to know something about people around us.Now I always feel that true if any body set front of me or talk to me. I have Problem with this, butI used to it. I recommend every body needs to read this book. "
290,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647306-ben,4,"It was a book jam packed with tip after tip of useful body language signals. It makes a person aware of his own body language as well as others. This is not a simple sit down read the book and go to work. It is a slow time consuming process to use what the book is about. We often see people and never think twice as to what we are really seeing. Just like Sherlock Holmes was a master of the secret unseen world,we to can be if we put the information to use that is in the book. Each chapter is a different avenue to explore. The basics, male and female differences, courtship, handshakes, and a test in the final chapter to help you learn what you just read. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in this subject area. Humor and illustrations help make this book an enjoyable read. "
291,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6133676-riki-skutt,4,"First of all, it was a very interesting book to read. I don't know if everything I read was completely accurate, but it sounds probable. Considering that there were so many body gestures/movements that were gone over in this book, it would be difficult to remember everything or even a majority of this information. I think a great way to read this book would be to read it through once, then go back to any sections that you may have forgotten information from later. The organization and layout of the book was well done. There are pictures to go with passages, and chapters are broken into certain types of body language (hands, feet, facial expression, etc.) As I don't like to read fiction at all, I enjoyed this book a lot."
292,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10993216-josh-meadows,5,"Very good book. It is written in a way that is easy to understand, and yet it is still interesting. When one begins to study body language it can be difficult because some gestures don't have obvious connections to their emotional implications. This book, however, goes very in depth when explaining the causes and effects of certain gestures and expressions. I found that the origins of some of the gestures we make were really interesting: physiological, instinctual, and even cultural reasons. Your interest is kept as the book is humorous throughout, which is something that is pretty rare in the behavioral psychology/sociology genre. All in all, this book is great, and it is worth many rereads."

Just by applying some of the techniques, I feel more confident in normally stressful situations. I never knew that when you carry yourself a certain way, you actually can cause yourself to feel better or worse because your brain responds to that. For example, you cross your arms during a conversation as a self protecting and guarding mannerism. You send these unconfident signals to the other person, and also to your own brain! Maybe this guarded stance feels comfortable, or perhaps because you feel guarded and uncomfortable, this stance is comfortable to those feelings! That was a lightbulb moment for me. Just by not letting myself use guarded gestures, I automatically feel more confident and self assured. Great book!"
296,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1436646-ethan,4,"This may not be the most scientific book on nonverbal communication, but it has some great content. A lot of this stuff is common sense (yes, we know that crossed arms mean that the person isn't listening) but there's a lot of stuff that may not be obvious, such as how to sit/stand when talking to people. The eye contact stuff is also interesting (I'm going to have to try and stare at someone's forehead someday to see if it freaks them out).I know that a lot of the evidence in this book is anecdotal and definitely doesn't apply to everybody, but the big takeaway for me is that more than half of communication occurs nonverbally -- so observing someone can be just as important as listening to them. Fascinating stuff. I'll probably read more books on this subject."
297,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23929266-emir-omeragic,4,"A very good and useful book. The thing which I liked the most about this book is the amount of information offered. The authors described body language of the whole body and in different situations. I was very surprised with the amount of negative body language I had myself before I read this book. I immediately applied some of the body language, and still I'm working on the major aspects of positive gestures. Remember: never cross your arms and always smile :) .Anyone who want to improve his/hers social skills, I recommend this book. To those who already read it (including my self), I recommend reading it again. There is too much info there to be remembered after one time reading. Also I recommend making notes, which I've already done.My rate: 4.5"

So, I have to admit, I've never had a conscious acknowledgment of body language. I needed this book because I work with a more sensitive group and I need to be aware of when I make them unhappy or uncomfortable. This book was very helpful. It had some ""well duh"" moments, but the majority was helpful facts and I appreciated the practice ""problems."" It would be even more helpful paired with a cd or youtube videos. I kind of wish it focused more on office culture and communication and less on sales, since that is my problem area. But I understand that is where the Pease family comes from and what they know. I plan to follow this up with another book written by an FBI agent. "

The language is simple and very suitable and interesting for a teen like me. Before reading this book I wasn't really into body language but now I'm very very interested in body language. The book shows you the basics of body language. It makes you learn how to present something, when to talk and when to shut up, when to invade someone else's life and when to not, how to make somebody open up for you, understand what people want to really do and many other things.I'm not good at writing reviews.. but I'm good at recommending books.. and I absolutely recommend this book for you people. Yes, I'm young but trust me, you'll like this book."
