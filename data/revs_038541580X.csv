0,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg,3,"When is a math book not a math book? How about when it's a biography, or a history of the early Cold War years? Clocking in at 278 pages, this book is sort of three books in one. It's kind of a look at Game Theory. Sometimes it's a biography of John Von Neumann, and then at other times it's a primer about early Cold War paranoia and the beginning of the arms race. All three are pretty interesting subjects, and they are intertwined in ways that are fairly obvious (or at least fairly obvious if one reads the dust jacket), but unlike real brand Oreo's with their carefully calculated ratio of filling to cookie, this book is more like a cheap store brand that is skimpy on the filling and all about the cookie. That's fine, but it's not really a good proportion. Problem one. (Spoiler?) John Von Neumann dies. It's inevitable, we all die. Historically he's dead. As the writer though he didn't need to kill off the central narrative strand of the book about sixty pages before the end. Once Von Neumann died it was like the book came to a slow halt, everything else after it felt like filer, even if it wasn't, it just felt like an after-thought, or like something Minor Threat would condone filling your head with (sorry, had to go with the Minor Threat / Filer reference). What follows Von Neumann's death is some explanations of different games, and maybe some Cold War stuff, but I kind of lost interest at this point (although the games are fun to read about, lots of little tricks you can pull on greedy friends if one was so inclined.)Problem two. I don't know much about math, and reading this book I don't know anything more about math. I kind of wanted to learn a little something about Game Theory here, but in a nice and easy to understand way that someone who got a D+ in his third quarter of high school algebra could understand. I got a tiny bit of math that someone who got A's in a couple of statistics classes in college could have easily figured out for himself, but nothing math-ish except for descriptions of the games in a narrative form. I don't know what I expected actually. I guess I was a little disheartened to find out I knew most of these games already, and more of the math behind them from watching a few seasons of Numb3rs, and could usually even remember which episode's Charlie would enlighten some member of the FBI about a particular game strategy and how it would help them capture a bad person. Problem three. This is like problem one. Douglas Hofstader and Richard Powers are masters at running three parallel narratives at once and pulling them in and out of each other as their books progress. If you're going to do three narrative threads it should be as neat and tidy as they do it. This book doesn't, and once again I'm disappointed because the three narrative thread structure is one that I love. To be teased with this structure and then see it unravel until only one lone thread is left without a satisfying 'brining it all together' makes me sad. Problems aside the book was a nice read, but not exactly what I wanted the book to be. I'll just have to go back to watching more Numb3rs to learn my higher math concepts for the mathematically retarded. "
1,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1739231-brett,4,"This book is three intertwined story lines, all separate, but related. The first is a short biography of John von Neumann, the founder of game theory. The second is a layman's explanation of game theory, with many examples of various games, their properties, and how they might be applied to real life. The third is a history of the middle of the 20th Century in relation to the atomic bomb, specifically the arms race between the USA and USSR that gave us the huge stockpile of hydrogen bombs and mutually assured destruction.Poundstone does a good job of keeping the book fresh by switching between the various narratives, although occasionally the pieces don't fit together quite well. Dr. Neumann's life sometimes interrupts the bomb history only to be followed by the game theory discussion, leaving the reader holding a lot in his head. But in the end, I feel I have a much better understanding of what game theory is all about and why it is important. This is probably the best compliment any layman's science book can receive. "

3,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17081670-warren-mcpherson,4,This book combines a narrative of the life on John Von Neumann with an exploration of a couple of his ideas that have had a great impact on society.John Von Neumann had a deep understanding of many of the most advanced ideas of his time. He also made critical contributions to many projects that were mostly shaped by other people. This makes a description of his life and ideas a formidable challenge.I have run across his contributions to computer science and was familiar with the extremely high regard contemporaries had for him so I was quite curious to know more about the man.Most of the book is spent explaining a selection of ideas that have had broad social impact like game theory and the development of the nuclear bomb. The core concepts of game theory are familiar to most people. The discussion fills in some background and explains some nuance. The discussion of systemic analysis of simple games with parameterized rules foreshadows cellular automata. Knowledgable readers will gain an understanding of how some critical ideas are connected and have developed. But the book makes no assumptions and all readers will gain insight into one of the most incredible people of the twentieth century.
4,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159477-steven,4,Read this a bunch of times. If you find game theory fascinating it's the kind of book you can pick up and start reading and then find a hour or more has gone by.
5,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65913-tim,3,"If you saw the movie version of A Beautiful Mind and thought that its corny description of Nash equilibria left something to be desired, then this popular treatment of game theory is an excellent next step. The book devotes some space to a biography of John von Neumann and a rushed history of post-WW2 nuclear politics, but the real highlights are the author's crisp and readable explanations of the major concepts of game theory -- chief among them the Minimax Theorem, the Prisoner's Dilemma, Tit-for-Tat, and the Dollar Auction. The book wisely confines itself to a narrow corner of the broad and diverse field of behavioral economics, which lets it go deeper with each idea. But it's hard not to feel intrigued by the unexplored paths branching off from game theory. I guess for that there are other books to read."
6,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1039571-joseph,4,"the beginning and the end of the book are good. it talks abt game theory and its application in different scenariosthe middle part is less interesting unless of course you like history. but i must say this book provides a good overview on game theory, especially to someone new on the subjectkey takeaways from the book:(1) provides scientific explanation on why ppl would be motivated to defect (rather than cooperate) given the chance to go behind someone's back. And why economically speaking, it's always better to cooperate in the long run in a prisoner's dilemma(2) that the optimal solution (equilibrium) to game theory is following the principle of tit-for-tat (corrected 13 Dec) ( do unto others what others do to you) "
7,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,4,"At once a biography of John von Neumann (which of course could not touch on all his scientific achievements, since this would have required a far greater sophistication than the author could assume), a popular introduction to game theory, including a detailed discussion of prisoner's dilemma, the game of chicken and Rousseau's stag hunt, and the story of early Cold War nuclear diplomacy (involving such prominent figures as Francis Matthews, Secretary of the Navy in the Truman administration who called for a preventive nuclear war against the Soviet Union)."
8,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1183115-doug,2,"Interesting, though it suffers a bit from trying to be three books at once -- a biography of John von Neumann, a primer on game theory, and a history of the first decade of the Cold War. There are a lot of nifty ideas and fun anecdotes within, but it's not too successful in tying the various strands together. "
9,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422685-jessica,4,Great book filled with fun facts that really color Neumann's life and the history of the Cold War from a game theory point of view.
10,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10361209-dan-downing,4,"When one wants to write about something which will sustain only a quarter of a book's worth of print, one can be clever in a number of ways. I've no clue if Mr. Poundstone resorted to such padding techniques or if he merely threw together an olio of interesting stuff using John von Neumann as a jumping-off point.For my money, I rounded up this volume in search of more information about Dr. Neumann. Norman Macrae's biography and the material in Richard Rhodes' magisterial works on the Atomic and Hydrogen bombs left me with questions or perhaps time had erased some bits. In any event, off I went and bought the present volume.Poundstone examines game theory and matters relating to nuclear weapons, the Cuban Missle Crises, and a fairly large helping of von Neumann stories. Throw in a chapter on The Rand Corporation and some expanded material on various dilemma games, and you have an interesting and worthy book.Reading it today as opposed to its publication era in the early 90s adds a bit of spice as some issues have been settled and a few still loom. 1992 is so far in the past that the term 'googol' is used without a blush. The charms of the internet and cell phones are never mentioned. Yet von Neumann's fingerprints are all over the technologies underlying these things. And so much more.Recommended."
11,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81413182-barrett,3,"This book provides a fine glimpse on the conceptual facet, and a grand perspective on the pragmatic facet, of game theory. What it has is a next-to-zero amount of mathematics, but tons of historical facts and real-life examples. The life and events occurring therein of John von Neumann was described in great details. Overall, I think this book is a great source of information for laymen or folks that enjoy pop-science, especially for those who think that game theory is fun and that its applications are must-learn. On the other hand, if you are doing research on game theory, then it's best to read this book as a preliminary for the math-heavy hardcore of the field; this book will surely be helpful."
12,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/947350-jessica,5,"Fantastic and extremely accessible intro game theory. Although I found the portions on von Neumann’s personal history less interesting, it was helpful to know the world in which game theory evolved. Many games are covered in the book beyond the prisoner’s dilemma (stag hunt, the dollar auction, tit for tat, etc), all followed by discussions on how they relate to military, economics, advertising, and even biology. One of the top two books I’ve read this year."
13,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38271579-gk,3,"Solid 3.5. Like the title says - a mix of Neumann's biography, story of the bomb through the WW2 and a primer on game theory. Introduces game theory in an extremely interesting manner, and maintains interest throughout without seeming like a textbook. Thoroughly enjoyed the history of RAND corporation and its attempts in using game theory for strategy. However it gets a bit slow through parts of the biography. Highly recommend it for anyone wanting to get the skinny on game theory."
14,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33071750-kevin-gross,5,"Quite a good book on the basics and history of game theory. The book also provides a biography of John von Neumann, albeit largely limited to his roots in Hungary and his contributions to game theory, not mentioning much about his other endeavors. Very readable and well paced, dragging only a bit in its extended ruminations on Prisoner's Dilemma and other games."
15,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47589638-tom,4,"Great book.

28,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1821283-charles,5,"Should be required reading for all people active in geopolitical decision makingSimultaneously one of the most over and underrated areas of mathematics, game theory has many applications in the behavioral sciences. The classic example of this is illustrated by the problem known as the prisoner’s dilemma. Each arrested person must make a decision as to whether they should keep silent or confess and implicate both of them based on how they think the other person will act. Both gain the most by silence, but the worst possible outcome is to keep silent when the other talks. With applications in politics all the way up to the consideration of nuclear war, the problem is fascinating.  The treatment here is a combination of a biography of John von Neumann and a description of the (mis)uses of game theory. Clearly, the most interesting items are the descriptions of strategies advocating a “preventive” nuclear war in the late 1940’s. The end result of such a conflict would have been a world where the United States was overwhelmingly dominant and Washington D. C. would have been the de facto capital of a “world” government. As amazing as it sounds, there were people who rationally argued for such an action, Bertrand Russell being one of the most outspoken. Such positions continued to be argued until both sides developed a reliable second strike capability, which solidified the nuclear balance of terror. One of the most interesting what-if scenarios that once can imagine, a nuclear preventive war would make an exciting science fiction story.  John von Neumann clearly ranks as one of the most talented people of all time. Arguably the best mathematician ever, one of the original computer scientists, fluent in many languages and knowledgeable in many areas, his accomplishments are truly awesome. At one point he was one of the most powerful people in the world, influencing decisions affecting the lives of everyone on the planet. All of this is explained in a very readable style as very little mathematics is used in the descriptions.  This book should be required reading for all who rise to positions where national security decisions are made. It could also be used as a text for many courses in political and behavioral sciences. Even mathematicians will find it useful.Published in “Mathematics and Computer Education,” reprinted with permission and this review also appears on Amazon. "
29,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"This was a curiously fractured book. Those moderately rare folks expecting the subject to stay close to the title will be surprised: although Poundstone does spend quite a bit of time and text explaining the Prisoner's Dilemma (the archetypal game theoretic problem), this is almost as much a biography of the scientist John Von Neumann.The nexus is the cold war fascination with the PD as a mechanism for strategic analysis of the arms race. Unfortunately, game theory was seized upon as a means of understanding long before academia (economics, mathematicians, philosophers, political scientists) actually understood what the games had to tell us in the abstract, thus horribly warping what we thought we could learn about interacting with the enemy. (Specifically, early examiners hadn't yet seen how iterated games radically changed the strategies and tactics of play.)For most folks, Poundstone's book is weaker for the confusion. The tale isn't told well enough to draw the reader in, so only those who arrive already interested in each of the topic areas examined will tolerate the union.Despite its somewhat more abstract presentation, anyone truly interested in the Prisoner's Dilemma would be better off tackling the seminal 
The Evolution of Cooperation
 by Robert Axelrod. "
30,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7316023-ron,4,"William Poundstone's ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" is a strange hybrid of a book. Not that history and pop science haven't ever been mixed together before. On the contrary, ""Goedel, Escher, Bach"" is a classic of the genre. GEB was also grossly misunderstood and people overlooked the history of AI (which was incredible) because of the relatively technical discussions involving formal logic and ""TNT"".Poundstone seems determined not to suffer a similar fate. ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" tackles the fairly popular, yet grossly misunderstood, technical subject of game theory. Poundstone's treatment of the topic is excellent. Poundstone, a writer with a techincal background, knows how to explain to the layman without being condescending. The exposition is clear and of interest to anybody. Poundstone spins case studies to which anyone can relate. One dilemma, the ""Stag Hunt"", concerns, say, two boys who agree to get silly haircuts for graduation. One or both of the boys may chicken out for whatever reason (parents, etc.), and may not warn each other. What should each boy do? This dilemma reminded me of my summer at Milton Academy in high school, when 3 of us tall, skinny kids with big noses and curly, black hair agreed to pull a ""switcheroo"" at our graduation ceremony. I chickened out, although I warned the others. Still, the fact that a dilemma such as that had been studied by the likes of RAND made me howl."
31,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"The book intertwines three totally different subjects and to a degree that works well.The book's take on historic cold war events is superficial. However, the discussion is more than simply the backdrop discussion. One gets some strange insights into the thinking of many who shaped the world. However, as with the other subjects, one is left wanting more.The focus on Van Neumann often appears needless. One is never clear, despite heavy assertions, why he should be considered a cut above the rest of the great innovators in the game theory field the way Einstein is in the field of relativity. This is not to doubt Van Neumann's leading role or superiority but the book somehow never substantiates enough despite amusing anecdotes and many tales involving him.On the key game theories, the book excels. For those more interested, the treatment would appear superficial. But few who are not experts won't walk away with some amazing insights. The real life connections are good. And the treatment is neither too simplistic nor excessively technical. For anyone uninitiated on the subject, the book is a great start despite all the imperfections."
32,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7631233-alex,4,"This is really three books in one: a brief biography of John von Neumann, a history of the making of the bomb and the early days of the Cold War, and an introduction to basic game theory. Von Neumann pretty much invented game theory, was deeply involved in the creation of the A-bomb, and worked with the RAND Corporation & as a government advisor in the 40s and 50s. It all adds up to a fascinating book.The Prisoner's Dilemma of the title is a well-known problem described by game theory (and represented often in popular culture): two prisoners are questioned separately and offered a plea bargain to rat out the other guy. Mutual cooperation provides the best overall outcome, but each individual must defect in order to protect (or maximize) his own interest. Many real-world situations can be described by this theoretical model and related models such as The Stag Hunt and the Game of Chicken; the problem in each is that individual rational action is detrimental to the whole. While interesting, game theory really doesn't offer any solutions to societal dilemmas, because (a) people aren't always rational, and (b) the payoff values can't really be quantified."
33,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4840226-miguel-vargas,3,"I bought this book was because I wanted to know more about John von Neumann's life. At first, I like a lot this book since the introduction is really broadly engaging. However, it focuses a lot on the Cold War from a prisoner's dilemma perspective. I have to admit some topics covered about game theory are really interesting, but the explanation of most of them are kind of overwhelming. Honestly, I expected to find more about von Neumann's personal life, but it is okay because it was compensated by knowledge about game theory I have grasped. The solution to the prisoner's dilemma is simple avoid prisoner's dilemma which in the end is avoiding contact with other human beings.Now I wonder if we human beings are going to be responsible of sweeping out humankind or whether we will be conquered by a civilization from another planet. Hence, I totally agree with von Neumann when he claimed that the long-term survival of the human race depends upon our devising better wys to promote cooperation than any now in existence."

It does a good job of situating the field's ideas as practical lenses for understanding reality.

Game Theory is a way of mathematically representing conflict and strategy. John Nash (depicted in the movie ""A Beautiful Mind"") won the Nobel Prize for developing the Nash Equilibrium in Game Thory. The author makes a valiant attempt to explain game theory in non-technical terms but after completing the book I found myself still a bit fuzzy on the central principles of Game Theory. The discussion of von Neumann's role in early computing and the atomic bomb helps to explain game theory and how it has been used by the military and government think tanks such as the Rand Corporation."
36,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/526331-richard,3,"Game theory is a fascinating subject, but Poundstone's treatment is nothing short of heel-dragging. Including the biography of von Neumann was definitely exceeding maximum density. Game theory itself is an intriguing subject, with its application to global thermonuclear politics to natural selection to marriage counseling, so the biographic element here became ultimately skippable. Even when Pundstone reveals a grand new application for game theory (something around long before John Nash, though he is nowadays probably the most recognizable name put to game theory, though he only came up with a variation), he beats it to death before he takes on a new aspect. Half of this length, this might have made for an amazing book."

It may sound like a cop-out, but it does address the core issue - we are all rational and irrational creatures at the same time, and these conflicts create prisoner's dilemmas.

It tries to break up the monotony of theory with interesting chapters on the history of the people who worked on game theory(especially John von Neumann) and comparisons between certain dilemma's in game theory with the cold war and nuclear proliferation.My only problem with the book is that it's more of a history book than it is a game theory primer. There's only a few games actually explained and pretty much no math at all. Good book, but not fantastic."
45,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24260597-maygoon,4,"This was a surprisingly enjoyable book. Thanks to a clever blend of biography, cold-war history, and math theory, this book could definitely appeal to far more people than the title itself alludes. If there is a weak point to this book, it is that it so rarely delves into mathematical theory that when it does it comes off as a bit jarring - like a linear algebra problem in a history book - and the brain isn't quite ready for it. But putting that aside, it was an enjoyable read, complete with laugh-out-loud moments that I really wasn't expecting."
46,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267687-nita,3,"It's hard to read this book without long pauses that may or may not involve scratch paper. I really enjoyed the game theory aspect of it.I feel like the math presented was accurate but the prose used to justify it was a little wishy-washy in places. It smacked of ""left as an exercise for the reader"" without explicitly saying so. I was frequently annoyed because the von Neumann biography tended to interfere with the game theory history, rather than complement it."
47,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610244-arjen,3,This book is about three things:1. a concise biography of John von Neumann2. a concise overview of post WWII cold war arms-race politics3. game theory and the prisoner's dilemmaVery quick read that never really digs deep into the subjects. You can imagine because each of the above three subjects can easily fill a tome by themselves. I really enjoyed it though and I would recommend it to anyone interested in either of the above topics.
48,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1033837-ronen,4,"A mix between game theory primer, biography of John Von Neumann and Cold War history, I quite warmed to this book. Doesn't delve very deeply into any of the topics, but it's a nice primer and not heavy. I skimmed over some of the Cold War history but really enjoyed the end of the book, a discussions of social and biological implications of game theory. Some interesting ideas for parlor games as well (want to try the Dollar Auction :) )"
49,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21047175-pubudu-wariyapola,1,"Was able to only make it through about half of this book - it was so bad that I had to give up. It's a rambling collection of anecdotes, vague recollections, excepts from books, papers, letters, and magazine articles that are cherry picked to make a statement - and unfortunately - at least through the first half of the book - it's not clear what that statement is. This could have been so much more - if only the author picked a theme and went with it."
50,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/883503-tom,5,"Fascinating and readable exploration of a famous paradox from 'game theory' and its many applications to real life. Not overly technical, and includes excellent biographical details on the celebrated genius John von Neumann. Useful background if you want to read about the hot new field of behavioral economics."
51,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2742743-brian,4,Surprisingly easy read on game theory and a intro to guys like von Neuman and John Nash...the game makers who brought us M.A.D engagement theory with the Soviets. Filled with great examples of irrational 'gaes' we play every day. Great blend of game theory and human behaviour...I refer back to it time and time again.
52,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3076950-smihlon-mihlon,4,"Gotta love the history of game theory and nuclear war/deterrence. Von Neumann is a common name in electrical engineering because he is known as the father of computing (he literally created the programmable model that computers all follow today), but he is also the father of game theory and one of the head physicists that worked on the Manhattan project."
53,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2858567-ellen,4,"A very good book, but a struggle for someone who is a card-carrying non-rational being. the book gave me a renewed awareness of the role of reductive theory in real life and how, within limits, it can be applied. the book also gave me a deeper grasp on the intellectual/political scene between 1945 and 1950 which was fascinating."
54,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6823231-seoul-rationalthinkers,5,"Part Bio of Von Neumann, Part Description of the science of Game Theory, it leads to a deep understanding of the natural laws of behavior, and ultimately helps answer how complexity arises without design. One of the modern 'complex sciences' which along with Chaos Theory expose previously unquantifiable facets of reality. The two together heavily inform Dawkin's Blind Watchmaker."
55,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4834819-muneel-zaidi,4,"Any electrical engineer or fan of scientific progress will enjoy this book, but those interested in human psychology or politics/war will also find utility in it too. Mixing up the life of von Neuman, creation of game theory, and development of the atom bomb keeps the prose interesting and fresh. The basic of some game theory games are also well explained, a good intro to the topic."
56,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11281586-gutman,4,"Fascinating read. Well written, and not at all heavy, it scored high in the brain candy dept as Poundstone takes the reader on an intriguing ride through logic, human behavior, game theory, the lives of John von Neumann and other game theorists, the history of the cold war, the cuban missile crisis, strategy and more. "
57,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24489460-dave,0,Interesting book on game theory and bio of the founders of the computer John Neumann. Gave a short history of game theory and a synopsis of what is going on with it now. Biggest thing I learned was that game theory is difficult to apply outside the laboratory because of the unaccountable variables that pop up for each individual.
58,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113436-matt-hooper,4,"John von Neumann is one of the most incredible people of the 20th century (much more important, and arguably intelligent than the popular Einstein IMHO). This book covers game theory and how it relates to his life."
59,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/250795-chris,4,"Very readable discussion of Von Neumann's weird life and the history of game theory. You learn a little bit about Von Neumann, a little bit about basic game theory and a little bit about how game theory has been used by policy makers."
60,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1035805-daniel,4,A really well-developed explanation of game theory and prisoners dilemmas. The straight-up biography elements were often boring though. The life of John von Neumann and his dinner parties aren't nearly as interesting as his mathematical discoveries.
61,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1758293-daehgge,3,This is a good book for those interested in the history of the development of the prisoner's dilemma. There are some mentions of RAND Corporation in between that seem superfluous. The book looks into its implications to the modern nuclear dilemma.Good read.
62,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1318278-allisonperkel,4,"a wonderful overview of John Von Newmann's life and a very good layman look at game theory. A little slow towards the end/middle but if you ever wondered about either of these two topics and wanted a little cold war politics thrown in, this is the book for you"
63,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/256156-pat,4,This is a pretty fun read and the interwoven cold war history is interesting. This makes me want to write my own iterated prisoner's dilemma server. Rumor has it there's a second edition in the works...and there may be algorithms that beat tit-for-tat -- could this be Golden Rule 2.0?
64,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2295979-eric-roston,0,"Poundstone winds a von Neumann biography, history of the bomb, and a history of game theory into one package. It works. It's also a nice reminder of simpler times, when one person could know everything, when the world was bipolar, and game theory was stuck in binary oppositions, too. "
65,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/744116-malachi-brown,4,"Really interesting information about the history of the Prisoner's Dilemma in game theory, and about John Von Neumann, but it didn't seem to have a clean structure or flow, switching between theory and biographical narrative."
66,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1832363-donald,4,I picked up this book to clarify some stuff on the Prisoner's Dilemma for an essay. I got totally engrossed in it. I do wonder what old Dick was aiming for when he wrote it but in any case he was a success in writing a very interesting book.
67,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889014-laura,4,Actually this was really interesting and accessible even for a non-math-brain like me. The parts about von Neumann and the pre-cold-war mindset were fascinating though some of the bits about the Bomb did drag. And I actually understood all of the parts about game theory :)
68,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2366087-randy,3,"Half biography, half an overview of game theory, especially the Prisoner's Dilemma... um, half a history of the impact of game theory on the Cold War.Semi-interesting. Would have liked more on von Neumann and his other mathematics."
69,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5879647-donnie-edgemon,5,"This book includes an introduction to game theory, and I enjoyed that, but the combination with a biography of von Neumann and early Cold War history pleasantly surprised me. The history and von Neumann bio combine to keep the game theory from being too dense for a casual reader."
70,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1064829-gwen,3,"Dense history of game theory and its application to the atomic bomb, war, conflict, and evolution. Some really interesting stuff in here. It was just difficult to get through reading a few pages every night. Really liked some of the game theory, including Tit for Tat and Dollar Auction."
71,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6652102-mike,5,"This book is a bigraphy of John Von Neuman who was arguably the greatest genuis of the 20th century. His work inspired several nobel prizes, helped model modern computers, helped understand the atomic bomb, and made Game Theory a factor in preventing the Cold War from becoming the Nuclear Winter."
72,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6432739-michael-artin,3,"Some good stuff in this book, in fact, some really great stuff. At the same time, I think it suffers a bit from trying to be three things at once (biography, history, intro to game theory). Made it feel a bit disjointed at times."
73,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4485647-joni-baboci,3,"A mildly interesting book mixing some very basic game theory with the history of how it arose, the life of von Neumann, the making of the nuclear bomb and cold war diplomacy. When you say it like that it sounds way more interesting than it actually is."
74,038541580X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48007024-oivind-loe,3,"Good introduction to game theory. Also goes into depth about certain perspectives about the cold war, and Von Neumann. These chapters were for me not as interesting as the ones about game theory, but they helped give perspective."
