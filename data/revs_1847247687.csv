0,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25942645-mark-hebwood,4,"This is a history of mathematics packed into less than 400 pages. Ian tackles everything from ancient tallying systems to group theory, from foundational maths to probability theory, from number theory to complexity. So no prizes for guessing that this is not an in-depth account of each subject. But I did not expect it to be, and Ian freely acknowledges that he had to make choices of what to include, and cut corners in the rigour with which he chose to explain it. And I think he made these decisions well. At first, I did think that his treatment would turn out a bit too fluffy for my taste, but as I progressed further into the book, his chosen topics started to bind together and coalesced into an overall rich account of the development of this fascinating intellectual discipline. Even so, I still would have liked a more transparent development of some of the maths he presented. To give you a flavour of the style Ian adopts throughout his account, look at this example from the chapter on trigonometry:Using the obvious fact that θ/2 + θ/2 =θ, Ptolemy's Theorem implies that sin θ/2 = √ [(1 - cos θ) / 2] Now, I was able to work this out from the angle transformation formulae (which were also given on the same page), but my point is that I had to stop reading, think about it, and scroll a little algebra into the margin. It wasn't hard, but that's only because I remembered having seen this before at school, so I had the confidence to tackle this derivation in the first place. Later on, Ian talks about things I had never seen before, and especially in the chapter on group theory, I remember merely reading the words, and emerging thoroughly befuddled and none the wiser at the end. Still, these are not really shortcomings of the book. Of course Ian cannot go into all the details and present a cogent mathematical treatment of subjects that are often rarefied and odd, even for mathematicians (I am told). Certainly my enjoyment of the book did not suffer from the fact that he had to gloss over some of the derivations; sometimes I did not understand a single word, but for the most part Ian's account offered a fascinating glimpse into the development of mathematics from its earliest origins. When I did understand something, it made me think about the concepts involved, when I did not, it made me curious to learn more.Thoroughly enjoyable. I can only recommend it."
1,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42680630-krishna-kumar,2,"This is a short history of maths. By short, I mean really short. Which is unfortunate, because there can be no justice done to any topic within the few pages that the author has allocated for each. In some cases, just as the topic gets interesting, the author is forced to make a rapid conclusion. In other situations, he is forced to become very high-level and ignores the details necessary to help the reader understand what the topic is all about.Having said that, it is still a fun book in many respects. The focus is on mathematicians and scientists who have made important discoveries, talking about their lives and how they arrived at their deductions and proofs. There is also mention of when mathematicians discovered that something cannot be done, i.e., they discovered a proof that something is not possible in a particular domain. Also how some fields of mathematics did not find much practical use until computers came along.As one would expect, as the book progressed, I found the reading very difficult. This is the nature of the increasing complexity of the mathematics involved and even though I was familiar with most of the math discussed, the rapid transition from one point to another required careful reading. Unfortunately, the author seems to have devoted more time on the early chapters instead of elaborating and simplifying the later ones."
2,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37124155-lthmath,5,"This is one of the best books on history of mathematics I have read in a very long time. The author has a wonderful way of starting with something basic and getting to complicated aspects in just a couple of pages. I loved it. The chapters are very interestingly divided into small sub-chapters; everything seems to be organised so that each chapter starts with a basic idea and by the end you get the full on complicated aspects. From this point of view, I don't think the book is for everyone. I will say you need to have a basic idea of some concepts such as differentiation, solving equations, polynomials, probabilities, geometry. It will be even more interesting if you had an idea of about differential equations, abstract algebra or topology - this is not a must, but it will give you a better understanding of the history behind these topics. Moreover, the author has a great way of explaining applications of those topics in our society. Every chapter ends with a bit on ""how [insert topic] do for us"", which gives an example from another science or domain that uses that part of mathematics. Also, the book has small biographies on different mathematicians per topic. I think it is great that after you read about the discovery of a proof or theorem by a great mathematician, you also get a couple of paragraphs about his life. He doesn't spend much time or space on this, just basic information that offers more context. For me it felt like transforming a name related to a theorem into the actual person that worked and struggled to discover that. "
3,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"""Taming the Infinite"" could be one of the best books to explain the history of the mathematics from Ancient Periods until this time. Ian Stewart had done almost everything in his ability. I could generally imagine the world of mathematics and its parts. Author showed examples how we use mathematics in our daily life. But his words are really difficult to understand to ordinary person who is not familiar, for example, with Topology or Calculus."
4,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6645592-mark-seemann,3,"This is a history of mathematics, more than it's a book about specific mathematical discoveries. While I understand that it's a formidable task to explain the results of mathematics without actually going through the terminology and proofs, I had hoped for something more akin to Charles Petzold's The Annotated Turing, which met me at just the right level of abstraction.The first 150-200 pages of Taming the Infinite didn't teach me much that I didn't already know, although it filled out some historical details I wasn't fully aware of.Once it reached more recent (and more advanced) mathematics, however, I found that often, the level of abstraction was too high, and I couldn't follow what it was about.There's also too many lists of mathematicians and dates, with too little narrative structure to make it interesting. In 1807, x published this; then in 1823 y published that. Apart from that, the chronicles sometimes jump weirdly from later to earlier dates within a paragraph or two. Foo published this in 1794, and elaborated on the topic in a later paper in 1799. Meanwhile, Bar had corresponded with Baz; in a letter from 1809 he wrote that blah blah blah. In 1786, Bar was getting close to cracking whatever. I'm not trying to emulate the language, but the structure of the record. It's sometimes a bit disconcerting.Despite these misgivings, I was overall satisfied with the reading experience."
5,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11436449-christine-cordula-dantas,4,"A good summary of the history of mathematics (and mathematicians), in a clear and simple language. I recommend this book specially for young students, but general readers will also gain a good overview of mathematics, even if not particularly enthusiastic about this subject, as mathematical formulas can be skipped without loss of grasping the main historical facts. 3.5/5 stars."
6,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3249435-shannon,4,"I really quite enjoyed this non-fiction history of math book. I will admit most of the math itself was beyond what I could understand, but I loved hearing about how the different thought processes came about and the histories of the mathematicians. Very enjoyable read."
7,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1925269-paul-weimer,4,"Mathematician and scientist Ian Stewart writes some popular books on the subject (I keep meaning to read his annotated Flatland). The Story of Mathematics is devoted to an overview and history of Mathematics, and what it was good for in the past and what its good for now.With lots of sidebar digressions on figures and topics, this volume reminded me, in some respects, of my beloved ""The Math Book"" textbook that I recently found for sale again, used and purchased. The Story of Mathematics takes on Mathematical topics of increasing complexity and difficulty. Each topic is placed in context with how and why it was invented and developed.So the volume begins with tallies and basic number systems, showing how tallies turned into Babylonian and Egyptian number systems. We progress through basic geometry, our own number system (with sidebars on things like the Mayan and Chinese systems), trigonometry, logarithms, algebraic geometry, number theory, calculus, differential equations, and all the way up to modern chaos theory. In less than 300 pages, this means that no topic really is done in depth, a strength and a weakness. Similarly, too, the book remains at a high level overview strictly for non-mathematicians. This is not a volume by Eli Maor! In fact, the Mathematically trained might feel this is a bit dumbed down.So, I believe that intelligent readers who are completely math-phobic and yet have an urge to know more about how it works and where it came from (without doing any math skull sweat) will be happiest with the book. Those fully trained in Mathematics might be frustrated at some of the lack of depth in topics (and probably would be happier with a volume on a more specific subject that they are interested in). As for myself, I learned some things about fields of mathematics of which I am not very conversant. Stewart has a relatively easy style to follow, but its nothing special. As a production value, I do mention that to keep the volume under 300 pages, the print in the book is relatively small. Still, despite all of this, I enjoyed reading Stewart's Mathematical overview."
8,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17577930-holly-cruise,3,"I used to be good at maths. Good, but not especially interested, so I dropped it at a younger age than perhaps I should have. Turns out when you don't exercise your maths muscles for over a decade, they atrophy hugely, leaving you staring blankly at the pages of this book about the history of maths, and saying ""Whut?"".Each chapter presented the same challenge - how far into it could I get before I didn't know what the hell it was on about? Some felled me on the first page, throwing out equations and squiggly lines which my brain couldn't handle. Some I made it almost to the end of the chapter, doing surprisingly well on topology, logic and set theory. Why were the more recent chapters the ones I coped with best? Is it because I have bothered to read up on these things in the last few years, whereas I've left algebra alone since about 2001? Who knows?It seems odd to give a positive review to a book I've admitted I didn't get large chunks of, but it's nicely written and friendly enough that you only realise you've no idea what's happening once it's too late and you've read three pages of text without understanding a thing. Selling things in layman's terms isn't always possible, which I think this proves, but getting close enough, as Stewart does, is commendable.Maths, eh?"
9,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,4,"Another popular history of mathematics, essentially interchangeable with most others. Whatever points he gains for not shying away completely from some of the more technical aspects in the way his colleagues do, he loses for having hand-drawn graphs; I know this is the hip thing to do nowadays, but it looks sloppy and occasionally obscures the information he's trying to convey.Still, not the worst book ever written."
10,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/186293-darkpool,3,"Due back at the library Monday. Perhaps I'll return to it eventually. What I have read of this is entertaining enough, and I've even managed to thrill and amaze my Y12 class with some of my gleanings from its pages. Sadly, it had too much competition from more wildly interesting books which have appeared to demand my attention. "
11,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61064096-tally-the-chatty-introvert,0,"DID NOT FINISH, HENCE NO STAR RATING, SO TAKE THIS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT IF YOU WANT: This is probably the strangest review I've left so far. I'll also admit I gave up reading at page 100. In many aspects, I like what's going on as far as how it's presenting information. In others, though, I just don't speak math well enough to really follow it and get enthusiastic.Now, there is some interesting information in The Story of Mathematics. It tells us the beginnings of mathematics and some concepts we may be familiar with. One thing that shocked me was that the ancients and up to about 500 years ago, they really didn't deal with negative numbers (or weren't sure the best way to go about it.It's strange because you realize somebody's gotta invent the wheel here and get everybody on board so we can understand it.I like this book and don't like it at the same time. I feel like I just don't understand math enough to really get how the mathematicians got from point A to point B in their discoveries and why it was so important. I got to learn more history, for sure, which is what kept me going (and why I bought the book), but I'm just not mentally ready for it yet.I'll keep this one because I think it's more browse worthy than read-through worthy. If you're curious about certain concepts or really good with math (or understand math better than me), then I think this is a great book to consult to learn more about how we've figured things out over time.Perhaps in a few years (when I get some more math in me), I'll dust this one off and come back to it. I just spent more than two weeks trying to get further in, but the more math that came out made me feel like I'd gone into a textbook.I'll be taking courses soon to help me really get the mental acuity and understanding on par.It could just be lousy timing--I've been reading VERY little lately because of headaches, work, and other crazy things. I'm trying to get back on track, and this one's just too hard to try to get through right now."
12,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50953558-jason,4,"This abbreviated history of mathematics is more than just a chronology of events. It starts with basic counting at start of civilization, and slowly incorporating and weaving a story of how various mathematical ideas came to being without going into too much technical detail. Math in schools tends to be taught in discrete chunks with no connections, and this book provides that much needed context and purpose. I also like how the book focuses on mathematics as being experimental in nature, sometimes starting out as an abstract ""what if"" idea and eventually finding its way in applied practice many years down the road.This book does not delve into too much technical detail; if you are familiar with the mathematical ideas, you will come to a greater appreciation of the discussed ideas. I skimmed over or omitted sections for which I did not have the mathematical background (i.e., whenever I felt lost!), opting to read the summary paragraph at the end of the chapter. I also found that the approach was very Euro-centric, and although there were the cursory acknowledgement of how other civilizations or cultures played a role, this is still very much a traditional view of how mathematics came to being.Nevertheless, it comes highly recommended to math teachers who want to be able to give their students some more historical context, students interested in mathematics, and those who use mathematics on a routine basis (engineers, biologists, physicists)."
13,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41460606-andrea-valente,4,"Very enjoyable reading.I have studied some of the stuff in the book, here and there during my studies, but the names and theories where more or less disconnected.The book did a great job at giving historical sense to the why and the who of math. I really liked the honesty of the author in explaining how math is very much a human construct, and theories needed to be re-studied and better foundations established, over and over. It is the kind of book that makes you find/deepen your respect for a subject!PS I don't use differential equations in my everyday work, but I got a much grasp at why they are so cool and used ;)PPS I would have loved a link to the author's favorite proof that quintics cannot be solved symbolically..."
14,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103724154-emirhan,2,"Disappointing, unfortunately. When i start this book i was really excited. I've read a few books about space and computer science. So i thought it would be like those, starting from a simple idea and slowly building on top of that idea – simplicity to complexity.  This book wasn't like that at all. I didn't understand at least the half of the subjects. This is not for general readers. It seems to me that you need to have quite a lot knowledge about those subjects to understand this. Usually when i read a scientific book, it leaves an impact. I am glad that i read it but i didn't get what i expected."
15,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41184155-yahav-m,3,"Well... I'm kind of conflicted. I think the writing is good, and the first half or two-thirds of the book are quite interesting and, although sometimes difficult, I was able to follow through. However, sometimes there's just too much information - as it should have, but I mean there's too much info without many explanations of it. While I did enjoy the book, sometimes I had to take quite the break because it was 'too much'. Overall, I'd recommend the book, but it is sometimes hard to grasp everything."
16,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43017375-bill-goethals,5,"To present the broad strokes of mathematics without going through the rigorous math is a tall task that Stewart mostly nails. There are interesting personal asides that prevent this from being a nonfiction slog, but it is not a page turner. Read this if you love math and are curious about how the key aspects of it developed, but don’t want to spend a year getting through a 12,000 page complete history (looking at you M. Kline). "
17,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86460185-rebecca-would,3,"An interesting and informative enough history, but apparently its possible to have too many popular maths books, you start reading things you already know just in new formats. The last few chapters were very good discussing slightly more modern mathematics (though this was written in 2007). Recommended for anyone with a good basic knowledge of mathematical techniques and wishing to understand more about where they came from."
18,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5344627-sarah,4,I didn't understand a lot of the maths but I shall keep it on the shelf as a useful reference book and go find some more maths books - perhaps I will understand a little more each time. And anyway I enjoy understanding a little and hoping to understand more in time. And there were lots of fascinating bits of history and mathematicians to enjoy.
19,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27573155-anil-bhat,3,"Interesting read to understand the origins of mathematics, though it gets a little technical at times. I liked the callout sections where the author has written about how that particular fields of maths is used in real life. Probably a one time read for all maths enthusiasts."

23,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105474709-diego-kevin,3,"History of Math: The Last Ten Thousand Years is a book written by the British writer and math teacher Ian Stewart that contains the history and evolution of math as science over the years. It is divided into chapters and each one gives an approximation to different branches of mathematics. When I was studying Literature in university, I had to take a class on mathematics. I was surprised to have to study math when I was trying to get a degree in Literature. However, it did not bother me, because I like mathematic and I was good at it. As a further surprise, the class was not about mathematic or at least not in the way we expect when someone says that he will teach us mathematics. The class was about the evolution of the concept of math over the years. We did not have to multiplicate or divide numbers, we just had to read a bunch of books. It was more like what you should expect to study when you are trying to get a degree in Literature. The main reason why I am telling this, it is because of one of the books I had to read in that class is the reason that I became interested in History of mathematics. It was a book that contains the history of Galileo and his misunderstanding whit the church due to his attempt to demonstrate that the Earth had a circular shape. It was really interesting, and its better feature was that the way it was written made it easy to read and understand. So, I was expecting something similar when I decided to read this book and at the beginning it was as I had expected. However, as I was reading it, the book became more complicate and difficult to read due to the topics it was talking about. This is not fault of the book or the author, on the contrary the author made the topics interesting and entertaining even when I could not fully understand them. This is not a book for someone who knows nothing about mathematics, it includes some really difficult topics and mathematical theories that can make us feel lost in them. In conclusion, I did not recommend this book to anyone who was not related to mathematic. "
24,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2385396-bradley-eylander,4,"The book was a good read because it discussed the more popular breakthroughs in mathematics that I learned in school (it was very selective on what it discussed in mathematics). It was easy to read and it had sections in each topic of mathematics where it would show how every subject in math contributes to today. It also had pictures, which is nice for visual learners like myself.It lacked however, in mathematical proofs. To explain how someone made a breakthrough in mathematics the author would write what the mathmatician did in words, but show little or no mathmatical proofs. Using mostly vocabulary is difficult to follow because some (if not most) of the termonology used I didn't fully understand. The author helped some of the termonology, but in my opinion, not enough. So occasionally I went to wikipedia for some understanding (and even then it was difficult to grasp).While reading this book it gave me a slight desire to get a masters in mathematics. As it turns out a lot of mathmeticians are philosophers and since I like philosophy and math I thought I would be a good fit. However, it's not a valuable degree unless I want I want to be a professor. At my current job there are some math majors, but they're not common; and uber-rare in private firms."
25,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68756594-alain-patrick,5,"A perfect historical ensemble on how the course of Mathematics influenced the Human life in its several domains, from Physics to Astronomy, Architecture, Biology, Computing, Arts, et al. It is, no shadow of a doubt, a perfect reading for non-mathematicians as well, based on a brilliant didactic approach."
26,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826413-michael-fournier,4,"in progress. I highly recommend adding this one to your shelf. So far it is an entertaining mix of the history, theory and practical aspects of Mathematics. Ian Stewart has some great books on the subject (see Flatland). The Story of Mathematics covers subjects of increasing complexity as it follows the timeline of Mathematics development. Each topic is placed in context with how and why it was invented and developed. It is shorter than your average textbook, so nothing is too academic. This makes it an interesting and engaging read for the average Joe (me included). If you're a mathematician...you might take issue with the lack of depth and formula. It isn't a textbook, so don't expect one! It is a fun read on a subject that some people find not so fun."
27,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12267632-emily,4,"3.5 stars rounded up because I can imagine far worse attempts at summarising ""the story of mathematics"", I liked the use of separate boxes which discussed the personal lives of mathematicians to keep the main text on the maths itself (for the most part) and the liberal use of good diagrams really boosted my understanding and appreciation of the topic at hand. I'm going to hang onto this book as a reference if I ever need a summary of a given field of mathematics, but I'd struggle to know who to recommend it to. This is because it alternates between the incredibly obvious, through interesting and accessible to the near-impenetrable. You could never really tell where on this sprectrum the next chapter was going to be at. "
28,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2564751-stephen,3,"I was really distracted by the breaks in the momentum taken by asides about various mathematicians. It read almost as a periodical. I was very happy to get a handle on the evolution of mathematics asa science and art and I think to this end the author nailed it. I am not one to get excited about math, in fact I get rather bored of it quickly- but I am fairly sure it is because I am confused by it. Stewart held my wavering attentions most of the time and I found myself scribbling onto napkins or into notebooks to get a grasp of the theories being presented often. Good supportive illustrations by the way. Overall a good read for a newbie to the field like me."
29,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15938535-harry,3,"Not for everyone. As someone who was good at maths at school, but didn't take it as a subject beyond the age of 16, I found some of the content difficult to follow. Each chapter deals with the development of a particular field of maths. In most chapters I managed to hold my own until about 3/4 through and then it would get beyond me. I still found the book fascinating though and would probably have got more from it in my university years when some of the concepts dealt with we're fresher in my mind."
30,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8195334-steve,4,"A fascinating and often surprising history of mathematics, from the Babylonians to Chaos Theory and most points in between. Some very nice biographical sketches of the key players as well. However, in spite of the jacket blurb, I definitely wouldn't recommend it to people with only an average grasp of the subject (GCSE or equivalent.) I did Pure Maths to A Level, and parts of it left me floundering. I love Professor Stewart's books usually, but I feel that this could have done with someone at the publisher saying, 'Hang on a minute, Ian - can you explain this bit again?' "
31,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3402052-prabhu-r,5,"For the most part, the author has made a good effort on presenting complex mathematical concepts comprehensible for people without mathematical background. Some sections could have been better explained, however, the complex nature of the subject is all you can do. Overall the author's effort is very appreciable that he has gone through the efforts of combining history and the mathematical concepts in an interesting blend. The transformation mathematics has took over its long history is very interesting making it even more beautiful a subject."
32,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23748469-krollo,4,"I have a passable knowledge of A-Level Maths, and frankly unless the reader is at this level most of the book will go over their head. The way the chapters are organised means that you can get about halfway through, just barely understanding, and then Stewart just tries to explain why the quintic is unsolvable or whatever and the lack of detail makes the explanation fairly dodgy. Overall, though, I'd recommend this book to anyone with a reasonable comprehension of maths who wants to get a grasp of where it has come from and where it is going."
33,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12940027-timothy-rowe,3,"I was a little disappointed in this one, but only because I expect great things from Stewart. Unusually for Stewart the mathematics is not all that clearly explained. I occasionally found myself confused by his explanations of stuff I knew. Given that, it's hard to work out who this is pitched at. Mathematicians - even just folks who have read the occasional recreational mathematics book - will find most of it familiar, and those without that background are likely to struggle with it."

Know how the concepts were created (and imagined), clarified much of question of the type ""Why is this the way it is?""I'm not so good in mathematics (far from it), but this book is nice and I enjoy it, it helped me to connect some concepts and theories that I heard about.The principal benefits of read this book is: the good perspective that it give to you about mathematics."
35,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30425151-gradinaru-alexandru,4,"A well built book about the history of how mathematics evolved in time, and with chapters dedicated to showing each branch of math, it's properties and uses in real life. Would recommend it to anyone who like math or who is curious about it. Ian Stewart does a great job in popularizing math, so it doesn't seem as obscure as school makes it seem."
36,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27763768-kavi-naidu,4,"A very interesting and engaging read, anyone who is at all interested in mathematics will enjoy this book.

38,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,4,"As I've said elsewhere, I'm a convert to Ian Stewart's books. This is one for the real non-mathematician, and covers material that arguably should be taught to every child at this level, just to show what mathematics is *really* all about.Highly recommended!"
39,1847247687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13406801-federico,3,A very pleasant journey through the history of Maths.
