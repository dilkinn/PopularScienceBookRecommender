0,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-a-rather-bookish,2,"This book makes for mediocre reading, as it felt like somebody was reading straight from a textbook, with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. I love reading about the vagina, and admittedly, it was the title that originally attracted me to this. Unfortunately, apart from a few interesting snippets of information, I felt like this book fell way below my expectations.This book talks about the female anatomy, sexual behaviour, and very little about that tremendous wonder, that is the female orgasm, but does go into immense detail about contraception, telling us which could work for us and why, and any unwanted side effects that may occur.Whoever wrote this book obviously has a passion for the birth control pill, as to me, the impression I got while reading, is apart from preventing unwanted pregnancies, it is seemingly the answer to everything, Heavy bleeding? Take the pill. Endometriosis? Just take the pill. I am unable to take any kind of birth control pill, and obviously, the pill is a personal preference to each individual, but I just felt like in this book, it was kind of smothered on to me, like a greasy lump of lard, and even if one doesn't want to take the pill, YOU SHOULD STILL TAKE THE PILL!I also felt that this book was pretty biased when it comes to having sex. I mean, just because I have a vulva, that doesn't immediately mean I'd like a penis lodged in my vagina. Life doesn't work like that, and to me, this suggestion seemed somewhat ignorant.Which leads me on to the issue that this book spent much time talking about contraception, but not enough time discussing PMDD, which stands for premenstrual dysphoric disorder. This is is a health problem that I have had for five years, that is similar to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) but is much more serious. PMDD causes severe irritability, depression, or anxiety in the week or two before your period starts, and also causes many physical symptoms, too. Symptoms usually go away two to three days after your period start. This book didn't touch the sides about this condition, and that felt very demeaning and incredibly disappointing. I wanted more ground covered, but then I forgot;I CAN TAKE THE PILL! The Wonder Down Under: A User's Guide to the Vagina is advertised as a feminist text, and apparently, according to other readers, is groundbreaking. I couldn't refer to this text as either of those, as ignorance completely seeps through, and ruined any enjoyment I could have had reading this. I already like to think that I speak pretty openly about the female anatomy, and doing so doesn't create misconceptions to people about what is, and what isn't right for them. In the wrong hands, this book could act as a rather unhelpful resource, offloading it's blatant narrow-mindedness to innocent minds."

This is a clearly written, engaging and reassuring guide to all things genitals-related: anatomy, hygiene, sex, contraception, and things that can go wrong (everything from yeast infections to hemorrhoids). It’s all extremely helpful. The authors are Norwegian medical students who have worked as sexual health advisors and run a female sexual health blog. For this English edition some UK-specific information has been added, but the advice is pretty universal. My favorite little detail is that in Norway they use the term “disco mouse” for the funky smell your crotch has after a long, sweaty day. (“Mouse” being Norwegian slang for female genitals.)"

We want women to be able to make independent choices, with all the facts on the table; we want their choices to be based on medical knowledge, not gossip, misunderstandings, and fear. A good knowledge base about how the body works will make it easier for women to make their own choices with self-confidence and self-assurance. Sexuality and sexual health must be demystified, and we must take ownership of our bodies.

I don't care who you are, where you live or how old you are. If you have a vagina, I implore you to read The Wonder Down Under. No matter how many things you know (or think you know) about the female anatomy, I guarantee that there will be at least a couple of instances where the book will make you go ""Huh...I had no idea!"".Let me give you an example of a couple of things that I didn't know:

The truth—and this came as a surprise to us as well—is that we can actually use up to a thousand eggs every single month, not just one, as is commonly described. The number used each month varies throughout our life and slows down significantly the older we get. That’s how the numbers add up, if you tried to do the math.In other words, the difference between our eggs and a man’s sperm isn’t as vast as it’s often made out to be. For women, as for men, multiple sex cells fight a hard battle among themselves for the right to try and make a baby. A battalion of eggs begin to mature every month, but only one select egg makes it through security and is released from the ovary. The rest are brutally rejected and destroyed.



Now seems like a good time to take a quick break to comment on a couple of things we didn't learn in high school biology class. It's about the egg cell. You probably remember the heroic battle or race between the tough-guy sperm cells, which swim frantically to be the first to fertilize the waiting, passive egg. Point one: the egg doesn't stand still. The egg doesn't stand around nervously in the bar waiting for the sperm cell. The egg is a diva and, like most divas, she tends to turn up at the party fashionably late. The egg isn’t passive at all. It’s at least as active as the sperm cell. It isn’t the sperm cells that swim toward the egg but rather the egg that comes bobbing down toward the waiting sperm cells. They’ve often been waiting for her for days. [...] Why is it so natural to present egg cells (from women) as passive and sperm cells (from men) as active when this absolutely doesn’t correspond to reality? Just wondering...

One of the things I loved about this book is that Ellen Stokken Dahl and Nina Brochmann don't just give you medical facts in a dry manner. The writing is light and fun but without compromising the seriousness of some of the issues discussed. There is also quite a bit of social commentary which, of course, is almost impossible to avoid when talking about sex. Whether is's orgasms:

We wish Bonaparte had known that not having an orgasm during ordinary intercourse with a man isn’t abnormal. It’s the norm. But because men have dominated the research into female sexuality and the public discourse about sex, this is a message that has passed many people by. Sex has become synonymous with the activity that almost solely ensures that the man comes: the penis in the vagina. Indeed, people say that intercourse isn’t “consummated” unless the man has had an orgasm. If only the woman comes, intercourse is theoretically incomplete—it is interrupted intercourse. The woman has vanished from the picture.The sex you have regularly should be designed to maximize pleasure and orgasms for both partners, so couldn’t having sex in a hetero relationship just as well mean, for example, fifty-fifty oral sex and penetration? It’s wrong to write off the female orgasm as a pure bonus. Orgasm should be the rule, for women as well as men.

or abortions:

Abortion, the practice of intentionally terminating a pregnancy, provokes strong feelings. It’s become a controversial issue worldwide in recent years, with many debating whose rights are primary: the pregnant woman’s, or those of the unborn fetus.For us, the woman’s rights have the greatest weight—it’s the woman who will undergo the physical and mental strain of pregnancy and birth. It is also often the woman who is left with the responsibility for care and provision of support. A child results in greater emotional, economic, and social upheaval for the woman, and the women who have the least to begin with are often the ones who are hit the hardest. It ought to be a woman’s choice whether she wants to take on these burdens. There are no other areas of policy where it’s acceptable to impose such considerable personal cost on a citizen to satisfy society’s moral norms as when we oblige a woman to give birth to a child she doesn’t want to have or is in no financial position to care for.

it's clear that Dahl and Brochmann don't hesitate to state their opinions, (rightfully) implying that they're not up for debate.I am not at all exaggerating when I say that this book should be mandatory in every school. I'll say it one more time and then I'll leave: no matter how much you know (or think you know) about your sexual and reproductive organs, this book has something new and thoroughly fascinating to teach you.PS. Regarding menstrual pain and painkillers:

You can use painkillers for menstrual cramps, but it is important to use them correctly. Ibuprofen directly inhibits the COX enzymes, ensuring that fewer prostaglandins are produced. This is why ibuprofen and similar meds, known as NSAIDs (“nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs”), are the most effective medication for menstrual pains. If you tend to have severe period pains, you should start taking ibuprofen a day before your period, or at least immediately when you notice the slightest sign of pain. After that you should take painkillers every six to eight hours in the first few days of your period without a break. Far too many people wait until it’s really hurting before they take painkillers and unfortunately they are then much less effective because the prostaglandins have already been produced.

The book I think was written really well also, the way it was written made it a lot easier to read it was not like a boring medical textbook."
5,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3475211-basma,5,"A highly insightful book about everything that goes down under” in a female’s body. It’s scientific, straightforward, easy to understand and has side comments and references that I found very quirky. It’s one of those books that from the very start urges you to be open to learn something new that you might not like hearing or reading about, as well as breaking the myths and cultural traditions that aren’t based on anything scientific.This book talks about a lot of things that happen in our bodies that we might not know about it, haven’t been taught, are scared to ask about or are shushed when we try to ask, are shamed for being curious or wanting to ask questions. Especially for people growing up in a country where all of this is taboo, shameful, disgusting and ‘3eeb’ or for those of us growing up in a highly religious country, this book makes you feel like it’s a safe space that offering you easy tools to learn and understand. I wish there’s a book like this in Arabic and I can see how this can be seen as such a revolutionary and obscene act in some way. And of course it will be banned. The authors, translators and publisher will definitely be shunned. I don’t doubt that there are some Arabic reference to very few information that is mentioned in this book, but to have it as a whole translated with the same meanings, understanding and references would be a game changer."
6,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196863-jayne-lamb,2,"WAY too pro-hormonal birth control. Their argument about the ghastly side effects some women experience is basically, 'well, at least it's not as bad as being pregnant'. *EYE ROLL*"
7,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15885750-innastholiel,2,"Don’t get me wrong, this book has a lot of good(-ish) information, so if you’re looking for a basic overview of human female physiology and anatomy as it retains to sexual behaviour, this is an okay summary. It has a heavy focus on contraception, listing different methods as well as their advantages and disadvantages, as judged by Brochmann and Støkken Dahl.Overall, I don’t take issue with the contents of the book, except for one thing: It reads a lot like an advertisement for hormonal contraception. Would you like to not get pregnant? Well, the pill is great for that, but the pill is also great for lots of other things! Heavy bleeding? Take the pill! Irregular cycle? Take the pill! Underlying illness like PCOS or endometriosis? Take the pill! Just general menstrual pain? Take the pill! Depressed? Take the pill!** Disclaimer: There are some reasons researchers think the pill might actually increase your risk of depression, but those are all faulty studies because of this and this and this; of course, there is that one really thorough, really good empirical study that indicates that yes, hormonal contraception does increase your risk of depression, but whatever, man, as long as we don’t know more: TAKE THE PILL!!!!!That’s what reading the section on contraception felt like to me: A long, meandering indoctrination to the Holy Order of the Birth-Control Pill. Don’t misunderstand me, if you want to take the pill, then, by all means, do it and see for yourself whether or not it works for you. But the way this section is written makes me uncomfortable because it seems to dismiss any reason, rational or not, why people choose not to take hormonal contraception. It also seems to assume that everyone with a vulva wants to have sex, and penetrative sex with someone with a penis, no less. This leads me to the greater problem I have with The Wonder Down Under: Its overall tone and demeanour, if books can have such a thing, are extremely narrow-minded and, imo, very clearly reflect a cis-gendered and predominantly heterosexual perspective. People with vulvas are constantly and consistently referred to as “women” (and people with penises, so far as they are mentioned, are “men”). As someone who doesn’t identify with these terms of “man” and “woman”, let me tell you that it is a strange and disconcerting feeling to see them thrown around unconditionally and unrestrainedly. To me, “man” and “woman” are societal constructs associated with certain attributes and behaviours, and have little to do with biology. So having this idea that vulva = woman drilled into my head every page was hurtful, not only because I, despite my female anatomy, don’t like being called a “woman”, but also because not all people who do identify as women are born with vulvas or choose to have their genitals altered to more closely resemble those of a biological female. This type of ignorance applies not only to the the issue of biological sex and gender, but also to sexuality. 1. The authors assume that sex is awesome for everyone and that everyone must want to have it. As someone who is without a doubt on the asexual spectrum, I feel obligated to inform you that that simply is not true. There is nothing abnormal about not wanting sex or having had it and not seeing what all the fuss is about. People often assume that being sexless is a detriment, but the truth is that the only thing that is detrimental is to have to pretend to be something you’re not. Being uninterested in sex is my natural state of being. It always was. It does not cause me distress because I didn’t lose anything, it’s just that nothing was ever there.** (view spoiler)[I feel obligated to add my own disclaimer here: This is my experience, and as a sample size of one, it is, in essence, meaningless unless you are specifically interested in what I have to say. If you desired sex at some point but don’t anymore, if you feel like you lost something, if you feel unhappy with your sexlessness, it is very possible that there are other, complicating factors at work, and there is no shame in exploring your situation, be it on your own, with a friend, a partner, or a therapist. (hide spoiler)].2. Like I said, The Wonder Down Under strikes me as a predominantly heterosexual perspective. I say predominantly because there are instances in which the authors seem to remember that there are people with vulvas who don’t desire (penetrative) sex with someone with a penis, but those instances often feel like an afterthought. Overall, even though this book tries to be inclusive, it comes back to heteronormative standards fairly quickly. This is how it is, although it can also be like that, of course, but let’s talk about how it really should be (*wink, wink, nudge, nudge*), and not how it maybe could be.I understand that privilege is a hard thing to see when it is you who is privileged ((view spoiler)[when I say privilege I mean that what you feel and how perceive yourself matches the societal “ideal” closely (hide spoiler)]), but it creates an environment in which it is hard to be or feel differently, and people won’t understand that unless we speak up. Society has a very narrow view of what is “good” and “right” and “natural”, even though nothing in nature is certain except its variety. But Homo sapiens is a cruel animal, so anything that differs must be defective. I don’t mean to accuse Brochmann and Støkken Dahl of deliberate malice, but just because someone isn’t aware that they are causing you pain doesn’t mean you don’t feel hurt. I am also aware that this might at least in part be a translation or language issue, but the overall tone makes me think that it’s more than that. When I came across this book, people called it “groundbreaking” and “feminist”, but I don’t perceive it to be either. It is much too narrow-minded to be called ground-breaking, and much too caught up in “should”s to be interesting as a feminist text. In the end, it left me mourning, because reading this book reminded me of all the times I tried and failed to pretend to be something I’m not. Calling myself “woman” and “sexual” is like trying to put on a sweater that won’t fit. No matter the size, no matter the colour, the cut just isn’t right for me. I understand that not everyone will feel the same as me, but as I said before, if we want people to learn to be sceptical and not take everything for granted, we need to speak up. "

Excellent information for young women, adult women, and even some of us older ones. Ever since I bought the first edition of Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women in the early 1970s, I've been a fan of authors who make information about our bodies and our sexuality easier to understand. The women who worked at the Denver Planned Parenthood clinic where I volunteered for a couple of years would applaud this book and have a few copies for waiting-room reading, I'm sure. This book is non-judgmental, well-organized, and pretty easy to understand."
9,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4986986-tracey-allen-at-carpe-librum,3,"The Wonder Down Under - A User's Guide to the Vagina by medical students Nina Brochmann and Ellen Stokken Dahl sets out to educate and inform women about sexual health and dispel any misconceptions readers may have. With a clever cover design, The Wonder Down Under achieves this in a relaxed and informative manner although I did have a few concerns with it.Primarily, I have a major issue with the title. Very early on in the book (page 8 to be precise) the authors point out that the majority of people refer to female genitalia as the vagina, when in fact, it should be referred to as the vulva; as the vagina is only one part of the genitalia. However, the authors then perpetuate the misnomer in the very title of this book. Sorry ladies, but you can't have it both ways!The medical students are based in Oslo in Norway, and this book is a response to the success of their blog and is translated from Norwegian. The translation was very good, but it's worth noting that many of the stats they refer to are for Norway or the region. The authors provide many reassuring notions and take a lot of care to point out every woman is different but normal and sexual health shouldn't be embarrassing but they undo all of their goodwill with the section title of: Discharge, Periods and Other Gore. Gore? What the hell? This might have been a translation error or just an extremely poor choice of words, but it definitely bothered me. This offensive section title grouped six chapters together, and therefore featured at the top of the page for 28 pages. Not good.The book includes chapters on a multitude of topics - including a comprehensive section on contraception - however there is nothing on menopause. I'm not sure why this was left out when there was time for a few pages on genital mutilation and intimate surgery, but I'm hopeful this information will be added in a future re-printing of the book.An informative read for young women (and men).* Copy courtesy of Hachette Australia *"
10,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772327-christopher,4,"I am not the intended audience for this book.That said, I'm now the father of a 12 1/2 year old and I have no experience in what she's going to be facing in the near future of her life. So my wife bought this book for my daughter to read and I thought I ought to as well.On behalf of my gender I apologize for stupid/ignorant statements and assumptions we have made. I thought I had a good grounding in anatomy and reproductive sciences/birth control; I did not have an accurate picture of the nuance and complexity of birth control options.I really appreciated the authors' risk-based approach to sex, birth control, and STIs. It was very different from my in-school sex-ed which focused on the ""nothing is ever safe safe so don't do it at all"" themes. Side-effects happen, but less often than you may think. STIs suck, but many can be treated and many can be lived with. Not having sex ever is not only unlikely, but denying an important part of the human experience.Some of the translations from the original Norwegian were a bit clunky. This applied to both language (disco mouse as a euphemism) and culture (TV shows I've never heard of, more focus on Middle Eastern or African cultural expectations than say Catholic or Evangelical expectations). That said, I don't see how this book could have been written in the US without it causing a concerted campaign to string up the authors as witches - because people suck.I know my daughter has now started in on this book and I hope it really helps her to feel more confident in her choices and options."

It's so valuable to keep up to date and re-evaluate our long held medical beliefs. Our bodies should not be taboo or a mystery to us!This book is educational and exceptionally well-researched. But its also non-judgmental and humorous. The authors present some dry medical concepts in an accessible and conversational tone. And the illustrations (there are a few!) are cute, helpful, and surprisingly hilarious at times.It touches on anything you could imagine related to the vulva; anatomy, contraception, sex, psychology, consent, gender, disease, and even the dangers of poor sex education (FGM being the most extreme case). There were so many interesting facts I learned not just about biology, but also about history and society. (Women in ancient Greece used leaves and honey as a form of contraception!)The notable exceptions in this book are menopause and post-pregnancy. There are a ridiculous number of pregnancy books so I dont think the omission is significant. But I do think a section on menopause would have been helpful! There's so much stigma and ignorance surrounding menopause, we need a book like this to cut through all of the fog.I would honestly love for this to be required reading in school. Schools don't do enough with health education so women are often forced to take education into their own hands. And that often involves hearsay or women's magazines or Google, which can all be unreliable. But even if you had great health ed and are not shy about talking to your doctor, what about those things you don't even know you need to know? That's what I liked most about this! I feel more informed. I can separate what's medically proven with what's misinformation (synchronized periods are not a thing! My life has been a lie). I now have a deeper grasp of the science behind different phenomena. And all of this makes me so pleased that I picked this book up. Its definitely something I will continue to reference as needed in the future."

This is not anything new to me. There where a few things in this I learned but not many. I have also been and used several contraceptions during the years so I know how they work.I found the book to be funny at times and yes informative. The problem I have with this is that it's solely targeted to women (and I guess persons with vaginas? ) which I think is very sad. It would be good for all gender to know about their own and other people's genitals, I think. The book goes in to second person a lot of times which bothered me.It also tries not to 'judge', but still get their point of view cross. There is one sentence, about selling or buying sex that I strongly believe shouldn't be in this book without a discussion about the ways selling and buying sex affects humans in so many aspects.Would i recommend? Maybe? Probably not but it also depends on if you need a user guide to your or your partner(s) vagina. Maybe read the first part and see what you think?"

20,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5308813-janine,4,"I'm rating this 4 stars because I think it's an important book. That being said -- I don't know that there was anything earth-shattering that I learned from reading this book. I did, however, love the way that it was presented, and researched, and the way it tackled so many of the common (and often problematic) myths surrounding female anatomy. Early in the book the authors address the fact that female anatomy has often been overlooked in favor of focusing on male anatomy instead. Big shocker, right? But the book starts out by talking about how similar that female and anatomy both are -- probably the most surprising thing to me as a reader, honestly. It's just that for ladies, most of those parts are internal, while the dudes just have it all out there in the open. Part of the reason, surely, the vagina is so shrouded in mystery. I think the authors do a really great job of addressing that the myths and misunderstanding surrounding our lady parts is not only problematic, but sometimes also dangerous. This is most explicitly addressed when they talk about the hymen serving as a ""virginity test"" despite that being an inaccurate way of determining whether a women has ever had sex. The book goes into great and well-researched detail on just about anything you could want to know about the female sexual organs. They address basic anatomy, sexual health, contraception, reproduction, and just general knowledge about how everything down there should look and feel, and when to be worried something isn't right. They use facts, humor, charts, and sometimes even pictures to break things down in a way that is easy to understand, take in, and compare. So, while I didn't take in anything too outrageously new, I will say I did learn some things. And think this should be required reading for all women, the younger the better. Because while a lot (although not all) of this might be learned along the way, it would have been a lot of comfort to me to know some of the things presented here when I was younger, and less sure about...anything. Kudos to Dahl and Brockmann for putting this out into the world, and helping women to embrace being women, and take away some of the mystery and secrecy surrounding those lady parts of which we shall not speak.... ;)"

You are doing yourself a great disservice. Sure you already know it gives you pleasure and hopefully orgasms, with or without a partner. It also provides stimulation for your partner. We know it's a baby cradle and exit. We are inconvenienced every month when our period starts and raise your hand ( mine is raised) if you suffered excruciating pain the first few days Every.Single.Mother.Loving.Month! Then there's yeast infections, genital warts, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, and ovarian cancer. We can develop Endometriosis , fibroid tumors, ovarian cysts, and have a retroverted uterus (hand up again). And don't forget about PMS,PCOS, PID, STD's, and FTD. *snicker, I threw that last one in for laughs . But the book isn't just about the negative aspects of your lady parts. It's everything about it, the good, the bad, and the ugly. It covers everything from A (anus) to O (Orgasm Bible) to V (vagina) plus some.We live in an age where we should know these things. So why don't we? In my case it was my parents failure to educate we four girls. This book is perfect for young adults and up.The Wonder Down Under: The Insider's Guide to the Anatomy, Biology, and Reality of the Vagina .

So I asked for a review copy, and I'm glad I did.This isn't just a very informative book featuring a bunch of stuff women are very familiar with, it's also quite funny. The illustrations alone cracked me up so much I had to show my husband. And couldn't stop cackling. There's a LOT of information within these pages. Ranging from normalising how important it is to get to know your own body, how to make informed choices about the many contraception options available, sexual health and how the female anatomy changes throughout a woman's life.There's even a section about gender identity. But as the title states, this very crafty reference book is about the vagina.I really enjoyed it, and think that books like these should be shared with both boys and girls in school. There's too much mystery, misconceptions, and false information kept away from each gender. This creates problems, ignorance and distrust. We should be talking openly about our bodies and sex, instead of demonising everything.But anyway, I could go on about this for ages...The Wonder Down Under is a very cool book to have in your library because there's just so much packed inside. I'm going to file it with the rest of my feminist reference books.Grab yourself a copy!"
23,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53101848-annabeth,5,"As someone who only learned the most basic information about reproductive organs in school (thanks for nothing, MEN), I needed this book a lot. Growing up, I've spent hours upon hours researching things about sex, STDs, periods etc. on the internet when reading this could have saved me the trouble. I can only imagine a version of me in a parallel universe who's read this book at age 11 or something, and already knows that vaginal sex isn't the only form of sex, masturbating is perfectly normal, tampons aren't as dangerous as people make them out to be, almost every person with a vagina gets a yeast infection sometime in their lifetime, (Yes, I said person with a vagina, not all of them are women. I love how inclusive of trans people this book is.) and that sex and gender are very complex things. Imagine how powerful she must be. The only reason I can think of for this not being a mandatory read at school is misogyny and that infuriates me. I want everyone to read it. I've never been particularly fond of biology, but this book is very easy to understand, with some funny anecdotes thrown in so it doesn't get too dry (pun not intended) and pictures to illustrate the most important things. Sure, a gynecologist or someone who's already an expert on vaginas might not get a lot of new information out of it, but I'm sure everyone else will. Go read this book!"

An easy-to-read, informative and completely shame-free guide to all things relating to the vulva and its use. Despite being of a certain age, I had pretty good access to sex education as a young thing - but I still learned a thing or two while reading this, and was pleased to find other topics set out in clearer and more straightforward language than I've ever heard before. Other readers will no doubt choose other subjects to mention, but for me my biggest ""Hallelujah!"" was at learning the plain unvarnished truth about the hymen - and, honestly, fuck the fucking patriarchy for their nonsense about this physical aspect of women's bodies, which they've misused in order to control us and our sexualities. (I don't usually identify as an uncomplicated woman, despite being born cis-gendered, but I'd happily die on the barricades over this issue.)A book highly recommended for all owners and operators of female genitals."

I was not thaught how to talk about it, how to ask questions. And even if annual gynaecologist visits showed that everything is fine with me, I got no answers, no peace.Until this book. I got it accidentally arriving to our book-club too early. And there was some concert in the library, so I was waiting and checking random shelves. And there it was bright orange and inviting. I got into it already in the first pages. Honestly, it is just sad that so many girls are living without understanding what important, magical and natural processes are happening in their bodies. Some chapters of this should be compulsory literature for girls AND boys in their early teenage years. And a must for everyone 18+.Of course, the hippy in me started to protest a bit in the chapters dedicated to glorifying hormonal birth control that the authors are suggesting for almost every case of life. It was interesting to read a bit more about this type of control that I had not been paying attention to before, to understand how it actually works, how old and already researched it is. Still, a bit too much for me. And I'm sure that pro-nature friends also might resist these chapters. But still, it doesn't reduce the importance of the book, written professionally AND reader-friendly by people from the field.By the way it all started as blog of a doctor and medicine student for teenagers. But when they saw that so many adults (women and men) are sending in their questions about kinda basic things, they realised, how dangerous is the print of this taboo topic. Uncountable researches about penises and still so much unknown abut vaginas and all the related treasures. And if you want to read something not so reader-friendly, there are plenty of references to medical research and articles.Oh, yes, an extra star about the wonders of clitoris. Freud, fuck you big time (in the metaphoric way)! I'm superangry with you, dead man!"

But overall this is an important book and I wish everyone despite age or gender would read a book like this. This could help a lot not only in regard to sexuality, but also in understanding of your own or someone else's body. The authors are doctors, so don't expect a viewpoint outside academic medicine or you might get disappointed. Of course you can criticise this, I also did that from time to time, but I accept their viewpoint and you can look for other (serious) approaches of some topics somewhere else. To live with a female body is a journey anyway of finding out what suits you best personally, there can never be a standard. But this book is talking about medical and anatomical facts, so that is what its aim is and nothing else.#WomenInTranslationMonthTranslated from the Norwegian by Nora Pröfrock and Ina Kronenberger."

This is a book that should be required reading for all young women. I am always dismayed at the ignorance of young women I've heard over the years....The only thing missing was that I was sorry there wasn't a section on menopause! I am finding too many women in their 40's who are shocked to realize that menopause marks the end of childbearing! How are we failing to educate our young women??? Too many women think they have years and years and years to have children only to find themselves hitting menopause in their 30's and 40's. But this book is a start. I'm hoping a part 2 is in the works.This would make a great gift for a ""new woman.""The fact that I received this book from the publisher has not colored my review in any way, it is my fair and honest opinion."

I got the feeling that the main focus of the book was, for the most part, put on contraception (with some very strong recommendations for the ""we don't claim to be 100% medical experts; we're only students"" message), but other than that a well-composed book.

Mostly, I think this book does quite well at getting that information across. Personally, I was very interested by the sections on contraception and all the things that can go awry with one's vagina over time, because those were the particular topics where my knowledge was lacking. So I can't speak to the quality of that information, but I was happy with what I got from it.I was less pleased with the earlier sections just on anatomy. This section definitely suffered the most when assessing the writing itself. It was clunky and oftentimes I felt like there needed to be just one more sentence tacked onto paragraphs to bring everything back together and make the point clear. Less frequently, but enough to be noticeable, it also seemed that the authors would get very close to stating something and then divert at the last second. Not only did that feel awkward because I was expecting something more, but generally I felt that they had missed something important. The big one that sticks out in my mind even now, is their discussions on one's sex drive. They spend pages discussing sex drive, particularly low sex drive. In all those pages, never once did the authors mention asexuality. In all of their reasons for low or non-existent sex drives, they always approached it as a problem to fix, not something that for some people, is very natural for their bodies. That's fine for me, because I knew that they were missing an important piece of information there, but when I consider young girls reading The Wonder Down Under, I feel like the existence of asexuality needed to be acknowledged and validated. So at the end of the day, I'm glad I read this. I'm glad I read it, because I got some useful information from it, and I would be happy to see others reading The Wonder Down Under, but with a grain of salt. I wouldn't want this to be considered a one-stop shop for understanding one's vagina, because I feel like it misses too much. That said, though, there are worse places to start, worse misinformation to be given."

Dr Nina Brochmann and Dr Ellen Støkken Dahl truly did a brilliant job with this book.""Gleden med skjeden"", "" The Wonder Down Under"" or ""Viva la Vagina"" - No matter the preferred title or the language you want to read it in, this book is something that everyone can have use out of reading. Clear cut and written in a very understandable language (with at touch of humour here and there), it delivers everything you need to know about the female genitalia and gets you exited about the wonders of the human body. I`m certainly going to make all of my friends and family read this book.At the end of the day, this is a medical book, but it`s special in the fact that it never once feels like opening a biology textbook; rather, it feels like an enlightening conversation with good friends.I truly mean it when I say I recommend this to everyone - With or without a vulva!I was perfectly happy reading this at the age of 17, but this book is for everyone who is prepubescent and older (pretty sure even 80-year olds will learn things they never knew)."

And honestly, ""the human fetus is like an aggressive parasite""? ""thank God the body naturally aborts disabled babies (in a miscarriage), because it would be stupid to carry severely disabled babies to term anyway""?!

48,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22408185-christa-gettys,5,"This entire book blew me away! I got my sex ed in 1980 at the tender age of 10, and was shown of all things, A WALT DISNEY CARTOON! Cartoon, yes, you read that right, a cartoon on how a girl works when her period starts. So much misinformation, misogynistic information, and a whole lot of nothing burger all around!It was still pretty much the dark ages at that point. You can still find it on Youtube!!The very best thing i took out off all the amazing truths, facts, and medical information, is this...FIRST TIME SEX DOES NOT HAVE TO HURT! A woman does not need to feel tearing and bleed. The hymen has nothing to do with virginity, the hyman ""revirginates"" (my word) itself if a woman abstains for more than 2 weeks. Even a tampon can stretch a hyman - and hymens come in all different shapes and sizes (like a guys junk does- surprise surprise) That a woman MUST be properly aroused by a partner with foreplay, she must be comfortable with having sex, not all nerves or over tired or feel forced or coerced into it. To feel guilted into having sex will make it very painful and unfulfilling.We should never be ashamed of our bodies, any part of them or how they work!! As a young girl coming from a very religious upbringing, I suffered over 35 years of guilt at being hypersexual!! Even after marriage to an open minded man (who was religious as well, so he knew put tab A in slot B - push in and out a lot until you cum.) We have struggled and are still learning!! I'm freaking educating scholarly folks about this information!! One man was so taken aback, he got the book for his daughter to read...and his wife was stunned at all she never knew!I am slowly bringing these idea to my son. He is 18 but developmentally 12 (he'll catch up) but I want him to know the truth, not the lies he keeps spouting from internet buddies and such. Yeah, he squirms when mom tells him the truth to the lies. He wants to shock mom (HAHAHAHA that ain't gonna happen!) I hope that if he does ever wed, if his bride to be has about as much a clue as I did, I'll be able to give her this and perhaps we can read it together. ""Honey, if you want to have a happy sex life, we need to talk""I'm still in the same religion, only now I know better and don't fall for the guilt trips about things like masterbation being a sin. It is so natural that I even had ""wet dreams"" growing up. As a girl who woke up from intimate dreams orgasming and not having touched myself - now there was a guilt trip from hell!These gals gave the facts about everything. Every type of birth control and how best to choose. The myriad problems that can arise and how to find help. What not to do with your body.I want this book to be the sex ed go to book that every girl should read. In school sex ed, In libraries, children's sections at the bookstores. I mean girls as young as 9 are getting their periods now! So along with, 'I have two mommies', should be this book! AND it is a fantastic book for boys to read as well. I think it is written in a way that won't get boys aroused as well as won't bore them to tears (with the right person guiding them through reading it) If all boys knew how girls worked and vise versa, I think we'd all be sexually more satisfied in life.Plus as I've learned, you are never too old, and it it's not just for women (please guys educate yourselves - even if you are 50!) Knowledge is power."
49,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19036138-alexandra-d,4,"Overall a good book, especially for those who don't really know a lot about female bodies and the things that are happening on the inside. In certain topics it goes into detail (sometimes too deep), whereas they were topics that are barely mentioned and then they just switch to something else.I loved that the book talks about many aspects, hygiene, sex, STDs and STIs, even abortion, etc. It's is very meticulous but at the same time it explains well and simply so it's easy to understand.What I didn't like about it was that I found that the writers have a fixation on the Pill: to me that chapter (chapters?) was unnecessarily long and I just skipped those parts when they talked and talked about one million different studies regarding the pill's smallest side effects. It's helpful to say what those exist but I absolutely don't see the point in listing all the studies in the world that determine how many women get a headache after starting to take the contraceptive pill (and they mention a LOT of studies from MANY countries...). Everybody is unique so it won't help you if you know that X amount of women have a headache in e.g. Denmark when taking a certain type of pill. In addition, to me it was distressing to read multiple times throughout the book that they stated that having a regular menstruation cycle on its own doesn't have any advantage to a woman (I can't remember the exact phrasing but that was the essence of it). I get where they are coming from but in this day and age, when people are still in the dark when it comes to menstruation (although most of the people have the opportunity to learn if they want as a TON of information is available nowadays) it is extremely dangerous to say something like this. Yes, the blood on its own does not have positive effect on a woman's body but if you consider ALL the processes that occur in order for a female body to have a regular menstrual cycle (excluding the cases when somebody uses hormonal contraception, as it can alter the cycle of course) it is super important to have a cycle as it effects many other parts and functions of our bodies. I think they should've clarified this. Sometimes I also found the style a bit ""girly"", meaning that it was a bit hard for me to take these two women seriously, I felt like I was reading a friendly chat and not something that is coming from two professionals. Overall I liked it and it's an excellent book to get to know female bodies better, so I highly recommend it."

Brilliant.Growing up in a developing Asian country, sex education is hushed. I remember being in primary school (or was it Junior High?), where we had this one seminar, if you'd call it that, about abstinence. That's basically it. My parents also hushed the conversation—it mostly started and ended with my Mom saying, ""Be careful with boys. Don't do it. Don't get pregnant. Girls are the ones who get the blame.""Now that I'm married, it feels like the world around sex and yes, vagina, is finally wide open. I can read about these stuffs without feeling guilty (or dirty), and honestly, I'm taken aback at how unknowledgeable I am with the biology of my own intimate body part. This books talks about the wonder down under: the technical names, period, sex, contraceptions, abortions, some diseases, and loads more. It debunks a few popular myths as well.I wish I've read this kind of book earlier, like, when I was in university. It's a wonderful book that serves like a biology textbook (meaning: it's full of facts and well-researched articles), but reads like a good nonfiction book. And I always prefer to read books instead of web articles that I don't know whether they are true or not.Recommended to all girls and women of all ages."

Although a lot of it did end up being review, it strengthened a lot of what I already knew and filled in some blanks. I feel super confident about internal female-body anatomy now (did you know that the uterus is at a 90-degree angle to the vagina?) and know more details than I previously did about various forms of birth control (did you know that both the hormonal IUD and the arm implant are more effective against pregnancy than tubal ligation?!). My biggest complaint is that the book mostly skips over menopause, which I thought was weird and made the book feel somewhat incomplete and contributed to its abrupt ending.But, if you had a patchy sex-ed experience in school or just think women's health is neat and want to strengthen your foundation in the topic, I would recommend this one. (Side-note: Though the book does acknowledge trans and NB folks, and occasionally cis-men, I would say that The Wonder Down Under is mostly talking to and about cis-women. Do with that information what you will.)"

Be warned that there are pictures (well cartoon drawings) of penises, sexual situations, naked people, and do you get the gists of that. There also drawings of the vagina.You get practical information covering all aspects of the reproductive system including what is it/what are all the parts, periods/discharge, sex, contraception, abortion, and problems down below. Besides the broad stretch of information you also get little tidbits of information, for example, the clitoris gets erect (albeit much smaller) and can have episodes of erection and soft throughout the night just as a man's penis will get hard and soft.It is well written, although dry to me at times (but that could just be because I have read many human sexual books and textbooks so know a lot of the information provided). It is witty and clever and the drawings just make me laugh out loud or oh shit I hope no one walks by and sees this.This is a must-read for anyone who will be dealing or have a female reproductive system.

I feel this a book for teenagers and young women who are interested in sex and contraception. I wouldn't use this book as a sole resource in choosing whether any particular device is for you, but it is an informative book to be used as a stepping stone to make a better decision. I gave this one star because I felt like this was a biology book that could be used in a health class. I do think this book would be great for men to read to understand the female body, anatomy, and menstrual cycle. Any age of male would find this useful if they have a wife, daughter, or sister.

This is a fantastic resource for all women to learn in an easy-to-read format meant for the average reader.

Also, I would recommend it to every parent (no matter if their a parent to a boy or a girl). In a warm and interesting way the authors who are two young doctors talk about everything regarding women’s reproductive organs and sexuality. They demystify what are common misperceptions of what’s OK and what’s not OK and share a warm message of acceptance trough the entire book. I wish I had read this book when I was entering sexual life. :) But I believe it’s never too late to become more self conscious about these topics.Oh, and the Croatian translation of the book is “Dolje je najbolje”.

72,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64752900-madeline-o-rourke,3,"I'm obviously very glad that works like The Wonder Down Under exist, but I also am excited for better ones to come along.There is so much to know about vaginas and reproductive systems and the like. Mostly, I think this book does quite well at getting that information across. Personally, I was very interested by the sections on contraception and all the things that can go awry with one's vagina over time, because those were the particular topics where my knowledge was lacking. So I can't speak to the quality of that information, but I was happy with what I got from it.I was less pleased with the earlier sections just on anatomy. This section definitely suffered the most when assessing the writing itself. It was clunky and oftentimes I felt like there needed to be just one more sentence tacked onto paragraphs to bring everything back together and make the point clear. Less frequently, but enough to be noticeable, it also seemed that the authors would get very close to stating something and then divert at the last second. Not only did that feel awkward because I was expecting something more, but generally I felt that they had missed something important. The big one that sticks out in my mind even now, is their discussions on one's sex drive. They spend pages discussing sex drive, particularly low sex drive. In all those pages, never once did the authors mention asexuality. In all of their reasons for low or non-existent sex drives, they always approached it as a problem to fix, not something that for some people, is very natural for their bodies. That's fine for me, because I knew that they were missing an important piece of information there, but when I consider young girls reading The Wonder Down Under, I feel like the existence of asexuality needed to be acknowledged and validated. So at the end of the day, I'm glad I read this. I'm glad I read it, because I got some useful information from it, and I would be happy to see others reading The Wonder Down Under, but with a grain of salt. I wouldn't want this to be considered a one-stop shop for understanding one's vagina, because I feel like it misses too much. That said, though, there are worse places to start, worse misinformation to be given."

Dr Nina Brochmann and Dr Ellen Støkken Dahl truly did a brilliant job with this book.""Gleden med skjeden"", "" The Wonder Down Under"" or ""Viva la Vagina"" - No matter the preferred title or the language you want to read it in, this book is something that everyone can have use out of reading. Clear cut and written in a very understandable language (with at touch of humour here and there), it delivers everything you need to know about the female genitalia and gets you exited about the wonders of the human body. I`m certainly going to make all of my friends and family read this book.At the end of the day, this is a medical book, but it`s special in the fact that it never once feels like opening a biology textbook; rather, it feels like an enlightening conversation with good friends.I truly mean it when I say I recommend this to everyone - With or without a vulva!I was perfectly happy reading this at the age of 17, but this book is for everyone who is prepubescent and older (pretty sure even 80-year olds will learn things they never knew)."

78,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22408185-christa-gettys,5,"This entire book blew me away! I got my sex ed in 1980 at the tender age of 10, and was shown of all things, A WALT DISNEY CARTOON! Cartoon, yes, you read that right, a cartoon on how a girl works when her period starts. So much misinformation, misogynistic information, and a whole lot of nothing burger all around!It was still pretty much the dark ages at that point. You can still find it on Youtube!!The very best thing i took out off all the amazing truths, facts, and medical information, is this...FIRST TIME SEX DOES NOT HAVE TO HURT! A woman does not need to feel tearing and bleed. The hymen has nothing to do with virginity, the hyman ""revirginates"" (my word) itself if a woman abstains for more than 2 weeks. Even a tampon can stretch a hyman - and hymens come in all different shapes and sizes (like a guys junk does- surprise surprise) That a woman MUST be properly aroused by a partner with foreplay, she must be comfortable with having sex, not all nerves or over tired or feel forced or coerced into it. To feel guilted into having sex will make it very painful and unfulfilling.We should never be ashamed of our bodies, any part of them or how they work!! As a young girl coming from a very religious upbringing, I suffered over 35 years of guilt at being hypersexual!! Even after marriage to an open minded man (who was religious as well, so he knew put tab A in slot B - push in and out a lot until you cum.) We have struggled and are still learning!! I'm freaking educating scholarly folks about this information!! One man was so taken aback, he got the book for his daughter to read...and his wife was stunned at all she never knew!I am slowly bringing these idea to my son. He is 18 but developmentally 12 (he'll catch up) but I want him to know the truth, not the lies he keeps spouting from internet buddies and such. Yeah, he squirms when mom tells him the truth to the lies. He wants to shock mom (HAHAHAHA that ain't gonna happen!) I hope that if he does ever wed, if his bride to be has about as much a clue as I did, I'll be able to give her this and perhaps we can read it together. ""Honey, if you want to have a happy sex life, we need to talk""I'm still in the same religion, only now I know better and don't fall for the guilt trips about things like masterbation being a sin. It is so natural that I even had ""wet dreams"" growing up. As a girl who woke up from intimate dreams orgasming and not having touched myself - now there was a guilt trip from hell!These gals gave the facts about everything. Every type of birth control and how best to choose. The myriad problems that can arise and how to find help. What not to do with your body.I want this book to be the sex ed go to book that every girl should read. In school sex ed, In libraries, children's sections at the bookstores. I mean girls as young as 9 are getting their periods now! So along with, 'I have two mommies', should be this book! AND it is a fantastic book for boys to read as well. I think it is written in a way that won't get boys aroused as well as won't bore them to tears (with the right person guiding them through reading it) If all boys knew how girls worked and vise versa, I think we'd all be sexually more satisfied in life.Plus as I've learned, you are never too old, and it it's not just for women (please guys educate yourselves - even if you are 50!) Knowledge is power."
79,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19036138-alexandra-d,4,"Overall a good book, especially for those who don't really know a lot about female bodies and the things that are happening on the inside. In certain topics it goes into detail (sometimes too deep), whereas they were topics that are barely mentioned and then they just switch to something else.I loved that the book talks about many aspects, hygiene, sex, STDs and STIs, even abortion, etc. It's is very meticulous but at the same time it explains well and simply so it's easy to understand.What I didn't like about it was that I found that the writers have a fixation on the Pill: to me that chapter (chapters?) was unnecessarily long and I just skipped those parts when they talked and talked about one million different studies regarding the pill's smallest side effects. It's helpful to say what those exist but I absolutely don't see the point in listing all the studies in the world that determine how many women get a headache after starting to take the contraceptive pill (and they mention a LOT of studies from MANY countries...). Everybody is unique so it won't help you if you know that X amount of women have a headache in e.g. Denmark when taking a certain type of pill. In addition, to me it was distressing to read multiple times throughout the book that they stated that having a regular menstruation cycle on its own doesn't have any advantage to a woman (I can't remember the exact phrasing but that was the essence of it). I get where they are coming from but in this day and age, when people are still in the dark when it comes to menstruation (although most of the people have the opportunity to learn if they want as a TON of information is available nowadays) it is extremely dangerous to say something like this. Yes, the blood on its own does not have positive effect on a woman's body but if you consider ALL the processes that occur in order for a female body to have a regular menstrual cycle (excluding the cases when somebody uses hormonal contraception, as it can alter the cycle of course) it is super important to have a cycle as it effects many other parts and functions of our bodies. I think they should've clarified this. Sometimes I also found the style a bit ""girly"", meaning that it was a bit hard for me to take these two women seriously, I felt like I was reading a friendly chat and not something that is coming from two professionals. Overall I liked it and it's an excellent book to get to know female bodies better, so I highly recommend it."
80,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5385976-marcella-purnama,4,"It's like reading a biology textbook, in a novel-way. Brilliant.Growing up in a developing Asian country, sex education is hushed. I remember being in primary school (or was it Junior High?), where we had this one seminar, if you'd call it that, about abstinence. That's basically it. My parents also hushed the conversation—it mostly started and ended with my Mom saying, ""Be careful with boys. Don't do it. Don't get pregnant. Girls are the ones who get the blame.""Now that I'm married, it feels like the world around sex and yes, vagina, is finally wide open. I can read about these stuffs without feeling guilty (or dirty), and honestly, I'm taken aback at how unknowledgeable I am with the biology of my own intimate body part. This books talks about the wonder down under: the technical names, period, sex, contraceptions, abortions, some diseases, and loads more. It debunks a few popular myths as well.I wish I've read this kind of book earlier, like, when I was in university. It's a wonderful book that serves like a biology textbook (meaning: it's full of facts and well-researched articles), but reads like a good nonfiction book. And I always prefer to read books instead of web articles that I don't know whether they are true or not.Recommended to all girls and women of all ages."
81,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6735671-kaitlin-stainbrook,0,"I consider myself a fairly knowledgable human when it comes to women's health topics, and since The Wonder Down Under is more of a basic overview, I wasn't sure how much there would be here for me. Although a lot of it did end up being review, it strengthened a lot of what I already knew and filled in some blanks. I feel super confident about internal female-body anatomy now (did you know that the uterus is at a 90-degree angle to the vagina?) and know more details than I previously did about various forms of birth control (did you know that both the hormonal IUD and the arm implant are more effective against pregnancy than tubal ligation?!). My biggest complaint is that the book mostly skips over menopause, which I thought was weird and made the book feel somewhat incomplete and contributed to its abrupt ending.But, if you had a patchy sex-ed experience in school or just think women's health is neat and want to strengthen your foundation in the topic, I would recommend this one. (Side-note: Though the book does acknowledge trans and NB folks, and occasionally cis-men, I would say that The Wonder Down Under is mostly talking to and about cis-women. Do with that information what you will.)"
82,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43571237-mark-syron,3,"An information-packed book that brings humor when regarding the female reproductive system. Be warned that there are pictures (well cartoon drawings) of penises, sexual situations, naked people, and do you get the gists of that. There also drawings of the vagina.You get practical information covering all aspects of the reproductive system including what is it/what are all the parts, periods/discharge, sex, contraception, abortion, and problems down below. Besides the broad stretch of information you also get little tidbits of information, for example, the clitoris gets erect (albeit much smaller) and can have episodes of erection and soft throughout the night just as a man's penis will get hard and soft.It is well written, although dry to me at times (but that could just be because I have read many human sexual books and textbooks so know a lot of the information provided). It is witty and clever and the drawings just make me laugh out loud or oh shit I hope no one walks by and sees this.This is a must-read for anyone who will be dealing or have a female reproductive system.

I was expecting more of a book that was eliciting empowerment of the vagina and the female form but it was a biology book. I feel this a book for teenagers and young women who are interested in sex and contraception. I wouldn't use this book as a sole resource in choosing whether any particular device is for you, but it is an informative book to be used as a stepping stone to make a better decision. I gave this one star because I felt like this was a biology book that could be used in a health class. I do think this book would be great for men to read to understand the female body, anatomy, and menstrual cycle. Any age of male would find this useful if they have a wife, daughter, or sister. Understanding the female form is necessary for a well-rounded society."

Anyway, I buckled down and wrapped it up just before the end of the year, figuring that of all years for me to end by finishing a book about the female anatomy, the year of my hysterectomy and pelvic floor reconstruction surgery would be the perfect one. This is a fantastic resource for all women to learn in an easy-to-read format meant for the average reader.

Also, I would recommend it to every parent (no matter if their a parent to a boy or a girl). In a warm and interesting way the authors who are two young doctors talk about everything regarding women’s reproductive organs and sexuality. They demystify what are common misperceptions of what’s OK and what’s not OK and share a warm message of acceptance trough the entire book.

108,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22408185-christa-gettys,5,"This entire book blew me away! I got my sex ed in 1980 at the tender age of 10, and was shown of all things, A WALT DISNEY CARTOON! Cartoon, yes, you read that right, a cartoon on how a girl works when her period starts. So much misinformation, misogynistic information, and a whole lot of nothing burger all around!It was still pretty much the dark ages at that point. You can still find it on Youtube!!The very best thing i took out off all the amazing truths, facts, and medical information, is this...FIRST TIME SEX DOES NOT HAVE TO HURT! A woman does not need to feel tearing and bleed. The hymen has nothing to do with virginity, the hyman ""revirginates"" (my word) itself if a woman abstains for more than 2 weeks. Even a tampon can stretch a hyman - and hymens come in all different shapes and sizes (like a guys junk does- surprise surprise) That a woman MUST be properly aroused by a partner with foreplay, she must be comfortable with having sex, not all nerves or over tired or feel forced or coerced into it. To feel guilted into having sex will make it very painful and unfulfilling.We should never be ashamed of our bodies, any part of them or how they work!! As a young girl coming from a very religious upbringing, I suffered over 35 years of guilt at being hypersexual!! Even after marriage to an open minded man (who was religious as well, so he knew put tab A in slot B - push in and out a lot until you cum.) We have struggled and are still learning!! I'm freaking educating scholarly folks about this information!! One man was so taken aback, he got the book for his daughter to read...and his wife was stunned at all she never knew!I am slowly bringing these idea to my son. He is 18 but developmentally 12 (he'll catch up) but I want him to know the truth, not the lies he keeps spouting from internet buddies and such. Yeah, he squirms when mom tells him the truth to the lies. He wants to shock mom (HAHAHAHA that ain't gonna happen!) I hope that if he does ever wed, if his bride to be has about as much a clue as I did, I'll be able to give her this and perhaps we can read it together. ""Honey, if you want to have a happy sex life, we need to talk""I'm still in the same religion, only now I know better and don't fall for the guilt trips about things like masterbation being a sin. It is so natural that I even had ""wet dreams"" growing up. As a girl who woke up from intimate dreams orgasming and not having touched myself - now there was a guilt trip from hell!These gals gave the facts about everything. Every type of birth control and how best to choose. The myriad problems that can arise and how to find help. What not to do with your body.I want this book to be the sex ed go to book that every girl should read. In school sex ed, In libraries, children's sections at the bookstores. I mean girls as young as 9 are getting their periods now! So along with, 'I have two mommies', should be this book! AND it is a fantastic book for boys to read as well. I think it is written in a way that won't get boys aroused as well as won't bore them to tears (with the right person guiding them through reading it) If all boys knew how girls worked and vise versa, I think we'd all be sexually more satisfied in life.Plus as I've learned, you are never too old, and it it's not just for women (please guys educate yourselves - even if you are 50!) Knowledge is power."
109,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19036138-alexandra-d,4,"Overall a good book, especially for those who don't really know a lot about female bodies and the things that are happening on the inside. In certain topics it goes into detail (sometimes too deep), whereas they were topics that are barely mentioned and then they just switch to something else.I loved that the book talks about many aspects, hygiene, sex, STDs and STIs, even abortion, etc. It's is very meticulous but at the same time it explains well and simply so it's easy to understand.What I didn't like about it was that I found that the writers have a fixation on the Pill: to me that chapter (chapters?) was unnecessarily long and I just skipped those parts when they talked and talked about one million different studies regarding the pill's smallest side effects. It's helpful to say what those exist but I absolutely don't see the point in listing all the studies in the world that determine how many women get a headache after starting to take the contraceptive pill (and they mention a LOT of studies from MANY countries...). Everybody is unique so it won't help you if you know that X amount of women have a headache in e.g. Denmark when taking a certain type of pill. In addition, to me it was distressing to read multiple times throughout the book that they stated that having a regular menstruation cycle on its own doesn't have any advantage to a woman (I can't remember the exact phrasing but that was the essence of it). I get where they are coming from but in this day and age, when people are still in the dark when it comes to menstruation (although most of the people have the opportunity to learn if they want as a TON of information is available nowadays) it is extremely dangerous to say something like this. Yes, the blood on its own does not have positive effect on a woman's body but if you consider ALL the processes that occur in order for a female body to have a regular menstrual cycle (excluding the cases when somebody uses hormonal contraception, as it can alter the cycle of course) it is super important to have a cycle as it effects many other parts and functions of our bodies. I think they should've clarified this. Sometimes I also found the style a bit ""girly"", meaning that it was a bit hard for me to take these two women seriously, I felt like I was reading a friendly chat and not something that is coming from two professionals. Overall I liked it and it's an excellent book to get to know female bodies better, so I highly recommend it."
110,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5385976-marcella-purnama,4,"It's like reading a biology textbook, in a novel-way. Brilliant.Growing up in a developing Asian country, sex education is hushed. I remember being in primary school (or was it Junior High?), where we had this one seminar, if you'd call it that, about abstinence. That's basically it. My parents also hushed the conversation—it mostly started and ended with my Mom saying, ""Be careful with boys. Don't do it. Don't get pregnant. Girls are the ones who get the blame.""Now that I'm married, it feels like the world around sex and yes, vagina, is finally wide open. I can read about these stuffs without feeling guilty (or dirty), and honestly, I'm taken aback at how unknowledgeable I am with the biology of my own intimate body part. This books talks about the wonder down under: the technical names, period, sex, contraceptions, abortions, some diseases, and loads more. It debunks a few popular myths as well.I wish I've read this kind of book earlier, like, when I was in university. It's a wonderful book that serves like a biology textbook (meaning: it's full of facts and well-researched articles), but reads like a good nonfiction book. And I always prefer to read books instead of web articles that I don't know whether they are true or not.Recommended to all girls and women of all ages."
111,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6735671-kaitlin-stainbrook,0,"I consider myself a fairly knowledgable human when it comes to women's health topics, and since The Wonder Down Under is more of a basic overview, I wasn't sure how much there would be here for me. Although a lot of it did end up being review, it strengthened a lot of what I already knew and filled in some blanks. I feel super confident about internal female-body anatomy now (did you know that the uterus is at a 90-degree angle to the vagina?) and know more details than I previously did about various forms of birth control (did you know that both the hormonal IUD and the arm implant are more effective against pregnancy than tubal ligation?!). My biggest complaint is that the book mostly skips over menopause, which I thought was weird and made the book feel somewhat incomplete and contributed to its abrupt ending.But, if you had a patchy sex-ed experience in school or just think women's health is neat and want to strengthen your foundation in the topic, I would recommend this one. (Side-note: Though the book does acknowledge trans and NB folks, and occasionally cis-men, I would say that The Wonder Down Under is mostly talking to and about cis-women. Do with that information what you will.)"
112,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43571237-mark-syron,3,"An information-packed book that brings humor when regarding the female reproductive system. Be warned that there are pictures (well cartoon drawings) of penises, sexual situations, naked people, and do you get the gists of that. There also drawings of the vagina.You get practical information covering all aspects of the reproductive system including what is it/what are all the parts, periods/discharge, sex, contraception, abortion, and problems down below. Besides the broad stretch of information you also get little tidbits of information, for example, the clitoris gets erect (albeit much smaller) and can have episodes of erection and soft throughout the night just as a man's penis will get hard and soft.It is well written, although dry to me at times (but that could just be because I have read many human sexual books and textbooks so know a lot of the information provided). It is witty and clever and the drawings just make me laugh out loud or oh shit I hope no one walks by and sees this.This is a must-read for anyone who will be dealing or have a female reproductive system.

I was expecting more of a book that was eliciting empowerment of the vagina and the female form but it was a biology book. I feel this a book for teenagers and young women who are interested in sex and contraception. I wouldn't use this book as a sole resource in choosing whether any particular device is for you, but it is an informative book to be used as a stepping stone to make a better decision. I gave this one star because I felt like this was a biology book that could be used in a health class. I do think this book would be great for men to read to understand the female body, anatomy, and menstrual cycle. Any age of male would find this useful if they have a wife, daughter, or sister. Understanding the female form is necessary for a well-rounded society."

Anyway, I buckled down and wrapped it up just before the end of the year, figuring that of all years for me to end by finishing a book about the female anatomy, the year of my hysterectomy and pelvic floor reconstruction surgery would be the perfect one. This is a fantastic resource for all women to learn in an easy-to-read format meant for the average reader. The authors covered a ton of topics, but they did it well with just enough depth to inform and educate. I highly recommend to young women, especially!"

Also, I would recommend it to every parent (no matter if their a parent to a boy or a girl). In a warm and interesting way the authors who are two young doctors talk about everything regarding women’s reproductive organs and sexuality. They demystify what are common misperceptions of what’s OK and what’s not OK and share a warm message of acceptance trough the entire book. I wish I had read this book when I was entering sexual life. :) But I believe it’s never too late to become more self conscious about these topics.Oh, and the Croatian translation of the book is “Dolje je najbolje”.

HSV1 and HSV2 can be anywhere. Once you have them you can't contract them in another spot. they decrease in outbreaks as you age.also got knowledge about progesterone vs combo contraception.And got a much better description of HPV than any doctor has provided me.no menopause, prolapse, ablation/ tube tying, sexuality, how to have an orgasm, etc here."

I am not really the target audience for it, but it does seem like it has some good information regardless.That said, it's sad that sexual health information seems to come with a very specific set of political and cultural beliefs. There were times in the book where the authors came off as either preachy or as having the kind of naivete you get when you are first coming into your own as experts on a subject - where things are very clearly black and white. Unfortunately, I think that the sort of enthusiasm it takes to write a book like this comes with the sort of naivete that makes it less than ideal to me, so it's not very uncommon."

I enjoyed the writing, the wealth of info, the dry humor, the long list of references to science journals and medical reports compiled at the end of this book, and the humorous illustrations. I only wish there were more of those cute cartoons within the text! The earlier chapters were the most interesting to me, in which the authors explain the vagina and how it functions. So many #TIL moments. The later chapters cover contraception, pregnancy, STIs etc so they got a little clinical (but not boring or off-putting). Every teenager should be given this book. "

This is a book that should be required reading for all young women. I am always dismayed at the ignorance of young women I've heard over the years....The only thing missing was that I was sorry there wasn't a section on menopause! I am finding too many women in their 40's who are shocked to realize that menopause marks the end of childbearing! How are we failing to educate our young women??? Too many women think they have years and years and years to have children only to find themselves hitting menopause in their 30's and 40's. But this book is a start.

I got the feeling that the main focus of the book was, for the most part, put on contraception (with some very strong recommendations for the ""we don't claim to be 100% medical experts; we're only students"" message), but other than that a well-composed book.

I got my sex ed in 1980 at the tender age of 10, and was shown of all things, A WALT DISNEY CARTOON! Cartoon, yes, you read that right, a cartoon on how a girl works when her period starts. So much misinformation, misogynistic information, and a whole lot of nothing burger all around!It was still pretty much the dark ages at that point. You can still find it on Youtube!!The very best thing i took out off all the amazing truths, facts, and medical information, is this...FIRST TIME SEX DOES NOT HAVE TO HURT! A woman does not need to feel tearing and bleed. The hymen has nothing to do with virginity, the hyman ""revirginates"" (my word) itself if a woman abstains for more than 2 weeks. Even a tampon can stretch a hyman - and hymens come in all different shapes and sizes (like a guys junk does- surprise surprise) That a woman MUST be properly aroused by a partner with foreplay, she must be comfortable with having sex, not all nerves or over tired or feel forced or coerced into it. To feel guilted into having sex will make it very painful and unfulfilling.We should never be ashamed of our bodies, any part of them or how they work!! As a young girl coming from a very religious upbringing, I suffered over 35 years of guilt at being hypersexual!! Even after marriage to an open minded man (who was religious as well, so he knew put tab A in slot B - push in and out a lot until you cum.) We have struggled and are still learning!! I'm freaking educating scholarly folks about this information!! One man was so taken aback, he got the book for his daughter to read...and his wife was stunned at all she never knew!I am slowly bringing these idea to my son. He is 18 but developmentally 12 (he'll catch up) but I want him to know the truth, not the lies he keeps spouting from internet buddies and such. Yeah, he squirms when mom tells him the truth to the lies. He wants to shock mom (HAHAHAHA that ain't gonna happen!) I hope that if he does ever wed, if his bride to be has about as much a clue as I did, I'll be able to give her this and perhaps we can read it together. ""Honey, if you want to have a happy sex life, we need to talk""I'm still in the same religion, only now I know better and don't fall for the guilt trips about things like masterbation being a sin. It is so natural that I even had ""wet dreams"" growing up. As a girl who woke up from intimate dreams orgasming and not having touched myself - now there was a guilt trip from hell!These gals gave the facts about everything. Every type of birth control and how best to choose. The myriad problems that can arise and how to find help. What not to do with your body.I want this book to be the sex ed go to book that every girl should read. In school sex ed, In libraries, children's sections at the bookstores. I mean girls as young as 9 are getting their periods now! So along with, 'I have two mommies', should be this book! AND it is a fantastic book for boys to read as well. I think it is written in a way that won't get boys aroused as well as won't bore them to tears (with the right person guiding them through reading it) If all boys knew how girls worked and vise versa, I think we'd all be sexually more satisfied in life.Plus as I've learned, you are never too old, and it it's not just for women (please guys educate yourselves - even if you are 50!) Knowledge is power."
139,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19036138-alexandra-d,4,"Overall a good book, especially for those who don't really know a lot about female bodies and the things that are happening on the inside. In certain topics it goes into detail (sometimes too deep), whereas they were topics that are barely mentioned and then they just switch to something else.I loved that the book talks about many aspects, hygiene, sex, STDs and STIs, even abortion, etc. It's is very meticulous but at the same time it explains well and simply so it's easy to understand.What I didn't like about it was that I found that the writers have a fixation on the Pill: to me that chapter (chapters?) was unnecessarily long and I just skipped those parts when they talked and talked about one million different studies regarding the pill's smallest side effects. It's helpful to say what those exist but I absolutely don't see the point in listing all the studies in the world that determine how many women get a headache after starting to take the contraceptive pill (and they mention a LOT of studies from MANY countries...). Everybody is unique so it won't help you if you know that X amount of women have a headache in e.g. Denmark when taking a certain type of pill. In addition, to me it was distressing to read multiple times throughout the book that they stated that having a regular menstruation cycle on its own doesn't have any advantage to a woman (I can't remember the exact phrasing but that was the essence of it). I get where they are coming from but in this day and age, when people are still in the dark when it comes to menstruation (although most of the people have the opportunity to learn if they want as a TON of information is available nowadays) it is extremely dangerous to say something like this. Yes, the blood on its own does not have positive effect on a woman's body but if you consider ALL the processes that occur in order for a female body to have a regular menstrual cycle (excluding the cases when somebody uses hormonal contraception, as it can alter the cycle of course) it is super important to have a cycle as it effects many other parts and functions of our bodies. I think they should've clarified this. Sometimes I also found the style a bit ""girly"", meaning that it was a bit hard for me to take these two women seriously, I felt like I was reading a friendly chat and not something that is coming from two professionals. Overall I liked it and it's an excellent book to get to know female bodies better, so I highly recommend it."
140,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5385976-marcella-purnama,4,"It's like reading a biology textbook, in a novel-way. Brilliant.Growing up in a developing Asian country, sex education is hushed. I remember being in primary school (or was it Junior High?), where we had this one seminar, if you'd call it that, about abstinence. That's basically it. My parents also hushed the conversation—it mostly started and ended with my Mom saying, ""Be careful with boys. Don't do it. Don't get pregnant. Girls are the ones who get the blame.""Now that I'm married, it feels like the world around sex and yes, vagina, is finally wide open. I can read about these stuffs without feeling guilty (or dirty), and honestly, I'm taken aback at how unknowledgeable I am with the biology of my own intimate body part. This books talks about the wonder down under: the technical names, period, sex, contraceptions, abortions, some diseases, and loads more. It debunks a few popular myths as well.I wish I've read this kind of book earlier, like, when I was in university. It's a wonderful book that serves like a biology textbook (meaning: it's full of facts and well-researched articles), but reads like a good nonfiction book. And I always prefer to read books instead of web articles that I don't know whether they are true or not.Recommended to all girls and women of all ages."
141,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6735671-kaitlin-stainbrook,0,"I consider myself a fairly knowledgable human when it comes to women's health topics, and since The Wonder Down Under is more of a basic overview, I wasn't sure how much there would be here for me. Although a lot of it did end up being review, it strengthened a lot of what I already knew and filled in some blanks. I feel super confident about internal female-body anatomy now (did you know that the uterus is at a 90-degree angle to the vagina?) and know more details than I previously did about various forms of birth control (did you know that both the hormonal IUD and the arm implant are more effective against pregnancy than tubal ligation?!). My biggest complaint is that the book mostly skips over menopause, which I thought was weird and made the book feel somewhat incomplete and contributed to its abrupt ending.But, if you had a patchy sex-ed experience in school or just think women's health is neat and want to strengthen your foundation in the topic, I would recommend this one. (Side-note: Though the book does acknowledge trans and NB folks, and occasionally cis-men, I would say that The Wonder Down Under is mostly talking to and about cis-women. Do with that information what you will.)"
142,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43571237-mark-syron,3,"An information-packed book that brings humor when regarding the female reproductive system. Be warned that there are pictures (well cartoon drawings) of penises, sexual situations, naked people, and do you get the gists of that. There also drawings of the vagina.You get practical information covering all aspects of the reproductive system including what is it/what are all the parts, periods/discharge, sex, contraception, abortion, and problems down below. Besides the broad stretch of information you also get little tidbits of information, for example, the clitoris gets erect (albeit much smaller) and can have episodes of erection and soft throughout the night just as a man's penis will get hard and soft.It is well written, although dry to me at times (but that could just be because I have read many human sexual books and textbooks so know a lot of the information provided). It is witty and clever and the drawings just make me laugh out loud or oh shit I hope no one walks by and sees this.This is a must-read for anyone who will be dealing or have a female reproductive system. Whether that is the holder herself, a boyfriend, or letting one know about the wonder down under."

I was expecting more of a book that was eliciting empowerment of the vagina and the female form but it was a biology book. I feel this a book for teenagers and young women who are interested in sex and contraception. I wouldn't use this book as a sole resource in choosing whether any particular device is for you, but it is an informative book to be used as a stepping stone to make a better decision. I gave this one star because I felt like this was a biology book that could be used in a health class. I do think this book would be great for men to read to understand the female body, anatomy, and menstrual cycle. Any age of male would find this useful if they have a wife, daughter, or sister. Understanding the female form is necessary for a well-rounded society."

Anyway, I buckled down and wrapped it up just before the end of the year, figuring that of all years for me to end by finishing a book about the female anatomy, the year of my hysterectomy and pelvic floor reconstruction surgery would be the perfect one. This is a fantastic resource for all women to learn in an easy-to-read format meant for the average reader. The authors covered a ton of topics, but they did it well with just enough depth to inform and educate. I highly recommend to young women, especially!"

Also, I would recommend it to every parent (no matter if their a parent to a boy or a girl). In a warm and interesting way the authors who are two young doctors talk about everything regarding women’s reproductive organs and sexuality. They demystify what are common misperceptions of what’s OK and what’s not OK and share a warm message of acceptance trough the entire book. I wish I had read this book when I was entering sexual life. :) But I believe it’s never too late to become more self conscious about these topics.Oh, and the Croatian translation of the book is “Dolje je najbolje”.

HSV1 and HSV2 can be anywhere. Once you have them you can't contract them in another spot. they decrease in outbreaks as you age.also got knowledge about progesterone vs combo contraception.And got a much better description of HPV than any doctor has provided me.no menopause, prolapse, ablation/ tube tying, sexuality, how to have an orgasm, etc here."

I am not really the target audience for it, but it does seem like it has some good information regardless.That said, it's sad that sexual health information seems to come with a very specific set of political and cultural beliefs. There were times in the book where the authors came off as either preachy or as having the kind of naivete you get when you are first coming into your own as experts on a subject - where things are very clearly black and white. Unfortunately, I think that the sort of enthusiasm it takes to write a book like this comes with the sort of naivete that makes it less than ideal to me, so it's not very uncommon."

I enjoyed the writing, the wealth of info, the dry humor, the long list of references to science journals and medical reports compiled at the end of this book, and the humorous illustrations. I only wish there were more of those cute cartoons within the text! The earlier chapters were the most interesting to me, in which the authors explain the vagina and how it functions. So many #TIL moments. The later chapters cover contraception, pregnancy, STIs etc so they got a little clinical (but not boring or off-putting). Every teenager should be given this book. "

I cannot fault it at all. It's also perfect for any age. I once believed I knew a fair amount about my 'wonder down under', but some (lady) parts still took me completely by surprise.

This is a book that should be required reading for all young women. I am always dismayed at the ignorance of young women I've heard over the years....The only thing missing was that I was sorry there wasn't a section on menopause! I am finding too many women in their 40's who are shocked to realize that menopause marks the end of childbearing! How are we failing to educate our young women??? Too many women think they have years and years and years to have children only to find themselves hitting menopause in their 30's and 40's. But this book is a start.

I got the feeling that the main focus of the book was, for the most part, put on contraception (with some very strong recommendations for the ""we don't claim to be 100% medical experts; we're only students"" message), but other than that a well-composed book.

Mostly, I think this book does quite well at getting that information across. Personally, I was very interested by the sections on contraception and all the things that can go awry with one's vagina over time, because those were the particular topics where my knowledge was lacking. So I can't speak to the quality of that information, but I was happy with what I got from it.I was less pleased with the earlier sections just on anatomy. This section definitely suffered the most when assessing the writing itself. It was clunky and oftentimes I felt like there needed to be just one more sentence tacked onto paragraphs to bring everything back together and make the point clear. Less frequently, but enough to be noticeable, it also seemed that the authors would get very close to stating something and then divert at the last second. Not only did that feel awkward because I was expecting something more, but generally I felt that they had missed something important. The big one that sticks out in my mind even now, is their discussions on one's sex drive. They spend pages discussing sex drive, particularly low sex drive. In all those pages, never once did the authors mention asexuality. In all of their reasons for low or non-existent sex drives, they always approached it as a problem to fix, not something that for some people, is very natural for their bodies. That's fine for me, because I knew that they were missing an important piece of information there, but when I consider young girls reading The Wonder Down Under, I feel like the existence of asexuality needed to be acknowledged and validated. So at the end of the day, I'm glad I read this. I'm glad I read it, because I got some useful information from it, and I would be happy to see others reading The Wonder Down Under, but with a grain of salt. I wouldn't want this to be considered a one-stop shop for understanding one's vagina, because I feel like it misses too much. That said, though, there are worse places to start, worse misinformation to be given."

Dr Nina Brochmann and Dr Ellen Støkken Dahl truly did a brilliant job with this book.""Gleden med skjeden"", "" The Wonder Down Under"" or ""Viva la Vagina"" - No matter the preferred title or the language you want to read it in, this book is something that everyone can have use out of reading. Clear cut and written in a very understandable language (with at touch of humour here and there), it delivers everything you need to know about the female genitalia and gets you exited about the wonders of the human body. I`m certainly going to make all of my friends and family read this book.At the end of the day, this is a medical book, but it`s special in the fact that it never once feels like opening a biology textbook; rather, it feels like an enlightening conversation with good friends.I truly mean it when I say I recommend this to everyone - With or without a vulva!I was perfectly happy reading this at the age of 17, but this book is for everyone who is prepubescent and older (pretty sure even 80-year olds will learn things they never knew)."

I get where they are coming from but in this day and age, when people are still in the dark when it comes to menstruation (although most of the people have the opportunity to learn if they want as a TON of information is available nowadays) it is extremely dangerous to say something like this. Yes, the blood on its own does not have positive effect on a woman's body but if you consider ALL the processes that occur in order for a female body to have a regular menstrual cycle (excluding the cases when somebody uses hormonal contraception, as it can alter the cycle of course) it is super important to have a cycle as it effects many other parts and functions of our bodies. I think they should've clarified this. Sometimes I also found the style a bit ""girly"", meaning that it was a bit hard for me to take these two women seriously, I felt like I was reading a friendly chat and not something that is coming from two professionals. Overall I liked it and it's an excellent book to get to know female bodies better, so I highly recommend it."

HSV1 and HSV2 can be anywhere. Once you have them you can't contract them in another spot. they decrease in outbreaks as you age.also got knowledge about progesterone vs combo contraception.And got a much better description of HPV than any doctor has provided me.no menopause, prolapse, ablation/ tube tying, sexuality, how to have an orgasm, etc here."

There were times in the book where the authors came off as either preachy or as having the kind of naivete you get when you are first coming into your own as experts on a subject - where things are very clearly black and white. Unfortunately, I think that the sort of enthusiasm it takes to write a book like this comes with the sort of naivete that makes it less than ideal to me, so it's not very uncommon."

I only wish there were more of those cute cartoons within the text! The earlier chapters were the most interesting to me, in which the authors explain the vagina and how it functions.

I am finding too many women in their 40's who are shocked to realize that menopause marks the end of childbearing! How are we failing to educate our young women??? Too many women think they have years and years and years to have children only to find themselves hitting menopause in their 30's and 40's. But this book is a start.

Mostly, I think this book does quite well at getting that information across. Personally, I was very interested by the sections on contraception and all the things that can go awry with one's vagina over time, because those were the particular topics where my knowledge was lacking. So I can't speak to the quality of that information, but I was happy with what I got from it.I was less pleased with the earlier sections just on anatomy. This section definitely suffered the most when assessing the writing itself. It was clunky and oftentimes I felt like there needed to be just one more sentence tacked onto paragraphs to bring everything back together and make the point clear. Less frequently, but enough to be noticeable, it also seemed that the authors would get very close to stating something and then divert at the last second. Not only did that feel awkward because I was expecting something more, but generally I felt that they had missed something important. The big one that sticks out in my mind even now, is their discussions on one's sex drive. They spend pages discussing sex drive, particularly low sex drive. In all those pages, never once did the authors mention asexuality. In all of their reasons for low or non-existent sex drives, they always approached it as a problem to fix, not something that for some people, is very natural for their bodies. That's fine for me, because I knew that they were missing an important piece of information there, but when I consider young girls reading The Wonder Down Under, I feel like the existence of asexuality needed to be acknowledged and validated. So at the end of the day, I'm glad I read this. I'm glad I read it, because I got some useful information from it, and I would be happy to see others reading The Wonder Down Under, but with a grain of salt. I wouldn't want this to be considered a one-stop shop for understanding one's vagina, because I feel like it misses too much. That said, though, there are worse places to start, worse misinformation to be given."

Dr Nina Brochmann and Dr Ellen Støkken Dahl truly did a brilliant job with this book.""Gleden med skjeden"", "" The Wonder Down Under"" or ""Viva la Vagina"" - No matter the preferred title or the language you want to read it in, this book is something that everyone can have use out of reading. Clear cut and written in a very understandable language (with at touch of humour here and there), it delivers everything you need to know about the female genitalia and gets you exited about the wonders of the human body. I`m certainly going to make all of my friends and family read this book.At the end of the day, this is a medical book, but it`s special in the fact that it never once feels like opening a biology textbook; rather, it feels like an enlightening conversation with good friends.I truly mean it when I say I recommend this to everyone - With or without a vulva!I was perfectly happy reading this at the age of 17, but this book is for everyone who is prepubescent and older (pretty sure even 80-year olds will learn things they never knew)."

I got my sex ed in 1980 at the tender age of 10, and was shown of all things, A WALT DISNEY CARTOON! Cartoon, yes, you read that right, a cartoon on how a girl works when her period starts. So much misinformation, misogynistic information, and a whole lot of nothing burger all around!It was still pretty much the dark ages at that point. You can still find it on Youtube!!The very best thing i took out off all the amazing truths, facts, and medical information, is this...FIRST TIME SEX DOES NOT HAVE TO HURT! A woman does not need to feel tearing and bleed. The hymen has nothing to do with virginity, the hyman ""revirginates"" (my word) itself if a woman abstains for more than 2 weeks. Even a tampon can stretch a hyman - and hymens come in all different shapes and sizes (like a guys junk does- surprise surprise) That a woman MUST be properly aroused by a partner with foreplay, she must be comfortable with having sex, not all nerves or over tired or feel forced or coerced into it. To feel guilted into having sex will make it very painful and unfulfilling.We should never be ashamed of our bodies, any part of them or how they work!! As a young girl coming from a very religious upbringing, I suffered over 35 years of guilt at being hypersexual!! Even after marriage to an open minded man (who was religious as well, so he knew put tab A in slot B - push in and out a lot until you cum.) We have struggled and are still learning!! I'm freaking educating scholarly folks about this information!! One man was so taken aback, he got the book for his daughter to read...and his wife was stunned at all she never knew!I am slowly bringing these idea to my son. He is 18 but developmentally 12 (he'll catch up) but I want him to know the truth, not the lies he keeps spouting from internet buddies and such. Yeah, he squirms when mom tells him the truth to the lies. He wants to shock mom (HAHAHAHA that ain't gonna happen!) I hope that if he does ever wed, if his bride to be has about as much a clue as I did, I'll be able to give her this and perhaps we can read it together. ""Honey, if you want to have a happy sex life, we need to talk""I'm still in the same religion, only now I know better and don't fall for the guilt trips about things like masterbation being a sin. It is so natural that I even had ""wet dreams"" growing up. As a girl who woke up from intimate dreams orgasming and not having touched myself - now there was a guilt trip from hell!These gals gave the facts about everything. Every type of birth control and how best to choose. The myriad problems that can arise and how to find help. What not to do with your body.I want this book to be the sex ed go to book that every girl should read. In school sex ed, In libraries, children's sections at the bookstores. I mean girls as young as 9 are getting their periods now! So along with, 'I have two mommies', should be this book! AND it is a fantastic book for boys to read as well. I think it is written in a way that won't get boys aroused as well as won't bore them to tears (with the right person guiding them through reading it) If all boys knew how girls worked and vise versa, I think we'd all be sexually more satisfied in life.Plus as I've learned, you are never too old, and it it's not just for women (please guys educate yourselves - even if you are 50!) Knowledge is power."
199,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19036138-alexandra-d,4,"Overall a good book, especially for those who don't really know a lot about female bodies and the things that are happening on the inside. In certain topics it goes into detail (sometimes too deep), whereas they were topics that are barely mentioned and then they just switch to something else.I loved that the book talks about many aspects, hygiene, sex, STDs and STIs, even abortion, etc. It's is very meticulous but at the same time it explains well and simply so it's easy to understand.What I didn't like about it was that I found that the writers have a fixation on the Pill: to me that chapter (chapters?) was unnecessarily long and I just skipped those parts when they talked and talked about one million different studies regarding the pill's smallest side effects. It's helpful to say what those exist but I absolutely don't see the point in listing all the studies in the world that determine how many women get a headache after starting to take the contraceptive pill (and they mention a LOT of studies from MANY countries...). Everybody is unique so it won't help you if you know that X amount of women have a headache in e.g. Denmark when taking a certain type of pill.

Mostly, I think this book does quite well at getting that information across. Personally, I was very interested by the sections on contraception and all the things that can go awry with one's vagina over time, because those were the particular topics where my knowledge was lacking. So I can't speak to the quality of that information, but I was happy with what I got from it.I was less pleased with the earlier sections just on anatomy. This section definitely suffered the most when assessing the writing itself. It was clunky and oftentimes I felt like there needed to be just one more sentence tacked onto paragraphs to bring everything back together and make the point clear. Less frequently, but enough to be noticeable, it also seemed that the authors would get very close to stating something and then divert at the last second. Not only did that feel awkward because I was expecting something more, but generally I felt that they had missed something important. The big one that sticks out in my mind even now, is their discussions on one's sex drive. They spend pages discussing sex drive, particularly low sex drive. In all those pages, never once did the authors mention asexuality. In all of their reasons for low or non-existent sex drives, they always approached it as a problem to fix, not something that for some people, is very natural for their bodies. That's fine for me, because I knew that they were missing an important piece of information there, but when I consider young girls reading The Wonder Down Under, I feel like the existence of asexuality needed to be acknowledged and validated. So at the end of the day, I'm glad I read this. I'm glad I read it, because I got some useful information from it, and I would be happy to see others reading The Wonder Down Under, but with a grain of salt. I wouldn't want this to be considered a one-stop shop for understanding one's vagina, because I feel like it misses too much. That said, though, there are worse places to start, worse misinformation to be given."

Dr Nina Brochmann and Dr Ellen Støkken Dahl truly did a brilliant job with this book.""Gleden med skjeden"", "" The Wonder Down Under"" or ""Viva la Vagina"" - No matter the preferred title or the language you want to read it in, this book is something that everyone can have use out of reading. Clear cut and written in a very understandable language (with at touch of humour here and there), it delivers everything you need to know about the female genitalia and gets you exited about the wonders of the human body. I`m certainly going to make all of my friends and family read this book.At the end of the day, this is a medical book, but it`s special in the fact that it never once feels like opening a biology textbook; rather, it feels like an enlightening conversation with good friends.I truly mean it when I say I recommend this to everyone - With or without a vulva!I was perfectly happy reading this at the age of 17, but this book is for everyone who is prepubescent and older (pretty sure even 80-year olds will learn things they never knew)."

228,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22408185-christa-gettys,5,"This entire book blew me away! I got my sex ed in 1980 at the tender age of 10, and was shown of all things, A WALT DISNEY CARTOON! Cartoon, yes, you read that right, a cartoon on how a girl works when her period starts. So much misinformation, misogynistic information, and a whole lot of nothing burger all around!It was still pretty much the dark ages at that point. You can still find it on Youtube!!The very best thing i took out off all the amazing truths, facts, and medical information, is this...FIRST TIME SEX DOES NOT HAVE TO HURT! A woman does not need to feel tearing and bleed. The hymen has nothing to do with virginity, the hyman ""revirginates"" (my word) itself if a woman abstains for more than 2 weeks. Even a tampon can stretch a hyman - and hymens come in all different shapes and sizes (like a guys junk does- surprise surprise) That a woman MUST be properly aroused by a partner with foreplay, she must be comfortable with having sex, not all nerves or over tired or feel forced or coerced into it. To feel guilted into having sex will make it very painful and unfulfilling.We should never be ashamed of our bodies, any part of them or how they work!! As a young girl coming from a very religious upbringing, I suffered over 35 years of guilt at being hypersexual!! Even after marriage to an open minded man (who was religious as well, so he knew put tab A in slot B - push in and out a lot until you cum.) We have struggled and are still learning!! I'm freaking educating scholarly folks about this information!! One man was so taken aback, he got the book for his daughter to read...and his wife was stunned at all she never knew!I am slowly bringing these idea to my son. He is 18 but developmentally 12 (he'll catch up) but I want him to know the truth, not the lies he keeps spouting from internet buddies and such. Yeah, he squirms when mom tells him the truth to the lies. He wants to shock mom (HAHAHAHA that ain't gonna happen!) I hope that if he does ever wed, if his bride to be has about as much a clue as I did, I'll be able to give her this and perhaps we can read it together. ""Honey, if you want to have a happy sex life, we need to talk""I'm still in the same religion, only now I know better and don't fall for the guilt trips about things like masterbation being a sin. It is so natural that I even had ""wet dreams"" growing up. As a girl who woke up from intimate dreams orgasming and not having touched myself - now there was a guilt trip from hell!These gals gave the facts about everything. Every type of birth control and how best to choose. The myriad problems that can arise and how to find help. What not to do with your body.I want this book to be the sex ed go to book that every girl should read. In school sex ed, In libraries, children's sections at the bookstores. I mean girls as young as 9 are getting their periods now! So along with, 'I have two mommies', should be this book! AND it is a fantastic book for boys to read as well. I think it is written in a way that won't get boys aroused as well as won't bore them to tears (with the right person guiding them through reading it) If all boys knew how girls worked and vise versa, I think we'd all be sexually more satisfied in life.Plus as I've learned, you are never too old, and it it's not just for women (please guys educate yourselves - even if you are 50!) Knowledge is power."
229,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19036138-alexandra-d,4,"Overall a good book, especially for those who don't really know a lot about female bodies and the things that are happening on the inside. In certain topics it goes into detail (sometimes too deep), whereas they were topics that are barely mentioned and then they just switch to something else.I loved that the book talks about many aspects, hygiene, sex, STDs and STIs, even abortion, etc. It's is very meticulous but at the same time it explains well and simply so it's easy to understand.What I didn't like about it was that I found that the writers have a fixation on the Pill: to me that chapter (chapters?) was unnecessarily long and I just skipped those parts when they talked and talked about one million different studies regarding the pill's smallest side effects. It's helpful to say what those exist but I absolutely don't see the point in listing all the studies in the world that determine how many women get a headache after starting to take the contraceptive pill (and they mention a LOT of studies from MANY countries...). Everybody is unique so it won't help you if you know that X amount of women have a headache in e.g. Denmark when taking a certain type of pill. In addition, to me it was distressing to read multiple times throughout the book that they stated that having a regular menstruation cycle on its own doesn't have any advantage to a woman (I can't remember the exact phrasing but that was the essence of it). I get where they are coming from but in this day and age, when people are still in the dark when it comes to menstruation (although most of the people have the opportunity to learn if they want as a TON of information is available nowadays) it is extremely dangerous to say something like this. Yes, the blood on its own does not have positive effect on a woman's body but if you consider ALL the processes that occur in order for a female body to have a regular menstrual cycle (excluding the cases when somebody uses hormonal contraception, as it can alter the cycle of course) it is super important to have a cycle as it effects many other parts and functions of our bodies. I think they should've clarified this. Sometimes I also found the style a bit ""girly"", meaning that it was a bit hard for me to take these two women seriously, I felt like I was reading a friendly chat and not something that is coming from two professionals. Overall I liked it and it's an excellent book to get to know female bodies better, so I highly recommend it."
230,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5385976-marcella-purnama,4,"It's like reading a biology textbook, in a novel-way. Brilliant.Growing up in a developing Asian country, sex education is hushed. I remember being in primary school (or was it Junior High?), where we had this one seminar, if you'd call it that, about abstinence. That's basically it. My parents also hushed the conversation—it mostly started and ended with my Mom saying, ""Be careful with boys. Don't do it. Don't get pregnant. Girls are the ones who get the blame.""Now that I'm married, it feels like the world around sex and yes, vagina, is finally wide open. I can read about these stuffs without feeling guilty (or dirty), and honestly, I'm taken aback at how unknowledgeable I am with the biology of my own intimate body part. This books talks about the wonder down under: the technical names, period, sex, contraceptions, abortions, some diseases, and loads more. It debunks a few popular myths as well.I wish I've read this kind of book earlier, like, when I was in university. It's a wonderful book that serves like a biology textbook (meaning: it's full of facts and well-researched articles), but reads like a good nonfiction book. And I always prefer to read books instead of web articles that I don't know whether they are true or not.Recommended to all girls and women of all ages."

Although a lot of it did end up being review, it strengthened a lot of what I already knew and filled in some blanks. I feel super confident about internal female-body anatomy now (did you know that the uterus is at a 90-degree angle to the vagina?) and know more details than I previously did about various forms of birth control (did you know that both the hormonal IUD and the arm implant are more effective against pregnancy than tubal ligation?!). My biggest complaint is that the book mostly skips over menopause, which I thought was weird and made the book feel somewhat incomplete and contributed to its abrupt ending.But, if you had a patchy sex-ed experience in school or just think women's health is neat and want to strengthen your foundation in the topic, I would recommend this one. (Side-note: Though the book does acknowledge trans and NB folks, and occasionally cis-men, I would say that The Wonder Down Under is mostly talking to and about cis-women. Do with that information what you will.)"
232,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43571237-mark-syron,3,"An information-packed book that brings humor when regarding the female reproductive system. Be warned that there are pictures (well cartoon drawings) of penises, sexual situations, naked people, and do you get the gists of that. There also drawings of the vagina.You get practical information covering all aspects of the reproductive system including what is it/what are all the parts, periods/discharge, sex, contraception, abortion, and problems down below. Besides the broad stretch of information you also get little tidbits of information, for example, the clitoris gets erect (albeit much smaller) and can have episodes of erection and soft throughout the night just as a man's penis will get hard and soft.It is well written, although dry to me at times (but that could just be because I have read many human sexual books and textbooks so know a lot of the information provided). It is witty and clever and the drawings just make me laugh out loud or oh shit I hope no one walks by and sees this.This is a must-read for anyone who will be dealing or have a female reproductive system.

I wouldn't use this book as a sole resource in choosing whether any particular device is for you, but it is an informative book to be used as a stepping stone to make a better decision. I gave this one star because I felt like this was a biology book that could be used in a health class.

Mostly, I think this book does quite well at getting that information across. Personally, I was very interested by the sections on contraception and all the things that can go awry with one's vagina over time, because those were the particular topics where my knowledge was lacking. So I can't speak to the quality of that information, but I was happy with what I got from it.I was less pleased with the earlier sections just on anatomy. This section definitely suffered the most when assessing the writing itself. It was clunky and oftentimes I felt like there needed to be just one more sentence tacked onto paragraphs to bring everything back together and make the point clear. Less frequently, but enough to be noticeable, it also seemed that the authors would get very close to stating something and then divert at the last second. Not only did that feel awkward because I was expecting something more, but generally I felt that they had missed something important. The big one that sticks out in my mind even now, is their discussions on one's sex drive. They spend pages discussing sex drive, particularly low sex drive. In all those pages, never once did the authors mention asexuality. In all of their reasons for low or non-existent sex drives, they always approached it as a problem to fix, not something that for some people, is very natural for their bodies. That's fine for me, because I knew that they were missing an important piece of information there, but when I consider young girls reading The Wonder Down Under, I feel like the existence of asexuality needed to be acknowledged and validated. So at the end of the day, I'm glad I read this. I'm glad I read it, because I got some useful information from it, and I would be happy to see others reading The Wonder Down Under, but with a grain of salt. I wouldn't want this to be considered a one-stop shop for understanding one's vagina, because I feel like it misses too much. That said, though, there are worse places to start, worse misinformation to be given."

Dr Nina Brochmann and Dr Ellen Støkken Dahl truly did a brilliant job with this book.""Gleden med skjeden"", "" The Wonder Down Under"" or ""Viva la Vagina"" - No matter the preferred title or the language you want to read it in, this book is something that everyone can have use out of reading. Clear cut and written in a very understandable language (with at touch of humour here and there), it delivers everything you need to know about the female genitalia and gets you exited about the wonders of the human body. I`m certainly going to make all of my friends and family read this book.At the end of the day, this is a medical book, but it`s special in the fact that it never once feels like opening a biology textbook; rather, it feels like an enlightening conversation with good friends.I truly mean it when I say I recommend this to everyone - With or without a vulva!I was perfectly happy reading this at the age of 17, but this book is for everyone who is prepubescent and older (pretty sure even 80-year olds will learn things they never knew)."

258,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22408185-christa-gettys,5,"This entire book blew me away! I got my sex ed in 1980 at the tender age of 10, and was shown of all things, A WALT DISNEY CARTOON! Cartoon, yes, you read that right, a cartoon on how a girl works when her period starts. So much misinformation, misogynistic information, and a whole lot of nothing burger all around!It was still pretty much the dark ages at that point. You can still find it on Youtube!!The very best thing i took out off all the amazing truths, facts, and medical information, is this...FIRST TIME SEX DOES NOT HAVE TO HURT! A woman does not need to feel tearing and bleed. The hymen has nothing to do with virginity, the hyman ""revirginates"" (my word) itself if a woman abstains for more than 2 weeks. Even a tampon can stretch a hyman - and hymens come in all different shapes and sizes (like a guys junk does- surprise surprise) That a woman MUST be properly aroused by a partner with foreplay, she must be comfortable with having sex, not all nerves or over tired or feel forced or coerced into it. To feel guilted into having sex will make it very painful and unfulfilling.We should never be ashamed of our bodies, any part of them or how they work!! As a young girl coming from a very religious upbringing, I suffered over 35 years of guilt at being hypersexual!! Even after marriage to an open minded man (who was religious as well, so he knew put tab A in slot B - push in and out a lot until you cum.) We have struggled and are still learning!! I'm freaking educating scholarly folks about this information!! One man was so taken aback, he got the book for his daughter to read...and his wife was stunned at all she never knew!I am slowly bringing these idea to my son. He is 18 but developmentally 12 (he'll catch up) but I want him to know the truth, not the lies he keeps spouting from internet buddies and such. Yeah, he squirms when mom tells him the truth to the lies. He wants to shock mom (HAHAHAHA that ain't gonna happen!) I hope that if he does ever wed, if his bride to be has about as much a clue as I did, I'll be able to give her this and perhaps we can read it together. ""Honey, if you want to have a happy sex life, we need to talk""I'm still in the same religion, only now I know better and don't fall for the guilt trips about things like masterbation being a sin. It is so natural that I even had ""wet dreams"" growing up. As a girl who woke up from intimate dreams orgasming and not having touched myself - now there was a guilt trip from hell!These gals gave the facts about everything. Every type of birth control and how best to choose. The myriad problems that can arise and how to find help. What not to do with your body.I want this book to be the sex ed go to book that every girl should read. In school sex ed, In libraries, children's sections at the bookstores. I mean girls as young as 9 are getting their periods now! So along with, 'I have two mommies', should be this book! AND it is a fantastic book for boys to read as well. I think it is written in a way that won't get boys aroused as well as won't bore them to tears (with the right person guiding them through reading it) If all boys knew how girls worked and vise versa, I think we'd all be sexually more satisfied in life.Plus as I've learned, you are never too old, and it it's not just for women (please guys educate yourselves - even if you are 50!) Knowledge is power."
259,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19036138-alexandra-d,4,"Overall a good book, especially for those who don't really know a lot about female bodies and the things that are happening on the inside. In certain topics it goes into detail (sometimes too deep), whereas they were topics that are barely mentioned and then they just switch to something else.I loved that the book talks about many aspects, hygiene, sex, STDs and STIs, even abortion, etc. It's is very meticulous but at the same time it explains well and simply so it's easy to understand.What I didn't like about it was that I found that the writers have a fixation on the Pill: to me that chapter (chapters?) was unnecessarily long and I just skipped those parts when they talked and talked about one million different studies regarding the pill's smallest side effects. It's helpful to say what those exist but I absolutely don't see the point in listing all the studies in the world that determine how many women get a headache after starting to take the contraceptive pill (and they mention a LOT of studies from MANY countries...). Everybody is unique so it won't help you if you know that X amount of women have a headache in e.g. Denmark when taking a certain type of pill. In addition, to me it was distressing to read multiple times throughout the book that they stated that having a regular menstruation cycle on its own doesn't have any advantage to a woman (I can't remember the exact phrasing but that was the essence of it). I get where they are coming from but in this day and age, when people are still in the dark when it comes to menstruation (although most of the people have the opportunity to learn if they want as a TON of information is available nowadays) it is extremely dangerous to say something like this. Yes, the blood on its own does not have positive effect on a woman's body but if you consider ALL the processes that occur in order for a female body to have a regular menstrual cycle (excluding the cases when somebody uses hormonal contraception, as it can alter the cycle of course) it is super important to have a cycle as it effects many other parts and functions of our bodies. I think they should've clarified this. Sometimes I also found the style a bit ""girly"", meaning that it was a bit hard for me to take these two women seriously, I felt like I was reading a friendly chat and not something that is coming from two professionals. Overall I liked it and it's an excellent book to get to know female bodies better, so I highly recommend it."
260,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5385976-marcella-purnama,4,"It's like reading a biology textbook, in a novel-way. Brilliant.Growing up in a developing Asian country, sex education is hushed. I remember being in primary school (or was it Junior High?), where we had this one seminar, if you'd call it that, about abstinence. That's basically it. My parents also hushed the conversation—it mostly started and ended with my Mom saying, ""Be careful with boys. Don't do it. Don't get pregnant. Girls are the ones who get the blame.""Now that I'm married, it feels like the world around sex and yes, vagina, is finally wide open. I can read about these stuffs without feeling guilty (or dirty), and honestly, I'm taken aback at how unknowledgeable I am with the biology of my own intimate body part. This books talks about the wonder down under: the technical names, period, sex, contraceptions, abortions, some diseases, and loads more. It debunks a few popular myths as well.I wish I've read this kind of book earlier, like, when I was in university. It's a wonderful book that serves like a biology textbook (meaning: it's full of facts and well-researched articles), but reads like a good nonfiction book. And I always prefer to read books instead of web articles that I don't know whether they are true or not.Recommended to all girls and women of all ages."
261,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6735671-kaitlin-stainbrook,0,"I consider myself a fairly knowledgable human when it comes to women's health topics, and since The Wonder Down Under is more of a basic overview, I wasn't sure how much there would be here for me. Although a lot of it did end up being review, it strengthened a lot of what I already knew and filled in some blanks. I feel super confident about internal female-body anatomy now (did you know that the uterus is at a 90-degree angle to the vagina?) and know more details than I previously did about various forms of birth control (did you know that both the hormonal IUD and the arm implant are more effective against pregnancy than tubal ligation?!). My biggest complaint is that the book mostly skips over menopause, which I thought was weird and made the book feel somewhat incomplete and contributed to its abrupt ending.But, if you had a patchy sex-ed experience in school or just think women's health is neat and want to strengthen your foundation in the topic, I would recommend this one. (Side-note: Though the book does acknowledge trans and NB folks, and occasionally cis-men, I would say that The Wonder Down Under is mostly talking to and about cis-women. Do with that information what you will.)"
262,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43571237-mark-syron,3,"An information-packed book that brings humor when regarding the female reproductive system. Be warned that there are pictures (well cartoon drawings) of penises, sexual situations, naked people, and do you get the gists of that. There also drawings of the vagina.You get practical information covering all aspects of the reproductive system including what is it/what are all the parts, periods/discharge, sex, contraception, abortion, and problems down below. Besides the broad stretch of information you also get little tidbits of information, for example, the clitoris gets erect (albeit much smaller) and can have episodes of erection and soft throughout the night just as a man's penis will get hard and soft.It is well written, although dry to me at times (but that could just be because I have read many human sexual books and textbooks so know a lot of the information provided). It is witty and clever and the drawings just make me laugh out loud or oh shit I hope no one walks by and sees this.This is a must-read for anyone who will be dealing or have a female reproductive system.

I was expecting more of a book that was eliciting empowerment of the vagina and the female form but it was a biology book. I feel this a book for teenagers and young women who are interested in sex and contraception. I wouldn't use this book as a sole resource in choosing whether any particular device is for you, but it is an informative book to be used as a stepping stone to make a better decision. I gave this one star because I felt like this was a biology book that could be used in a health class. I do think this book would be great for men to read to understand the female body, anatomy, and menstrual cycle. Any age of male would find this useful if they have a wife, daughter, or sister. Understanding the female form is necessary for a well-rounded society."

Anyway, I buckled down and wrapped it up just before the end of the year, figuring that of all years for me to end by finishing a book about the female anatomy, the year of my hysterectomy and pelvic floor reconstruction surgery would be the perfect one. This is a fantastic resource for all women to learn in an easy-to-read format meant for the average reader. The authors covered a ton of topics, but they did it well with just enough depth to inform and educate. I highly recommend to young women, especially!"

Also, I would recommend it to every parent (no matter if their a parent to a boy or a girl). In a warm and interesting way the authors who are two young doctors talk about everything regarding women’s reproductive organs and sexuality. They demystify what are common misperceptions of what’s OK and what’s not OK and share a warm message of acceptance trough the entire book. I wish I had read this book when I was entering sexual life. :) But I believe it’s never too late to become more self conscious about these topics.Oh, and the Croatian translation of the book is “Dolje je najbolje”.

HSV1 and HSV2 can be anywhere. Once you have them you can't contract them in another spot. they decrease in outbreaks as you age.also got knowledge about progesterone vs combo contraception.And got a much better description of HPV than any doctor has provided me.no menopause, prolapse, ablation/ tube tying, sexuality, how to have an orgasm, etc here."

I am not really the target audience for it, but it does seem like it has some good information regardless.That said, it's sad that sexual health information seems to come with a very specific set of political and cultural beliefs. There were times in the book where the authors came off as either preachy or as having the kind of naivete you get when you are first coming into your own as experts on a subject - where things are very clearly black and white. Unfortunately, I think that the sort of enthusiasm it takes to write a book like this comes with the sort of naivete that makes it less than ideal to me, so it's not very uncommon."

I enjoyed the writing, the wealth of info, the dry humor, the long list of references to science journals and medical reports compiled at the end of this book, and the humorous illustrations. I only wish there were more of those cute cartoons within the text! The earlier chapters were the most interesting to me, in which the authors explain the vagina and how it functions. So many #TIL moments. The later chapters cover contraception, pregnancy, STIs etc so they got a little clinical (but not boring or off-putting). Every teenager should be given this book. "

In all those pages, never once did the authors mention asexuality. In all of their reasons for low or non-existent sex drives, they always approached it as a problem to fix, not something that for some people, is very natural for their bodies. That's fine for me, because I knew that they were missing an important piece of information there, but when I consider young girls reading The Wonder Down Under, I feel like the existence of asexuality needed to be acknowledged and validated. So at the end of the day, I'm glad I read this. I'm glad I read it, because I got some useful information from it, and I would be happy to see others reading The Wonder Down Under, but with a grain of salt. I wouldn't want this to be considered a one-stop shop for understanding one's vagina, because I feel like it misses too much. That said, though, there are worse places to start, worse misinformation to be given."

284,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49392624-mathilde-mykl-y,5,"5 ⭐️ - I loved itThere are very few instances in which a book moved this quickly to my ""Favourite books"" list. Dr Nina Brochmann and Dr Ellen Støkken Dahl truly did a brilliant job with this book.""Gleden med skjeden"", "" The Wonder Down Under"" or ""Viva la Vagina"" - No matter the preferred title or the language you want to read it in, this book is something that everyone can have use out of reading. Clear cut and written in a very understandable language (with at touch of humour here and there), it delivers everything you need to know about the female genitalia and gets you exited about the wonders of the human body. I`m certainly going to make all of my friends and family read this book.At the end of the day, this is a medical book, but it`s special in the fact that it never once feels like opening a biology textbook; rather, it feels like an enlightening conversation with good friends.I truly mean it when I say I recommend this to everyone - With or without a vulva!I was perfectly happy reading this at the age of 17, but this book is for everyone who is prepubescent and older (pretty sure even 80-year olds will learn things they never knew)."
285,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57033278-ylva,1,"A 400 pages long advertisement flyer for hormonal contraception. Natural methods like NFP/FAM are not explicitly mentioned, natural methods are called unsafe and they only give an (incorrect) Pearl Index for taking your temps every day. It is also not correct that ovulation happens 2-4 days after a rise in temperature. Not recommended because of all the nonsense in there. And honestly, ""the human fetus is like an aggressive parasite""? ""thank God the body naturally aborts disabled babies (in a miscarriage), because it would be stupid to carry severely disabled babies to term anyway""?! (What about those mothers, who are ""not lucky enough"" or whose body is ""not intelligent enough"" to miscarry disabled babies? )Horrible. "
286,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43674772-fye,5,I recommend this one for all men and women. Extremely cognitive and very useful in daily life.
287,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16557651-saadik-bhanbhro,4,This is very informative book. Everyone should read. 
288,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22408185-christa-gettys,5,"This entire book blew me away! I got my sex ed in 1980 at the tender age of 10, and was shown of all things, A WALT DISNEY CARTOON! Cartoon, yes, you read that right, a cartoon on how a girl works when her period starts. So much misinformation, misogynistic information, and a whole lot of nothing burger all around!It was still pretty much the dark ages at that point. You can still find it on Youtube!!The very best thing i took out off all the amazing truths, facts, and medical information, is this...FIRST TIME SEX DOES NOT HAVE TO HURT! A woman does not need to feel tearing and bleed. The hymen has nothing to do with virginity, the hyman ""revirginates"" (my word) itself if a woman abstains for more than 2 weeks. Even a tampon can stretch a hyman - and hymens come in all different shapes and sizes (like a guys junk does- surprise surprise) That a woman MUST be properly aroused by a partner with foreplay, she must be comfortable with having sex, not all nerves or over tired or feel forced or coerced into it. To feel guilted into having sex will make it very painful and unfulfilling.We should never be ashamed of our bodies, any part of them or how they work!! As a young girl coming from a very religious upbringing, I suffered over 35 years of guilt at being hypersexual!! Even after marriage to an open minded man (who was religious as well, so he knew put tab A in slot B - push in and out a lot until you cum.) We have struggled and are still learning!! I'm freaking educating scholarly folks about this information!! One man was so taken aback, he got the book for his daughter to read...and his wife was stunned at all she never knew!I am slowly bringing these idea to my son. He is 18 but developmentally 12 (he'll catch up) but I want him to know the truth, not the lies he keeps spouting from internet buddies and such. Yeah, he squirms when mom tells him the truth to the lies. He wants to shock mom (HAHAHAHA that ain't gonna happen!) I hope that if he does ever wed, if his bride to be has about as much a clue as I did, I'll be able to give her this and perhaps we can read it together. ""Honey, if you want to have a happy sex life, we need to talk""I'm still in the same religion, only now I know better and don't fall for the guilt trips about things like masterbation being a sin. It is so natural that I even had ""wet dreams"" growing up. As a girl who woke up from intimate dreams orgasming and not having touched myself - now there was a guilt trip from hell!These gals gave the facts about everything. Every type of birth control and how best to choose. The myriad problems that can arise and how to find help. What not to do with your body.I want this book to be the sex ed go to book that every girl should read. In school sex ed, In libraries, children's sections at the bookstores. I mean girls as young as 9 are getting their periods now! So along with, 'I have two mommies', should be this book! AND it is a fantastic book for boys to read as well. I think it is written in a way that won't get boys aroused as well as won't bore them to tears (with the right person guiding them through reading it) If all boys knew how girls worked and vise versa, I think we'd all be sexually more satisfied in life.Plus as I've learned, you are never too old, and it it's not just for women (please guys educate yourselves - even if you are 50!) Knowledge is power."
289,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19036138-alexandra-d,4,"Overall a good book, especially for those who don't really know a lot about female bodies and the things that are happening on the inside. In certain topics it goes into detail (sometimes too deep), whereas they were topics that are barely mentioned and then they just switch to something else.I loved that the book talks about many aspects, hygiene, sex, STDs and STIs, even abortion, etc. It's is very meticulous but at the same time it explains well and simply so it's easy to understand.What I didn't like about it was that I found that the writers have a fixation on the Pill: to me that chapter (chapters?) was unnecessarily long and I just skipped those parts when they talked and talked about one million different studies regarding the pill's smallest side effects. It's helpful to say what those exist but I absolutely don't see the point in listing all the studies in the world that determine how many women get a headache after starting to take the contraceptive pill (and they mention a LOT of studies from MANY countries...). Everybody is unique so it won't help you if you know that X amount of women have a headache in e.g. Denmark when taking a certain type of pill. In addition, to me it was distressing to read multiple times throughout the book that they stated that having a regular menstruation cycle on its own doesn't have any advantage to a woman (I can't remember the exact phrasing but that was the essence of it). I get where they are coming from but in this day and age, when people are still in the dark when it comes to menstruation (although most of the people have the opportunity to learn if they want as a TON of information is available nowadays) it is extremely dangerous to say something like this. Yes, the blood on its own does not have positive effect on a woman's body but if you consider ALL the processes that occur in order for a female body to have a regular menstrual cycle (excluding the cases when somebody uses hormonal contraception, as it can alter the cycle of course) it is super important to have a cycle as it effects many other parts and functions of our bodies. I think they should've clarified this. Sometimes I also found the style a bit ""girly"", meaning that it was a bit hard for me to take these two women seriously, I felt like I was reading a friendly chat and not something that is coming from two professionals. Overall I liked it and it's an excellent book to get to know female bodies better, so I highly recommend it."
290,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5385976-marcella-purnama,4,"It's like reading a biology textbook, in a novel-way. Brilliant.Growing up in a developing Asian country, sex education is hushed. I remember being in primary school (or was it Junior High?), where we had this one seminar, if you'd call it that, about abstinence. That's basically it. My parents also hushed the conversation—it mostly started and ended with my Mom saying, ""Be careful with boys. Don't do it. Don't get pregnant. Girls are the ones who get the blame.""Now that I'm married, it feels like the world around sex and yes, vagina, is finally wide open. I can read about these stuffs without feeling guilty (or dirty), and honestly, I'm taken aback at how unknowledgeable I am with the biology of my own intimate body part. This books talks about the wonder down under: the technical names, period, sex, contraceptions, abortions, some diseases, and loads more. It debunks a few popular myths as well.I wish I've read this kind of book earlier, like, when I was in university. It's a wonderful book that serves like a biology textbook (meaning: it's full of facts and well-researched articles), but reads like a good nonfiction book. And I always prefer to read books instead of web articles that I don't know whether they are true or not.Recommended to all girls and women of all ages."
291,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6735671-kaitlin-stainbrook,0,"I consider myself a fairly knowledgable human when it comes to women's health topics, and since The Wonder Down Under is more of a basic overview, I wasn't sure how much there would be here for me. Although a lot of it did end up being review, it strengthened a lot of what I already knew and filled in some blanks. I feel super confident about internal female-body anatomy now (did you know that the uterus is at a 90-degree angle to the vagina?) and know more details than I previously did about various forms of birth control (did you know that both the hormonal IUD and the arm implant are more effective against pregnancy than tubal ligation?!). My biggest complaint is that the book mostly skips over menopause, which I thought was weird and made the book feel somewhat incomplete and contributed to its abrupt ending.But, if you had a patchy sex-ed experience in school or just think women's health is neat and want to strengthen your foundation in the topic, I would recommend this one. (Side-note: Though the book does acknowledge trans and NB folks, and occasionally cis-men, I would say that The Wonder Down Under is mostly talking to and about cis-women. Do with that information what you will.)"
292,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43571237-mark-syron,3,"An information-packed book that brings humor when regarding the female reproductive system. Be warned that there are pictures (well cartoon drawings) of penises, sexual situations, naked people, and do you get the gists of that. There also drawings of the vagina.You get practical information covering all aspects of the reproductive system including what is it/what are all the parts, periods/discharge, sex, contraception, abortion, and problems down below. Besides the broad stretch of information you also get little tidbits of information, for example, the clitoris gets erect (albeit much smaller) and can have episodes of erection and soft throughout the night just as a man's penis will get hard and soft.It is well written, although dry to me at times (but that could just be because I have read many human sexual books and textbooks so know a lot of the information provided). It is witty and clever and the drawings just make me laugh out loud or oh shit I hope no one walks by and sees this.This is a must-read for anyone who will be dealing or have a female reproductive system. Whether that is the holder herself, a boyfriend, or letting one know about the wonder down under."
293,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100057519-hanah-williams,1,"If you want information about STDs, contraception, the menstrual period, etc, this is a book for you. I was expecting more of a book that was eliciting empowerment of the vagina and the female form but it was a biology book. I feel this a book for teenagers and young women who are interested in sex and contraception. I wouldn't use this book as a sole resource in choosing whether any particular device is for you, but it is an informative book to be used as a stepping stone to make a better decision. I gave this one star because I felt like this was a biology book that could be used in a health class. I do think this book would be great for men to read to understand the female body, anatomy, and menstrual cycle. Any age of male would find this useful if they have a wife, daughter, or sister. Understanding the female form is necessary for a well-rounded society."
294,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51466379-morninglight-mama,4,"Like most nonfiction, this took me a long time to read, only because I'd put it down in favor of novel after novel, not because it wasn't interested, but because I'm a sucker for novels. Anyway, I buckled down and wrapped it up just before the end of the year, figuring that of all years for me to end by finishing a book about the female anatomy, the year of my hysterectomy and pelvic floor reconstruction surgery would be the perfect one. This is a fantastic resource for all women to learn in an easy-to-read format meant for the average reader. The authors covered a ton of topics, but they did it well with just enough depth to inform and educate. I highly recommend to young women, especially!"
295,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32554134-ana-curo,5,"The book should be a must read for every teenage girl and young women who want to learn more about sex, contraception and sexual disease. Also, I would recommend it to every parent (no matter if their a parent to a boy or a girl). In a warm and interesting way the authors who are two young doctors talk about everything regarding women’s reproductive organs and sexuality. They demystify what are common misperceptions of what’s OK and what’s not OK and share a warm message of acceptance trough the entire book. I wish I had read this book when I was entering sexual life. :) But I believe it’s never too late to become more self conscious about these topics.Oh, and the Croatian translation of the book is “Dolje je najbolje”. "
296,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67235153-alexandra,3,"I thought the book did not do what it said it aimed to do: give people knowledge of sexual practices.if you didn't have sex ed 4x, or weren't paying rapt attention, you probably should read this book.I learned a bunch about herpes that I didn't know - it stays in the once place you get it. HSV1 and HSV2 can be anywhere. Once you have them you can't contract them in another spot. they decrease in outbreaks as you age.also got knowledge about progesterone vs combo contraception.And got a much better description of HPV than any doctor has provided me.no menopause, prolapse, ablation/ tube tying, sexuality, how to have an orgasm, etc here."
297,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,2,"This book is fine. I am not really the target audience for it, but it does seem like it has some good information regardless.That said, it's sad that sexual health information seems to come with a very specific set of political and cultural beliefs. There were times in the book where the authors came off as either preachy or as having the kind of naivete you get when you are first coming into your own as experts on a subject - where things are very clearly black and white. Unfortunately, I think that the sort of enthusiasm it takes to write a book like this comes with the sort of naivete that makes it less than ideal to me, so it's not very uncommon."
298,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8320288-heidi,5,"Highly, highly recommended! Absolutely, totally for everyone – with or without a vagina! I enjoyed the writing, the wealth of info, the dry humor, the long list of references to science journals and medical reports compiled at the end of this book, and the humorous illustrations. I only wish there were more of those cute cartoons within the text! The earlier chapters were the most interesting to me, in which the authors explain the vagina and how it functions. So many #TIL moments. The later chapters cover contraception, pregnancy, STIs etc so they got a little clinical (but not boring or off-putting). Every teenager should be given this book. "
299,1473666902,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48443843-kirsty-bates,5,"I WISH THIS BOOK EXISTED WHEN I WAS YOUNG. In fact, I want to see this book on the school curriculum for everyone to read - vulva or no vulva.Not only is so bloody informative - it busts myths and it's frank and open - but it's also written in layman's terms, and they EVEN CRACK A JOKE sometimes. I cannot fault it at all. It's also perfect for any age. I once believed I knew a fair amount about my 'wonder down under', but some (lady) parts still took me completely by surprise. Everyone should read it, I'm telling ya."
