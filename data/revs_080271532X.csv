0,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"My meeting with this book fell considerably short of love at first sight. Not saw it on sale yesterday at a Melbourne bookstore and asked if I thought it might be interesting. I picked it up, glanced at the less-than-brilliant cover and leafed through it for a minute or two; the writing seemed lackluster and the first anecdote I found was one I'd seen before. I was about to put it back when I reconsidered. It cost $10 and was evidently an easy read. I'd always wondered what the deal was with the mysterious Poincaré conjecture. Why not find out?Well, I couldn't have more wrong: this is a truly excellent book. The bare bones of the story are easy to summarize. The Poincaré conjecture, formulated in 1900 by Henri Poincaré, states cryptically that ""every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere"". It remained an important unsolved problem for about a century, until it was proved correct by the reclusive Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman. Perelman was awarded two of the most prestigious prizes in mathematics, but turned them down.On that description it doesn't sound very interesting, but the author makes it come alive; he's done a huge amount of background reading on both the mathematics and the history, and when he puts it in its historical context you see how fascinating it is. Well over half the book is a history of geometry, starting from its foundations in antiquity with the Babylonians, Pythagoras and Euclid. O'Shea, a cultured mathematician with an intense interest in the history of his subject, gives you plenty of material on the Greeks (did you know there's a mistake in the proof of Euclid's Proposition 1?), then traces how their work was passed through the Arabs to Renaissance Europe. En route, he finds a delightful way to explain to the non-mathematicians what a ""3-sphere"" is: it turns out to be the shape of the universe as described in Dante's Divine Comedy, two sets of concentric spheres mystically joined at their common surface. He illustrates with a famous picture from Doré:As he progresses towards the present day, he finds opportunities to introduce the other terms that will eventually be used in the Conjecture, and the narrative starts to focus in on the key concepts: manifolds, connectedness, topology and, above all, non-Euclidean geometry. This is the clearest overview of the subject I've ever seen, and he has a whole bunch of stories and observations I hadn't come across before. One thing I found particularly remarkable was the long guerilla war waged by the 19th century German mathematicians against Kant's conceptions of geometry. I have had several discussions with philosophically knowledgeable people on this site about Einstein's claim to have refuted Kant. What I didn't realize was that it was just the final battle in a campaign that had gone on for a century. Gauss laid the groundwork, but thought it was so controversial that he couldn't publish: at least in Germany, it wasn't possible to openly say that Kant was wrong, and non-Euclidean geometries made perfectly good sense. But other great mathematicians - Riemann, Lobachevsky and Bolyai - found the same ideas, and they gradually came out in the open. Einstein finished it off: not only is it logically possible that the space we live in might be non-Euclidean, it actually happens to be true! Another remarkable story from the end of this period is the intense rivalry between the German Klein (who, I learned, married Hegel's granddaughter) and the French Poincaré, a professional duel which so exhausted them that they both suffered nervous breakdowns as a result. O'Shea, who knows both French and German, includes lovely quotations from their correspondence. By the time we reach 1900 and the formulation of the Conjecture, it all makes perfect sense, and it's obvious why the problem captivated several generations of top mathematicians. I was worried that the last third would be anticlimactic, but my fears again turned out to be groundless. O'Shea hardly loses momentum at all as he goes into the finishing stretch, which involves explaining some horribly difficult mathematics; once again, he finds clever visual analogies to make the esoteric technique of Ricci flow seem reasonable and intuitive. It's obviously impossible to give us the details of Perelman's proof, but he successfully conveys both its general outline and the process which led to its acceptance by the world mathematical community.At the end, there is the tantalizing mystery: why did Perelman turn down the huge prizes he'd won, and what was the even larger discovery he hinted at, which would make the Poincaré conjecture no more than a stepping stone? If this had been a novel, I would have groaned at the author's unsubtle attempt to set up a sequel, but oddly enough it happens to be real life. Stranger than fiction, you know."
1,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"So – the shape of the universe. It’s a giant ball, right? Especially when you think of its beginning in a big bang. But that brings up the awkward question of what’s outside the ball. Space (universe) is not infinite. It’s believed to be finite, but without a boundary. It becomes easier to understand this if you consider two-dimensional beings living in a spherical (the two-dimensional surface of a ball) universe. Their universe is finite, but has no boundaries. There are no edges, and if they start off from one point and keep going in the same direction they’ll come back to where they started. Our universe is finite and without boundary in the same way. If you get on a spaceship and keep going in the same direction, eventually you’ll be back in the same neighborhood! This one is harder to imagine, isn’t it? In the case of two-dimensional people living on a sphere, we can see how it can be finite but without boundary because we can see how the sphere bends in a third dimension. But how is it for our three-dimensional universe? There’s no fourth dimension to bend in. Reading this book didn’t make it any easier for me to really understand how the universe can be finite but without a boundary. All I can do is quote the two-dimensional analogy, but I’m still a three-dimensional earthling. But even assuming that the universe is finite and without boundary – is it a three-sphere? To go back to the two-sphere analogy, just because Magellan sailed in the same direction and came back to where he started doesn’t mean that the earth is a sphere. It can also be doughnut shaped, and the same would still happen. No one really knows what the shape of the universe is. There’s a lot of evidence for it being flat (whatever that means). And the Poincare Conjecture: It says that a finite, no-boundary space that is “simply connected” is a three-sphere. This question is obviously of great interest both to mathematicians and to the physicists studying the geometry of the universe. (We still don’t know if the universe is “simply connected” or not. A ball is simply connect, but something like a doughnut is not simply connected.) Unlike Reimann’s Hypothesis, the Poincare Conjecture was finally proved after much heartbreak and agony – by an eccentric Russian mathematician named Gregori Perelman who didn’t even accept the award for it. The book tells the story of the conjecture and the man who proved it. Good pop-science and math history. "
2,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/168143-steven,1,"There was some explanation earlier in the book, but later explanation was poor. I came away with little understanding of how the Poincare conjecture was solved. The book was a disappointment, but did provide a reference to book by Jeffrey Weeks that might offer better layman-level explanations of topological concepts."
3,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14201179-daniel-wright,4,"Why is this book not more widely read? It's at least as good as books like Fermat's Last Theorem, with far more mathematical content. If any layman wants a glimpse into the world of top-level mathematics, I cannot recommend a better book."

It was exciting to read about the first one to be solved. I never took topology in college, though, so I have to admit that much of this went right over my head. If you wanted to know without reading all the math, yes, the Poincare conjecture turned out to be true. Pretty cool stuff!"
5,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41912303-vil-m-zouhar,3,"This book was in the 'mathematics' section in the library and I was expecting something more mathematics focused. Hence I was disappointed by the history lesson this book turned out to be. Except for the initial confusion, it was a nice read."
6,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/138600-sean,5,As a recent grad student in mathematics I found this book incredibly interesting. It made me want to go on and get my Ph.D. in manifold theory.
7,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14196927-santiago-f-moreno-solana,4,"The fact is I would need infinitive (sets of) lifes to read all the books I want and (another set of) infinitive lifes to put into practice everything I read in all the books I would achieve to read in those other (infinite sets of) lifes (certainly, an infinite number of books). And yet, I would need an infinite memory to recall all the things I learn from them and correct, maybe, all the infinite (sets of) mistakes I would make during my infinite learning. If infinite books available, I might not be able to start anew with the first book, but having enough (infinite) time, who knows? Life would be infinite, even if memory would not.I finished this book with a feeling of satisfaction, with the great pleasure of having touched, albeit with the points of my fingers, the fascinating world of topology and geometry and while I want to learn more I get the feeling I will not have enough time in this life to grasp this incredible world it's been opened to me to understand all the nuancies, not even the most simple ones. It is a very sad moment to realise this life is simply much too short to discover all the beauty hidden behind the walls of ignorance.This is a fascinating book casting the search for a solution for an unsurmountable (until Perelman arrived, of course) and difficult (extremely difficult) problem, for performing the task of solving an open question (well, rather a conjecture) posed by Poincaré (one of the greatest mathematicians in history) in the last page of his last work on topology ('analysis situs'): the Poincaré's conjecture.I knew little about topology and geometry before reading the book and after reading the book I want more (as a physicist I have the right to say I was ignorant before reading the book, but I remain ignorant as well after the reading and this is quite disatisfying).So many brilliant minds failed and then, out of the blue (well, a blue which is not at all such looking at the brilliant background of the 'solver' and his career), one clear mind (Perelman, of course) came from the cold (Russia) with modesty and right attitude, a bold mind who, after solving such Conjecture, went back to his cave from where he came from to never show up, after saying something similar to 'hey world, look what I leave for the future of maths. Just some notes for you to read. By the way, I got solved the Poincaré's conjecture, but please leave me alone. I was just playing Sudoku. Thank you very much'.I loved and read with great pleasure the way the author presented the very difficult concepts and math topics to later give a sucint explanation of what was solved by Perelman actually. I loved to read the historical overview surrounding the lifes and circumstances, the diffculties and disappointments the many great mathematicians suffere, the context and the background, human and mathematical, until a Russian mathematician came to fill in the void. If this is not a fascinating story then you really don't have a sense for beauty and the misterious ways you may need to arrive at it.At times, reading was difficult. Mathematical concepts are not easy to explain for the layman, but the author achieves, when necessary, almost always, to use the correct explanation, find the correct example or comparison, to use the right words a clear mind would need to use and an average mind would need to understand. Enlightning and absolutely recommendable."
8,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18216012-daniel-cunningham,3,"This was a decent book, but a bit of a hard read.Firstly, the book introduces many concepts by name, with some short descriptions, and then goes on to discuss them in some qualitative detail; how one concept leads to another; how concepts fail to connect. For me, at least, this was difficult to follow. Granted, in order to truly understand what is being discussed, you would need to understand the mathematics; perhaps this is just an insurmountable problem in trying to translate high-level and difficult mathematics into lay-language.Secondly, there are too many sections where names and dates and attempted proofs of such-and-such a conjecture/theory/etc. are listed; in these sections it very much feels like the only people who would be able to pull much meaning would be already quite familiar with the topics. There is much more of this in the last third or quarter of the book.The middle 85% of the book isn't about the Poincare Conjecture per se. In this, I would describe the book as the history of mathematicians and mathematics, from ancient times to today, as told from the point of view of the Poincare Conjecture. An analogy might be something like a book that details the life of some famous figure by telling the history of their family/ancestry and the times and events their family lived through."
9,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716528-chris,2,"This book was about as painful as reading the book of Genesis: its pages mostly comprise a chronological list of mathematicians (""and so-and-so's work begot so-and-so's thesis""...) interspersed with definitions sans explanation or example (a group, a ring, etc.). The highlights were the only occasional example of geometry in mathematical physics or when the author found time to elaborate a little more on an interesting property of a certain metric or surface structure. In fact, the best part of the book is the final two sentences that state (for about the 5th time but with the most clarity) the thesis of the book as defined by its title. Good grief."

Not a daunting read, easily understood and very clear explainations.Takes some imagination and thinking to get ones mind around the concepts discussed but all in all an awesome book. One of my favorite when it comes to popular science. Its kind of like a ""history of topology"", ""story of a frustrating problem and the journey to its solution"" and discussion between you and the author about what topology really is about all wrapped into one book. "
11,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1087636-richard,5,"I originally purchased this book to learn more about Gregory Perelman and the fields medal he turned down, but over the course of the book you get such a detailed explanation of the history of math, that I spent just as much time in wikipedia as I did reading this book.

Poincare himself is only present for about 1/10th of the book. It's more of a very brief history of geometry and topology than a treatment of the problem.Also, the resolutions of the images in the book are so poor it's as if the publisher printed out jpegs and made Xeroxes of them."

20,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7532432-nicholas,3,"The goal of this book, as stated, was to outline the buildup to and eventual solution of the Poincare conjecture in a way that non-mathematicians would be able to follow. As someone who studied some graduate math, I feel comfortable saying that O'Shea partially achieved his goal. Definitely my passing familiarity with some of the topics mentioned made my reading of the book easier. Since even with that understanding I simply passed by some of the content, there are parts that a non-mathematician will have to skim.However, there are a lot of good details on the personalities and biographies of the various mathematicians in the story of this conjecture, and great inclusion the interplay of the relevant historical events with the growth and decline of various academic institutions. Tracking one major concept in mathematics to write about the history of mathematics generally is overall a good formula, pun intended. Best of all was the introduction of the timeline in the reference at the end, because it clearly laid out the author's plan for the book (""The narrative of develops the following three interlocking themes...""). It's as if he included a notecard on which he'd planned his book. Although this might have been better expanded into a full-fledged introduction chapter.One major complaint I have is the use of endnotes rather than footnotes because of the way they are used in this book. First, about half of the endnotes actually contain comments that might be interesting or enlightening in reading, which is when I feel they should be included as footnotes, so they might be read without needed to flip back and forth. Second, as the other half are just the citations, flipping to the back hoping for more information and only finding a citation is very distracting, and could be avoided with footnotes (quick glance - nothing to note - return back up the page)."
21,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27131192-arko,5,"The book encapsulates the fascinating journey of mathematical development centered around topological concepts that led to a conjecture in the early 1900s by the great French mathematician Henri Poincaré. According to this conjecture , every simply connected closed 3 dimensional manifold is topologically similar to a 3-sphere. The author carefully presents the concepts and reiterates them wherever needed through out the book for laymen interested in mathematics. The author knits the socio-political environment in various era of breakthrough in mathematics done by talented minds from pre-Socratic times , through Arabic mediaeval and European Enlightenment period followed by the 19th and 20th century era of topological maestroes like Gauss, Reimann , Poincaré, Klein, Hilbert, Veblen, Dehn, Smale ,Thurston, Hamilton till the final proof of the Poincaré conjecture by the eccentric and brutally dedicated mathematician Gregori Perelman. The world was stunned when Perelman declined the prestigious Fields medal and even the Millennium prize of million dollars only reserved to be awarded to those who solves the seven important unsolved problems in mathematics of which Poincaré conjecture was one being unsolved for about a century and so far the only one to be moved to the rank of a theorem. Perelman seemed to have valued his successful results more than the limelight of awards.The book goes beyond only telling the historical achievements of mathematical rigour. The author specifies the need of a sense of ethics and morality to go along with the rigour to pursue strict mathematical proofs. It is a book worthy of wide readership."
22,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20454189-al-maki,0,"Notice that the subtitle is ""in search of the shape of the universe,"" not ""the shape of the universe"". The book is about what mathematicians have been able to determine about the shape and that is not very specific: it's all connected, it's finite, it has no boundary. So even though it's finite and you could go anywhere in it, you would never get to the end of it. A counter-intuitive idea, but the book presents some comprehensible possibilities of how that might work. I very much enjoyed it for that, but mathematics is hard to put into words and sometimes you run into things like the following.""He reinterpreted the numbers that Betti had considered, nowadays called Betti numbers, by introducing equations between submanifolds of a manifold, called homologies on a manifold that expressed the relation of bounding within the manifold.""If that isn't clear, don't blame yourself."

Reading about the history of the topology and interactions between famous mathematicians, such as Gauss, Riemann, and Klein, got me excited about mathematics research. Around half of the book is history on the topic and the other half is on the actual mathematics behind the Poincare Conjecture. After reading this book, I had the pleasure of meeting with the author and discussing his research. The Poincare Conjecture is a lovely book, but Dr. O'Shea is an even lovelier man."
32,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6968193-jake,4,"Preview: I will preface this by saying that my knowledge of topology is limited. I am a computer science undergrad, who learned most of my topology from Tadashi Tokieda's set of lectures that can be found on African Institute for Mathematical Sciences' youtube page, various sources scattered on the internet and messing around in Wolfram Alpha with examples. I've found it incredibly useful in helping me understand proofs in other mathematical disciplines. Bolyai & Reimann section stood out to me as particularly heartwarming. As an undergrad who just had to endure integral calculus I made an immediate connection to the gravity of the scientific discovery covered in those sections. I will admit that during the course, the importance of Riemann's discoveries had not dawned on me. The gambit of calculus I've had to endure to get to the math I want to focus on was disappointing to me during that quarter, but those sections really gave me a different perspective on that difficulty.Computation in mathematics is not immediately intuitive for myself and concepts come far before successful computation, with it being a subject that has me expending far more energy in it that my peers to get good grades. This book for that reason was quite approachable. It offers a rigorous enough introduction to the layman to appreciate Topology but doesn't hold your hand enough to do injustice to the science. O'Shea could have done with some edits though. The front half of the book read better than the second half, with the latter sections dragging on. This is no doubt due to the density of science being done in recent times and the fact that it is so much more well recorded. I don't blame O'Shea but it is a fault of the text. While the second half dragged on, the connection back to Reimann's lecture of Perelman's lecture that covered the conjecture was touching. This book is well worth the read if you're willing to do some work."
33,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8908897-joseph,3,I found this a somewhat approachable book about crazy difficult mathematics. There is plenty of easy reading about the lives and the history of math and an journalistic account of the story of the refusal of the million dollar prize when this conjecture was proven by 2006. I was a math major in college and I found topology very difficult and did not study non-Euclidian geometry either. These are two of the basic areas of study involved in the conjecture but the basic idea the author conveys is how discovering the shape of the earth is a similar project to discovering the shape of the universe.One can make flat maps of the earth's surface and can put them together to figure out the shape of our three dimensional globe. But in alternate science fiction worlds earth could have been shaped like a donut or an infinite cylinder until we explored the poles. We experience the world in three dimensions but as Einstein showed space is not Euclidean - the shortest lines in space are not necessarily the lines we think of from high school geometry. So we can explore space and make three dimensional maps of our explorations and put them all together and we may find that the universe has a multi-dimensional curve to it.
34,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1025214-whitney,5,"This book was recommended to me by my husband. Wanting to understand more about his work as a topologist, I agreed to read this book. I found it very interesting. I liked learning about the history of this conjecture, and how Perelman came up with his proof. I found most of the information presented in a way that allowed for a non-mathematician to understand what was being discussed. I admit, some of the math was beyond me, but on the whole, it was understandable. While I preferred the history portion of the book, I thought there was a good balance between the history and the math used to explain the conjecture.I liked the way O'Shea explained the math. I thought he did a decent job making it understandable to the average reader without making it seem too dumbed down or over the top popular science. I found much of the material interesting, and I liked that it would bring up a lot of fascinating thought and discussion points. There is also a great section of notes in the back if you desire to learn more about some of the topics discussed in the book."
35,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7316023-ron,3,"This is a terrific read. It must be read as a historical introduction to the subject, rather than an effective explanation for the nonmathematician. There are simply too many terms containing highly specialized jargon that are tossed about for a nonspecialist to follow effectively.That said, there is a very nice story spun here, about the commotion caused by the solution of a very hard problem in the math community. The origin of the problem, as well as the people involved, are brought to life well enough. Unfortunately, the hero of the story, Grigory ""Grisha"" Perelman, is given somewhat short shrift, given the magnitude of his achievement. I admittedly learned more of Perelman through a New Yorker article in 2006 than I did in this book.That said, the book successfully got me thinking about topology and the shape of our universe. It was also neat to see my diffrential geometry prof. spoken of very positively in the book."
36,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/445677-scott,1,"This book was Donal O'Shea's first work for a popular audience. Unfortunately, his style does not get beyond what the popular audience might expect from an Ivy-League professor specializing in topology. His writing style alternated breezy sections on the personalities of mathematicians and the state of their contemporary world with dense, barely comprehensible (to the non-mathematical layman) sections describing the mathematics leading up to the Poincare Conjecture and its proof. I found it readable but hard to follow, and difficult to maintain my interest. With only 260 or so pages of text, I could not read it through. While it may reward close reading with an understanding of mathematical insights, there are many better authors who make such understanding less of a chore. I cannot recommend it for its intended audience."
37,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16177673-chelsea-m,3,"I felt like the title was a little misleading. The Poincare conjecture is only mentioned in the last few chapters, and the majority of the book is taken up by going over the history of mathematics and topology. I've already read a number of books on mathematics, so I found this somewhat repetitive. However, I did like this book. It accomplishes what I consider to be the single most important goal of a book about a mathematical problem: making me understand what the problem actually is, and how it was solved (if applicable). This book doesn't go into too much detail about Perelman's proof, but it told me enough to satisfy me. Too often, books fail at this goal; the author either underestimates the reader's mathematical ability and assumes a thorough explanation would be beyond them, or they err on the opposite side and uses 'obvious' shortcuts that are anything but."
38,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27179763-snoakes,4,"I assume that as you've read past the title, then you have embraced your inner nerd. Because you'll need to be quite nerdy to appreciate this book (I've given it four stars - says quite a lot about me).Many moons ago I scraped a third class degree in maths. As a result I am awed by people who can understand this stuff, let alone make the mental leaps required to make the advances described in this book. I couldn't get my head completely around some of the concepts, but the maths comes in short bursts (there is more detail in the notes at the back if your nerdiness demands it). The rest of it is about the history of the problem and the mathematicians involved and how, as they say, they built on the shoulders of giants. Donal O'Shea's enthusiasm for his subject shines through."
39,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35241629-milad,1,"The first quarter of the book gives you a lot of cool info on the shape of the universe, Grigori Perelman, and Poincare. But that's it! Because after that, it begins throwing some really unnecessary paragraphs (and chapters) on the biography of the people. That's what I hate about this book: unnecessary information. Some sections are completely unneeded and even most of the times, it's somewhere you don't expect it to be, right in the middle of a serious work!Perhaps it's because I'm a math major myself and I was looking for a couple of formulas and equations to explain it all. Anyways, I've picked up a topology class this term and I'll figure it out more intellectually and more exact."
40,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40116144-dan-adelman,0,"I think it'd be unfair of me to give this book a star rating, since I really had a hard time understanding it. That may be more a reflection of me than the book, and I wouldn't want to drag down its average.I will say that I am pretty comfortable with math books written for a lay audience. I had no issues with Fermat's Last Theorem (Simon Singh), Journey through Genius (William Dunham), or the Golden Ratio (Mario Livio). So I'd say if you already have a little background in topology (which I do not), this book may very well be great. But if you're looking for an introduction to the subject just to know what the Poincare Conjecture is all about (as I was) and how it was solved, this book may not be helpful to you."
41,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1401974-toby,3,"A pretty good discussion of the Poincare Conjecture and its history. I found the historical discussions more interesting than the mathematical discussions since the mathematics is on the technical side, requiring the reader to remember a lot of technical terms. More pictures and examples would probably have helped.I was also left wanting to know more about Perelman himself. As apparently most other people do, Donal O'Shea makes Perelman's reclusive personality part of the story, and this is where a good biographer or journalist could probably have added done a better job. "
42,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/938829-chastity,4,"I really enjoyed this book, but it dragged a little through some of the biographies of mathematicians. Also, if you have a feel for math you'll enjoy the book even if you didn't study a lot of mathematics in college. That also might make some of the explanations in the first half of the book a little too lengthy. Overall a well-written book on the history of math and the mathematicians that contributed to the knowledge that allowed such a conjecture to be formulated, and the ultimate ability to prove it."
43,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5516573-robert,4,"An easy to read introduction to the historical and substantive background of one of the most important conjectures in mathematics. The Poincare Conjecture was proved by Grigori Perelman in 2002, who won a Millennium Prize, as well as the Fields Medal for his work. He rejected both awards. The ""conjecture"" (now a theorem) has important consequences regarding the shape of the universe. It states that a 3-dimensional manifold which is compact, has no boundary and is simply connected must be homeomorphic to a 3-dimensional sphere. What this means is explained carefully in the book. "
44,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2672686-matt-musselman,4,"Not an easy book, but it succeeded in bringing some really challenging higher-order math principles to a layman like me in a consciousness-changing way. I had read a lot about the curvature of space-time in books about Einsteinian physics, but I guess I always felt it was a conceptual analogy and never grasped that our universe is indeed finite and has a ""shape,"" and then to contemplate what mathematical tools we would need to figure out which of several shapes it actually is. The insights into mathematics history and culture were also really enlightening."
45,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/210421-bart,4,"Surprisingly enjoyable.Looking up at the night sky, at the distant stars and galaxies and clusters of galaxies, it is inconceivable to me that there are not other intelligences out there, some far different than us. Hundreds of years hence, if we ever develop technologies that enable us to meet and to communicate, we will discover that they will know, or want to know, that the only compact three-dimensional manifold in which every loop can be shrunk to a point is a three-sphere. Count on it. (p. 200)"
46,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2978936-leroy,2,"Topology is a lot harder than it may seem to some. The second half of this book was completely over my head. I gave the book two stars because the ratings are based on my subjective personal experience in reading it (""it was ok""), but it is clearly an expertly written book on an extremely complex topic. I don't know whether it is possible to dumb it down, so to speak, to make these concepts more accessible, but I imagine I would enjoy such a book more."
47,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1118264-william,3,"Even though I graduated in Mathematics, I never really delved into topology. The book was a mixture of interesting pieces and portions that were hard to understand, but overall a good history of the evolution of mathematical thought. I'd probably rate it higher if I'd been able to read it in a few days -- unfortunately schedules were such that it took me four months to complete."
48,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1140777-rob,3,"A bit slow going at first, with what I guess was a necessary background for those that don't know what it means for an n-dimensional manifold to be homeomorphic to another n-dimensional manifold. However, once it got into the history of the development of topology and especially the life of Poincare it became much more interesting."
49,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3903826-dallas,5,"Not many people can turn the pusuits of a reclusive Russian living with his mother in a bug-infested St. Petersburg apartment into a story of wonderment, but O'Shea gives a good development of the background leading up to Perelman's proof; the detail is what really makes this a good read. Now if only someone can figure out Riemann's hypothesis... "
50,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4231247-david,2,"Despite being written for a non-mathematical audience, it was quite confusing. I enjoyed the history sections but got lost in most of the topology. I only finished it because I have a really hard time starting a book and not finishing it. Someone who doesn't have at least a basic interest in math will probably not enjoy this book."
51,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/756878-kristin-mcphillips,3,"Inspiring. Picked this up at a used book store because I wanted to learn about the shape of the universe. Turns out its more about math history. I definitely have a better understanding of the poincare conjecture and it's proof, and it's a great story it's just not as sciency as I thought it would be"
52,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1123669-david,3,"A bit more mathy than the introduction suggested, but what the heck, I was a math major, so I could handle it.Good explanation of the conjecture itself, together with the history of the underlying mathematics surrounding its development and solution."
53,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6265983-gina,4,"This book was fascinating. It's a good read for mathematicians and lay readers alike. It provides a good overview of the Poincare Conjecture, history and attempts to solve it along with an interesting biography of Poincare. "
54,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6622183-haider-a,3,"This is a nice book that is about many thing, mostly geometry and the mathematical work of Poincare. Unfortunately, the title of the book is missleading, I have expected to read more about how the conjecture was proved, but I ended up trying to remember what the conjecture was all about."
55,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6265174-erickson,4,"Good introduction to Poincare Conjecture as well as some mathematics surrounding it. However, it contains a little too much of historical accounts and contexts in which the conjecture was made, thus making this book less informative mathematically than expected."
56,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50165670-steve-barker,4,First couple of chapters hard going but necessary to understand if you are to comprehend the theme of the book. Interesting mix of the science of topology mixed with a history of its most important players.
57,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/955424-rtm-taylor-manning,3,"Oh goodness. I haven't felt this incapable in a long time. It's very well written, and I still couldn't wrap my head around some of the topology."
58,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134026-malini-sridharan,3,"I think I get what's in the book, but I feel like I would not get the things he left out. I can, however, feel the absence. I am going to have to ask some math people about it."
59,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18622-doug,2,"Found it to be very confusing, and maybe it's because I'm simply not smart enough to understand 3-spheres, complex topologies, and n-dimensional space, but I blame the book."
60,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6435933-derek,5,Great story about the solution to one of the millenium problems in mathematics.It would probably take me at least a year to understand his solution.
61,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14240252-dendi,5,the best book ever in contemporary mathematics
62,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23222383-imran,5,Literary a gem. Scientifically great.

64,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9735055-tess,4,"I really enjoyed this book as a slightly more challenging general audience book on mathematics and topology. I love reading books about quantum physics, cosmology and maths. I usually find history quite boring and I'm also starting to find myself reading the same material in different books but this one game me new insights and was very enjoyable to read. I found this other review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) to be very accurate and helpful because I also dismissed the book on first skim read, thinking it would be a bit too basic. After reading the review below I gave it a crack anyway and just as the review said I was pleasantly surprised. Now I am on the hunt for more books like this that are for the general audience but a little more of a challenging read. "
65,080271532X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87385252-peter-man,0,Not for the faint of heart. It's good for people who are interested in mathematics and the development of the human intellect.
