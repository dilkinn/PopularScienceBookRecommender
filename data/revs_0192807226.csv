It was almost like a detective novel! The fact that it was probably the seventh or eighth book on symmetry I had read by then makes this all the more surprising and shows how well the author does his job.The book describes how the largest ever mathematical proof was solved by hundreds of mathematicians over many, many pages of proofs. Sounds dry? It's not! This history goes back to the beginnings of group theory, and runs all the way through to quite recent times. It includes some very interesting discussions of the personalities involved.Highly recommended!"
1,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714801-yael,5,"The hero of this book, the Monster of Symmetry, is a giant snowflake that requires 196,884 dimensions to describe it. Rather than being a mere mathematical curiosity, its structure points to deep connections between symmetry, number theory, and mathematical physics. Ultimately it may help us come to understand the fabric of our universe -- or even the infinite multiverse.This is the story of the quest to discover the Monster. Beginning in revolutionary France in the 1830s, it takes the reader up to the present day -- and beyond. Mark Ronan describes the driving determination, odd coincidences, and extraordinary people that were drawn into what became the greatest collaboration in the history of mathematics. He describes how the study of simple, regular shapes led to the whole field of simple groups, and the search for the basic nuts and bolts of symmetry. The hunt for the Monster began to classify all these nuts and bolts, the ""atoms"", of symmetry, and this bold project began to accelerate after World War II as new methods were devised to fill in the gaps in the classification, in the same way that chemists and physicists worked to fill out the Periodic Table of the Chemical Elements. The quest involves shapes in numerous dimensions, weird multi-crystals, and different ways of packing spheres that now underlie a good deal of modern technology. But some mathematical entities just don't fit the scheme, and the biggest, most bad-assed member of these outlaws was the Monster. As mathematicians drew ever-nearer to it, this dazzling entity's sheer scale and complexity became clear.But mathematicians are still struggling to grasp the nature of the Monster. Given the extraordinary links between it and the deep physical form of the universe, it will become far more important in the future than we realize even now, a piece of 22nd- or 23rd-century mathematics arriving by chance in the 20th century, hinting at answers to questions not yet asked, which may not be asked for decades or even centuries. When we finally understand the nature of the Monster, we will probably thereby open up a whole new, far more profound vista of the nature of physical reality."
2,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/381736-dav,5,"I have to give this one five stars, if for no other reason because it was the book I was reading when I finally started to understand group theory. It covered the history and importance of this branch of mathematics much the same as Why Beauty Is Truth: The Story of Symmetry but in a more concise manner. Another difference is this book was thematically structured around the development of a particularly interesting artifact of group theory known as the Monster (this is actually what mathematicians call it by the way, due to its sheer unprecedented size). I think using a concrete example throughout the discourse was a good choice. Ronan also chose well to sometimes stop the progression and say ""let's remember how we got here,"" proceeding to review the series of discoveries for a few paragraphs that led to a certain new advance.I had been prepared to never understand group theory. For all I knew, it wasn't something that someone with a lack of formal math education (beyond calculus 20 years ago) was capable of learning from just reading books without a teacher. But somewhere halfway through this book things started to click into place a little bit. After that the book became immensely more enjoyable since I could follow along with the challenges and successes of the researchers with a significantly more understanding.It is an interesting story, and something that surely will be of particular importance to understanding the future we will be experiencing in the coming decades. I don't ever want to be the typical post middle-age person who has checked out of modern times just because they couldn't keep up with the scientific advances, and I am more convinced than ever that a basic understanding of group theory is going to be necessary for any hope of hanging on."
3,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5226097-bojan-tunguz,5,"One of the greatest achievements of the 20th century mathematics has been the classification of the finite simple groups. Groups are mathematical objects that tells us about symmetries, and like many other mathematical objects they are relatively easy to describe, but can be fiendishly difficult to fully understand. Sometimes understanding comes from a single brilliant insights by an incredibly gifted individual, and these individuals become part of the mathematical lore that can even touch upon the popular imagination. However, most of the time these days the game of mathematics has become complex enough that it can become increasingly difficult for any individual to fully contribute to on its own to the full problem. Professional mathematicians don't mind this at all: they thrive in collaborations and feed off of each other's work and enthusiasm. The collaborative nature of mathematics is at full display when it comes to the classification of finite simple groups, an effort that spanned hundreds of articles in scientific journals between 1955 and 1983. I have always been curious to find out more about this enterprise, and this book does a remarkable job at presenting it to the general reader. It is comprehensive without becoming technically hard to follow. Anyone who has ever taken a college level mathematics course should be able to read it without much difficulty, although some basic understanding of group theory and modern algebra would be great bonus. The book also doesn't dumb down mathematics to the point that it becomes irritating for those who have some mathematical sophistication, so even professional scientists and mathematicians can find it very informative and a rewarding read. And if you are curious, the Monster from the title refers to the special simple finite group that has been one of the most fascinating mathematical objects discovered so far. "
4,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/200773-bretbenesh,4,"It was good, and it made me more interested in learning more about some of the sporadic simple groups (this is pretty close to my field of research).The best points: it provides a good history of finite group theory and is an engaging read. I think that he also does a good job making the technical mathematics accessible to the layperson.I have two complaints:1. In order to retain my membership as a pedantic mathematician, I will point out that he says that he says the order of the alternating group on n letters increases ""exponentially"" as n gets larger. This is false, although I understand that people are starting to commonly mis-use the word ""exponentially.""2. I lost track of the number of times Ronan says, ""We will hear more about _____ later."" It seems that this would be a result of poor organization, although the lives of these group theorists intersect so much that it would probably be impossible to avoid (although he could have simply let us find out that we will learn more about _____ on a couple of these occasions).These are pretty minor points."
5,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5932356-tim-robinson,4,"On second reading, I've downgraded this book from five stars to four. Towards the end the maths dries up and the story becomes one of names, dates and places. I'm feeling brave enough to tackle some more technical details but they are lacking. What is the ""next book up"" on this topic?"
6,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2369794-chris,4,"With some warts, Ronan has nearly achieved the holy grail of mathematics exposition: (1) short, (2) readable, (3) about mathematical objects of significance and interest.While the book has significant flaws, I give it 4/5 because the writing is clear enough for a non-mathematician, and there are so few of those in existence. Bad marks for supposed applicability of the ideas to the real world (including the usual demons of quantum physics, binary arithmetic = computers, and coding theory [which, see http://neilsloane.com/doc/Me109.pdf, users found gzip to be good enough and didn’t need the theoretically superior Leech lattice]), and nerd-machismo (Sophus Lie’s coke-bottle eyeglass rims are somehow muscular; chaired professors are cited for their intellectual immortality, when in reality most people don’t care at all about these 19th-century academic chairs or their works). Ronan also displays a scant understanding of history by, for example, using exactly one source for his entire chapter on Sophus Lie. But, whatever: it’s better that he clearly understands, and very clearly explains, the actually interesting mathematics --- which, in every other case, a non-mathematician would mis-explain.If you wonder if mathematics is interesting or not, give Ronan a read. You should be able to understand the interesting structures he describes, and the amount of physics and Bell Labs mysticism is soft-pedalled much more than the rest of the genre."
7,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9114047-wanda,3,"Ronan paints a fascinating historical perspective of the mathematical developments that lead up to the discovery of the Monster, as well as the ""Moonshine"" connections to other domains (e.g. number theory, string theory). However, I felt that although Ronan's enthusiasm for the topic is supreme and his passion for explaining the mathematical process shines, the writing of this book lacked polish and the analogies used were not clear; as a math enthusiast, I was able to recall enough of the theory of finite groups to understand where he was trying to go with his analogies and to flesh out details that were glossed over. My interest in the subject has definitely been piqued, and I was able to find some papers which provide a more technical survey of this topic, such as Moonshine by Duncan, Griffin, and Ono."
8,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59022055-basement-dweller,3,"A fun read that will likely get you at least somewhat interested in group theory. But the book uses analogies to talk about the ideas of the mathematical concepts rather than directly explaining them. If I were to explain something like addition in a similar manner that Ronan sometimes explains things in his book it might sound like this: it is an operation that takes two numbers and combines them to create another. It’s good because it doesn’t complicate things usually, but can end up sounding way too vague, leaving you just as confused as you would have been if he had just explained it. But still, I recommend this book as it is genuinely interesting and you will learn about groups, their symmetry, the monster, and the stories of the mathematicians who discovered them. It’s a goof introduction to group theory and has driven me to want to find out more about the topic."
9,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64462162-hyung-mook-kang,3,"Last three to four chapters are the most important chapters in this book. The rest are about mainly introducing the concept of group and Lie groups, with a slight of a monster. He tried to explain as best as he could about the concept of the simple group, but ended up repeating again and again that simple group is the group that is so ""simple"". This book basically tells you that there are mysterious connections between monster, modular form, and vertex operator algebra, to which the connection is called the Moonshine."
10,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13935777-gregory,4,This is a well written book especially considering the abstract nature of the material. I personally would have liked a little more detail on things. Maybe a description of four group families that have a Euclidean description. Though I don't think this would have be good for most readers. Most of the time when I would wish he would explain something it would appear in a few pages. So he addressed most of my criticisms before the book ended.
11,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70719710-ookami,4,"A well written book in the sense of understandable to someone with some interest and understanding of mathematics and history. Abstract mathematics is a help. The book is an interesting story of connections. Sometimes it feels like things are glossed over and the book could have contained both more history and technical explanations (perhaps more illustrations and examples). Still, I found it an enjoyable read over 2 days and an introduction to an interesting phenomenon"
12,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60049338-nigel-mcfarlane,4,"This describes the journey from the origins of group theory to the discovery of ""The Monster"" - a gigantic multi-dimensional symmetry that completed the classification of the groups. The biographical details are fascinating and frequently very sad, particularly when they concern the destruction wrought on German mathematics by the Nazis."
13,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8794821-mark,4,"I enjoyed the birds-eye view of strange connections between areas within mathematics and physics. His explanations lost me a few times, but it was well worth the read."
14,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54528449-glenn,4,"Laymen can read this book guilt-free. Mark Ronan has provided an excellent insight to undergrad Math students on the workings of those people in Math careers. Excellent writing, Mark!"
15,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,3,Goes into great detail on the project to classify the simple groups.
16,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9387204-jonathan-widell,3,"Too bad the book omits the obvious reference to ""the shoulders of giants"". What did I get out of the book? I found it fascinating to see how scientific discovery evolves in practice over centuries. It takes an oddball here and an oddball there to get the best results. Sometimes you go back to old books to find out what other have found out before you. Ronan provides a partly first-person account of this endeavour called Monsters and Moonshine and, while doing so, gives some valuable insights into how mathematical discovery takes place: for instance, you rarely have a mathematical research team but do your research individually, which is a pain, while acknowledging any help you have received from for example your thesis supervisor; you have to come up with a theorem if you wish to be immortal, and so on. The material Ronan provides is anecdotal. Those passages are fun to read but do not amount to real eye-openers. The book is at its strongest when it takes the bird's eye view and recounts how an idea has evolved over time. A couple of times Gauss is quoted as making the author's fundamental point: ""Mathematical discoveries, like springtime violets in the woods, have their season which no human can hasten or retard."" Ronan's sense of history is impressive.As for the math itself, Monsters are objects that belong to group theory. Group theory studies algebraic structures called groups or, as Ronan explains, which ""deals with the study of symmetry"" on page 1. The young French mathematician Évariste Galois turns out to be our hero. He discovered simple groups of permutation in 1830. Ronan calls those simple groups of permutations ""atoms of symmetry"". ""Simple"" meant, according to Ronan, groups that could not be broken down (or ""deconstructed"" as he prefers to say) any further. So, a Monster is a group...yes, what is it exactly? An exceptional symmetry object, is the answer. The main quest in this book is to find those exceptional symmetry objects, of which 26 have been found so far. The second largest of them is called affectionately the Baby Monster. The largest is called the Monster. By ""large"" we mean that the Monster has a staggering number of dimensions: 196,883. I don't pretend to understand where exactly we are going with this but that is what we are told.Moonshine is even more opaque. Moonshine is an attempt to explain some of the staggering correspondences that Monsters in group theory exhibit with number theory. Those correspondences are crystallized in an object in number theory, namely the number 196,884, which is almost the same as the number of the dimensions of the Monster. One is still at a loss to understand the connections, Ronan admits. He does not say much more. He does say, though, that string theory seems a promising home for both the Monsters and the Moonshine. The implication is that this is all very cutting edge. Therefore, one has to forgive the obscurity. However, the reader cannot avoid the impression that the book would have benefited from more careful editing. Many things are repeated at least twice. When that keeps happening, you start feeling as awkward as trying to laugh when you hear the same joke twice. Except this book is not funny. It does not make you laugh.To be fair, Ronan's excitement for his subject is contagious. I maintain that the book works best as a peek into the mind of someone who is discovering something that boggles the mind. How do you get your mind around something that boggles the mind? Maybe you don't. Hence the excitement, not only for the Monsters and Moonshine but for finding and pushing the limits of our minds."
17,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1232443-francis,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I think it gave a very rich yet comprehensible picture of the history of finite group theory (concentrating on the classification of the finite simple groups), starting with a bit of pre-history from the ancient Greeks, but really starting with Galois' immortal work on , and tracing the the major players in the 19th century like Cauchy, Jordan, Lie, Klein, Burnside, and the 20th century, like Dickson, Thompson, Gorenstein, Conway, Fischer, Aschbacher, etc., with a special emphasis on the largest sporadic finite simple group, the Monster, and the still-mysterious connections with modular functions, vertex operator algebras, and string theory, collectively referred to as Moonshine.In terms of reviewing the contents, I cannot hope to do better than Rob Griess's review, so I will link to it here:http://www.ams.org/notices/200702/rev...I have personal experience with some of the people discussed in this book and I have heard many of the same stories that were told to him, and I can say that his retellings of the stories are very faithful to what I have heard; it is a valuable historical document of the personalities and happenings during the time of the classification.One anecdote I wanted to amplify on was the one about the name ""buildings"". J.P. Serre related to a group of us at dinner once that they had thought about using the term ""skeleton"" instead (as discussed in the book) but then the elaboration of the metaphor produced ""coffin"", ""ossuary"", etc., which were quite morbid, so they chose ""chamber"", ""apartment"", ""building"" instead.For more details, I would recommend T. Thompson's ""From Error-Correcting Codes Through Sphere Packings to Finite Simple Groups"" for a pleasant mathematical narrative covering a significant portion of the middle of this book, and Conway and Sloane's ""Sphere Packings, Lattices, and Groups"" for an encyclopedic survey of much of the material, particularly the topics related to the Monster (e.g., the Leech lattice, the 26-dimensional Lorentzian lattice, Conway's Monster construction, and so forth). Also, for the middle part of the story (Klein, Lie, Dickson, Weyl, etc.) I would recommend Hawkins' ""Emergence of the Theory of Lie Groups"", a comprehensive history of that era.I perceived a few minor infelicities in the writing, such as some somewhat awkwardly interjected background mathematical anecdotes like the one about Emmy Noether and the university not being a bathhouse, and a tendency to introduce a topic with a ""we'll discuss this later"" quite frequently.I am curious to compare my experience of reading this book to that of someone without training in group theory."
18,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31526875-francisco-rodr-guez,2,"It is very difficult to read a mathematical book with a good balance between explaining the maths and not delving into difficult details. Each reader has a different preference. This book didn't achieve that balance for me at all. It explains too clearly the very easy things such as how to know the order of a polynomial, giving examples and so on, but anything more difficult than that is not explained at all: not even attempted. As a result I did not get a feeling for the subject except it being very difficult. I would have loved an explanation of Galois' work which started it all, and is probably explainable to a non mathematician, but I did not understand it. From that point onwards, having not understood the foundational work, it was completely impossible to follow the rest. I would have been much happier if the author had attempted to give explanations of the difficult concepts."
19,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649064-matthew,2,"As the book's subtitle promises, this book is about a quest--meaning, I had not sufficiently appreciated before I picked it up, a great deal of narrative about how mathematicians have to come to know what they know. As a non-mathematician, I did not find this at all helpful. The idea of multidimensional symmetry, for obscure reasons, fascinates me, but it is also intensely abstract and conceptually frustrating. The biographical details of the many people who contributed to group theory and such, especially in considering their false starts, only confuses things. Moreover, Ronan never quite gets beyond this mode to really distill the essence of the theory in its mature form, which is what I really want to understand. This book will probably be of much more utility to readers who already have a better grasp on the math and would like to learn more about the theory's human history, rather than someone like myself who is a nonspecialist interested in learning about symmetry and the Monster. "
20,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/199168-meghan,3,"The subject matter of Ronan's ""Symmetry and the Monster"" is fascinating: Symmetry mathematics, an accidental quest of discovery that lasts for centuries, tie-ins with String Theory, Quantum Physics and the j-function. Still, though, I would not recommend this book if this is one's initial foray into studying any of these subjects. Ronan, while he writes gently and does explain some concepts, is first and foremost interested in the mathematical discoveries that led to the uncovering of the Monster Group. However, Ronan will bombard the reader with certain concepts that seem to appear in brain-aching clusters; paradoxically, Ronan will present a concept's name then write, ""But more on this later..."" as he continues the biography. Overall, it's an incredibly interesting book. Just do your homework before you go read it."
21,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7251641-james,2,"Interesting experience reading. The book had explanations of how groups worked. I grasped each one loosely, then kind of forgot what I had grasped as I read on. I had a kind of ""Tacit Dimension"" style grasp of the explanations as I went into the next explanation. So now I have a vague sense of what groups are (and of how the various structures leading up to the Monster are), which was more than I had before. It's like, I understand, but I don't. It's good to have a taste of the mathematicians' vibe and ""way of moving"". I found myself thinking in terms of ""These people / things are all different but I can take them to be the same in certain important respects"", the same move the early group theorists made to invent group theory."

The last one found was the Monster Group and the classification was completed in 1982.

23,0192807226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6265174-erickson,4,"Good introduction on symmetry and group theory, with sufficient breadth though not depth. However, the writing style is quite 'vexing' sometimes, especially on the part where the author kept repeating ""we shall meet with this later"" or ""we will deal with this in the next chapter"" etc. too many times. It at one juncture really made the reader 'fed up'.Nonetheless, the book is broad enough to let readers know what is at stake and what are the things covered in those topics, though the exposition is not clear in explaining some basic concepts, or some explanations are too much simplified that the essence is probably lost. It is still a good book, though not an excellent one admittedly."

Math, unlike physics where I have more experience, is much tougher to grasp conceptually, and I feel I would've benefitted from more exploration on how the great monster of symmetry underpins our physical universe, though perhaps that's simply not known yet. A good read, less interesting to me than the Language of Numbers, but definitely gives one the same inspiring sense that there is a very complex and fascinating order to things that numbers can uncover in extraordinary ways.
