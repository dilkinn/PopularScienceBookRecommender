0,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/144579-ep,5,"I hated Physics when I was a kid, because the teacher who taught me wore coke-bottle glasses, had halitosis, and his spittle flew. He also churned out equations on the board, and expected you to get E=mc2 as if you were born to do so. How can one not understand the elegance and simplicity and total enlightenment that this captured about our physical world? Well, I didn't. Because the physical world -- believe it or not -- was abstract enough not to grasp at the 10,000 foot level.Ok, then comes Parallel Worlds, by Michio Kaku. I don't know what made me pick up this book. A lot of reading impulse probably had something to do with stray comments or observations one picks up from somewhere. I had read that this book was unputdownable. What! A science nonfiction book unputdownable. Was I born yesterday?Well, it could be said I was 'born-again' after reading this. From Newton's theory of gravity to Einstein's theory of relativity, to the mystery of the origin of the universe (the ""big bang""), to quantum theory, multiverses/parallel universes, time travel, wormholes, black holes, string theory -- Kaku slices through the heart of these scientific discoveries with a paring knife so sharp that even the most science-averse of us can grasp the mystery and the wonder of the universe. For someone like me, who grew up without religion, found God in a Catholic church, wanting desperately to understand how ""we"" came about, this book was eye-opening, humbling. It does not preach to the religionists -- it's hard not to face this cosmic question as one plows through the scientific evidence -- is there or is there not a Higher Intelligence that created all of this (especially the series of Goldilocks perfect coincidences that made life on Earth possible), but in the end, I wonder if I don't come away thinking all the scientific evidence in the world, and the brilliant theorizing about our physical universe has not proven a damn thing about the existence of God. I would go so far as to say it has not disproved the existence of God.Read and think through for yourself -- if anything, one realizes that so many of the political, religious, environmental backfighting in pockets of the world may be so much sand in the hourglass -- not that a comet or asteroid could hit us tomorrow and end all life as we know it, but that Earth could rotate a little differently on its axis, a black hole could be sliding perilously close to us but we can't see us and we'd be sucked into its Event Horizon within a billionth of a second and evaporated. All these things can happen. And there is still so much more we do not know about our universe! Any of those things we don't yet know could kill us. Life is super-symmetrical, held in fine equilibrium, but oh, so tenuously.The coolest thing I realized -- I had no idea that it was nuclear energy, one of the four forces that obtain in our universe-- that prevents our bodies (its atoms) from flying apart. Here I thought it was something only used to build bombs! "
1,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"Kaku starts off by comparing the big bang to the creation in Christian and Chinese mythology. Yuck. He also finishes off the book with a tedious digression into religious inanities.The syrupy and hyperbole-riddled language is guaranteed to cause misunderstanding in anyone unfamiliar with cosmology, and irritation in anyone already familiar with cosmology. But hey, it's a popular science book, you sort of expect that.Kaku attributes the ""discovery"" of dark matter and dark energy to the WMAP data.A halo of dark matter was first considered to account for the stability of spiral galaxies.Without this large halo holding the spiral arms together by it's gravity, spiral galaxies would not be stable.Later work on cosmic inflation supports this hypothesis, but didn't start it.Dark energy was first hypothesized to account for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe as measured by Hubble redshift of distant quasars.Again, this was confirmed by WMAP but was detected long before.In a later chapter, he goes on to the history of these ideas in more detail, contradicting his earlier mistake.There are many more examples of contradictions in this writing.For example, Kaku writes that the weak nuclear force is ""too weak to hold the nucleus together, sometimes allowing it to decay"".This can be horribly misleading to someone who doesn't already know that the strong nuclear force holds the nucleus together, whereas the weak nuclear force can cause disturbances which shatter the nucleus. Later in the same paragraph this is explained, but it is contradictory and confusing. Reader be warned.Kaku repeatedly refers to the event horizon around a black hole a ""magic sphere"". Yuck.Kaku claims string theory is the ONLY contestant for unifying gravity.This outright lie flies in the face of many researches, like Lee Smolin, who are looking at other ways to unify gravity. Unbelievable how smug Kaku can be.The chapter on time travel was a joke. Classic Kaku packaging wild speculation and supernatural fantasy as ""science"".The chapter on the anthropic principle was polluted with god this and god that, which I found enraging.Even in his area of expertise, science fiction, Kaku makes a gaff, mistaking the human-made robots in The Matrix for ""aliens"".Kaku constantly refers to the cosmological constant as ""anti-gravity"", which is a joke to any physicist, who knows that gravity is an inverse square law, while the cosmological constant is, well, a CONSTANT negative pressure. Just another example of Kaku's obsession with using irritating and inaccurate words."
2,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,4,"My first foray into Michio Kaku's worldHaving just listened to Brian Green's The Elegant Universe and his case for String Theory and M-Theory, the bold theoretical attempts to integrate Einstein's general/special relativity with quantum physics while also incorporating gravity, my occasional urge to understand the macro and micro principles of the universe, from quarks to blackholes, multiple dimensions, boson particles, Plank distances, and everything in between, his name has hit the radar many times as a physicist and futurist who writes popular science books for the general but scientifically-curious reader. He covers much of the same territory as The Elegant Universe, but with far less technical depth than that book, but with a more approachable style as he drops loads of science-fiction cultural references and he does excel at making the difficult subject matter a bit less intimidating. His enthusiasm for the various topics he covers is also infectious, so if the title sounds like something you'd like to read about without needing a theoretical physics PhD, by all means give it a try. It does stray pretty far into highly speculative territory such as sentient beings fleeing the heat death of our universe billions of years in the future, but if you're an avid hard SF reader this won't feel so far-fetched. Rather it's exciting to hear a respected physicist take such outlandish ideas seriously."
3,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,4,"If you are into time travel or a time travel author, this should be required reading (or in this case listening). Because there was so much great information presented in an understandable manner, this might become the only book that I will read after listening to it as I want to ensure I have this one as a reference.The first third of the book was a good refresher and had me thinking, “I know this stuff”. . in fact, I felt a little cocky and questioned why I chose this book. Then came the heavy stuff. Don’t misunderstand. By heavy, I don’t mean not understandable. By heavy, I mean, wow! awe-inspiring, make you think, and realize your insignificance. Insignificance not only in this world, solar system, galaxy, or universe but instead total insignificance in existing. The possibilities for multiple or parallel universes will leave your head spinning. However, as a time travel aficionado, this is a good thing making for some great reading by clever authors.It’s amazing to think that our existence is based upon the “Goldilocks” theory for everything. That Earth is exactly the correct distance from the sun, that the sun is the correct size, in the correct spot in the galaxy, that the correct combination of chemicals came together to form us, that the moon is the correct distance from Earth, and on and on.The mysteries of existence are not found only in a smaller scale as we continue to look for the building blocks of our life but building up as well. Like many others, I have always felt that we were part of something bigger. Nobody can really state what that is other than some form of a collective. My personal theory is (and I’ve never heard it anywhere before) is that our universe could simply be a cell in part of a larger being. Along with other universes that are hypothesized in this book, my theory is that we are physically part of God. So, if our universe is but one of God’s cells, think how many cells comprise a human and then realize how insignificant we are as part of his body. "
4,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,5,"January 2019Having re-read this book after 5 years, my opinion of it has not changed a bit. I still see it as a piece of great writing, skillfully popularising mind-blowing concepts and ideas. However, it is becoming more dated every year as the science progresses. So, for my next reading on the subject, I've ordered The Universe in Your Hand: A Journey Through Space, Time, and Beyond by Christophe Galfard - it also has good reviews on Goodreads, and so I hope I will not be disappointed.June 2013:Help, help! I'm surrounded by microscopic wormholes and baby universes!July 2013:I have just finished the best pop-science book I have ever read (including Balcombe's ""Pleasurable Kingdom"" which I found very well-written, perfectly constructed and also very touching; a no. 1 until now).The subject of the book is mind-blowing and it is extremely difficult to stay focused on the reading for a length of time, because it inspires and stretches imagination to the limits. I just couldn't stop picturing things in my head! Certainly, this effect is brought mainly by the information which one could derive from any other book on the subject of the string theory, but Kaku has a great gift of clear, understandable and entertaining writing. And he simply seems to be a great guy, a person delighted in the mysterious beauty of the world(s) who puts a genuine effort in facilitating the knowledge of it to as wide an audience as possible. I did have to consult Wikipedia occasionally, but generally the book is very self-contained: the writing is easy on the reader, and the apparatus helps in managing information.The book has one disadvantage: it is full of spoilers! Kaku refers to many sci-fi novels that seem like a lot of fun, so if you don't know them, you might risk a spoilt pleasure. I have the deepest respect for the Author for the last pages of the book, which send an optimistic message: we are here to learn, discover and make changes for the better. We are, right here and now, in that crucial stage which requires us to be careful and wise so we can perceive and participate in the universe with more awareness and impact than ever before. If we take the right social and moral standing today, we might be able to understand and enter the worlds previously unseen, become the observers who can truly understand and manage life, matter and intelligence. Is it overly optimistic? Perhaps, but it gives us a great purpose to follow, and it's nicer to keep going with such in mind instead of living with the vision of desolation and doom."
5,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,5,"A very, very nice book..! Provided a radical understanding of the nature of Nature from the physical perspective, while eventually ending the book with its plausible connections to divinity.... a Superb Book!!"
6,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Kaku takes us through physics history from Newton’s laws to M-Theory, his favorite flavor of string theory. Along the way we find Maxwell’s electromagnetism, Plank’s Constant, Einstein’s relativity, Hubble’s red shift, Schrodinger’s cat, Gamow’s big bang, Guth’s inflation and end up exploring exotic concepts such as wormholes and parallel universes. This brief history was well written and enjoyable. The rest of the book is engaging but has some shortcomings. As is typical in popular physics books, non-mathematical explanations of mathematical constructs such as string theory leave us only guessing at their validity. Kaku’s concern with the death of our universe in trillions of years was a little beyond my current event horizon of worry and his proposed escapes seemed more like science fiction than science. His musings on the Anthropic Principle and its implications for man’s place in the universe offered little new. Still, Parallel Worlds imparts a large amount of information simply and left me with a fresh sense of wonder."
7,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1922182-heini,4,"I am inclined to see this marvellously inspiring book as consisting of three distinct but entwined parts.The first part is a an excellent account of the history of modern science told in Michio Kaku's impeccably witty and easily-understood narrative. As such I would recommend this book as a natural continuation of for instance Thomas S. Kuhn's ""The Copernican Revolution"" or some other similar book about the history of science in general. Parallel Worlds picks up naturally and leads us into the twentieth century and right up to the cutting edge of physics - and beyond with qualified speculation on what the future might hold.Which constitutes the second and third parts. The second part is about where we are at at the moment. It explains in great detail which issues modern physicists are preoccupied with at the current moment and why. How did they reach these conclusions? On what grounds to they base their suspicions? What could all of these high-brow and abstruse theories be used for in all practicality? Michio Kaku, being a proponent of M-theory himself, is not afraid of letting his own personal stance be known. However, at no point did I feel that he misrepresented his opponents or attempted to distort their views. He treated difference of opinion in a respectful and balanced manner. Also in this second part Michio Kaku explores some of the philosophical implications of M-theory. I am afraid the book falls rather flat in this respect. For all of his formidable intellect it would be an overstatement to say the least to call Michio Kaku a philosopher. Gone are his sharp and illustrative analogies and his concise grasp on the subject matter. I got the impression that Kaku thinks little of philosophy and considers it rather unworthy of his time - unfortunately at the cost of critical thinking in regards to what would otherwise have been some very pertinent issues indeed. Just the fact that Kaku uncritically conflates indeterminism with free will without ever giving any sort of conceptual analysis of what he means by either should be enough to make any philosopher worth her salt cringe. One is left with no idea on what Kaku is really attempting to say.The third and last part of the book is entirely speculative. That is to say that it is science fictional speculation of what possibilities will become available to us in the future with an emphasis on the scientific feasibility and not so much on the fiction. Kaku imagines various ways it could be possible for a hypothtical evolved intelligence to survive the inevitable death of our universe. I am not sure if Kaku's intent was to provide hope. If it was, I must say he fails. The future seems rather bleak and each of the possibilities he mentions is outweighed by how much could count against it. Nevertheless, the thoughts and ideas are very interesting and if you like science fiction for its exploration of what might be, you will certainly enjoy this book.I gave the book four stars. The only thing that prevents me from giving it five is the above-mentioned wanton carelessness when it comes to philosophical considerations coupled with some minor, yet inexcusable, mistakes, which could all have been avoided if only Michio Kaku would have bothered to do more research outside of his own field when writing the book. (The most hilarious example of an avoidable mistake is that at one point Kaku sums up the plot of The Matrix franchise as humans being kept in a virtual reality by aliens. Perhaps not the most damning thing to get wrong but this detracts nothing from how little effort it would have taken to get it right.)All in all a book well worth reading despite its short-comings."
8,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368200-nathan,4,"Michio Kaku is quickly becoming my favorite science writer, and easily my favorite hypothetical or theoretical physicist. His ideas and the way he presents them make fun, easy reading for those of us who were always terrible in math and didn't digest much about astrophysics in school. He deals with a lot of ""what if"" scenarios, and more than most modern physicists he holds onto his imagination. Kaku's work bristles with excitement, something you can rarely say about a book covering cosmological topics. In most cases, unless you know how to build a particle accelerator in your basement, you're not going to get excited by a tome on cosmological constants and the mathematical flatness of the universe. Kaku, however, is just as happy talking about science fiction as he is talking the mathematics of a black hole, and his enthusiasm is contagious. Parallel Worlds is no let-down, and any fan of fascinating books about modern science that brim with imaginative possibilities should check Kaku's work out. This (along with Hyperspace) is one of the most fun books on cosmology I've ever read.NC"
9,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20189454-brigid-cruickshank,3,"Easy to read, they said; a good 1st dive into physics for the novice, they said. It was, in the beginning an interesting and enjoyable read - but then my lit spoiled brain began to hurt a bit. I stopped often, to read ""real"" books, it's true, but I finally made it through the dark era (despite my lack of warp drive). That is all I can say, however, I finished. I did learn a few things but then those tidbits of information slipped through a black hole and now it's in a different universe. My journey there will have to wait though because, after all, it's summer. And, my brain is begging for some literature."
10,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1802736-toomy,4,"This book is an entertaining and interesting read. Almost no formula, although you still need some basics to get the most out of it. It will update your general knowledge about cosmology to year 2004, when the book was written.The Large Hadron Collider(LHC) came online this year. Some scientists predicted that LHC could create black hole, which could destroy the earth. We all know what happened now. Dr. Kaku talked about LHC in his book - LHC could only create black hole in subatomic level with a very small probability. In other words, LHC would not a black hole in astonomical size."
11,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7555106-lori,5,"I've been putting off my review for this book in an attempt to organize my thoughts so the review consisted more of the contents within the book rather than just a mindless rant of how awesome Michio Kaku is. Unfortunately, my thoughts remained a jumbled mess as my giddiness took precedence.So why is he just so fantastic? Michio Kaku is not only gifted in his abilities as a physicists (he is co-founder of string field theory, has written textbooks, articles, novels, etc. in the field of physics and popular science), but he makes the difficult and convoluted subject of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics accessible and entertaining for the everyday person. An individual like me, who struggled through physics and calculus and who still sings the quadratic equation to the tune of ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" can pick this book up and enjoy it wholeheartedly.Kaku uses easy to understand analogies to explain mathematical equations or the theory in general which helps the reader remain on board when he begins to discuss higher dimensions, the possibility of space/time travel, or multiple universes. He also engages the reader with quotes or synopsis from our culture's best science fiction novels and he lists both obscure (maybe not for the avid physic buff) and popular scientists involved in proving, disproving, theorizing, advocating (well you get the picture) the various subjects within this novel which add much to the flow and pace of this book.Overall this book left me vibrating with excitement at the prospect of time/space travel; the possible reality of multiple universes (think Schrodinger's Cat); and the potential of humanity on earth to become a type III civilization. Narrator: Mark VietorPerformance: 5/5This book is straight narration without characters and different points of view and Vietor does a very good job with the narration"
12,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1284151-holly,4,"This book isn't exactly light reading. It's not what I'm accustomed to reading, either, but science has always been one of those topics I love to watch on tv, but flounder at in class. But I wasn't being graded on Parallel Worlds so it worked out fine!Mr. Kaku is actually one of my favorite guys on History Channel's The Universe (also gotta love Neil deGrasse Tyson) so I was really excited to read his book. I won't lie; it's not a summer beach read, in my opinion, but it's worth the read. String theory is exciting to read about to me because it's almost like real-life science fiction. Mr. Kaku covers that, along with how it relates (and doesn't relate) to Relativity and other laws and theories. He goes over scientists who paved the way to this theory, and everything in between. The book shows how string theory can be possible, and what it could end up being: The Theory of Everything. If you're at all interested in physics or the universe, I would suggest this book."
13,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,0,"The Blurb:In this thrilling journey into the mysteries of our cosmos, best-selling author Michio Kaku takes us on a dizzying ride to explore black holes and time machines, multidimensional space, and most tantalizing of all, the possibility that parallel universes may exist alongside our own.Kaku skillfully guides us through the latest innovations in string theory and its latest iteration, M-theory, which posits that our universe may be just one in an endless multiverse, a singular bubble floating in a sea of infinite bubble universes. If M-theory is proven correct, we may perhaps finally find an answer to the question, ""What happened before the big bang?""This is an exciting and unforgettable introduction into the new cutting-edge theories of physics and cosmology from one of the pre-eminent voices in the field."
14,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4859109-irena,5,"An excellent read especially if you are interested in cosmology and modern physics. Very well written, the language is precise and not overwhelmed with technicalities and pseudo-clever demagogy, but at the same time advanced scientific topics and the latest scientific developments are presented by an insider in an interesting, concise and thought provoking way. Lots of food for thought and fascinating topics here from creation of the universe and the place of intelligent life in it to the distant fate of humankind and the meaning of life itself. To read and reread. And I'm definitely going to read other books by Michio Kaku."
15,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2925334-anusha-sridharan,5,"This has been a great read. Since, I haven't done any extensive study before on parallel universes this book has been a mild eye opener to a lot of things I should be reading next. It got me inquisitive to research more. Once I do a little bit of reading there, I might come back to this book for inspiration."
16,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13180341-jaime-k,4,"The problem with books about science is that they constantly date themselves. No matter. This is still a very interesting and informational book, especially when considering how much has been done since 2004!And how much we need to do.I've read a few other books by Kaku, though published after this one. I found this to be more repetitious than I would like, though an easier read. Kaku really tries to make sure that ANYONE can read this, not just people in the field (in contrast to the other books, I think he got a bit more technical in them). The analogies Kaku offers with real-world, tangible examples are fantastic and so very helpful. So are the diagrams and pictures.There was some revolutionary development in cosmology in the early 2000s, and this book focuses not only on them but past developments and future projections. The history and evolution of cosmology, including how we have come to understand forces like gravity, were interesting to read.One thing I like about Kaku is that he's extremely fair and is willing to show the intersection of science and religion, not taking either side but showing both of them. I'm also glad he included information on Georges Lemaître, the Catholic priest who first confirmed an expanding universe (leading to the name of big bang).Information on the big bang as well as the unification with four fundamental forces in qualtum theory and elementary particle physics is fascinating.He discusses things that are seemingly paradoxical, like inflation vs. Einsteins theory of relativity.I love how aspects of string theory are analogies to music counterparts. I also love that Kaku notes that many theories leave uncertainties, as logical conclusions can't always be proven.And yet there is substantial evidence as to how and why multiple and parallel universes can exist.The phases and stages of the universe are both so neat to read.The Misner universe is very strange, and--even more odd to me--is easy to understand.The parallel quantum universes make me chuckle and boggled at the same time.It is easy to forget that while WE can't dissolve and rematerialize elsewhere, at the subatomic level, it's how electronics and lasers work.The information on string theory, supersymmetry, and duality is all utterly fascinating. Supersymmetry confused me the most.At first I was upset that he described the way Lisa Randall looked as she was the only female in her field for a while. But he did the same to at least one other person later on. It's to demonstrate that you can't judge a scientist by the way they look, but it threw me off for a second since I have always known Kaku to be so fair.I LOVE the Goldilocks aspects of Earth! I knew some but not all.The book dates itself, talking about the Large Hadron Collider and what it’s anticipated to do. Still, I enjoyed all the details.Using nanotech to recreate our brains for bots to use is SCARY. GUYS MOVIES WERE MADE ABOUT THIS.The conclusion wraps things up fairly well."
17,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58375962-david-raz,3,"About half of this book is science, and although a new edition with the latest findings may have been in place, this part is very good, explaining cosmology in a way that will attract both people with little understanding of the subject and people like me, who are scientists, but not in the field of Physics and cosmology.The other half is ramblings about time travel and escaping our reality. This part was riddled with speculation of the worst kind, inaccuracies and just didn't feel like science to me.Weighing both halves, three stars out of five."
18,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26925505-chris-stein,3,"This was my first Kaku book. I’ve been impressed with the writing in all of the popular science books written by big time physicists (Greene, Susskind, Tegmark, etc…) and Kaku did not disappoint me. He isn’t my favorite of the aforementioned authors, but he does offer unique perspective and comes off as extremely open minded. He certainly does not read as haughty, pretentious, egotistical, or self-congratulating as some of the others authors can at times. Kaku frequently pays tribute to colleagues and unsung heros throughout the book, but having read Susskind’s works and only noticing some small qualified Susskind citations on topics that Susskind wrote entire books about (and didn’t even mention him while talking about the Holographic Principle), I couldn’t help but conjecture that some professional rivalry or ego clashing might have gone on between the two. He points out that while specific individuals get credit for the major breakthroughs, the same thoughts had been thought by other non-scientists (like a Poe tribute) well before anything was rigorously and officially proven. He has a solid presentation of big Fine tuning parameters, but I prefer Tegmark’s more recent presentation of the theoretical emergence of parallel universes and the many worlds implications, description of the early big bang, and eternal inflation, especially for a book titled “Parallel Worlds”. He is sure to call out a scientist (like Feynman or a Hawking) on a direct antagonistic quote if it should be known.Part 1 of the book was a great presentation of the story of cosmology and science emerging from antiquity and leading up to and through the big bang theory. I’ve read variants of the same old story many times, but this presentation was a unique spin and added tidbits of humanity to the men behind the breakthroughs. Kaku also painted a nice picture of the drama and unsung heros standing up to dogma or contributing without recognition behind the scenes, and pointed out that if it were not for a few serendipitous events that unfolded and aligned with perfect timing some major breakthroughs would have been set back decades or never happened at all. Some life or sociological events that on the surface seemed like obstacles ended up possibly enabling the Einsteins and Newtons to make their largest breakthroughs and deepest impact. He was sure to point out contributions of women who struggled for recognition as physicists, and I feel that he went out of his way to show that dogmatism can be just as rampant and stifling to progress in science as anywhere else.I was a little disappointed with part 3. It read too much like sci-fi, an irrelevant breed of futurism, or a quick list of all of his ideas. I understand that working up to that section was part of his motivation for writing the book, and necessary to include, but I did not enjoy it as much as parts 1 or 2. Like our present situation in a runaway expanding universe with a positive cosmological constant, the sweet spot of the book was late part 1, and I liked it less as I went along. This is not a slight on Kaku, it is more of a reflection of my indifference to the kind of futurism that does not seem applicable to anything within a few generations or even a few hundred years of the current human condition.It is my opinion that Kaku seems incredibly open minded, covers dry topics without being dry, makes sure to stay in touch with human implications while discussing science, pays tribute where tribute is unsung or due, and makes sure to point out the shortcomings and humanity of those that might be worshipped as scientific gods."

20,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,3,"Kaku uses the categories of ""Type I, II, and III civilizations"" that were ""introduced by Russian physicist Nikolai Kardashev in the 1960s."" Type I is a civilization that ""has harnessed planetary forms of energy."" Type II ""has exhausted the power of a single planet and has harnessed the power of an entire star..."" Type III ""has exhausted the power of a single solar system and has colonized large portions of its home galaxy."" ""Each type of civilization differs from the next lower type,"" Kaku explains, ""by a factor of 10 billion."" A strange way to measure social evolution. As far as I can tell, we are no longer qualitatively assessing homo politicus nor quantifying progress by homo economicus. Now we have homo exūstúrus, or man understood as He Who Will Burn Things Up.Some passages are delightfully absurd: ""There is a certain amount of danger, however, in creating a universe in an oven.""One example of a sentence I feel I ought to be able to understand, but do not actually understand: ""These six dimensions have all been compactified, so that entering a higher dimension is impossible – more than a little disappointing to those who would one day hope to soar into an infinite hyperspace rather than merely take brief short-cuts through compactified hyperspace via wormholes.""A quote from Brian Greene that I feel less awkward about not understanding:1. The tiny mass of the elusive, ghostlike neutrino could be experimentally determined, and string theory might explain it.2. Small violations of the Standard Model could be found that violate point-particle physics, such as the decays of certain subatomic particles.3. New long-range forces (other than gravity and electromagnetism) could be found experimentally that would signal a certain choice of a Calabi-Yau manifold.4. Dark matter particles could be found in the laboratory and compared to predictions of string theory.5. String theory might be able to calculate the amount of dark energy in the universe.Kaku quotes geologist Peter Ward and astronomer Donald Brownlee on the importance of the moon's orbit and gravitational influence on Earth: ""Without the Moon there would be no moonbeams, no month, no lunacy, no Apollo program, less poetry, and a world where every night was dark and gloomy. Without the Moon it is also likely that no birds, redwoods, whales, trilobite, or other advanced life would ever grace the earth.” Later in the book, Kaku explains the long-distance space travel ""warp drive machine"" proposed by physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994: ""It simply shrinks the space in front of you while expanding the space behind you. Think of walking across a carpet to reach a table. Instead of walking on the carpet, you could lasso the table and slowly drag it toward you, making the carpet bunch up in front of you."" These two ideas together are confusing to me, because, if the so-called Goldilocks ""just-right"" placement of the moon is so critical to maintaining stability on Earth, I don't know why we'd ever want to lasso entire planets or galaxies and pull them closer to us. It must be a hyperspace thing."
21,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61270111-sina-keshavarz,4,"Dr. Michio Kaku is the congenial scientist of the media. Meaning he knows quantum physics as much as he knows how to be a convivial person. He fills the gap between science and people by delineating the language of physics, quantum theory, string theory, M-theory, black holes and parallel universes in such simplicity that you can't help falling in love with modern physics. The book starts with depicting an ascetic compendium of modern physics. He then establishes the ideas of the book upon these bases unfolding the meaning behind parallel worlds and the M-theory. The book never wears you down since it is a vehicle to move you through space and time to observe the reality you could not see in your daily life. He then digs deeper into the 11 dimensions and their mathematics. I believe some chapters are not suited for uneducated people since the basics don't suffice for Kaku to express his ideas. ""Parallel Worlds"" states different works of physics - from different authors - to further depict the meaning behind utilized physical expressions. However, as always Kaku draws out different philosophical views toward the subject of his book and initiates a decorous contentious argument among the academic society. He demurs every superstition or wrong hypothesis in his books and always portrays science as the means of guidance by standing on the shoulders of the giants.PS: I always loved how Kaku finishes his books in a perfect, wonderful, and breathtaking denouement as if it is you who are unraveling the mysteries of the universe."
22,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2356237-melmoth43,3,"Albeit a comprehensive and informative history of Physics, I'm afraid the author and I parted company with the introduction of the String and M theories. To quote Einstein, ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."" At this stage, String and M are simply hypotheses, with little or no hard evidence to prove their validity. That may happen, but as of now, in their present form, I find them lacking in two features all great discoveries have: simplicity and elegance of design. Unfortunately, Kaku doesn't help my little or no understanding much. As well, his dire encapsulation of our Universe's future, accurate as it may turn out to be, held little more than possible hypotheses again. The truth is we simply don't know what the future holds. For me, the most interesting parts of the book were what was, and not what may be.But still, Kaku is a good writer; and there was enough in this book to hold my interest."
23,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9053571-kirsty,5,"I highly recommend this book as an accessible and touchstone overview to Astrophysics. A non-fiction work in my opinion to be added to the list of books that absolutely everyone should read at least once. The points are often illustrated beautifully by quotes from literature or philosophy, making it a lot easier for the more bookish minded to grasp. It’s always pleasing when you come across a name you intimately recognise; like Poe, Lewis Carroll, and even Salvador Dali to name a just few. Kaku has a very elegant way of putting complex ideas across and evaluating others work for the lay person. So, if you have always wanted to read about cosmology but felt daunted by all the different theories than this is definitely the book for you. Kaku has definitely acquired a new fan."
24,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"I like Kaku's style but for me it is still not quite as likable as Brian Greene. I do like his way of thinking though. He as an ability to go to places and make connections with the wider world that I would not always make. He throws in a lot of geeky scifi book references too which I think kind of makes him endearing. Overall it was fun, my copy overly needed some updates though! Cosmology is moving fast and some of the information here is already outdated. Hopefully he has revisited some of these ideas in an update! "
25,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14036869-lisa,5,"I loved everything about this book. I am an amateur scientist (reading purely for fun) and found this book extremely accessible. From strikingly simple explanations of the creation & acceleration of the universe to purely mind-numbing theories of the multiverse and string theory, I had such a fun time reading this book! Kaku touches on the history of physics, implications of scientific discovery on religious thought, and most interestingly on what time travel and the future of human space travel might look like. A total eye opener and so fun to read!!"
26,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4269099-angela-blount,4,"While this book does indeed cover the concept of parallel worlds—and the theoretical aspects of a “multiverse”—it contains so much more material. Michio Kaku actually lays out the foundations of Quantum Physics and Cosmology by reaching back as far as Isaac Newton. He dwells a great deal on Albert Einstein as well, but as Kaku carries such a torch of admiration for his work, this is no surprise. In fact, it is integral to his focus on Einstein’s ‘Theory of Everything.’ 
“Physicists are made of atoms. A physicist is an attempt by an atom to understand itself.” 
 Parallel Worlds was exactly what I’ve come to expect from listening to the author’s interviews and lectures. Kaku’s wording is pensive, conversational, and ever laced with a sort of open-minded sense of wonder. Not so much as a hint of arrogance or condescension. He doesn’t hesitate to give nods to his colleagues both past and present, as well as highlight those whose contributions were sorely overlooked in their time. His use of metaphors and analogies is, as always, a vivid and insightful bridge between laymen and theoretical physics. (While there wasn’t much by way of insight into Michio Kaku himself, he does reflect several times on formative turning points in his young mind—and even shares a professional realization moment that borders on self-deprecating.) Spoiler Alert!: As a part of his teaching style, Kaku likes to illustrate examples of various physics concepts by pulling directly from the pages of many famed sci-fi novels. On the upside, this gives sci-fi authors some much deserved visionary credit, and gave me a number of books to add to my to-read list. On the downside… most of his examples give away key plot points—potentially ruining the mystery for those who hold such things sacred. Consider yourself fairly warned!----------On a more sociological level, it was interesting to learn so much about the tenuous interactions between physicists throughout the history of the science. (example: despite being responsible for laying down the laws of thermodynamics, Ludwig Boltzmann committed suicide in part because of the peer ridicule he faced while defending the (now proven) existence of the atom.) Kaku paints a picture of a still sometimes contentious and divided community, extensively male-dominated, and fraught with recognition-seeking egos. (Perhaps not so unlike many other professions.)Accessible, balanced in viewpoint, and tentatively optimistic toward the future of Physics and the human race at large. Kaku’s exploration of the possibility of other dimensions is a thoughtful physics primer. Favorite Quotes:*“...the laws of physics, carefully constructed after thousands of years of experimentation, are nothing but the laws of harmony one can write down for strings and membranes. The laws of chemistry are the melodies that one can play on these strings. the universe is a symphony of strings. And the ""Mind of God,"" which Einstein wrote eloquently about, is cosmic music resonating throughout hyperspace.” *“The poet only asks to get his head into the heavens. It is the logician who seeks to get the heavens into his head. And it is his head that splits. —G. K. Chesterson” "
27,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4569625-mike,4,"I started reading this when it first came out in paperback and then, for some unknown reason, set is aside, only to find it again yesterday. So, the first 300 pages were read 10 years ago and the last 60 pages were read yesterday and today. I'm sure there's a time-travel quip hiding in there but my brain's too foggy to grasp it today.From what I recall of the first 80% of this book, it's a sprint through parallel worlds theory and M-String theory. What Kaku does differently from, say, Brian Greene, is to look at the applications of the theory he's explaining. At times, this makes it feel like a primer for science fiction writers embarking on a new Star Trek franchise. Which is no bad thing - I always understand a theory better if it's rooted in concrete examples although I suspect I miss out on some of the richness of the theory thereby.The last chapter is possibly the best: a whiz around what all of this might mean for our understanding of the 'purpose'of the universe. Even if we reach a position of synthesising a Unified Theory of Everything, who created that law? Is there a designer? Is there a god? Or is it just turtles all the way down?Fascinating."
28,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35498982-tasnuva-hoque,3,"I actually have a lot to say about this book. let me get the proper words. first lets start with the positive side. I was able to read about things I had some vague idea about. Many theories, speculation and thoughts were presented to me. I was also able to get a brief picture about the state of the scientists that research about this subject, why they do it, what drives them. Successfully piqued my interest in the black holes and I immediately searched for actual pictures. Made me wish to like maths (what). Now for the things I didn't like. It was very boring in a way. Read like some kind of scientific journal, albeit a bit easier. It had not much humor and was very difficult for me to persist for long. As someone who has very little knowledge about the subject only my strong interest kept me going. Too much information was cramped in it. Sometimes I did forget some terms.Overall I did like it. Able to make me want to know more about physics and the quantum theory."
29,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58076426-seng-wee-wong,4,"This book is written with rather high level of technical knowledge. Author is well versed with the current physics theories pertaining to parallel universes. (duh, Dr. Michio Kaku is a trained theoretical physicist) The book talks about the history of physics, particularly how the realm of physics has transformed since Sir Issac Newton's era. In summary, the book talks about many theories that physicists have about parallel universes although none of them has been conclusively proven. (sad but it's the truth) All the talk about string theory, M-theory, supersymmetry and loop quantum gravity still needs to be substantiated with concrete empirical data. Nonetheless, the author fed as much fun facts as he could in the book in a manner even non-physicists are likely to understand. Generally fun book to read."
30,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63773-kelly-sedinger,4,"Parts of this I would rate at 4.5 stars; other parts maybe 3.5. And there are long sections I wouldn't really feel qualified to rate at all because I simply don't understand quite a bit of it! Nevertheless, I love good science writing and Kaku is quite good, usually able to make things clear and explain how it all works. As noted, there are a number of points in the book where I just didn't understand, and I don't think that's Kaku's fault.The most interesting parts of the book, for me, are the last several chapters, when Kaku speculates both on the eventual ""heat death of the universe"" and what strategies might exist for intelligent life to survive even that. It's all quite fascinating to consider even as a lot of it goes beyond the ability to even visualize what such intelligence might look like."

33,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69833039-alexandra,4,"This book was interesting; however, it felt scattered at times, jumping from idea to idea and from year to year, and sometimes I thought I'd accidentally opened a book on theology instead of a book on theoretical physics."

Nothing seems too big for him to attempt to respond to and he doesn't shy away from saying he does not know the answer to some of the more difficult ones.This book is very much about string theory that leads to parallel universes or multiverse. The idea of the end of it all as we know it is entertaining as well."

While my mind was unable to grasp all of the scientific material discussed and explained, I was able to increase my shallow well of knowledge concerning our galaxy among billions within the universe. Of interest is the theory that the universe continues to expand, stretching outward, ever farther away from us, so that Earth humans may never be capable of reaching distant worlds. But theories of wormholes and time travel to other worlds, while not impossible to imagine and therefore likely possible to achieve, present the age-old question, not whether we can, but should we?"

But, time to time he had started the futurology thing with references to science fiction, that makes it hard to take this book seriously with so much speculation. The book may inspire people to get into Physics, but for those who are already there, those who are filled with wonder at mathematical models of the universe and not fictional stories, this book may fail to broadcast.Anyway, the fact that parallel universes aren’t a theory, but predictions of certain theories, means that there are three logically possible lines of attack on parallel universes, corresponding to three types of claims:1) One or more of these “X implies Y” arguments are incorrect (inflation doesn’t predict *Level I, say).2) One or more of the theories X predicting multiverses are incorrect (inflation, say).3) Parallel universe is indeed predicted by scientific theories, but scientists shouldn’t waste their time thinking about such topics.Now, Attacking all these weaknesses on parallel universes involves doing interesting experimental and theoretical physics research. If any of the attacks succeed, the corresponding multiverse evidence is discredited. Conversely, if all the attacks fail, then we’ll be forced to take parallel universes more seriously whether we like them or not - such are the rules of science. In this way, parallel universes are no different from any other scientific idea.

40,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42604293-steven-huezo,5,"“Parallel Worlds” by Michio kaku is a book based around the many mysteries of the universe and the dozens of theories surrounding them. Kaku talks about the many ideas that have been made in the past several hundred years trying to explain the questions the universe has to offer to humanity. Focused mainly around the idea of parallel universes and how this universe came to be with each theory being as complaining and mind boggling as the last one.The book is at times difficult needing additional research to understand its concepts especially for a beginner in this type of area but is does do a good job at explaining some of the world's most controversial topic of the meaning of life. Citing many famous physicists such as Erwin Schrodinger to Albert Einstein theories and experiments used to try and solve or figure out questions that god has laid out for its creations to solve. One of the many mysteries being addressed in this book is the idea of multi-universes and the thought of traveling into one or even being in one. One experiment used to test this out was Erwin’s famous Schrodinger’s cat “,we put the cat in a nether world of being 50 percent dead and 50 percent alive simultaneously.” pg 158. This quote is saying how we are creating two universes one where the cat is alive and the other where that cat is dead, the only way to see which universe we are in is if we make an observation of the cat’s current state. But this is all just theory with no definitive truth or evidence to back up many of these theories. The book leaves you with more questions than answers, a majority of the solutions suggested in this book trying to solve the universe’s most puzzling questions can't even be tested or experimented on by man for awhile.The fact that we are just as far in technology and knowledge then when we were first brought into existence is just a mere step then what is left to explore. There is still so much that we humans have yet to understand and the fact we consider ourselves higher than any other species is just pure arrogance. It is astonishing to realize that we are still have a way to go to even answer some of the most basic of questions surrounding the creation of man. “Parallel Worlds” is an amazing book leading us on the front line of solving the most essential questions to our species and world around us. "
41,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,2,"In the Constance Garnett translations of Dostoyevsky, exasperated characters routinely ejaculate ""Tfoo!"" To sum up this colossal muckheap of a book, I say, ""Tfoo, Kaku!""Apparently, Dr. K. has done decent theoretical work in physics, but his inability to present clear ideas or a logical structure for whatever it is he's trying to say makes that a little difficult to accept. His ""aw shucks"" little-boy approach to difficult concepts leaves more loose ends than my cat toying with our curtain.My suspicions of the man started with the first page, his acknowledgements. Those he interviewed are arranged not alphabetically, not by the wealth of their contributions, but by the awards they have received: All Nobel laureates are noted first, followed by lesser beings. What does that tell you of objectivity and independence?Overall, this is a study (or hodge-podge) of theories of multiple universes and how to book a ferry ride between them. We visit wormholes and find that they wouldn't work well, in part because you'd need most of the energy of a galaxy to navigate one. And because you probably couldn't go home again.Kaku leaps form theory to theory like a mountain goat, leaving the reader, often, to plummet down an uncharted crevasse. His simple-minded and careless descriptions of complicated concepts read like early notes that never got edited. And his failure to fully evaluate opposing theories – some clever and interesting, others ludicrous – seems a dereliction of duty.Look at this: ""The mind reels when we realize that, according to this interpretation of quantum mechanics, all possible worlds exist with us. ... these quantum realities exist in the very same room that we live in."" They don't do anything of the sort! They exist in a some-other-where that has no connection with any room in our universe. This is just plain crappy, lazy writing.As Mr. Horse so eloquently put it in ""Ren and Stimpy,"" ""No sir, I don't like it."""
42,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35306337-harikleia,5,"The book “Parallel Worlds” by Michio Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York, is a very good guide for the universe, and perhaps, the multiverse (If the universe is infinite, then there must be a parallel one). It describes everything from the origins and beginning of our universe, to escaping the boundaries of it and what we may find there (if that is possible, and if we can ever manage it).	But this book is not boring like a textbook. It is true that most textbooks have analogies, but this book goes into more depth when it comes to such a thing, as well as making the analogy itself more interesting. Think: what would you find more interesting, accurate, and/or fun to read: if you were to take a fish out of a pond for a few seconds, and have it think that it was in a very different world (which it kind of is, but not in the sense the book is talking about) or if you put an animal in a zoo, instead of it’s natural habitat. Not only is this book informative, but also the method to grasp the reader’s interest is well thought-out. 	The writing style aside, the information presented in the book itself is intriguing. It doesn’t just address scientific fact and near-scientific fact. For example, most science books do not mention time travel as a possibility, because the idea is so absurd, especially with paradoxes (such as the Grandfather Paradox and the Predestination Paradox). And what if you knew that you could teleport to distant places in the universe. It’s just like saying that people can fly without using any apparatus, specifically for the purpose of flight.	As frightening as it may seem, the book also describes the possibilities of the end of the universe as we know it, but not in great detail. Still, most of the possibilities are hard to think of, so here comes the credit for the five stars!"
43,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42753855-ylexia-padilla,5,"Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku explores the many mysteries and theories of higher dimensions, black holes, creation of the universe and quantum theory through the greatest scientific minds as in Einstein, Heisenberg, Guth, Bohr, and Newton. The book explores many paradoxes such as the Cat Problem, where if a cat is sealed in a box with a bottle of poison inside connected to a hammer, which is connected to a Geiger counter placed near a piece of uranium. There is a 50 percent chance that the uranium will decay setting off the Geiger counter, which sets off the hammer breaking the glass bottle of poison killing the cat. “The cat is both dead and alive because the universe has split into two. In one universe, the cat is dead; in another universe, the cat is alive”. Like this, your mind will take a journey through the universe that will surely expose thoughts never thought of before. This book touches on many theories said and tested throughout history and clearly explains content with many analogies. I was surprisingly impressed on how the author, Michio Kaku, presents these meticulous, complex theories in a way that can be articulated by young readers. One of my favorite parts of the book was when Dr. Kaku decided to take a philosophical turn with the quantum controversy by George Berkeley that objects only exist because humans are there to observe them. “If a tree falls in a forest but no one is there to see it, then it does not really fall?” I recommend for all who have a deep curiosity of astronomy, quantum physics, and the mysteries of the universe.

But I never regret I started to read this book and finally finish it. Mr. Kaku successfully delivered comprehensive explanation about the universe.The book contains the A to Z of our universe. From the formation of the universe, the possibilities of the parallel universes, to some concepts for our civilazation to survive the death of our current universe by moving to the new one. One of the things that I like the most about this book is Mr. Kaku invited us to contemplate our life in our current time on Earth, he wanted us to celebrate our existence and utilize our life for beneficial things that could lead to better life for our descendant.Subjectively, the main down side of this book is some (if not most) of the contents of this book are too intense and complex. With only my highschool level of newtonian physics background and non-existence quantum physics background, sometimes it took good amount of time and several re-read for me to completely understand the concept and the content explained in the book and made it a little bit boring at times. Overall, this is a really good book to learn about our universe and all of things related to it. Thought the content is a little bit hard but it was so exciting to know and learn new things. I'd recommend this book to people who have interest in universe and physics in general."

There are so many things that we have to discover and are being discovered that are revolutionizing what we previously thought. For example, recently in physics we had a set number how the maximum mass something could be, astronomers then found a cluster that proved this theory wrong ultimately boggling the minds of today's brightest minds.In this book they go more in depth into many topics so that the reader understands basic theories proposed by multiple projects. These theories go over many different genres of Astronomy. They include the multiple String theories to even the theory of Schrodinger's cat and the multiple dimensions. This book blows the mind of its readers by filling it to the capacity with things you have never even thought of, although its not really a book but more of a collection of many different theories.This was definitely a fantastic read. Although it follows no direct storyline it goes over all different constructs of the universe. Each seperate catagory which are devided into chapters intrigued me more and more making me want to finish the whole book in the fastest amount of time.

Nevertheless, I love good science writing and Kaku is quite good, usually able to make things clear and explain how it all works. As noted, there are a number of points in the book where I just didn't understand, and I don't think that's Kaku's fault.The most interesting parts of the book, for me, are the last several chapters, when Kaku speculates both on the eventual ""heat death of the universe"" and what strategies might exist for intelligent life to survive even that. It's all quite fascinating to consider even as a lot of it goes beyond the ability to even visualize what such intelligence might look like."

Of interest is the theory that the universe continues to expand, stretching outward, ever farther away from us, so that Earth humans may never be capable of reaching distant worlds.

But, time to time he had started the futurology thing with references to science fiction, that makes it hard to take this book seriously with so much speculation. The book may inspire people to get into Physics, but for those who are already there, those who are filled with wonder at mathematical models of the universe and not fictional stories, this book may fail to broadcast.Anyway, the fact that parallel universes aren’t a theory, but predictions of certain theories, means that there are three logically possible lines of attack on parallel universes, corresponding to three types of claims:1) One or more of these “X implies Y” arguments are incorrect (inflation doesn’t predict *Level I, say).2) One or more of the theories X predicting multiverses are incorrect (inflation, say).3) Parallel universe is indeed predicted by scientific theories, but scientists shouldn’t waste their time thinking about such topics.Now, Attacking all these weaknesses on parallel universes involves doing interesting experimental and theoretical physics research. If any of the attacks succeed, the corresponding multiverse evidence is discredited. Conversely, if all the attacks fail, then we’ll be forced to take parallel universes more seriously whether we like them or not - such are the rules of science. In this way, parallel universes are no different from any other scientific idea.

70,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42604293-steven-huezo,5,"“Parallel Worlds” by Michio kaku is a book based around the many mysteries of the universe and the dozens of theories surrounding them. Kaku talks about the many ideas that have been made in the past several hundred years trying to explain the questions the universe has to offer to humanity. Focused mainly around the idea of parallel universes and how this universe came to be with each theory being as complaining and mind boggling as the last one.The book is at times difficult needing additional research to understand its concepts especially for a beginner in this type of area but is does do a good job at explaining some of the world's most controversial topic of the meaning of life. Citing many famous physicists such as Erwin Schrodinger to Albert Einstein theories and experiments used to try and solve or figure out questions that god has laid out for its creations to solve. One of the many mysteries being addressed in this book is the idea of multi-universes and the thought of traveling into one or even being in one. One experiment used to test this out was Erwin’s famous Schrodinger’s cat “,we put the cat in a nether world of being 50 percent dead and 50 percent alive simultaneously.” pg 158. This quote is saying how we are creating two universes one where the cat is alive and the other where that cat is dead, the only way to see which universe we are in is if we make an observation of the cat’s current state. But this is all just theory with no definitive truth or evidence to back up many of these theories. The book leaves you with more questions than answers, a majority of the solutions suggested in this book trying to solve the universe’s most puzzling questions can't even be tested or experimented on by man for awhile.The fact that we are just as far in technology and knowledge then when we were first brought into existence is just a mere step then what is left to explore. There is still so much that we humans have yet to understand and the fact we consider ourselves higher than any other species is just pure arrogance. It is astonishing to realize that we are still have a way to go to even answer some of the most basic of questions surrounding the creation of man. “Parallel Worlds” is an amazing book leading us on the front line of solving the most essential questions to our species and world around us. "
71,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,2,"In the Constance Garnett translations of Dostoyevsky, exasperated characters routinely ejaculate ""Tfoo!"" To sum up this colossal muckheap of a book, I say, ""Tfoo, Kaku!""Apparently, Dr. K. has done decent theoretical work in physics, but his inability to present clear ideas or a logical structure for whatever it is he's trying to say makes that a little difficult to accept. His ""aw shucks"" little-boy approach to difficult concepts leaves more loose ends than my cat toying with our curtain.My suspicions of the man started with the first page, his acknowledgements. Those he interviewed are arranged not alphabetically, not by the wealth of their contributions, but by the awards they have received: All Nobel laureates are noted first, followed by lesser beings. What does that tell you of objectivity and independence?Overall, this is a study (or hodge-podge) of theories of multiple universes and how to book a ferry ride between them. We visit wormholes and find that they wouldn't work well, in part because you'd need most of the energy of a galaxy to navigate one. And because you probably couldn't go home again.Kaku leaps form theory to theory like a mountain goat, leaving the reader, often, to plummet down an uncharted crevasse. His simple-minded and careless descriptions of complicated concepts read like early notes that never got edited. And his failure to fully evaluate opposing theories – some clever and interesting, others ludicrous – seems a dereliction of duty.Look at this: ""The mind reels when we realize that, according to this interpretation of quantum mechanics, all possible worlds exist with us. ... these quantum realities exist in the very same room that we live in."" They don't do anything of the sort! They exist in a some-other-where that has no connection with any room in our universe. This is just plain crappy, lazy writing.As Mr. Horse so eloquently put it in ""Ren and Stimpy,"" ""No sir, I don't like it."""
72,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35306337-harikleia,5,"The book “Parallel Worlds” by Michio Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York, is a very good guide for the universe, and perhaps, the multiverse (If the universe is infinite, then there must be a parallel one). It describes everything from the origins and beginning of our universe, to escaping the boundaries of it and what we may find there (if that is possible, and if we can ever manage it).	But this book is not boring like a textbook. It is true that most textbooks have analogies, but this book goes into more depth when it comes to such a thing, as well as making the analogy itself more interesting. Think: what would you find more interesting, accurate, and/or fun to read: if you were to take a fish out of a pond for a few seconds, and have it think that it was in a very different world (which it kind of is, but not in the sense the book is talking about) or if you put an animal in a zoo, instead of it’s natural habitat. Not only is this book informative, but also the method to grasp the reader’s interest is well thought-out. 	The writing style aside, the information presented in the book itself is intriguing. It doesn’t just address scientific fact and near-scientific fact. For example, most science books do not mention time travel as a possibility, because the idea is so absurd, especially with paradoxes (such as the Grandfather Paradox and the Predestination Paradox). And what if you knew that you could teleport to distant places in the universe. It’s just like saying that people can fly without using any apparatus, specifically for the purpose of flight.	As frightening as it may seem, the book also describes the possibilities of the end of the universe as we know it, but not in great detail. Still, most of the possibilities are hard to think of, so here comes the credit for the five stars!"
73,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42753855-ylexia-padilla,5,"Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku explores the many mysteries and theories of higher dimensions, black holes, creation of the universe and quantum theory through the greatest scientific minds as in Einstein, Heisenberg, Guth, Bohr, and Newton. The book explores many paradoxes such as the Cat Problem, where if a cat is sealed in a box with a bottle of poison inside connected to a hammer, which is connected to a Geiger counter placed near a piece of uranium. There is a 50 percent chance that the uranium will decay setting off the Geiger counter, which sets off the hammer breaking the glass bottle of poison killing the cat. “The cat is both dead and alive because the universe has split into two. In one universe, the cat is dead; in another universe, the cat is alive”. Like this, your mind will take a journey through the universe that will surely expose thoughts never thought of before. This book touches on many theories said and tested throughout history and clearly explains content with many analogies. I was surprisingly impressed on how the author, Michio Kaku, presents these meticulous, complex theories in a way that can be articulated by young readers. One of my favorite parts of the book was when Dr. Kaku decided to take a philosophical turn with the quantum controversy by George Berkeley that objects only exist because humans are there to observe them. “If a tree falls in a forest but no one is there to see it, then it does not really fall?” I recommend for all who have a deep curiosity of astronomy, quantum physics, and the mysteries of the universe.

But I never regret I started to read this book and finally finish it. Mr. Kaku successfully delivered comprehensive explanation about the universe.The book contains the A to Z of our universe. From the formation of the universe, the possibilities of the parallel universes, to some concepts for our civilazation to survive the death of our current universe by moving to the new one. One of the things that I like the most about this book is Mr. Kaku invited us to contemplate our life in our current time on Earth, he wanted us to celebrate our existence and utilize our life for beneficial things that could lead to better life for our descendant.Subjectively, the main down side of this book is some (if not most) of the contents of this book are too intense and complex. With only my highschool level of newtonian physics background and non-existence quantum physics background, sometimes it took good amount of time and several re-read for me to completely understand the concept and the content explained in the book and made it a little bit boring at times. Overall, this is a really good book to learn about our universe and all of things related to it. Thought the content is a little bit hard but it was so exciting to know and learn new things.

There are so many things that we have to discover and are being discovered that are revolutionizing what we previously thought. For example, recently in physics we had a set number how the maximum mass something could be, astronomers then found a cluster that proved this theory wrong ultimately boggling the minds of today's brightest minds.In this book they go more in depth into many topics so that the reader understands basic theories proposed by multiple projects. These theories go over many different genres of Astronomy. They include the multiple String theories to even the theory of Schrodinger's cat and the multiple dimensions. This book blows the mind of its readers by filling it to the capacity with things you have never even thought of, although its not really a book but more of a collection of many different theories.This was definitely a fantastic read. Although it follows no direct storyline it goes over all different constructs of the universe.

But, time to time he had started the futurology thing with references to science fiction, that makes it hard to take this book seriously with so much speculation. The book may inspire people to get into Physics, but for those who are already there, those who are filled with wonder at mathematical models of the universe and not fictional stories, this book may fail to broadcast.Anyway, the fact that parallel universes aren’t a theory, but predictions of certain theories, means that there are three logically possible lines of attack on parallel universes, corresponding to three types of claims:1) One or more of these “X implies Y” arguments are incorrect (inflation doesn’t predict *Level I, say).2) One or more of the theories X predicting multiverses are incorrect (inflation, say).3) Parallel universe is indeed predicted by scientific theories, but scientists shouldn’t waste their time thinking about such topics.Now, Attacking all these weaknesses on parallel universes involves doing interesting experimental and theoretical physics research. If any of the attacks succeed, the corresponding multiverse evidence is discredited. Conversely, if all the attacks fail, then we’ll be forced to take parallel universes more seriously whether we like them or not - such are the rules of science. In this way, parallel universes are no different from any other scientific idea.

100,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42604293-steven-huezo,5,"“Parallel Worlds” by Michio kaku is a book based around the many mysteries of the universe and the dozens of theories surrounding them. Kaku talks about the many ideas that have been made in the past several hundred years trying to explain the questions the universe has to offer to humanity. Focused mainly around the idea of parallel universes and how this universe came to be with each theory being as complaining and mind boggling as the last one.The book is at times difficult needing additional research to understand its concepts especially for a beginner in this type of area but is does do a good job at explaining some of the world's most controversial topic of the meaning of life. Citing many famous physicists such as Erwin Schrodinger to Albert Einstein theories and experiments used to try and solve or figure out questions that god has laid out for its creations to solve. One of the many mysteries being addressed in this book is the idea of multi-universes and the thought of traveling into one or even being in one. One experiment used to test this out was Erwin’s famous Schrodinger’s cat “,we put the cat in a nether world of being 50 percent dead and 50 percent alive simultaneously.” pg 158. This quote is saying how we are creating two universes one where the cat is alive and the other where that cat is dead, the only way to see which universe we are in is if we make an observation of the cat’s current state. But this is all just theory with no definitive truth or evidence to back up many of these theories. The book leaves you with more questions than answers, a majority of the solutions suggested in this book trying to solve the universe’s most puzzling questions can't even be tested or experimented on by man for awhile.The fact that we are just as far in technology and knowledge then when we were first brought into existence is just a mere step then what is left to explore. There is still so much that we humans have yet to understand and the fact we consider ourselves higher than any other species is just pure arrogance. It is astonishing to realize that we are still have a way to go to even answer some of the most basic of questions surrounding the creation of man. “Parallel Worlds” is an amazing book leading us on the front line of solving the most essential questions to our species and world around us. "
101,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,2,"In the Constance Garnett translations of Dostoyevsky, exasperated characters routinely ejaculate ""Tfoo!"" To sum up this colossal muckheap of a book, I say, ""Tfoo, Kaku!""Apparently, Dr. K. has done decent theoretical work in physics, but his inability to present clear ideas or a logical structure for whatever it is he's trying to say makes that a little difficult to accept. His ""aw shucks"" little-boy approach to difficult concepts leaves more loose ends than my cat toying with our curtain.My suspicions of the man started with the first page, his acknowledgements. Those he interviewed are arranged not alphabetically, not by the wealth of their contributions, but by the awards they have received: All Nobel laureates are noted first, followed by lesser beings. What does that tell you of objectivity and independence?Overall, this is a study (or hodge-podge) of theories of multiple universes and how to book a ferry ride between them. We visit wormholes and find that they wouldn't work well, in part because you'd need most of the energy of a galaxy to navigate one. And because you probably couldn't go home again.Kaku leaps form theory to theory like a mountain goat, leaving the reader, often, to plummet down an uncharted crevasse. His simple-minded and careless descriptions of complicated concepts read like early notes that never got edited. And his failure to fully evaluate opposing theories – some clever and interesting, others ludicrous – seems a dereliction of duty.Look at this: ""The mind reels when we realize that, according to this interpretation of quantum mechanics, all possible worlds exist with us. ... these quantum realities exist in the very same room that we live in."" They don't do anything of the sort! They exist in a some-other-where that has no connection with any room in our universe. This is just plain crappy, lazy writing.As Mr. Horse so eloquently put it in ""Ren and Stimpy,"" ""No sir, I don't like it."""
102,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35306337-harikleia,5,"The book “Parallel Worlds” by Michio Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York, is a very good guide for the universe, and perhaps, the multiverse (If the universe is infinite, then there must be a parallel one). It describes everything from the origins and beginning of our universe, to escaping the boundaries of it and what we may find there (if that is possible, and if we can ever manage it).	But this book is not boring like a textbook. It is true that most textbooks have analogies, but this book goes into more depth when it comes to such a thing, as well as making the analogy itself more interesting. Think: what would you find more interesting, accurate, and/or fun to read: if you were to take a fish out of a pond for a few seconds, and have it think that it was in a very different world (which it kind of is, but not in the sense the book is talking about) or if you put an animal in a zoo, instead of it’s natural habitat. Not only is this book informative, but also the method to grasp the reader’s interest is well thought-out. 	The writing style aside, the information presented in the book itself is intriguing. It doesn’t just address scientific fact and near-scientific fact. For example, most science books do not mention time travel as a possibility, because the idea is so absurd, especially with paradoxes (such as the Grandfather Paradox and the Predestination Paradox). And what if you knew that you could teleport to distant places in the universe. It’s just like saying that people can fly without using any apparatus, specifically for the purpose of flight.	As frightening as it may seem, the book also describes the possibilities of the end of the universe as we know it, but not in great detail. Still, most of the possibilities are hard to think of, so here comes the credit for the five stars!"
103,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42753855-ylexia-padilla,5,"Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku explores the many mysteries and theories of higher dimensions, black holes, creation of the universe and quantum theory through the greatest scientific minds as in Einstein, Heisenberg, Guth, Bohr, and Newton. The book explores many paradoxes such as the Cat Problem, where if a cat is sealed in a box with a bottle of poison inside connected to a hammer, which is connected to a Geiger counter placed near a piece of uranium. There is a 50 percent chance that the uranium will decay setting off the Geiger counter, which sets off the hammer breaking the glass bottle of poison killing the cat. “The cat is both dead and alive because the universe has split into two. In one universe, the cat is dead; in another universe, the cat is alive”. Like this, your mind will take a journey through the universe that will surely expose thoughts never thought of before. This book touches on many theories said and tested throughout history and clearly explains content with many analogies. I was surprisingly impressed on how the author, Michio Kaku, presents these meticulous, complex theories in a way that can be articulated by young readers. One of my favorite parts of the book was when Dr. Kaku decided to take a philosophical turn with the quantum controversy by George Berkeley that objects only exist because humans are there to observe them. “If a tree falls in a forest but no one is there to see it, then it does not really fall?” I recommend for all who have a deep curiosity of astronomy, quantum physics, and the mysteries of the universe.

But I never regret I started to read this book and finally finish it. Mr. Kaku successfully delivered comprehensive explanation about the universe.The book contains the A to Z of our universe. From the formation of the universe, the possibilities of the parallel universes, to some concepts for our civilazation to survive the death of our current universe by moving to the new one. One of the things that I like the most about this book is Mr. Kaku invited us to contemplate our life in our current time on Earth, he wanted us to celebrate our existence and utilize our life for beneficial things that could lead to better life for our descendant.Subjectively, the main down side of this book is some (if not most) of the contents of this book are too intense and complex. With only my highschool level of newtonian physics background and non-existence quantum physics background, sometimes it took good amount of time and several re-read for me to completely understand the concept and the content explained in the book and made it a little bit boring at times. Overall, this is a really good book to learn about our universe and all of things related to it. Thought the content is a little bit hard but it was so exciting to know and learn new things. I'd recommend this book to people who have interest in universe and physics in general."
105,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42862076-hunter,5,"Starting this book I was interested in the wonders this universe had to hold. There are so many things that we have to discover and are being discovered that are revolutionizing what we previously thought. For example, recently in physics we had a set number how the maximum mass something could be, astronomers then found a cluster that proved this theory wrong ultimately boggling the minds of today's brightest minds.In this book they go more in depth into many topics so that the reader understands basic theories proposed by multiple projects. These theories go over many different genres of Astronomy. They include the multiple String theories to even the theory of Schrodinger's cat and the multiple dimensions. This book blows the mind of its readers by filling it to the capacity with things you have never even thought of, although its not really a book but more of a collection of many different theories.This was definitely a fantastic read. Although it follows no direct storyline it goes over all different constructs of the universe. Each seperate catagory which are devided into chapters intrigued me more and more making me want to finish the whole book in the fastest amount of time. I genuinely enjoyed this book and a lot of people say they cannot put the book down and this was definatly one of those. "
106,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26199369-stanley-trice,4,"The author, Michio Kaku, explains the physics of parallel worlds, multiple universes, time travel, and other quantum topics in an easily understandable style that is entertaining and insightful. A few rare spots he delves into the mathematics and in some places he goes too long in the history of a particular theory, but mostly he explores the realms of other places that we cannot currently detect with our senses and instruments.I like Mr. Kaku’s writing style and on TV, during his presentations of science, when he explains in a calming voice such topics as the end of the universe. He reminds me of Carl Sagan and his whimsical explanations about all the things we do not know concerning the universe.The problem with science books is that they can quickly become outdated. This was written in 2006 during the heyday of string theory and the development of M-theory. Whether these continue to become the prevailing winds of the Theory of Everything (TOE) or the Grand Unifying Theory (GUT) has yet to be determined. Yet, the book is still worth a read regardless what happens in quantum physics because what happened to the universe in the past and what will happen in the future will most probably continue to be theory."

But little by little this book wore down on me and I don't enjoy it at all. Most of the reasoning is so abstract they flew right above my head. To tie in with purely physic and cosmological knowledge there are also questions of ethic and philosophical dimensions (Like, when can you say that something exists??) It just makes me want to tear my hair out. Half way through the book I start to space out a lot and basically I was just persevering to glean out any bit, any trivia that I might understand and remember. The author believes that a person non-initiated in astrophysics can understand this book. I'M SORRY I FAILED YOU, AUTHOR. So Even if I didn't enjoy this book I'm putting three stars on it because I don't want my intellectual limits to penalize this massive, comprehensive work's rating. "

What really stood out to me is the discussion towards the end of the book of ideas about parallel universes. I've read other books briefly mention the possibility of parallel universes, but never have I read such a deep discussion about them. There are fascinating ideas of how future advanced civilizations could do things like traveling to a parallel universe, or escape the end of our universe by creating another universe. It just blew my mind.. the realization that while our engineering capabilities are so far behind to realize such potentialities, our scientific minds are advanced enough to consider them in quite some detail."

I felt I should write down a review that simply stated that this book is really an insightful read to the nature of reality and it should affect your frame of mind in regards to the universe (if you have not much exposure in deep physics concepts). Although, I do have to admit that it is dry and may be extremely difficult to read. I took a long time to read this book. Others I know have found it difficult to read and some have put the book down entirely. But it is enlightening, if you dare delve into this text. Also the last 50 pages are a little sci-fi and zany.

133,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42753855-ylexia-padilla,5,"Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku explores the many mysteries and theories of higher dimensions, black holes, creation of the universe and quantum theory through the greatest scientific minds as in Einstein, Heisenberg, Guth, Bohr, and Newton. The book explores many paradoxes such as the Cat Problem, where if a cat is sealed in a box with a bottle of poison inside connected to a hammer, which is connected to a Geiger counter placed near a piece of uranium. There is a 50 percent chance that the uranium will decay setting off the Geiger counter, which sets off the hammer breaking the glass bottle of poison killing the cat. “The cat is both dead and alive because the universe has split into two. In one universe, the cat is dead; in another universe, the cat is alive”. Like this, your mind will take a journey through the universe that will surely expose thoughts never thought of before. This book touches on many theories said and tested throughout history and clearly explains content with many analogies. I was surprisingly impressed on how the author, Michio Kaku, presents these meticulous, complex theories in a way that can be articulated by young readers. One of my favorite parts of the book was when Dr. Kaku decided to take a philosophical turn with the quantum controversy by George Berkeley that objects only exist because humans are there to observe them. “If a tree falls in a forest but no one is there to see it, then it does not really fall?” I recommend for all who have a deep curiosity of astronomy, quantum physics, and the mysteries of the universe.

But I never regret I started to read this book and finally finish it. Mr. Kaku successfully delivered comprehensive explanation about the universe.The book contains the A to Z of our universe. From the formation of the universe, the possibilities of the parallel universes, to some concepts for our civilazation to survive the death of our current universe by moving to the new one. One of the things that I like the most about this book is Mr. Kaku invited us to contemplate our life in our current time on Earth, he wanted us to celebrate our existence and utilize our life for beneficial things that could lead to better life for our descendant.Subjectively, the main down side of this book is some (if not most) of the contents of this book are too intense and complex. With only my highschool level of newtonian physics background and non-existence quantum physics background, sometimes it took good amount of time and several re-read for me to completely understand the concept and the content explained in the book and made it a little bit boring at times. Overall, this is a really good book to learn about our universe and all of things related to it. Thought the content is a little bit hard but it was so exciting to know and learn new things. I'd recommend this book to people who have interest in universe and physics in general."
135,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42862076-hunter,5,"Starting this book I was interested in the wonders this universe had to hold. There are so many things that we have to discover and are being discovered that are revolutionizing what we previously thought. For example, recently in physics we had a set number how the maximum mass something could be, astronomers then found a cluster that proved this theory wrong ultimately boggling the minds of today's brightest minds.In this book they go more in depth into many topics so that the reader understands basic theories proposed by multiple projects. These theories go over many different genres of Astronomy. They include the multiple String theories to even the theory of Schrodinger's cat and the multiple dimensions. This book blows the mind of its readers by filling it to the capacity with things you have never even thought of, although its not really a book but more of a collection of many different theories.This was definitely a fantastic read. Although it follows no direct storyline it goes over all different constructs of the universe. Each seperate catagory which are devided into chapters intrigued me more and more making me want to finish the whole book in the fastest amount of time. I genuinely enjoyed this book and a lot of people say they cannot put the book down and this was definatly one of those. "
136,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26199369-stanley-trice,4,"The author, Michio Kaku, explains the physics of parallel worlds, multiple universes, time travel, and other quantum topics in an easily understandable style that is entertaining and insightful. A few rare spots he delves into the mathematics and in some places he goes too long in the history of a particular theory, but mostly he explores the realms of other places that we cannot currently detect with our senses and instruments.I like Mr. Kaku’s writing style and on TV, during his presentations of science, when he explains in a calming voice such topics as the end of the universe. He reminds me of Carl Sagan and his whimsical explanations about all the things we do not know concerning the universe.The problem with science books is that they can quickly become outdated. This was written in 2006 during the heyday of string theory and the development of M-theory. Whether these continue to become the prevailing winds of the Theory of Everything (TOE) or the Grand Unifying Theory (GUT) has yet to be determined. Yet, the book is still worth a read regardless what happens in quantum physics because what happened to the universe in the past and what will happen in the future will most probably continue to be theory."

But little by little this book wore down on me and I don't enjoy it at all. Most of the reasoning is so abstract they flew right above my head. To tie in with purely physic and cosmological knowledge there are also questions of ethic and philosophical dimensions (Like, when can you say that something exists??) It just makes me want to tear my hair out. Half way through the book I start to space out a lot and basically I was just persevering to glean out any bit, any trivia that I might understand and remember. The author believes that a person non-initiated in astrophysics can understand this book. I'M SORRY I FAILED YOU, AUTHOR. So Even if I didn't enjoy this book I'm putting three stars on it because I don't want my intellectual limits to penalize this massive, comprehensive work's rating. "

I've read other books briefly mention the possibility of parallel universes, but never have I read such a deep discussion about them. There are fascinating ideas of how future advanced civilizations could do things like traveling to a parallel universe, or escape the end of our universe by creating another universe. It just blew my mind.. the realization that while our engineering capabilities are so far behind to realize such potentialities, our scientific minds are advanced enough to consider them in quite some detail."

I felt I should write down a review that simply stated that this book is really an insightful read to the nature of reality and it should affect your frame of mind in regards to the universe (if you have not much exposure in deep physics concepts). Although, I do have to admit that it is dry and may be extremely difficult to read. I took a long time to read this book. Others I know have found it difficult to read and some have put the book down entirely. But it is enlightening, if you dare delve into this text. Also the last 50 pages are a little sci-fi and zany.

Nevertheless, I love good science writing and Kaku is quite good, usually able to make things clear and explain how it all works. As noted, there are a number of points in the book where I just didn't understand, and I don't think that's Kaku's fault.The most interesting parts of the book, for me, are the last several chapters, when Kaku speculates both on the eventual ""heat death of the universe"" and what strategies might exist for intelligent life to survive even that. It's all quite fascinating to consider even as a lot of it goes beyond the ability to even visualize what such intelligence might look like."

Although, I do have to admit that it is dry and may be extremely difficult to read. I took a long time to read this book.

Reads like an Einstein biography at timesIn short, Kaku may not have had enough information for a book, but rolled with it anyway.Don't get me wrong, I learned a lot from reading it, and there were some truly jaw-dropping moments, but the last 100 pages or so of pure speculation with no scientific data to back up any of the claims he made was a bit too much.Still, if you love cosmology, this is something I would still recommend reading."

Nevertheless, I love good science writing and Kaku is quite good, usually able to make things clear and explain how it all works. As noted, there are a number of points in the book where I just didn't understand, and I don't think that's Kaku's fault.The most interesting parts of the book, for me, are the last several chapters, when Kaku speculates both on the eventual ""heat death of the universe"" and what strategies might exist for intelligent life to survive even that. It's all quite fascinating to consider even as a lot of it goes beyond the ability to even visualize what such intelligence might look like."

But, time to time he had started the futurology thing with references to science fiction, that makes it hard to take this book seriously with so much speculation. The book may inspire people to get into Physics, but for those who are already there, those who are filled with wonder at mathematical models of the universe and not fictional stories, this book may fail to broadcast.Anyway, the fact that parallel universes aren’t a theory, but predictions of certain theories, means that there are three logically possible lines of attack on parallel universes, corresponding to three types of claims:1) One or more of these “X implies Y” arguments are incorrect (inflation doesn’t predict *Level I, say).2) One or more of the theories X predicting multiverses are incorrect (inflation, say).3) Parallel universe is indeed predicted by scientific theories, but scientists shouldn’t waste their time thinking about such topics.Now, Attacking all these weaknesses on parallel universes involves doing interesting experimental and theoretical physics research. If any of the attacks succeed, the corresponding multiverse evidence is discredited. Conversely, if all the attacks fail, then we’ll be forced to take parallel universes more seriously whether we like them or not - such are the rules of science. In this way, parallel universes are no different from any other scientific idea.

190,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42604293-steven-huezo,5,"“Parallel Worlds” by Michio kaku is a book based around the many mysteries of the universe and the dozens of theories surrounding them. Kaku talks about the many ideas that have been made in the past several hundred years trying to explain the questions the universe has to offer to humanity. Focused mainly around the idea of parallel universes and how this universe came to be with each theory being as complaining and mind boggling as the last one.The book is at times difficult needing additional research to understand its concepts especially for a beginner in this type of area but is does do a good job at explaining some of the world's most controversial topic of the meaning of life. Citing many famous physicists such as Erwin Schrodinger to Albert Einstein theories and experiments used to try and solve or figure out questions that god has laid out for its creations to solve. One of the many mysteries being addressed in this book is the idea of multi-universes and the thought of traveling into one or even being in one. One experiment used to test this out was Erwin’s famous Schrodinger’s cat “,we put the cat in a nether world of being 50 percent dead and 50 percent alive simultaneously.” pg 158. This quote is saying how we are creating two universes one where the cat is alive and the other where that cat is dead, the only way to see which universe we are in is if we make an observation of the cat’s current state. But this is all just theory with no definitive truth or evidence to back up many of these theories. The book leaves you with more questions than answers, a majority of the solutions suggested in this book trying to solve the universe’s most puzzling questions can't even be tested or experimented on by man for awhile.The fact that we are just as far in technology and knowledge then when we were first brought into existence is just a mere step then what is left to explore. There is still so much that we humans have yet to understand and the fact we consider ourselves higher than any other species is just pure arrogance. It is astonishing to realize that we are still have a way to go to even answer some of the most basic of questions surrounding the creation of man. “Parallel Worlds” is an amazing book leading us on the front line of solving the most essential questions to our species and world around us.

191,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,2,"In the Constance Garnett translations of Dostoyevsky, exasperated characters routinely ejaculate ""Tfoo!"" To sum up this colossal muckheap of a book, I say, ""Tfoo, Kaku!""Apparently, Dr. K. has done decent theoretical work in physics, but his inability to present clear ideas or a logical structure for whatever it is he's trying to say makes that a little difficult to accept. His ""aw shucks"" little-boy approach to difficult concepts leaves more loose ends than my cat toying with our curtain.My suspicions of the man started with the first page, his acknowledgements. Those he interviewed are arranged not alphabetically, not by the wealth of their contributions, but by the awards they have received: All Nobel laureates are noted first, followed by lesser beings. What does that tell you of objectivity and independence?Overall, this is a study (or hodge-podge) of theories of multiple universes and how to book a ferry ride between them. We visit wormholes and find that they wouldn't work well, in part because you'd need most of the energy of a galaxy to navigate one. And because you probably couldn't go home again.Kaku leaps form theory to theory like a mountain goat, leaving the reader, often, to plummet down an uncharted crevasse. His simple-minded and careless descriptions of complicated concepts read like early notes that never got edited. And his failure to fully evaluate opposing theories – some clever and interesting, others ludicrous – seems a dereliction of duty.Look at this: ""The mind reels when we realize that, according to this interpretation of quantum mechanics, all possible worlds exist with us. ... these quantum realities exist in the very same room that we live in."" They don't do anything of the sort! They exist in a some-other-where that has no connection with any room in our universe. This is just plain crappy, lazy writing.As Mr. Horse so eloquently put it in ""Ren and Stimpy,"" ""No sir, I don't like it."""

It describes everything from the origins and beginning of our universe, to escaping the boundaries of it and what we may find there (if that is possible, and if we can ever manage it).	But this book is not boring like a textbook. It is true that most textbooks have analogies, but this book goes into more depth when it comes to such a thing, as well as making the analogy itself more interesting. Think: what would you find more interesting, accurate, and/or fun to read: if you were to take a fish out of a pond for a few seconds, and have it think that it was in a very different world (which it kind of is, but not in the sense the book is talking about) or if you put an animal in a zoo, instead of it’s natural habitat. Not only is this book informative, but also the method to grasp the reader’s interest is well thought-out. 	The writing style aside, the information presented in the book itself is intriguing. It doesn’t just address scientific fact and near-scientific fact. For example, most science books do not mention time travel as a possibility, because the idea is so absurd, especially with paradoxes (such as the Grandfather Paradox and the Predestination Paradox).

There are fascinating ideas of how future advanced civilizations could do things like traveling to a parallel universe, or escape the end of our universe by creating another universe. It just blew my mind.. the realization that while our engineering capabilities are so far behind to realize such potentialities, our scientific minds are advanced enough to consider them in quite some detail."

Of interest is the theory that the universe continues to expand, stretching outward, ever farther away from us, so that Earth humans may never be capable of reaching distant worlds.

But, time to time he had started the futurology thing with references to science fiction, that makes it hard to take this book seriously with so much speculation. The book may inspire people to get into Physics, but for those who are already there, those who are filled with wonder at mathematical models of the universe and not fictional stories, this book may fail to broadcast.Anyway, the fact that parallel universes aren’t a theory, but predictions of certain theories, means that there are three logically possible lines of attack on parallel universes, corresponding to three types of claims:1) One or more of these “X implies Y” arguments are incorrect (inflation doesn’t predict *Level I, say).2) One or more of the theories X predicting multiverses are incorrect (inflation, say).3) Parallel universe is indeed predicted by scientific theories, but scientists shouldn’t waste their time thinking about such topics.Now, Attacking all these weaknesses on parallel universes involves doing interesting experimental and theoretical physics research. If any of the attacks succeed, the corresponding multiverse evidence is discredited. Conversely, if all the attacks fail, then we’ll be forced to take parallel universes more seriously whether we like them or not - such are the rules of science. In this way, parallel universes are no different from any other scientific idea.

220,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42604293-steven-huezo,5,"“Parallel Worlds” by Michio kaku is a book based around the many mysteries of the universe and the dozens of theories surrounding them. Kaku talks about the many ideas that have been made in the past several hundred years trying to explain the questions the universe has to offer to humanity. Focused mainly around the idea of parallel universes and how this universe came to be with each theory being as complaining and mind boggling as the last one.The book is at times difficult needing additional research to understand its concepts especially for a beginner in this type of area but is does do a good job at explaining some of the world's most controversial topic of the meaning of life. Citing many famous physicists such as Erwin Schrodinger to Albert Einstein theories and experiments used to try and solve or figure out questions that god has laid out for its creations to solve. One of the many mysteries being addressed in this book is the idea of multi-universes and the thought of traveling into one or even being in one. One experiment used to test this out was Erwin’s famous Schrodinger’s cat “,we put the cat in a nether world of being 50 percent dead and 50 percent alive simultaneously.” pg 158. This quote is saying how we are creating two universes one where the cat is alive and the other where that cat is dead, the only way to see which universe we are in is if we make an observation of the cat’s current state. But this is all just theory with no definitive truth or evidence to back up many of these theories. The book leaves you with more questions than answers, a majority of the solutions suggested in this book trying to solve the universe’s most puzzling questions can't even be tested or experimented on by man for awhile.The fact that we are just as far in technology and knowledge then when we were first brought into existence is just a mere step then what is left to explore. There is still so much that we humans have yet to understand and the fact we consider ourselves higher than any other species is just pure arrogance. It is astonishing to realize that we are still have a way to go to even answer some of the most basic of questions surrounding the creation of man. “Parallel Worlds” is an amazing book leading us on the front line of solving the most essential questions to our species and world around us. "
221,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,2,"In the Constance Garnett translations of Dostoyevsky, exasperated characters routinely ejaculate ""Tfoo!"" To sum up this colossal muckheap of a book, I say, ""Tfoo, Kaku!""Apparently, Dr. K. has done decent theoretical work in physics, but his inability to present clear ideas or a logical structure for whatever it is he's trying to say makes that a little difficult to accept. His ""aw shucks"" little-boy approach to difficult concepts leaves more loose ends than my cat toying with our curtain.My suspicions of the man started with the first page, his acknowledgements. Those he interviewed are arranged not alphabetically, not by the wealth of their contributions, but by the awards they have received: All Nobel laureates are noted first, followed by lesser beings. What does that tell you of objectivity and independence?Overall, this is a study (or hodge-podge) of theories of multiple universes and how to book a ferry ride between them. We visit wormholes and find that they wouldn't work well, in part because you'd need most of the energy of a galaxy to navigate one. And because you probably couldn't go home again.Kaku leaps form theory to theory like a mountain goat, leaving the reader, often, to plummet down an uncharted crevasse. His simple-minded and careless descriptions of complicated concepts read like early notes that never got edited. And his failure to fully evaluate opposing theories – some clever and interesting, others ludicrous – seems a dereliction of duty.Look at this: ""The mind reels when we realize that, according to this interpretation of quantum mechanics, all possible worlds exist with us. ... these quantum realities exist in the very same room that we live in."" They don't do anything of the sort! They exist in a some-other-where that has no connection with any room in our universe. This is just plain crappy, lazy writing.As Mr. Horse so eloquently put it in ""Ren and Stimpy,"" ""No sir, I don't like it."""
222,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35306337-harikleia,5,"The book “Parallel Worlds” by Michio Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York, is a very good guide for the universe, and perhaps, the multiverse (If the universe is infinite, then there must be a parallel one). It describes everything from the origins and beginning of our universe, to escaping the boundaries of it and what we may find there (if that is possible, and if we can ever manage it).	But this book is not boring like a textbook. It is true that most textbooks have analogies, but this book goes into more depth when it comes to such a thing, as well as making the analogy itself more interesting. Think: what would you find more interesting, accurate, and/or fun to read: if you were to take a fish out of a pond for a few seconds, and have it think that it was in a very different world (which it kind of is, but not in the sense the book is talking about) or if you put an animal in a zoo, instead of it’s natural habitat. Not only is this book informative, but also the method to grasp the reader’s interest is well thought-out. 	The writing style aside, the information presented in the book itself is intriguing. It doesn’t just address scientific fact and near-scientific fact. For example, most science books do not mention time travel as a possibility, because the idea is so absurd, especially with paradoxes (such as the Grandfather Paradox and the Predestination Paradox). And what if you knew that you could teleport to distant places in the universe. It’s just like saying that people can fly without using any apparatus, specifically for the purpose of flight.	As frightening as it may seem, the book also describes the possibilities of the end of the universe as we know it, but not in great detail. Still, most of the possibilities are hard to think of, so here comes the credit for the five stars!"
223,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42753855-ylexia-padilla,5,"Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku explores the many mysteries and theories of higher dimensions, black holes, creation of the universe and quantum theory through the greatest scientific minds as in Einstein, Heisenberg, Guth, Bohr, and Newton. The book explores many paradoxes such as the Cat Problem, where if a cat is sealed in a box with a bottle of poison inside connected to a hammer, which is connected to a Geiger counter placed near a piece of uranium. There is a 50 percent chance that the uranium will decay setting off the Geiger counter, which sets off the hammer breaking the glass bottle of poison killing the cat. “The cat is both dead and alive because the universe has split into two. In one universe, the cat is dead; in another universe, the cat is alive”. Like this, your mind will take a journey through the universe that will surely expose thoughts never thought of before. This book touches on many theories said and tested throughout history and clearly explains content with many analogies. I was surprisingly impressed on how the author, Michio Kaku, presents these meticulous, complex theories in a way that can be articulated by young readers. One of my favorite parts of the book was when Dr. Kaku decided to take a philosophical turn with the quantum controversy by George Berkeley that objects only exist because humans are there to observe them. “If a tree falls in a forest but no one is there to see it, then it does not really fall?” I recommend for all who have a deep curiosity of astronomy, quantum physics, and the mysteries of the universe.

But I never regret I started to read this book and finally finish it. Mr. Kaku successfully delivered comprehensive explanation about the universe.The book contains the A to Z of our universe. From the formation of the universe, the possibilities of the parallel universes, to some concepts for our civilazation to survive the death of our current universe by moving to the new one. One of the things that I like the most about this book is Mr. Kaku invited us to contemplate our life in our current time on Earth, he wanted us to celebrate our existence and utilize our life for beneficial things that could lead to better life for our descendant.Subjectively, the main down side of this book is some (if not most) of the contents of this book are too intense and complex. With only my highschool level of newtonian physics background and non-existence quantum physics background, sometimes it took good amount of time and several re-read for me to completely understand the concept and the content explained in the book and made it a little bit boring at times. Overall, this is a really good book to learn about our universe and all of things related to it. Thought the content is a little bit hard but it was so exciting to know and learn new things. I'd recommend this book to people who have interest in universe and physics in general."
225,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42862076-hunter,5,"Starting this book I was interested in the wonders this universe had to hold. There are so many things that we have to discover and are being discovered that are revolutionizing what we previously thought. For example, recently in physics we had a set number how the maximum mass something could be, astronomers then found a cluster that proved this theory wrong ultimately boggling the minds of today's brightest minds.In this book they go more in depth into many topics so that the reader understands basic theories proposed by multiple projects. These theories go over many different genres of Astronomy. They include the multiple String theories to even the theory of Schrodinger's cat and the multiple dimensions. This book blows the mind of its readers by filling it to the capacity with things you have never even thought of, although its not really a book but more of a collection of many different theories.This was definitely a fantastic read. Although it follows no direct storyline it goes over all different constructs of the universe. Each seperate catagory which are devided into chapters intrigued me more and more making me want to finish the whole book in the fastest amount of time. I genuinely enjoyed this book and a lot of people say they cannot put the book down and this was definatly one of those. "

A few rare spots he delves into the mathematics and in some places he goes too long in the history of a particular theory, but mostly he explores the realms of other places that we cannot currently detect with our senses and instruments.I like Mr. Kaku’s writing style and on TV, during his presentations of science, when he explains in a calming voice such topics as the end of the universe. He reminds me of Carl Sagan and his whimsical explanations about all the things we do not know concerning the universe.The problem with science books is that they can quickly become outdated. This was written in 2006 during the heyday of string theory and the development of M-theory. Whether these continue to become the prevailing winds of the Theory of Everything (TOE) or the Grand Unifying Theory (GUT) has yet to be determined. Yet, the book is still worth a read regardless what happens in quantum physics because what happened to the universe in the past and what will happen in the future will most probably continue to be theory."

But little by little this book wore down on me and I don't enjoy it at all. Most of the reasoning is so abstract they flew right above my head. To tie in with purely physic and cosmological knowledge there are also questions of ethic and philosophical dimensions (Like, when can you say that something exists??) It just makes me want to tear my hair out. Half way through the book I start to space out a lot and basically I was just persevering to glean out any bit, any trivia that I might understand and remember. The author believes that a person non-initiated in astrophysics can understand this book. I'M SORRY I FAILED YOU, AUTHOR.

Kaku talks about the many ideas that have been made in the past several hundred years trying to explain the questions the universe has to offer to humanity. Focused mainly around the idea of parallel universes and how this universe came to be with each theory being as complaining and mind boggling as the last one.The book is at times difficult needing additional research to understand its concepts especially for a beginner in this type of area but is does do a good job at explaining some of the world's most controversial topic of the meaning of life. Citing many famous physicists such as Erwin Schrodinger to Albert Einstein theories and experiments used to try and solve or figure out questions that god has laid out for its creations to solve. One of the many mysteries being addressed in this book is the idea of multi-universes and the thought of traveling into one or even being in one. One experiment used to test this out was Erwin’s famous Schrodinger’s cat “,we put the cat in a nether world of being 50 percent dead and 50 percent alive simultaneously.” pg 158. This quote is saying how we are creating two universes one where the cat is alive and the other where that cat is dead, the only way to see which universe we are in is if we make an observation of the cat’s current state. But this is all just theory with no definitive truth or evidence to back up many of these theories. The book leaves you with more questions than answers, a majority of the solutions suggested in this book trying to solve the universe’s most puzzling questions can't even be tested or experimented on by man for awhile.The fact that we are just as far in technology and knowledge then when we were first brought into existence is just a mere step then what is left to explore. There is still so much that we humans have yet to understand and the fact we consider ourselves higher than any other species is just pure arrogance. It is astonishing to realize that we are still have a way to go to even answer some of the most basic of questions surrounding the creation of man. “Parallel Worlds” is an amazing book leading us on the front line of solving the most essential questions to our species and world around us.

251,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,2,"In the Constance Garnett translations of Dostoyevsky, exasperated characters routinely ejaculate ""Tfoo!"" To sum up this colossal muckheap of a book, I say, ""Tfoo, Kaku!""Apparently, Dr. K. has done decent theoretical work in physics, but his inability to present clear ideas or a logical structure for whatever it is he's trying to say makes that a little difficult to accept. His ""aw shucks"" little-boy approach to difficult concepts leaves more loose ends than my cat toying with our curtain.My suspicions of the man started with the first page, his acknowledgements. Those he interviewed are arranged not alphabetically, not by the wealth of their contributions, but by the awards they have received: All Nobel laureates are noted first, followed by lesser beings. What does that tell you of objectivity and independence?Overall, this is a study (or hodge-podge) of theories of multiple universes and how to book a ferry ride between them. We visit wormholes and find that they wouldn't work well, in part because you'd need most of the energy of a galaxy to navigate one. And because you probably couldn't go home again.Kaku leaps form theory to theory like a mountain goat, leaving the reader, often, to plummet down an uncharted crevasse. His simple-minded and careless descriptions of complicated concepts read like early notes that never got edited. And his failure to fully evaluate opposing theories – some clever and interesting, others ludicrous – seems a dereliction of duty.Look at this: ""The mind reels when we realize that, according to this interpretation of quantum mechanics, all possible worlds exist with us. ... these quantum realities exist in the very same room that we live in."" They don't do anything of the sort! They exist in a some-other-where that has no connection with any room in our universe. This is just plain crappy, lazy writing.As Mr. Horse so eloquently put it in ""Ren and Stimpy,"" ""No sir, I don't like it."""
252,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35306337-harikleia,5,"The book “Parallel Worlds” by Michio Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York, is a very good guide for the universe, and perhaps, the multiverse (If the universe is infinite, then there must be a parallel one). It describes everything from the origins and beginning of our universe, to escaping the boundaries of it and what we may find there (if that is possible, and if we can ever manage it).	But this book is not boring like a textbook. It is true that most textbooks have analogies, but this book goes into more depth when it comes to such a thing, as well as making the analogy itself more interesting. Think: what would you find more interesting, accurate, and/or fun to read: if you were to take a fish out of a pond for a few seconds, and have it think that it was in a very different world (which it kind of is, but not in the sense the book is talking about) or if you put an animal in a zoo, instead of it’s natural habitat. Not only is this book informative, but also the method to grasp the reader’s interest is well thought-out. 	The writing style aside, the information presented in the book itself is intriguing. It doesn’t just address scientific fact and near-scientific fact. For example, most science books do not mention time travel as a possibility, because the idea is so absurd, especially with paradoxes (such as the Grandfather Paradox and the Predestination Paradox). And what if you knew that you could teleport to distant places in the universe. It’s just like saying that people can fly without using any apparatus, specifically for the purpose of flight.	As frightening as it may seem, the book also describes the possibilities of the end of the universe as we know it, but not in great detail. Still, most of the possibilities are hard to think of, so here comes the credit for the five stars!"
253,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42753855-ylexia-padilla,5,"Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku explores the many mysteries and theories of higher dimensions, black holes, creation of the universe and quantum theory through the greatest scientific minds as in Einstein, Heisenberg, Guth, Bohr, and Newton. The book explores many paradoxes such as the Cat Problem, where if a cat is sealed in a box with a bottle of poison inside connected to a hammer, which is connected to a Geiger counter placed near a piece of uranium. There is a 50 percent chance that the uranium will decay setting off the Geiger counter, which sets off the hammer breaking the glass bottle of poison killing the cat. “The cat is both dead and alive because the universe has split into two. In one universe, the cat is dead; in another universe, the cat is alive”. Like this, your mind will take a journey through the universe that will surely expose thoughts never thought of before. This book touches on many theories said and tested throughout history and clearly explains content with many analogies. I was surprisingly impressed on how the author, Michio Kaku, presents these meticulous, complex theories in a way that can be articulated by young readers. One of my favorite parts of the book was when Dr. Kaku decided to take a philosophical turn with the quantum controversy by George Berkeley that objects only exist because humans are there to observe them. “If a tree falls in a forest but no one is there to see it, then it does not really fall?” I recommend for all who have a deep curiosity of astronomy, quantum physics, and the mysteries of the universe.

But I never regret I started to read this book and finally finish it. Mr. Kaku successfully delivered comprehensive explanation about the universe.The book contains the A to Z of our universe. From the formation of the universe, the possibilities of the parallel universes, to some concepts for our civilazation to survive the death of our current universe by moving to the new one. One of the things that I like the most about this book is Mr. Kaku invited us to contemplate our life in our current time on Earth, he wanted us to celebrate our existence and utilize our life for beneficial things that could lead to better life for our descendant.Subjectively, the main down side of this book is some (if not most) of the contents of this book are too intense and complex. With only my highschool level of newtonian physics background and non-existence quantum physics background, sometimes it took good amount of time and several re-read for me to completely understand the concept and the content explained in the book and made it a little bit boring at times. Overall, this is a really good book to learn about our universe and all of things related to it. Thought the content is a little bit hard but it was so exciting to know and learn new things. I'd recommend this book to people who have interest in universe and physics in general."
255,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42862076-hunter,5,"Starting this book I was interested in the wonders this universe had to hold. There are so many things that we have to discover and are being discovered that are revolutionizing what we previously thought. For example, recently in physics we had a set number how the maximum mass something could be, astronomers then found a cluster that proved this theory wrong ultimately boggling the minds of today's brightest minds.In this book they go more in depth into many topics so that the reader understands basic theories proposed by multiple projects. These theories go over many different genres of Astronomy. They include the multiple String theories to even the theory of Schrodinger's cat and the multiple dimensions. This book blows the mind of its readers by filling it to the capacity with things you have never even thought of, although its not really a book but more of a collection of many different theories.This was definitely a fantastic read. Although it follows no direct storyline it goes over all different constructs of the universe. Each seperate catagory which are devided into chapters intrigued me more and more making me want to finish the whole book in the fastest amount of time. I genuinely enjoyed this book and a lot of people say they cannot put the book down and this was definatly one of those. "
256,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26199369-stanley-trice,4,"The author, Michio Kaku, explains the physics of parallel worlds, multiple universes, time travel, and other quantum topics in an easily understandable style that is entertaining and insightful. A few rare spots he delves into the mathematics and in some places he goes too long in the history of a particular theory, but mostly he explores the realms of other places that we cannot currently detect with our senses and instruments.I like Mr. Kaku’s writing style and on TV, during his presentations of science, when he explains in a calming voice such topics as the end of the universe. He reminds me of Carl Sagan and his whimsical explanations about all the things we do not know concerning the universe.The problem with science books is that they can quickly become outdated. This was written in 2006 during the heyday of string theory and the development of M-theory. Whether these continue to become the prevailing winds of the Theory of Everything (TOE) or the Grand Unifying Theory (GUT) has yet to be determined. Yet, the book is still worth a read regardless what happens in quantum physics because what happened to the universe in the past and what will happen in the future will most probably continue to be theory."

But little by little this book wore down on me and I don't enjoy it at all. Most of the reasoning is so abstract they flew right above my head. To tie in with purely physic and cosmological knowledge there are also questions of ethic and philosophical dimensions (Like, when can you say that something exists??) It just makes me want to tear my hair out. Half way through the book I start to space out a lot and basically I was just persevering to glean out any bit, any trivia that I might understand and remember. The author believes that a person non-initiated in astrophysics can understand this book. I'M SORRY I FAILED YOU, AUTHOR. So Even if I didn't enjoy this book I'm putting three stars on it because I don't want my intellectual limits to penalize this massive, comprehensive work's rating. "

What really stood out to me is the discussion towards the end of the book of ideas about parallel universes. I've read other books briefly mention the possibility of parallel universes, but never have I read such a deep discussion about them. There are fascinating ideas of how future advanced civilizations could do things like traveling to a parallel universe, or escape the end of our universe by creating another universe. It just blew my mind.. the realization that while our engineering capabilities are so far behind to realize such potentialities, our scientific minds are advanced enough to consider them in quite some detail."

I felt I should write down a review that simply stated that this book is really an insightful read to the nature of reality and it should affect your frame of mind in regards to the universe (if you have not much exposure in deep physics concepts). Although, I do have to admit that it is dry and may be extremely difficult to read. I took a long time to read this book. Others I know have found it difficult to read and some have put the book down entirely. But it is enlightening, if you dare delve into this text. Also the last 50 pages are a little sci-fi and zany.

Reads like an Einstein biography at timesIn short, Kaku may not have had enough information for a book, but rolled with it anyway.Don't get me wrong, I learned a lot from reading it, and there were some truly jaw-dropping moments, but the last 100 pages or so of pure speculation with no scientific data to back up any of the claims he made was a bit too much.Still, if you love cosmology, this is something I would still recommend reading."

Nevertheless, I love good science writing and Kaku is quite good, usually able to make things clear and explain how it all works. As noted, there are a number of points in the book where I just didn't understand, and I don't think that's Kaku's fault.The most interesting parts of the book, for me, are the last several chapters, when Kaku speculates both on the eventual ""heat death of the universe"" and what strategies might exist for intelligent life to survive even that. It's all quite fascinating to consider even as a lot of it goes beyond the ability to even visualize what such intelligence might look like."

The book leaves you with more questions than answers, a majority of the solutions suggested in this book trying to solve the universe’s most puzzling questions can't even be tested or experimented on by man for awhile.The fact that we are just as far in technology and knowledge then when we were first brought into existence is just a mere step then what is left to explore. There is still so much that we humans have yet to understand and the fact we consider ourselves higher than any other species is just pure arrogance. It is astonishing to realize that we are still have a way to go to even answer some of the most basic of questions surrounding the creation of man. “Parallel Worlds” is an amazing book leading us on the front line of solving the most essential questions to our species and world around us.

281,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,2,"In the Constance Garnett translations of Dostoyevsky, exasperated characters routinely ejaculate ""Tfoo!"" To sum up this colossal muckheap of a book, I say, ""Tfoo, Kaku!""Apparently, Dr. K. has done decent theoretical work in physics, but his inability to present clear ideas or a logical structure for whatever it is he's trying to say makes that a little difficult to accept. His ""aw shucks"" little-boy approach to difficult concepts leaves more loose ends than my cat toying with our curtain.My suspicions of the man started with the first page, his acknowledgements. Those he interviewed are arranged not alphabetically, not by the wealth of their contributions, but by the awards they have received: All Nobel laureates are noted first, followed by lesser beings. What does that tell you of objectivity and independence?Overall, this is a study (or hodge-podge) of theories of multiple universes and how to book a ferry ride between them. We visit wormholes and find that they wouldn't work well, in part because you'd need most of the energy of a galaxy to navigate one. And because you probably couldn't go home again.Kaku leaps form theory to theory like a mountain goat, leaving the reader, often, to plummet down an uncharted crevasse. His simple-minded and careless descriptions of complicated concepts read like early notes that never got edited. And his failure to fully evaluate opposing theories – some clever and interesting, others ludicrous – seems a dereliction of duty.Look at this: ""The mind reels when we realize that, according to this interpretation of quantum mechanics, all possible worlds exist with us. ... these quantum realities exist in the very same room that we live in."" They don't do anything of the sort! They exist in a some-other-where that has no connection with any room in our universe. This is just plain crappy, lazy writing.As Mr. Horse so eloquently put it in ""Ren and Stimpy,"" ""No sir, I don't like it."""
282,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35306337-harikleia,5,"The book “Parallel Worlds” by Michio Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York, is a very good guide for the universe, and perhaps, the multiverse (If the universe is infinite, then there must be a parallel one). It describes everything from the origins and beginning of our universe, to escaping the boundaries of it and what we may find there (if that is possible, and if we can ever manage it).	But this book is not boring like a textbook. It is true that most textbooks have analogies, but this book goes into more depth when it comes to such a thing, as well as making the analogy itself more interesting. Think: what would you find more interesting, accurate, and/or fun to read: if you were to take a fish out of a pond for a few seconds, and have it think that it was in a very different world (which it kind of is, but not in the sense the book is talking about) or if you put an animal in a zoo, instead of it’s natural habitat. Not only is this book informative, but also the method to grasp the reader’s interest is well thought-out. 	The writing style aside, the information presented in the book itself is intriguing. It doesn’t just address scientific fact and near-scientific fact. For example, most science books do not mention time travel as a possibility, because the idea is so absurd, especially with paradoxes (such as the Grandfather Paradox and the Predestination Paradox). And what if you knew that you could teleport to distant places in the universe. It’s just like saying that people can fly without using any apparatus, specifically for the purpose of flight.	As frightening as it may seem, the book also describes the possibilities of the end of the universe as we know it, but not in great detail. Still, most of the possibilities are hard to think of, so here comes the credit for the five stars!"
283,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42753855-ylexia-padilla,5,"Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku explores the many mysteries and theories of higher dimensions, black holes, creation of the universe and quantum theory through the greatest scientific minds as in Einstein, Heisenberg, Guth, Bohr, and Newton. The book explores many paradoxes such as the Cat Problem, where if a cat is sealed in a box with a bottle of poison inside connected to a hammer, which is connected to a Geiger counter placed near a piece of uranium. There is a 50 percent chance that the uranium will decay setting off the Geiger counter, which sets off the hammer breaking the glass bottle of poison killing the cat. “The cat is both dead and alive because the universe has split into two. In one universe, the cat is dead; in another universe, the cat is alive”. Like this, your mind will take a journey through the universe that will surely expose thoughts never thought of before. This book touches on many theories said and tested throughout history and clearly explains content with many analogies. I was surprisingly impressed on how the author, Michio Kaku, presents these meticulous, complex theories in a way that can be articulated by young readers. One of my favorite parts of the book was when Dr. Kaku decided to take a philosophical turn with the quantum controversy by George Berkeley that objects only exist because humans are there to observe them. “If a tree falls in a forest but no one is there to see it, then it does not really fall?” I recommend for all who have a deep curiosity of astronomy, quantum physics, and the mysteries of the universe.

284,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48215814-handarbeni-muhammad-irfan,4,"It took me several months to finish this book, mainly because of the content of this book is quite hard and I got distracted by another books, lol. But I never regret I started to read this book and finally finish it. Mr. Kaku successfully delivered comprehensive explanation about the universe.The book contains the A to Z of our universe. From the formation of the universe, the possibilities of the parallel universes, to some concepts for our civilazation to survive the death of our current universe by moving to the new one. One of the things that I like the most about this book is Mr. Kaku invited us to contemplate our life in our current time on Earth, he wanted us to celebrate our existence and utilize our life for beneficial things that could lead to better life for our descendant.Subjectively, the main down side of this book is some (if not most) of the contents of this book are too intense and complex. With only my highschool level of newtonian physics background and non-existence quantum physics background, sometimes it took good amount of time and several re-read for me to completely understand the concept and the content explained in the book and made it a little bit boring at times. Overall, this is a really good book to learn about our universe and all of things related to it. Thought the content is a little bit hard but it was so exciting to know and learn new things. I'd recommend this book to people who have interest in universe and physics in general."
285,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42862076-hunter,5,"Starting this book I was interested in the wonders this universe had to hold. There are so many things that we have to discover and are being discovered that are revolutionizing what we previously thought. For example, recently in physics we had a set number how the maximum mass something could be, astronomers then found a cluster that proved this theory wrong ultimately boggling the minds of today's brightest minds.In this book they go more in depth into many topics so that the reader understands basic theories proposed by multiple projects. These theories go over many different genres of Astronomy. They include the multiple String theories to even the theory of Schrodinger's cat and the multiple dimensions. This book blows the mind of its readers by filling it to the capacity with things you have never even thought of, although its not really a book but more of a collection of many different theories.This was definitely a fantastic read. Although it follows no direct storyline it goes over all different constructs of the universe. Each seperate catagory which are devided into chapters intrigued me more and more making me want to finish the whole book in the fastest amount of time. I genuinely enjoyed this book and a lot of people say they cannot put the book down and this was definatly one of those. "
286,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26199369-stanley-trice,4,"The author, Michio Kaku, explains the physics of parallel worlds, multiple universes, time travel, and other quantum topics in an easily understandable style that is entertaining and insightful. A few rare spots he delves into the mathematics and in some places he goes too long in the history of a particular theory, but mostly he explores the realms of other places that we cannot currently detect with our senses and instruments.I like Mr. Kaku’s writing style and on TV, during his presentations of science, when he explains in a calming voice such topics as the end of the universe. He reminds me of Carl Sagan and his whimsical explanations about all the things we do not know concerning the universe.The problem with science books is that they can quickly become outdated. This was written in 2006 during the heyday of string theory and the development of M-theory. Whether these continue to become the prevailing winds of the Theory of Everything (TOE) or the Grand Unifying Theory (GUT) has yet to be determined. Yet, the book is still worth a read regardless what happens in quantum physics because what happened to the universe in the past and what will happen in the future will most probably continue to be theory."
287,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35205135-alopexin,3,"I started to read this with a measure of excitement because I like (some of) Marvel and (some) scifi and I'm all about that multiverse. But little by little this book wore down on me and I don't enjoy it at all. Most of the reasoning is so abstract they flew right above my head. To tie in with purely physic and cosmological knowledge there are also questions of ethic and philosophical dimensions (Like, when can you say that something exists??) It just makes me want to tear my hair out. Half way through the book I start to space out a lot and basically I was just persevering to glean out any bit, any trivia that I might understand and remember. The author believes that a person non-initiated in astrophysics can understand this book. I'M SORRY I FAILED YOU, AUTHOR. So Even if I didn't enjoy this book I'm putting three stars on it because I don't want my intellectual limits to penalize this massive, comprehensive work's rating. "
288,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73490-jihad,4,"Most of the book is a general history of physics and cosmology, not unlike many other general science books. What really stood out to me is the discussion towards the end of the book of ideas about parallel universes. I've read other books briefly mention the possibility of parallel universes, but never have I read such a deep discussion about them. There are fascinating ideas of how future advanced civilizations could do things like traveling to a parallel universe, or escape the end of our universe by creating another universe. It just blew my mind.. the realization that while our engineering capabilities are so far behind to realize such potentialities, our scientific minds are advanced enough to consider them in quite some detail."
289,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6128676-peter,5,"After reading this and rating it a few years ago, I find myself still thinking about it's contents and impact on my outlook to this day. I felt I should write down a review that simply stated that this book is really an insightful read to the nature of reality and it should affect your frame of mind in regards to the universe (if you have not much exposure in deep physics concepts). Although, I do have to admit that it is dry and may be extremely difficult to read. I took a long time to read this book. Others I know have found it difficult to read and some have put the book down entirely. But it is enlightening, if you dare delve into this text. Also the last 50 pages are a little sci-fi and zany. Possibly depressing. Enjoy!"
290,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2063636-adam-sprague,3,"Parts of this book I loved, while other parts suffered from a few problems:1. Kaku forgets his readers are, in fact, not physicists. 2. Far too much speculation3. Reads like an Einstein biography at timesIn short, Kaku may not have had enough information for a book, but rolled with it anyway.Don't get me wrong, I learned a lot from reading it, and there were some truly jaw-dropping moments, but the last 100 pages or so of pure speculation with no scientific data to back up any of the claims he made was a bit too much.Still, if you love cosmology, this is something I would still recommend reading."
291,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/655975-andr,5,"Great book! Yes, I loved it. Michio Kaku really does belong to my favorite authors. He covers almost everything about quantum physics, cosmology and all that in his book, including Maths. This book is not only for the layman, but also for the advanced reader. At least in my opinion. 517 pages also takes quite some time to read."
292,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,4," If you are interested in cosmology (like me), then this is the book for you. fascinating and approachable to anyone who knows some basic physics. I like Kaku's random stories of physicists and his style of writing. Parallel Worlds is a science book that reads like a work of literature. Also highly recommend Michio Kaku's Visions and Hyperspace."
293,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3079724-chad-kohalyk,3,"After reading this book, I can finally read and understand the Wikipedia article on string theory.Though I could do without the first bit, and last couple of chapters (and all the unnecessary references to theology), the middle of the book, which gives an easy to grasp explanation of quantum theory, string theory and m-theory, was excellent."
294,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2557898-agnes,5,"After finishing this book I literally hugged it. If you love physic, dont love it but you love to read and you are interested about space, this should be a must read. I am pretty sure after this read you just want to know more and more about it. About space, time travel, parallel worlds, and all that crazy theories in physic you never really understood. You cant get enough of it. Wonderful read."
295,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5891662-max-wilson,3,Just finished this one - good read but very similar to Hyperspace. This book is less fanciful and discusses more Quantum Theory than cosmology.
296,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27561315-mike-alcazaren,4,Excellent book. I love how Dr. Kaku is able to take complex topics and break them into more palatable chunks. A few of the concepts were still over my head. 
297,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942757-rrrrrron,5,This is one of the best and most accessible books on string and m-theory that I have read. Also a good update on the developments in cosmology in the past 5-10 years.
298,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16371687-russell-upol,5,Amazing read... Probably would need to read a few more times just to be fully satisfied... ha ha! A must read for anyone who's interested in the cosmos... and beyond! Mind blowing stuffs :)
299,1400033721,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61782419-whatthegemini,4,He will make difficult confusing concepts seem a little less difficult and a little less confusing. His book and lectures are wondeful. I would highly recommend his books.
