0,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl,5,"ETA: I would just like to add that even though I have the ARC of this book in ebook form, I just paid retail price for the hardback as a Christmas gift for my teenage science nerd kid (shhh, don't tell him). Highly recommended if you or anyone you love enjoys non-fiction pop science books!Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature (along with my co-reviewer Bill's 5 star review):So much fun! Caesar’s Last Breath is certainly the most enjoyable, informative and accessible popular science book I’ve read, and is gunning for the title of my favorite non-fiction book ever. Sam Kean takes the general topic of gases, shakes it around, and turns it upside down and inside out, examining it from multiple different angles ― some of them quite unexpected. The development of our earth’s atmosphere from the days our earth was formed, volcanoes, explosives from gunpowder to nuclear bombs, a farting genius, the vital role of ammonia in fertilizer (which development led to the use of chlorine in gas warfare), and many more gaseous topics are explored in this delightful book.Kean has a vivid and engaging style of writing, with a wry sense of humor, which elevates Caesar’s Last Breath far above most pop science books. Gas molecules are described as feral, oxygen as a madman, our moon as an albatross (as compared to the gnats that circle most other mooned planets), and gravity as “that eternal meddler” that won’t abide two planets in the same neighborhood. I learned about the Big Thwack (when a hypothetical planet called Theia smashed into our earth, vaporizing itself and eventually reforming into our moon), the Oxygen Catastrophe of 2,000,000,000 BC, and the mushroom cloud-shaped cakes baked during the heady days of the late 1940s when nuclear blasts didn’t really seem all that dangerous.Almost every topic Kean tackles is also given a human element. Some particularly memorable ones: Harry Randall Truman, the gutsy old coot who wouldn’t leave Mount Saint Helens, is juxtaposed with David Johnston, a geologist who volunteered for extra shifts in the closest observation towers on Saint Helens, believing that as a fit young marathon runner he had a better chance of escaping when the foreseeable eruption came than his older co-workers (he didn’t). The victims of Vesuvius who had the tops of their heads blown off like a mini-volcano eruption ― when your brain boils, the vapors need to escape somewhere! Louis Slotin, the nuclear scientist who had the eventually fatal habit of balancing a beryllium shell over a plutonium sphere and using an ordinary screwdriver to jiggle the sphere up and down, yo-yoing toward a nuclear chain reaction. Slotin rolled his eyes when Enrico Fermi warned him that he’d be dead within a year if he didn’t cut it out.While I didn’t reach the stratospheric levels of Bill’s highlighting, I did highlight 56 different passages in Caesar’s Last Breath (I counted), far above my normal level. I also spent several minutes telling my teenage children about some of the particularly interesting facts and stories in this book, pinning them down at breakfast where they couldn’t escape me. Not that they wanted to! Caesar’s Last Breath would be an excellent gift for readers of all ages, even those who aren’t particularly science-minded. I’m already planning it as one of my 15 year old son’s Christmas gifts.By the way, if Julius Caesar expelled one liter of air with his final breath, that breath contained approximately 25 sextillion molecules of air. Even though that’s a miniscule percentage of the air in our atmosphere, chances are that at least one molecule of Caesar’s last breath is in the very next breath you take.I received a free copy of this ebook from the publisher through NetGalley for review. Thank you!!"
1,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20955173-sean-gibson,5,"In ninja-like fashion and with deadly and merciless scientific roundhouses, Sam Kean has become one of my favorite non-fiction writers, which means two things: 1) I’m going to gush about his latest offering; and 2) the other writers in that group should be wary (so watch your back, Joseph Ellis; maybe start sleeping with the lights on). As with Kean’s previous books, Caesar’s Last Breath is a marvelous balancing act that mixes copious quantities of science with wit and humor without being boring (like a bad high school teacher) or cheesy* (like a bad high school teacher).(*Okay, so, Kean’s humor can occasionally veer into cheddar territory, but it’s done knowingly and purposefully with a wink and a nod; it’s like dad jokes on steroids. Or maybe just helium.)In taking readers on a tour of the gaseous portion of the periodic table by way of the air we breathe, Kean simultaneously illuminates and entertains, whether he’s recounting the horrible history of the development of nuclear weapons or giving some air time to the exploits of Le Petomane (I refer, of course, not to Mel Brooks’ hapless governor in Blazing Saddles, but, rather, the famous French flatulist who was, surprisingly, not so flagrantly fragrant). It’s compulsively readable, bite-sized science that offers not just amusing anecdotes, but genuine insight into the natural (and unnatural) world around us. If Kean could be cloned and teach science to every kid across the U.S., I’d wager my weight in radon that our performance on the international science stage would improve exponentially. I’ve enjoyed all of Kean’s work, but this is my favorite thus far. I’d say it’s a breath of fresh air, but, well…turns out the air’s not so fresh (unless maybe Caesar died while munching on some Tic Tacs). Regardless, add it to your reading list posthaste. (On an unrelated, but sort of semi-related note: there used to be a bar near my office in Washington, DC, called Science Club. It was a dark, quirky place adorned with scientific paraphernalia, and I always thought it would be the perfect setting for a sitcom about science-inclined wizards, sort of a Big Bang Theory meets Cheers kind of thing. I’ve always found the line between magic and science to be a very blurry one; I mean, what’s magic but something that we haven’t figured out the governing laws and principles behind, right? Imagine a snarky and recalcitrant but highly intelligent group of wizards and scientists who trade barbs and puzzle out the mysteries of the universe, all while drinking heavily and navigating a series of wacky subplots, at least one of which will involve a race to get to the battle of the bands on time. My new mission in life is to get Sam Kean to co-write a pilot with me. I see it as a 50/50 partnership: he brings wit, intellect, and scientific acumen to the project. I bring a laptop that has Microsoft Word 2010 on it and a pretty adequate supply of gum. It might not beat Doctor, Doctor, but it’d give it a run for its money. Let’s do this, Kean.)"
2,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Kean in his typical lighthearted style explores air. He discusses the earth’s early atmosphere ending with his thoughts on its future. In between he offers a collection of vignettes about the scientists and engineers who studied and manipulated all sorts of gases. We get the scientific concepts with entertaining stories making this an easy read. Kean starts describing the formation of the earth’s atmosphere, much of it coming from volcanoes. He sidetracks to the story of the Mount Saint Helen’s eruption in 1980 and the story of an old codger named Harry Truman (not the president). Living three miles from the cone he refused to leave and his body quickly converted to its gaseous state when he was vaporized by the eruption. The energy of the eruption equaled 27,000 Hiroshima bombs - a reminder of the power that formed not only the atmosphere but the continents.Kean then recounts the history of Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch who pioneered a way to turn air into fertilizer, more specifically freeing its nitrogen and producing ammonia. Today this technology is essential to support a population of 7.5 billion. Turning to the dark side Haber went on to develop and deploy poison gas in WWI. Despite this he won a Nobel Prize as did Bosch. Neither man could stand Hitler. Their disdain led to sad ends, Haber losing everything when he left Germany and Bosch, pushed out of his job, became a hopeless drunk. Two other stories with sad endings were those of Joseph Priestley and Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier. Priestley isolated oxygen in 1774 but didn’t understand it was a new element. Realizing Priestley was on to something, Lavoisier documented many of its unique characteristics and gave oxygen its name. Both are credited with its discovery and of course neither could accept the other getting credit launching a typical scientific feud. But they had worse problems. Back home in Birmingham, locals saw Priestley as very strange. An angry mob torched and ransacked his home in what was known as Priestley’s Riot. With nothing left in England he moved to the US. Lavoisier who had hobnobbed with the elites in Louis XVI’s France was executed by the guillotine in the French Revolution. A scientist to the end he wondered how long his head would be conscious. He reportedly asked an assistant to count the number of times he blinked as his head rolled off the blade. We don’t know the results.On a more pleasant note Kean turns to Thomas Beddoes and Humphrey Davy who experimented on themselves with every gas they could conjure up. Eureka, came the discovery of the effects of nitrous oxide, laughing gas, of which Davy became very fond. In 1799 he opened a clinic where at night he would share his discovery with his friends like poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey. According to Kean the scene at night resembled an “opium den.” Davy noted that nitrous oxide would be useful as an anesthetic, for which there was a great need, but he never followed through on that idea. Keen then tells the stories of the first uses in the 1840’s of nitrous oxide, ether and chloroform as anesthetics. Nitrous oxide would find a place in dentistry, ether in surgery and chloroform in giving birth. In 1853 Queen Victoria gave birth using chloroform. Of course, Kean can’t be serious too long so he segues to the story of Le Pentomane, the Fartomaniac. He was the star of the Moulin Rouge starting in 1892, soon becoming the highest paid entertainer in France, making twice per show what Sarah Bernhardt was making. After a few years he left the Moulin Rouge and performed at his own club until 1914. His act all came from his rear end, playing tunes, impersonations, and even smoking cigarettes. Doesn’t sound like a class act, but he hobnobbed with Matisse and Renoir. Ravel was a huge fan and Freud had his picture on his wall.Perhaps the most important gas of the industrial revolution was steam. Kean takes us through the development of the steam engine and the story of inventor James Watt. He sold his first steam engine in 1775 forever changing society. His steam engine allowed factories to leave rural areas alongside streams and move to their markets in cities speeding urbanization. Kean moves on to Alfred Nobel and his efforts to tame volatile nitroglycerin culminating in 1867 in the invention of dynamite. Explosives work by chemical reactions quickly releasing lots of gas molecules. Getting such powerful chemical reactions to work only when intended was a difficult problem and Nobel marketed many dangerous products before dynamite. But success for inventors can be problematic. Both Nobel and Watt wasted their later years fighting court battles over their many patents and impeding the progress of others. Despite dynamites many peaceful uses, many people despised Nobel for making wars more deadly. To right this wrong he established a huge prize fund with his wealth dismaying his heirs.The production of low cost steel made possible the era of skyscrapers and magnificent suspension bridges. So we learn about Henry Bessemer who in the 1860s developed his eponymous process which relied on the precise infusion of air. We end the period with Lord Rayleigh and William Ramsey who discovered the noble gases, largely inert gases such as argon, adding a whole new column to the periodic table. Both men won Nobel Prizes. Rayleigh also answered a fundamental question. Why is the sky blue? He realized gas molecules of oxygen, nitrogen and argon were the perfect size to scatter the sun’s incoming light sending more of blue’s shorter wavelengths our way.Turning to more recent times, Kean reviews gaseous aspects of the Manhattan project and atomic explosions including fallout. Initially the government played down the dangers of fallout. But eventually the public became concerned. I remember being with my father looking at home fallout shelters being prominently offered for sale. I can also remember drills in grade school in which we got under our desks in case we were bombed. My friends and I knew our little desks would not protect us against atomic bombs. My school was just outside Washington, D.C., not a place known for clear thinking. Next Kean looks at twentieth century efforts to change the weather. Seeding clouds became a popular idea. The US government got involved in 1947 with project Cirrus. The goal was to end droughts and stop hurricanes but, other purposes came to the fore. After defoliating Viet Nam didn’t get results, the US began seeding to make the VC slip and slide on the Ho Chi Minh trail. It was called project Popeye, the motto, “make mud not war”. By the 1970’s, none of its goals coming to fruition, the government realized seeding didn’t work very well and it stopped. But if you couldn’t control the weather, could you at least predict it? It took the computer age to come close and a new idea emerged – chaos theory. A change in a minute detail could change results significantly. Recognizing this, a weather scientist, Edward Lorenz gave us a popular idiom when he wrote a paper in 1972 entitled “Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly’s Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?”Lastly Kean looks at our future, not just here on earth but on other planets as well. On earth our future does not look good. Given what he’s seen of the human propensity to procrastinate until the last minute, Kean does not believe we will restrict carbon output enough to prevent dramatic climate change. He even offers up the possibility of a positive feedback loop leading to a runaway greenhouse effect that we and even cockroaches couldn’t survive. So he looks at the prospect of engineering our way out. Shooting silver iodide into the atmosphere might work and the sky might not be so blue but we’d have awesome red sunsets. Or sprinkling iron all over the ocean to grow more oxygen producing phytoplankton. If that doesn’t work out there is terraforming other planets or the moon, but that looks like more work than people in a hurry could handle. Lastly we could build a gigantic spaceship and search for a new home around another star. I’ll weigh in and say if we can’t do any of the former, I wouldn’t hold my breath for that. Despite the gloomy end, this is a fun book and it contains a lot of real science which I skipped over in this review. For those of us that read a lot of popular science books, there isn’t much new, but it is still entertaining. The pages turn fast. For those who are interested in science but not fond of science books, this could be a good bet. Even if you skip over the scientific explanations you can enjoy this book."
3,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos,4,"I want to thank the publisher for providing a copy of this book for me to review, this book is a study of oxygen, what is composed of , what it is it's structure and how the study of it had affected our society, all along the book the author provides historical notes to provide a relief to all the science behind the book , and these are very welcome . It is amazing to know how much it is to know about this gas (oxygen) that we usually take for granted but without which we would not exist , life as we know it could not have developed...even though there was a time in which oxygen was the most dangerous thing to life on Earth. If you like science that is relevant to our times presented in a fun format, then this is the book for you. "
4,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,4,"That's the goal of Caesar's Last Breath—to make these invisible stories of gases visible, so you can see them as clearly as you can see your breath on a crisp November morning. At various points in the book we'll swim with radioactive pigs in the ocean and hunt insects the size of dachshunds. We'll watch Albert Einstein struggle to invent a better refrigerator, and we'll ride shotgun with pilots unleashing top-secret ""weather warfare"" on Vietnam. We'll march with angry mobs, and be buried inside an avalanche of vapors so hot that people's brains boiled inside their skulls. All of these tales pivot on the surprising behavior of gases, gases from lava pits and the guts of microbes, from test tubes and car engines, from every corner of the periodic table. We still breathe most of them today, and each chapter in this book picks one of them as a lens to examine the sometimes tragic, sometimes farcical role that gases played in the human saga.What I wouldn't give to write like Sam Kean. He informs as he entertains, and vice versa. In his hands, material as dry and stultifying as a high school Chemistry textbook becomes a narrative - and one that is clever, amusing, and energetic. This is his most recent title to date, and he has really improved on the already high-quality work he published before. Caesar's Last Breath leaps and bounds through what would seem a very limited topic but towards the end begins to grind with some of the wearying repetition and noncohesive threads that I found distracting in his earlier books.4 stars out of 5, and very close to 4.5. It really is wonderful and Kean really is a great writer, but I would have liked it cut down by about 25 pages or so. I started skimming in the final sections, particularly the chapter about fallout which is presented in a way that makes it seem only tangentially related to gas laws."
5,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,5,"I received a free copy of Caesar's Last Breath for review, which I confess does make me a little positively biased , BUT Kean's non-fiction piece is really good. I'm not sure how he does it but Kean somehow takes an extremely broad topic: ""the air"" and structures the book in a way that makes sense. Balancing historic anecdotes, not just about scientists (for example Caesar), with science lessons the book was fun to digest even though their was a lot to absorb.One thing I will say however is this piece is not for the faint of existential hearts! If you're like me and don't necessarily like thinking too hard about things like how thin our atmosphere really is, how much radiation there blasting through the world, how toxic oxygen is and so forth, this book is probably going to induce some anxiety.On the political side there are some must read sections about the use and misuse of science (particularly around war) which provide some cautionary tales which I hope people will acknowledge (i.e. let's not destroy our own planet people!).All up I'm pretty happy I read Caesar's Last Breath despite the existential terror and frustration at some of the human race's folly. Highly recommended. "
6,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,2,"Given that the two Sam Kean books I've read where I'm fairly well-acquainted with the subject have come off to me as popular science drivel (this one and 
The Disappearing Spoon
), I might have to retroactively lower my assessments of his other books (if I don't want to fall prey to the Murray Gell-Mann amnesia effect). To be fair, I don't remember anything that was actively wrong in this book, just a lot of bluster and puffing.One thing I really don't like is Kean's attempt to ""have his cake and eat it too"" with regards to apocryphal stories. He seems unwilling to repeat an apocryphal story as fact, but he has no compunctions about saying, ""Although this is almost uncertainly not true, here's some story that makes whatever point I'm trying to make that has been in the popular narrative."" He does this more than once, and it's disingenuous - what's the point of the story? It's a made up story so it doesn't actually make the point, it's more of a ""wouldn't it be fun if this were true?"" But the answer to that is, ""Yes, but it's not, so stop saying it."""
7,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"Coming at you today with some atmospheric chemistry - all about the gases we're breathing right this very moment. All sextillion of those molecules of oxygen, nitrogen, ammonia, etc etc... And yeah, maybe even some of the same ones as Julius Caesar's last breaths, as the title of this book implies.""Air is the single most important thing in your environment right now. You can survive without food, without solids, for weeks. You can survive without water, without liquids, for days, without air, without gases, you'd last a few minutes at most.""It's rewarding to find those popular science books that balance facts, humor, and accessibility. Kean did it with this one. He's written several other popsci books, most notably the bestselling 'The Disappearing Spoon' (which I haven't read but have seen several times - have you read it?), and seems to strike that balance well. He's got an engaging and light style - often bordering 'cheesy' or 'punny' - but still entertaining and educational. He traces the history of discovery about the invisible gases that form our #atmosphere, that enter and exit our bodies, that build up in the earth, that form vacuums, that are used in warfare, agriculture, flight, that form our weather and the science of meterology... He covers all the gaseous ground here!He ends the books with a chapter speculating on exoplanet exploration and how humans of the future will breathe and adapt in those environments.If only my high school chemistry classes had been this fun! Accessible reading level/interest for older teens, and of course us curious adults who may not remember all the lectures on the periodic table 🤔"
8,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,5,"When I picked up Sam Kean's new book on air, I knew I was going to learn about the molecular structure of air and the permanence of these molecules in the history of our planet. What I didn't expect was a thorough study of everything that can possibly relate to the element. I learned about weather-making, atomic bomb testing, first balloon flights, radioactivity of bananas, Roswell incident, life on other planets, and much more. I'm a complete nerd for trivia, and now I'm just bursting to unleash all I absorbed from this book onto unsuspecting public. Good stuff!"
9,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20069595-glen,5,"I won this book in a goodreads drawing.A wonderful book recounting the science surrounding the air around us, and how many of the gases and their properties were discovered, often by accident. Very entertaining stuff, and very educational at the same time.Highly recommended."
10,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"Meditation practice often begins with focus on breathing, and in that sense there is no deeper meditation than ""Caesar's Last Breath"" to inspire mindfulness of the air within you (and around you). With this treatise on gasses, Sam Kean has solidified himself as one of my favorite authors. He shares stories of fact and discovery with a pervasive sense of humor and humanity, a brilliant penchant for the ""callback"" that connects and reinforces disparate concepts, a keen sense of which details are important and interesting, and the amazing ability to anticipate questions as I have them. This is science writing at its best.You'll learn what the air is made of, how much you breathe of each component in a single breath, how it got there in the first place, where else it has traveled, who discovered it and who almost discovered it, and what they were intending to find - which was typically something else. You'll learn the power of gasses to manufacture, to obliterate, to entertain and depress, with fascinating looks along the way at volcanoes, explosives, nuclear warfare, human combustion, combustion engines, farts, anesthesia, weather control, refrigeration, hot air balloons, alien visitation, space exploration, and the many fascinating personalities throughout history who have changed the way we live by increasing our understanding of gasses. The subject is explored from every angle, and the result is an immensely engaging and satisfying read."
11,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"Like Sam Kean's previous books, this one is a fascinating look at chemistry. Its emphasis is on gaseous elements, but not exclusively. This is not a comprehensive treatise--it is what I would call ""pop-chemistry"" (as analogous to pop-psychology). Sam Kean writes in a popular, friendly style that borders on cutesy. Here are a few quotes as an example:""boiled our frickin' oceans"" ""To say that geologists didn't embrace Wegener's theory is a bit like saying that General Sherman didn't receive the warmest welcome in Atlanta. ""Heck, mucking around down there might even backfire and trigger another outburst.""This type of language simply sounds ingratiating to me, and really irritates me. However, I can look beyond this silliness, and find a lot to like in this book.For example, there is an interesting story about how Carl Scheele and Joseph Priestley discovered oxygen, but it wasn't truly understood until Lavoisier investigated its significance, its role in chemistry, and gave the element its name. There is a retelling of a fascinating myth about Lavoisier's final science experiment as he was about to be beheaded at the guillotine. This is then followed by another fascinating story, this one about the ""Priestley riot"", the only riot named after a scientist! The riot took place in Birmingham, in the aftermath of his writing ""History of the Corruptions of Christianity"" and also because of his cheering of the French Revolution. His house and neighboring houses were burned down in the riot.During the 19th century, it was believed that spontaneous combustion could occur. And this is recounted in stories by Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Herman Melville, and Washington Irving.There is a fascinating story about William Morton, a con-man who was only interested in making a quick buck. He re-discovered that ether would be useful as an anesthetic during surgery. He arranged to use the ""mystery gas"" in a surgery by Dr. John Warren at Mass General Hospital. Everybody who got to know William Morton lived to regret it. However, his efforts to popularize the anesthetic did more ""to benefit humankind that almost anyone who ever lived.""The gases that make up the atmosphere are emphasized in this book. And, as in many other science books these days, there is a considerable amount of discussion about climate change. This is a very accessible book, full of interesting stories and anecdotes. You might think that Sam Kean chose topics carefully, in order to pack in the most interesting, and sometimes hilarious stories. You would be right."
12,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Received to review via Netgalley; publication date 18th JulySam Kean is an entertaining pop science writer in general, and though this isn’t as perfectly up my street as The Tale of the Duelling Neurosurgeons, it’s still fascinating and very readable. It starts by reminding us that we’re breathing the same air as everyone who has ever lived — including Caesar, hence the title — and that there’s a high chance we’re breathing in some of the same molecules that bounced around their lungs. Then it goes on to talking about the foundation of Earth’s atmosphere, the power of gases and the road humans took to discovering that, and finishes with a look at how life affects its environment — of course, the changes in the composition of our atmosphere that we cause, but also how we might spot other species on other planets doing the same.As you can see, that’s a lot of ground to cover, and Kean manages to string everything together into a pretty logical narrative. The longer chapters are leavened by interludes covering events that illustrate some part of what’s under discussion, like using hot gases to cut into a bank vault…Overall, entertaining and interesting, especially given that Earth sciences and the study of our atmosphere has never been a great interest of mine.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
13,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt,4,"You can capture the entire history of the world in a single breath.Accessible writing with some dry humor and a bit of snarkiness thrown in from time to time. Broken down into three basic parts-the first atmospheres, how our early atmosphere was formed.-human discoveries of the workings of the atmosphere and various gasses.-effects human inventions/discoveries had on the atmosphere.Overall an enjoyable book and I'll leave you with this thought from the author on climate change,But as much as I believe in the law of unintended consequences, I believe even more strongly in the consistency of human nature over time. And given that laziness and shortsightedness have dominated our behavior in the past, I don't see why they won't dominate our behavior in the future as well.In contrast, coming up with a technological fix for the problem, while not easy, exploits what humans do well-rally around a cause when things get desperate, then start building shit.8/10"
14,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7769236-sue,2,"Random, hodge-podge theory: the epitome of ""all over the page"". This is one of those books I wish I could UN-read. We don't all breathe the same air as our ancient ancestors--including Caesar. We'd have to live in a dome and Earth isn't that kind of place."
15,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6011718-ryan-morrow,5,"I’ve read Sam Kean’s entire bibliography to date (that I’m aware of) and I must say I enjoyed this contribution most of all. In addition to each chapter being a fantastic dive into a particular topic on gas(es), the book in its entirely has a captivating ability to disperse itself together as a whole. Highly recommend for the curious and introspective mind."
16,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53295152-mady,4,"A good book, definitely. But I’m tired of his religious cynicism that thinks spiritual folk can’t make sense the things science discovers (like we’re trapped believing in an old-timey fairy tale and can’t use critical thinking). He also doesn’t apply the same deep thought to the religious ideas he so glibly discredits. "
17,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"This book was a pretty interesting read. I was a little suspicious that I would find the subject too dry, but a couple of things prevented this. One is that Kean really writes this book from a human interest perspective. Each story is enriched with details about the lives and motivations of the people involved, often told in a humorous way. The other is that the subject matter is approached in a pretty broad way. The book isn’t a list of anecdotes about the discovery of various gasses through history. It’s more about how gasses have shaped the world. Also, Kean has a knack for approaching topics from the right perspective to keep the reader’s attention. For example, to talk about the way the atmosphere of the earth has changed over time, he starts with a story (full of extraneous but interesting details about the kooky characters involved) of a time when the atmosphere changed very dramatically and suddenly (the eruption of Mount St. Helens) and how it affected life in the surrounding area. Additionally, for the stories that focus on a scientific discovery, he really emphasizes the process, making the reader really understand why the scientists involved thought what they did, or took the next step that they did. The tone is also very conversational. I read in some published book reviews that some readers found it too conversational saying it “sounded too unscientific and undercut his otherwise authoritative voice.” I think that’s a weird criticism. Who cares if it sounds “unscientific” given our cultural associations with words like “fart”? The book is written in a logical format and does not extrapolate beyond known empirical data. It also happens to use words like fart. I liked the tone. I also saw the criticism that the book was too scattered. I agree the tangents abound. Personally, I really don’t have a problem with that in non-fiction books that are a broad survey of a topic. I do think it detracts from a book that has a specific thesis and a point to make. But just as I wouldn’t fault a friend for not sticking strictly to a linear narrative over a fun lunch date, I don’t fault Kean for it in this book. But also like a fun lunch date, I’m glad I had this conversation with Kean, but I don’t really need to record it to go back to, or make all my friends also have this conversation. It was enjoyable, but it didn’t change my life, hence the three stars. Like many science books written in the last few years, Kean also uses the opportunity to remind us that climate change is upon us, that we’re all connected and part of a common ecosystem etc. He also interestingly speculates about the future of human life off-planet. Nice way to wrap up the book."
18,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,4,"Good, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I have his previous books. Maybe those other topics – the elements, genetics, the human brain – are just more interesting to me than “gases.” “Air” is just such an … amorphous topic, and the organization here felt very random. As always, Kean tells the stories related to each gas in a lively, humorous way, and he skillfully connects the scientific ideas he's relating with historical incidents that illustrate their relevance. Air might not look like much, but it's powerful stuff. 3 ½ stars, rounded up to 4."
19,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392101-scarlett-sims,4,"Sam Kean does it again! In his typical conversational style, he makes science accessible and fun for the lay person, using odd occurrences from history to explain the gases that make up our atmosphere (and a few others). I really love his writing style because it is so much like how a person would talk and so non-technical. In some ways, I guess I like it because it's kind of how I would write? He takes a very human-interest sort of perspective, telling the stories of people who discovered elements and crazy things that happened to them. I really liked the two previous books I'd read by Kean and this one didn't disappoint me.I received this free from Goodreads giveaways."

21,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3796657-cj-zawacki,5,"So we talk in it, see in it, we walk in it: and even bring it into our bodies. Sam Kean has written CAEAR'S LAST BREATH to explain what is in the air we breath in our lives. I could say this is a nerd's book on science, however, I found the story of what we are breathing to be extremely enjoyable with lots of side comments. Kean takes us on an adventure into the discovery of all the gases we inhale and the history of their discovery. Each chapter has insights from the beginning of Earth to the Stars of the Universe. Great reading for inquisitive minds, well explained for the common readers.An enjoyable read about a necessity life function we cannot live without. Just try holding your breath on this book's knowledge."
22,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12000072-steve,5,"Great look at the atmosphere This is the third book of Sam Kean’s that I’ve read; the other two were “The Violinist's Thumb” and “The Disappearing Spoon”. I loved the latter two, so I had high expectations for “Caesar’s Last Breath”. I was not disappointed. Once again Kean does some great storytelling, this time about the atmosphere. There is some science involved since it is necessary to understand the behavior of gases in order to understand the atmosphere. Kean explains the science very simply, clearly, and painlessly. He then delves into a discussion of the atmosphere. Although I was already familiar with some of the material that Kean discusses, Kean’s magnificent storytelling made it seem all new. Even the footnotes are great. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who likes science.Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of this book via Netgalley for review purposes."
23,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22409011-brendan-monroe,2,"I wish I had a better reason for not liking this book. Believe me, I'm trying to think of one ... too many numbers? Should have read it in print rather than listened to the audio? I don't think either of those excuses really cuts it. So, to paraphrase the great George Costanza — or was it Jerry who first used this as an excuse? — it's not you, Sam Kean, it's me! Truth be told, I guess I just don't care enough about air. I mean, sure, a few facts and I'm all ears, but an entire book on the subject? No thanks.I know what you're thinking. ""The balls on this guy! To give a book a bad review because he didn't care about the subject! Why the hell would anyone read a book about something they weren't even interested in?""I hear you! And my answer is ... I don't know. I thought it would be interesting. I mean, the blurb made it sound interesting enough. But really, when it came down to it, I don't really give a damn whether some of the air molecules I just inhaled were previously floating around the lungs of Julius Caesar. Who would? (and anyway, how could they be the same? I still didn't quite get this part ... don't our air molecules just float around, until they eventually just dissolve up into the atmosphere?)Ok, apparently a lot of people give a damn. Have you ever been to Graceland? Or to any Hard Rock Cafe? People go apeshit over a pair of tattered leather pants if those tattered leather pants were once worn by Mick Jagger. Our celebrity-obsessed society is full of people who believe that the closer they are in proximity to the rich and the famous — or their air molecules — the better their prospects of becoming rich and famous.All that to say, I'm sure Sam Kean's book was chock-a-block full of fascinating info, but I found that I'd barely be onto a new chapter before being unable to recall all the information laid out in the previous chapter (perhaps I should have taken notes?).So to all who loved this book, more power to you. As for me, I better stick to reading about topics that interest me."
24,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,3,"I know this rating is not fair. This should have been the ideal book for me and in reality, should have been a 4-star book, but was one of the rare instances in which I had to take it down one because it was an audiobook. Don’t get me wrong, it has nothing to do with Ben Sullivan’s outstanding 5-star narration. In fact, I’m heading to Audible to look for others he has narrated it was that good. It was fantastically filled with numbers and stats that I love. The problem was there was just too much for me to capture and share here. If only I had read it in print, I could have better “Did you know?” type statistics to share with you. Those who read my reviews know I generally try to weave in interesting tidbits and learnings and I’m so disappointed that I am unable to do so now.This is another one of those books I refer to as a “biography of things”. The book outlines the history of our air and how it has evolved, it details the different gases that comprise our atmosphere and explains why it is likely you are inhaling roughly one particle of Caesar’s last breath every time you breathe.It’s all such good stuff for if you’re into data. I just wish I had time to document more of it while listening, but doing so when behind the wheel, makes it rough. All in all, a 5-star recommend if you can read it in print, 4-stars if you have time to digest it and take notes while listening, or 3-stars like me, for audio but no time to capture the information you’ll wish you did later. "
25,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27678334-eric,4,"This is the second time in recent memory that I have been reminded that some of the molecules of the air I breathe today could have been exhaled by Caesar as he breathed his last in 44 BC. That said, the title has a nice catchy ring for being thus phrased, but this seems more to be a tour of the periodic table with special attention paid to the gases contained thereon. He describes the truly gruesome final moment of the life of Harry Truman, the man who stayed on Mt Saint Helen against the advice of authorities as his body was likely vaporized - the science here is rather stunning. Included is the peculiar story of the pig that survived the bomb test at Bikini atoll, and a rather decent explanation of how the Air Force became involved in covering up UFO stories related to assessing Russian atomic testing. All done in a pretty clear manner understandable by even non-scientists."
26,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54953761-tamara-cassinat,4,"4.5 stars.I loved this - mostly. My favorite parts about Sam Keans novels are learning the history of chemistry and how things we discovered and researched. I find that fascinating. Plus, knowing the history of some chemicals and early research actually helps to deepen my understanding of chemistry in general. I loved the first two parts of this book because they covered the history of gas and how gas shaped our Earth. The discovery of Nobel gases, steam engines, laughing gas, TNT, and up to the atomic bombs. I also enjoyed a refresher on the basic chemical principles of gases and I learned a lot about meteorology which I had known little about before. My least favorite part of the book was the third section. The section about current and future gas science. I just had a hard time paying attention to it. It wasn't as captivating as the rest of the book. It's hard to end a good book on something that's less interesting. Anyway, still liked the book a lot. The author put in a lot of humor and explains things very well."
27,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67609021-maciej-kuczy-ski,5,"""Pumbaa, with you – everything's gas."" – Timon, ""The Lion King"" (1994)Sam Kean sure likes gases! And for a good reason – they're powerful and probably more significant than most of us realise. The author takes the reader for a journey through Earth's history, showing how certain gases – though seemingly miniscule – shaped our planet and our lives. The stories and facts introduced in the book are really entertaining and informative. My only gripe is that the author uses imperial units (feet, yards, pounds, etc.) instead of the metric system."
28,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4337911-renee,4,"I was so excited when I received an ARC of this book from Netgalley and Little, Brown & Company. I'm always looking for good books that I can share with my High School science students, but it's rare to find a chemistry related book that fits the bill -- Especially one as entertaining and engaging as this one. This examines how the gasses around us, often unnoticed, have shaped the world around us and been shaped by us. Kean uses historical events, discoveries, and anecdotes to illustrate how the gasses of Earth have changed throughout history: he infuses these stories with humor, and human interest -- focusing on the people making or affected by the discoveries. One of my favorite parts was about the discovery and naming of the Noble Gasses, I knew they were discovered well after many other gasses, but I didn't really know how. I highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks it sounds remotely interesting, Kean is sure to keep you engaged! I can't wait to share it with my students this year!"
29,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,3,"Disclaimer: I was sent a review copy in exchange for a fair review.I probably got the review copy because I loved an earlier Sam Kean book, The Violinist's Thumb. In that book, Kean did a deep dive (for laymen) into our genetic code, with each chapter organized around an amusing story that tied into the theme of that chapter. It was deeply researched, very entertaining, and quite informative.Here, he tries the same formula...only it never quite gels. So this one is about gases. Just that--gases in general. There's sort of a vague progression of ""beginning of the Earth"" gases through ""the order in which we discovered stuff"" gases to ""what we might find one day on other planets"" gases. But while the genetic code is a topic that you can go incredibly deep on but has some fairly well defined boundaries, gases are...well, by nature, they're amorphous and don't much like being contained. So this is chock full of insights, but they're really barely connected to each other. There's no actual story here.And the amusing anecdotes accelerate this problem instead of corralling it. They're really, really random. And he goes far, far deeper into them than actually necessary. (For example, we get multiple pages of learning the life history of a guy who got blown up by Mount Saint Helens. Because...gases were involved in the explosion. Or something. It's entertaining! But really doesn't actually have much more to do with gases than say, my own life history. Because I've played with helium balloons! Or something.)So. It's deeply researched. (Maybe too deeply, more deeply than is justified.) Very entertaining. (Really! Kean's writing style is delightful! Accessible and funny, and great at putting complex concepts into laymen's terms.) Quite informative. (Did you know the French Revolution can be blamed on a volcano in Iceland?) But it's less a book and more a multi-hour binge on Wikipedia, where you keeping clicking the most interesting link on the page and learning more and more fascinating stuff, none of which has anything to do with each other, and end the evening feeling stuffed full of random knowledge which might be fun to pull out at parties some day, and maybe a little headache-y. (Or maybe that's just me?)"
30,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/390242-mark,3," I received an Advanced Reader Copy from a Goodreads giveaway and the book is full of interesting scientific stories and tidbits, related to the air we breathe and the atmosphere around us. My only complaint about the book is that it seems a bit unfocused. The topics are all over the place and only slightly cohere around a theme. This doesn't stop the book from being interesting. It simply makes the topics seem random."
31,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Ever heard of dichlorodifluoromethane? (That's CCl2F2 to you chemistry students.) Well, guess what? You inhale seven trillion molecules of the stuff every time you breathe. Yes, it's in the air we breathe. That's just one of the lesser revelations in Sam Kean's eye-opening and thoroughly enjoyable new survey, Caesar's Last Breath: Decoding the Secrets of the Air Around Us. As the title will suggest to the careful reader, the central conceit in Kean's book is that ""roughly one particle of [the last breath Julius Caesar took after he was stabbed] will appear in your next breath."" Apparently, this ""how-many-molecules-in-X's-last-breath exercise has become a classic thought experiment in physics and chemistry courses."" Not in mine, though. I don't remember much about those courses, but I'm sure I would've remembered that.In Caesar's Last Breath, Kean will take you on a fast ride through the 4.5-billion-year history of Earth's atmosphere and then through the more than one hundred different gases that comprise the atmosphere today. Yes, more than one hundred. Individual chapters—and ""interludes"" placed between them—tell tales about each of the major substances. Everybody knows about nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. But there's also carbon monoxide (CO), nitrous oxide (N2O, known as laughing gas), methanethiol (CH3SH), and all manner of others. However, this is no mind-numbing laundry list of unfamiliar substances. Kean uses each one as a lever into the history of atmospheric science. And along the way he strays—delightfully—into topics that may be only tangentially related to the air we breathe.In fact, Caesar's Last Breath is as much about the scientists, famous and not, whose discoveries over the centuries have helped us understand the nature and the effects of each of the major gases in our atmosphere. If you're at all familiar with the history of science, you'll recognize the names Fritz Haber, Joseph Priestley, Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, Robert Boyle, Henry Cavendish, Humphry Davy, and so many others who have made the world around us easier to understand. Don't think for a minute, though, that Kean simply offers up the usual dry recitation of each scientist's discovery and how he made it. No. Instead, the author tells us things we never knew, or at least things that I never knew, about these fascinating people.For example, Henry Cavendish, the man who discovered hydrogen, was autistic and ""communicated with his domestic staff via notes."" He was also filthy rich. ""During his lifetime, Cavendish had more money in the Bank of England than any other British subject."" Joseph Priestley, the co-discoverer of oxygen, was a Protestant minister whose investigations prompted a mob in Birmingham to burn down his church and his home, hoping (without success) to see him burn inside it. Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, who tried to take sole credit for the discovery of oxygen, was an aristocrat who went to his death on the guillotine in the French Revolution. Lavoisier had been a rapacious tax-collector, and if anybody deserved such a fate, he probably did. And Albert Einstein teamed up with fellow nuclear physicist Leo Szilard to invent a better refrigerator. (They actually invented several and made a pile of money from them.) You'll also meet people whose names you're highly unlikely to know but will probably never forget, including the man who proved why the sky is blue, ""the worst poet who ever lived,"" and Le Pétomaine (the Fartomaniac), who became the highest-paid performer in France for his wildly popular act in which he sang and did impressions by passing gas.Caesar's Last Breath is full of fascinating and sometimes hilarious sidelights such as these. For example, did you know that ""[B]efore 1850 people routinely committed suicide rather than face surgery?"" (I didn't, and I've read a bit about the history of medicine.) It was only in the mid-19th century that anesthetics—first nitrous oxide, then ether, and finally chloroform—finally started coming into use.Sam Kean's writing style is informal, to say the least. (I don't think I've ever seen the word ""catookus"" in print anywhere else.) You can easily imagine him talking to you and laughing pretty much half the time. Given the aridity of so much of typical science histories, Caesar's Last Breath is a delight."
32,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5208303-maxine,5,"We all get annoyed when someone doesn’t cover their mouth when they cough for fear that we will inhale whatever they are spewing into the air around us. But, according to Sam Kean, when we breathe, we not only inhale the air of those near us right now but, in fact, every breath we take connects us with the breath of everyone who has ever lived including, as the title of his latest book suggests, Caesar’s last breath. As it says on the cover blurb [w]ith every breath, you literally inhale the history of the worldHe takes us through, not only the science of the gases in the air around us but the history of the people who studied them including some of their wildly crazy experiments on animals and even themselves and, as usual, he makes it not only easily understood (well, at least most of it) by non-scientific types like me but he makes it fascinating, even fun, to read about… again, at least most of it – there is this one chapter, The Fallout of Fallout, that makes Stephen King look like a piker when it comes to horror. In it, Kean discusses the science and history of nuclear testing including the Manhattan Project as well as the effects of radiation poisoning. Fortunately or perhaps somewhat cunningly, he follows this with stories about what really happened in Roswell and the possibility of life on other planets – thank goodness because I read this chapter at the same time as Trump’s cliffhanger speech about N. Korea.I’m guessing most non-science readers are thinking a book about gases sounds boring. But this is a Sam Kean book and if anyone could make gases not only interesting but entertaining, occasionally scary, frequently laugh-out loud funny, and, of course reader-friendly, it’s Sam Kean and in Caesar’s Last Breath: Decoding the Secrets of the Air Around Us, he does…a lot. If I learned a little bit about this amazing planet we live on along the way, hey, bonus.Thanks to Little, Brown, and Company for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review"
33,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,5,"Caesar’s Last Breath is a lot of fun to read. I just finished reading On Trails: An Exploration by Robert Moor, and I can’t help making the comparison between the two books. Caesar’s Last Breath meanders through the history, science, and applications of gases as well as making some profound observations about our relationship with the gases on Earth and the future.I loved On Trails, which also has a meandering style, approaching this topic and that. I loved this book even more, probably because I have a more natural interest in the subject matter. Kean is also a very funny writer, which gives that book an element of entertainment beyond the fascinating information. Kean is also a master at weaving interesting human stories and anecdotes with the history and science of gases. We should hire him to write all science and math textbooks because learning through these human narratives is just so effective. In high school science, you learn about the periodic table and its development in terms of the names associated with it, and its usefulness. In contrast, this book takes you right into the moment in history, embroiled in the all the mystery and controversy, and you find yourself taking sides and thinking about how you would do the experiment and puzzling out explanations for weird observations.For the next two weeks, I was brining up gas facts to my partner, Payel, about twice per conversation."
34,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2431634-chris,5,"This is a book about air, specifically the chemistry of air. That might sound like a dull topic to many, but Sam Kean is a master at infusing the science with stories that bring the discoveries and their impacts to life. I've read a lot of popular science books and expected to be revisiting many familiar stories, but I was delighted to find that most of what's here was new to me. I listened to the audiobook read in small part by the author but largely by Ben Sullivan, who does an excellent job at narrating the book. This is the second Sam Kean book I've read, and I look forward to reading more."

This may be my least favorite one, though. It's still good, Just not the best.I enjoy the poetic quality of this book. It's pretty romantic. I also feel so future-y reading about space colonization (let's take a moment to remember that imperialism sucks) and environmental engineering. I liked the puns and history stuff. This book also has some WWII stuff. Can any book ever not get into the A-bomb? This is a challenge I'm planning to do; find a non-fiction that does not mention WWII at all in any of its facets."

I enjoyed it at least as much as I enjoyed The Disappearing Spoon and The Violinist’s Thumb.

Yes, you. Kean's rollicking exploration of Earth's atmosphere is stuffed full of such staggering oddities. Even an element as staid as nitrogen turns out to have a shocking back story, involving Nazis of all things. Although there is a decent amount of science, most of the focus is on the scientists: their triumphs, disasters, foibles, and occasional acts of gobsmacking stupidity. Kean's slightly snarky prose enlivens yet another seemingly prosaic topic. Thanks, Netgalley."

48,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49607871-steven,5,"Well written pop science, I would recommend to high schoolers. "
49,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7383084-adam,4,"I was not a particularly enthusiastic student, at least where science was concerned. Every class I took on the subject, from middle school through college, left me completely uninterested, and I soon mastered the art of daydreaming while maintaining eye contact with my teachers, always with a notebook and pen seemingly at the ready. (In college, a required class on soil science, held at 9 a.m., was almost too much to bear. To keep myself awake, I sat beside the same student every Tuesday and Thursday, a soccer player with an active night life, and nudged him every time his head drooped to one side or the other. This self-appointed task kept me alert enough that I never fell victim to the same fate.)Needless to say, upon the completion of my last required science class as an undergrad--and, as I was well aware, the last science class I would ever have to take--I felt a sense of overwhelming joy. I had endured years of droning lectures, filled notebooks with equations and diagrams that I would never fully understand, and devoted hours of study to textbooks that described science as though it were a piece of furniture in need of assembly. Even dissection, something I did only once, revealed itself to be lacking any real interest for me, as we spent most of our time looking over the photocopied carcass of a splayed piglet in preparation for yet another quiz. (In retrospect, I should have claimed moral objections and skipped the entire ordeal, as another one of my classmates did; my grade would have been the same regardless, I'm sure.)And yet...buried deep in a box somewhere in my parents' basement are science books. Dozens and dozens of them. Many of them are picture books--on dinosaurs, weather patterns, birds, volcanoes, and so on. As a child, I adored anything related to science, especially if it taught me something about the strange, wild, and fascinating world I had been born into. I watched episodes of Bill Nye the Science Guy with such hunger that even today, twenty years later, I can recite certain moments verbatim. The house in which I grew up was surrounded on all sides by lush forest, and I whiled away hours collecting a leaves, studying anthills, and investigating dens dug by small animals. (That I escaped childhood without once being attacked by a badger is a miracle.) Like many young boys, the effects of fire left me spellbound: aluminum soda cans would weaken if left in a fire long enough, I noticed, but metal soup cans would not, and from these simple experiments I could make endless deductions. And at some point, around the age of ten or eleven, I became obsessed with Alfred Wegener, the man who first proposed continental drift. The thought of a fifth-grade boy becoming enamored with a long-dead German geophysicists while his classmates filled their lunchtime conversations with thoughts on their favorite football players is a little tough to imagine; for me, I couldn't imagine anything else at that age, especially the allure of football when compared to the puzzle-piece continents of our world.My interest may have been narrow and eccentric, maybe even parochial, but they were not unusual. My hunch is that many boys and girls experience a similar baptism: a parent or teacher introduces them to an enchanting aspect of the world, and they are hooked. As time passes, however, those interests disappear. Blame is easy to assign--we abandon many of our childhood interests over time, and adolescence makes us self-conscious about ourselves, especially if we enjoy something considered ""geeky"" or ""weird""--but I have no hesitancy in doing so. At some point, science became less about the world around me and more about the world as it was depicted on paper. The science lessons I remember fondly from my pre-teen years--raising butterflies, making alum crystals, dissecting owl pellets, creating an electrical grid from desk to desk--slowly gave way to tedious chapters in decades-old textbooks. Hands-on experiments became fewer and fewer, replaced by thick packets and endless tests.Even today, I shudder at what has become standard in science curricula across the country. Once, while tutoring a student after school, he handed me the packet he was required to complete for his science class, which reduced a compelling topic--volcanoes--to a series of multiple-choice questions and short-answer problems, all derived from long, droning paragraphs in his textbook. The boy I was tutoring was eleven years old. In more capable hands, he would be learning about volcanoes by building his own out of paper mache, or by studying pictures of Pompeii, or by tracing every step of an eruption with props and sound effects and destructible scenery. Instead, his study of volcanoes required him to sit at a table and search for bold vocabulary words.Which is, of course, a travesty. Our world is endlessly fascinating, and it's only been in the last five years or so--since graduating from college and becoming a teacher myself, albeit of English--that my interest in science has been rekindled, thanks almost exclusively to writers like Bill Bryson, Mary Roach, and Sam Kean.* The first wrote what is perhaps my favorite science book, A Short History of Nearly Everything, which explores the planet Earth from its earliest moments. What makes the book such a treasure is that Bryson, who has no formal training in science, devotes an equal amount of ink to both scientists and their discoveries. He tells their stories as though writing a novel--sometimes comedic, sometimes tragic, often inspiring but just as easily dispiriting--and employs creative analogies and contemporary examples in order to simplify complicated (but important) milestones reached centuries ago.The same can be said of Mary Roach, who writes about serious topics--the utility of dead bodies, the science of human sexuality, the preparation needed to undertake a mission to Mars--with biting honesty and a dark sense of humor, both of which help lay readers connect with subjects that might otherwise be seen as too obtuse or irrelevant. And Sam Kean takes broad scientific concepts--elements, genetics, the brain--and weaves together dozens of fascinating stories in order to convey how rich and complicated each subject truly is. In other words, he takes topics that have become stodgy textbook chapters and rewrites them to reveal the human faces behind each.Kean's most recent book, Caesar's Last Breath, explains the air around us: what it is comprised of, how long we've known this, and who made these discoveries. Along the way, we are introduced to the first men to successfully fly a hot-air balloon; a crotchety old widower in Washington who defies a volcano and loses; a pig that miraculously survives a nuclear blast; an aristocrat whose house is set on fire by those who see his scientific experiments as proof of his decadence; the world's worst poet, writing an ode to one of the world's worst bridges; a man who hopes to defeat hurricanes with chemicals; and so on. Each of these stories offers us a glimpse into our attempts at understanding, utilizing, and even changing our atmosphere. Most importantly, Kean knows that every respiration is a story in itself--a remixing of the same air breathed by men and women who lived centuries ago, as well as the same air that will be still be breathed centuries from now. In other words, every inhale is a communication with the past, and every exhale is a communication with the future.This is one aspect of science that is almost always lost in textbooks: why the past matters to those of us living in the present. It's very easy to ignore the life of Einstein when all we're asked to do is understand his theories. But learning about where our famous scientists came from, as well as how they came to be scientists, is just as important as memorizing their formulas, identifying their discoveries on the Periodic Table, or using modern versions of the instruments they designed and built. We see the situations that propelled them into asking questions, making observations, and filling pages with calculations, until they arrived at a conclusion. This gives our modern world a depth that it so deeply needs, and a nuance that might serve as a warning to others. As Kean points out, not all great scientists were heroic beyond their achievements; some, like Alfred Nobel and Fritz Haber, left legacies of carnage and death that may very well overshadow their scientific accomplishments in the near future. Those who hope to one day work in the sciences must understand that not every breakthrough is universally beneficial; sometimes, the cure for one problem is the cause of another, and anyone who walks into a laboratory without that in mind is taking a great risk.Studying the past is also a reminder to young people that those who do great things often come from humble beginnings, that they need to work hard over many years, that they often--and inevitably--struggle. Students often approach science class with a pass/fail mindset--they need to get the experiment right the first time because they will not have a second, and anything that does not achieve the prescribed outcome is meaningless. This is not how science is supposed to work. Science is built upon repetition and failure: every floundering experiment or disproven hypothesis adds to our scientific knowledge because it tells us to try again, change our approach, or move in a different direction. One of the great benefits to doing experiments with children is that it forces them to act, evaluate, and recalculate based on little more than what they've observed, all of which are vital skills. Learning that scientists of the past found success only after years, even decades, of failure gives kids permission to do the same--have an idea, conduct an experiment, and fail. As long as they see that failure as the beginning of a new path rather than the end of their only option, they will benefit much more than if they simply read about these experiments in a stuffy textbook.There are writers with much more direct scientific knowledge and expertise than Sam Kean--Neil deGrasse Tyson, Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking, and Michio Kaku are only a few. And they are fine writers, not to mention excellent spokespeople for the importance of a strong science education. But it's Sam Kean and his compatriots who I enjoy the most, and whose work offers us guidance about how we can reclaim the joys of science for future generations. They remind us that science can be both terrifying and exciting; it can be time-consuming but also fun and invigorating; it can be frustratingly mysterious, almost petulant in its unwillingness to give up the solution as easily as you would like, but within those mysteries is something redemptive. To solve a mystery of this world, even a relatively small one, is to locate a missing puzzle piece, one that reveals even more of our existence once set in place. And the people who solve those mysteries, regardless of their own personal foibles and reputations, are just as worthy of our study as their most important works.*A healthy diet of MythBusters reruns has also helped.This review is based on a copy of the book provided by the publisher and was originally posted at There Will Be Books Galore.

This all sounds rather boring, but he makes it exactly the opposite. He starts out with the story of Caesar’s last breath, which is apparently a common tale in chemistry, but one that I had never heard before. The story made me feel rather queasy, but far from bored. The rest of the book contains stories to illustrate properties of gases and their history on earth. The stories go from gross to horrifying, but never to boring. The author tells stories of discoveries about gases and somehow this brings in a lot of history and technological discoveries in addition to just gases. After reading this, I felt I’d had an extensive history lesson, far more detailed than was taught in school. He never veers too far away from gases, however. The books stays focused. This method is really good for understanding because it takes you through the thought processes of the people who worked out what we know about gases now. The author has clear way of explaining concepts and tells just enough about the scientists involved to keep them interesting without getting into too much detail. He also makes all the information interesting with his writing style. He has a humorous way of expressing himself that is just the right amount of lightness. It doesn’t get in the way of what he is saying like some authors’ humor does. This book does have a very dark side because human history is very dark. Even gases have been involved in war, and made radioactive, and this is very disturbing. I can’t say that I am terribly interested in gases, but this book makes me feel otherwise. They really are very important for everything else on earth."
51,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40609711-lori-gibbany,5,Loved it! Nerd knowledge in investable form. I haven't found a book by Sam Kean I didn't like.
52,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38715452-elaine-lau,5,An absolutely brilliant book and so utterly fascinating.
53,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3133678-fate-s-lady,4,"For a non-fiction book this got a bit romantic at times, not in a weird, mushy way but in the poetry of noting that should humanity one day reach another habitable planet, their first breath of new air will release just a little bit of earth into the new atmosphere in the form of oxygen and nitrogen and other trace elements that have cycled through millions or billions of people from Earth's history. Wow. The facts and science were interesting, but I think the magic of this book is the way it shapes how you'll look at something as mundane as breathing going forward. "
54,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3681995-jeff,4,"Another of Sam Kean’s wonderfully readable books about Science. Who would ever think there was so much to know, and how it could be explained in such a way as to make it appear both majestic and understandable to the lay person. The premise of the title is that, as all air molecules are recycled it is highly likely that, if not in every breath, at least several times a day you import some of the air that made up Caesar’s last breath. Or Harry Truman’s or Henry the vIII. In short the high number of molecules in each breath make diffusion in each person almost infinite. The book contains interesting discussions of Mt. St Helens, Krakatoa, and the many early volcanic explosions that formed our first air. Then how we went from that toxic air to now. It starts with Nitrogen. Nitrogen is triple bonded, it does not die out. Therefore over millions and millions of years the. I use amounts formed simply outlasted the volcanic gasses formed and then diffused in much greater quantities. We can’t create nitrogen. All nitrogen come from a single bacteria that forms it. Farmers learned tricks , manure, blood etc on crops helps this bacteria thrive. Not until two German scientists found a way to create nitrogen thru ammonia fertilizer did we have a way to increase the nitrogen we were blessed with. In fact, the extreme population growth the planet now holds, about half at least would have failed to exist if. It for this invention. There was just a finite supply of nitrogen, this a finite supply of living matter for foodstuffs. Oxygen is very much the opposite of nitrogen. As opposed to nitrogen’s triple bond non reactive state, oxygen will cause trouble wherever it is. Think of a fire given oxygen. Early discoverers of oxygen realized that our lungs burn oxygen. This is why we age/rust/oxidize. Photosynthesis creates extra unused oxygen which is why plants are so important. It is the mitochondria in cells that uses oxygen, without them we would not know how to process it. I have a great multitude of highlights on this book. Farts are addressed, it seems the author cannot relationship. Held gas has caused peoples abdomen to rip open. Water, h20, Laughing gas, how gravity affects the movement of water through vacuum pumps , the energy difference needed between water and steam from that water, these are all addressed. An interesting section on the non reactive noble gases and how these were discovered. Radioactive fallout, sound traveling in cold versus warm air, nitro glycerine, explosives in general, Freon and refrigeration, global warming, methane, a d much more. A full report on this book would take pages And pages. I can only tell you if you have an interest in science but not a lot of advanced understanding Kean will make you know much more than you thought you could. And you will enjoy it. This book rivals the authors best earlier works. It is a treasure trove of accessible information. "

56,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66704588-leslie-kroger,3,While ultimately a good read...the book was a little hard to follow in the beginning. I had to read several pages over to make sure I completely understood what the author was talking about. About mid way through the book however it became harder and harder to put the book down. This is definitely not a book for someone who likes to get pulled in right away. But very interesting to learn about our atmosphere and how everything we use and do today are connected to the molecules in the air around us. 
57,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara,4,"This one might be my favorite Sam Kean book so far--it sounds like it would be a boring topic, but I was constantly surprised by the directions he takes things, and all of it was pretty fascinating. There are still a couple moments here and there when I felt like he was exaggerating or oversimplifying, but I'll forgive him for that at this point because I find his stuff very entertaining, and there are plenty of other books I could read to find out more of the details I feel like Kean might be glossing over."
58,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75276463-adibah-nur,5,"Have you ever looked around you and thought of the constituents that make up a substance?Ever wondered who's the great inventor behind a genius creation?Or what drives a certain element in the periodic table, compounds or molecules being discovered?I love this book for a truckload of information compressed into it! Not to mention that this author is quite a witty fella. Not only I got an extensive history of how something was discovered/created, imagining the quintillions, septillions molecules we're all inhaling every day gave me quite the rush! (Although actually, it's technically just at ppm [parts per million] or ppb/t concentration.) But come on, aren't you gonna be mind-blown by how these molecules are replenished every day?I also love that this book provided me with down memory lane experience! Reading what you've learned back in school/uni days is just... refreshing!Expect humour from the author, yes, but do also expect experiments that went wild, or miserable scientist, scientists that found fame posthumously, ridiculous war plans (Fritz Haber abomination included) or even careers (as a chemist) that you've never heard of, like... pneumatic chemist (it's actually chemist who studies physical properties of gases in the 17th/18th/early 19th centuries).The book will take you from the creation of air (on early earth days), slowly to how it developed our four layers of atmosphere, to when early centuries scientists started to ponder upon how things work and made big names in the history of Science World, to what future we human might have on another planet. Buckle up your seatbelt because you're in for a ride!Lastly, you might be wondering if we are breathing Julius Caesar's Last Breath.Well... Yes, we do."
59,0316381640,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829466-sara,4,"Sam Kean is one of my favorite authors, so I had to grab this one. This one... was kind of like The Disappearing Spoon to me... a bit of a mixed bag. As in I truly enjoyed many of the stories, but some were a little technical and trending on dull (steam engines particularly) The highlights wereA. The eruption at St. Helen's (gets into what can happen to you when a volcano erupts)B. The Haber Bosh Reaction (making ammonia- cool because of the stories of the scientists behind it)C. The consequences of nuclear fallout (and how people tried to fool themselves that it isn't that harmfulThe last chapter is also fun on alien planets, but it's a big science book cliche to sneak in astronomy and science fiction in no matter what the topic that... meh. Another nit picking thing is that I get the colloquial nature of pop sci books, but I'm just not a fan of random profanity. It just takes away from the prose and that happens a few times in this book. However, when it comes to science writing and engaging science history, Kean is one of the best. Many of the stories are very gripping and not completely familiar. You're also sure to learn some interesting facts about gases in general. I sort of agree with the critique that this one is maybe less cohesive, but truthfully I don't think it took away from the book. I like the way Kean divides his chapters and vignettes and also his use of pictures of illustrations embedded in the book. He's got readability down to a science (ha!). I'm a bit biased toward the biology leaning books so I enjoyed Dueling Neuroscientists and Violinist's Thumb more, but Sam's book are always worth a good read. "
