0,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king,5,"If I had my way over again, I would have studied genetics at university. I was never brilliant at science subjects at school but good with the art subjects, English literature, history and all that good stuff. I stumbled across genetics about twenty years ago and have amassed a considerable number of books in this area.These books are not for the faint hearted. There is some real meaty content to absorb and I certainly found this with The Secret of Life. James Watson covers a wide range here. From Gregor Mendel, from whom genetics was coined in 1900, the famous double helix, playing God with DNA molecules, genetic fingerprinting, reading genomes through to defying disease.This is an extremely well-written and thought-provoking book and I would recommend it highly to anyone who is interested in genetics. The one failure of this book though, in my opinion, is that not enough recognition has been given to the crystallographer, Rosalind Franklin at Kings. She worked on the DNA molecule from 1951 until 1953 but still was blind to what was actually present. So what happens? Watson had a look at her x-rays and then that’s history. He received the Nobel Prize in 1962 with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins (Franklin’s supervisor at Kings) for their work on the double helix structure of DNA.In all fairness to Watson, he did mention that if Franklin had not died from ovarian cancer in 1958, there might have been indecision with the subsequent Nobel Prize, as the maximum that can share the award is three. He wondered who it would have been: Franklin or Wilkins?Personal feelings apart though, this is still a marvellous awe-inspiring book."
1,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"This is much, much better than James Watson's 1968 The Double Helix, which is full of unbearable ego and sexist opinions. It even contains a chapter which explains the discovery of the double helix sans most of the commentary that made the earlier book annoying. Watson has definitely matured, thank goodness, and into a man I wouldn't mind discussing genetics with. For example, he emphasises choice for pregnant women who know their babies have genetic disorders, insists that women have a right to decide on abortion which it is barbaric to deny, which I wouldn't have predicted from his earlier book and which suggests a more liberal outlook than I expected.In terms of the science alone, minus any comments on the writer, this is an excellent primer on DNA, covering most of what we currently understand about DNA. Being published nearly a decade ago now, it doesn't comment on newer discoveries like the epigenetic control of gene expression, but it does cover just about everything in my college level online genetics class right now, with the added benefit of being something you can take at your own pace and without the horrible quantity of math that actually putting theories into practice requires (for example, he talks about finding a gene by reference to its association with a marker: I can calculate that if you give me half an hour, a calculator and a piece of paper -- and allow me to cuss a good bit). It's accessible to the layman, I think, but I still found it of interest despite my genetics classes and general interest in the field.Some books leave me feeling that I've taken the wrong path in life. This is one of them. We know so many amazing, beautiful, astonishing things about DNA -- and we have so much more to learn. This book made me long to have taken the other path in which I forced myself through the sciences for my A Levels, took a degree in genetics or something related, and became a geneticist. Watson clearly evokes the potential for this knowledge, and makes me wish I could add whatever intelligence I have to the process.Skip The Double Helix, except as a historical document, but I do recommend DNA: The Secret of Life with little reserve."
2,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9189416-jesse,1,"This book is a classic bait and switch. You see the title, and you read the little bits about it, you notice its author (DNA structure co-discover) and you think you may have a real winner. The parts of the book that focus on hard science are fascinating. They delve into the subject matter in a way that those with some college biology can understand fairly well. I have taken college level biochemistry (and did terribly), so my view on what is required to understand this book may be warped. But for the most part, it seems that he explains jargon fairly well and keeps the jargon to a useful minimum.I knew there was something wrong with this book early on. As part of the ""history of genetics"", Watson covered eugenics. During that section, he tried to paint two sides of the movement, ""positive"" and ""negative"" eugenics. The bad eugenics was started by Americans and was eaten up by the Nazis. ""Positive eugenics"" was done by the more sensible British, in Watson's view, and was stifled by that inconvenience to genetic science called the T4 Program and its sequel, the Holocaust. This gross oversimplification of the history of eugenics baffled me, but I chalked it up to the fact that Watson is a scientist, not a historian.Unfortunately, Watson's lack of historical credentials slowly bleeds into and chokes the life out of this book. He does not know how to balance his opinions or show the other side of his arguments in any kind of reasonable light. Got a problem with genetically modified food? You're a Luddite holding back science. Worried about recombinant DNA? Then you hate sick people and want them to die. Now, in the case of recombinant DNA technology, Watson was right in that it appears to not have caused any major issues. However, later in the book, he talks about the dangers of using retroviri to correct genetic diseases. Apparently James Watson can distinguish between all these risks, as scientist extraordinaire.But this inconsistency is consistent throughout the book. Democracy is good, except when it interferes with the glorious path of science. Then government should just be some kind of scientific dictatorship where geniuses like Watson. Watson returns to eugenics at the end of the book, and passionately argues that we need to find out, genetically, which people would deserve to be taught math and if certain groups really are ""dumber"" than others. These bizarre obsessions, Watson's need to be right and demonize those who are ""wrong"", and his lack of historical balance totally destroy what is fascinating subject matter. I hope to find a book about this subject that is pure science and leaves the grating biases aside."
3,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This is a clear and lucid tale of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), written by one of the men who discovered the structure of the molecule. It delves into the history of the discovery, the human genome project, the potential of DNA in various areas such as GM foods, developing new medicines and combating crime. It becomes clear that much of the public and political fear in regards to DNA originates in ignorance. Other things, such as patenting genes, is absolutely horrifying because it effectively curtails further studies by increasing the cost. Sometimes in areas that would desperately need it. I don't know what kind of legislation allows this, it is absolutely absurd. The book itself is immensely readable and easily understandable even to the lay person. I am somewhat jealous of Watson for having been at the forefront of molecular biology - it must have been and must still be incredibly exciting to be on the cutting-edge of science."
4,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2840090-zjay,5,"I found this book fascinating. Watson has the knack of making difficult topics comprehensible to non-scientists like me. He is also a great storyteller. He takes the time to present each of the researchers whose works he discusses. He boils their often frustrating research down to the one or two big questions their findings helped to answer. I learned how parts of the body work. For example, on pp. 76-78, Watson explains how the body produces hemoglobin, a protein useful in transporting oxygen. Pages 81-83 explain the research that clarified how the body produces the enzyme that breaks down lactose in milk.  A very important question is how did DNA first come into being. DNA research uncovered the important work accomplished by RNA, which Watson describes as an evolutionary heirloom. Watson's collaborator on the double helix, Francis Crick, suggested early on that there may have been an ""RNA world"" before DNA developed. RNA can store and replicate genetic information and is a protein equivalent (it can act as a catalyst in critical chemical reactions). (pp. 83-85)In chapters 2 and 3, Watson tells the story of the discovery of the structure of DNA—the double helix. He relates the stories of dozens of researchers who collaborated to define amino acids, proteins and the human genome. Subsequent chapters examine the advances that have transformed agriculture (ch. 6), criminology and forensics (ch. 10), genetic medicine (ch. 11 [on diseases:] and ch. 12 [on therapies:]), and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries (ch. 5). Chapter 8 explains the human genome and its function. Watson also explains genetic theories prior to 1950 in chapter 1. The competitive struggle to fund academic research on the Human Genome before for-profit corporations copyrighted many of the genes is described in detail in Chapter 7. Chapter 9 describes the global research that uncovered DNA patterns that confirm the migration of early humans out of Africa about 100,000 years ago.This work taught me a lot and helped me to understand the importance of Watson and Crick's discovery. I highly recommend it."
5,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1271545-david,0,"When I came across the audio version of this book at work, I was excited. I looked forward to gaining a more solid grasp of genetics, and the thought of learning it from Watson was even better. If I'm lucky, I thought, I'll hear it in the voice of one of the fathers of genetics (Watson and his colleague, Crick, were the discoverers of the double helix structure of DNA). He did indeed read the introduction, and it was as interesting as I thought it would be. However, my youthful joy was not to last. Good books are supposed to teach you about yourself, and this book didn't disappoint. It taught me that, despite the best intentions, I am not built to understand science through audiobooks. Like when I tried A Brief History of Time, the reader's words just washed over me, and I would realize that I had been thinking about science in general, or a specific phrase he used that I like, or sandwiches, for the past ten minutes. Invariably I would chastise myself and pull myself back in, studiously listening and staunchly refusing to understand until I passed a remarkably interesting bit of roadkill on the highway. Don't get me wrong: Watson's writing was fairly accessible, but without the ability to go back and reread a certain line that I didn't quite get, it was sort of like falling down a flight of stairs with roller skates on and my hands stuck in fishbowls."
6,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5779932-chris-rock,4,"This is my second time reading this book (listening to it, actually). It's a pretty long book, dense, and rich with information.Written by the scientist who discovered the structure of DNA, and played an important role in the sequencing of the human genome, the book starts with the discovery of the structure of DNA and its role in the process of life. Then it moves to cover a wide variety of topic ranging from the purely scientific, such as DNA's role in protein synthesis, to the political, like the ethical concerns of the genetic manipulation of human DNA.Recommended for those with a pretty good grip on science, as it gets pretty deep in places. Highly recommended for those who wish to understand the role of DNA in our lives and all the various ways it can affect us."
7,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4649093-katie-mcsweeney,3,"Read this as a genetics undergrad and it was one of those books that confirmed my love of the subject, along with The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry. A fascinating area! But poor Rosalind Franklin where is her Nobel Prize???"
8,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7226831-josh-friedlander,4,"Learning about genetics today carries two problems: a lot of the very basic stuff is so well known that it's hard to appreciate how novel it was, the great change in philosophy necessitated by Mendel. And the rest of it is so jargon-laden and tinged with the intimidating aura of white-coated genius that people glaze over when hearing it. Watson's book is a very good summary of the entire topic, from Mendel to eugenics to his famous discovery of the double helix to the Asilomar near-moratorium on recombinant DNA experimentation to the birth of biotech to the incredible project that sequenced the entire human genome to CRISPR-Cas9 and the coming era of genetic medicine. Watson is a great narrator because he is...something of a character. Notoriously blunt (his autobiography is called Avoid Boring People) his career has been marked by rancour and controversy, from his collaborators Crick and Wilkins trying to stop his book about them being published, to his alleged theft of ideas from Rosalind Franklin, and his more recent outbursts against political correctness in relation to nature/nurture debates concerning gender and race. He is still an engaging, informative guide. This book, whose new edition contains added material on cancer genetics, and references to Theranos and Game of Thrones, is a good companion to Siddhartha Mukherjee's more stylish The Gene: An Intimate History and The Emperor of All Maladies. Like many brilliant scientists, Watson is not the easiest person to get along with, but his gifts and enthusiasm have ushered in a changed world most of us barely comprehend. "
9,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22060306-jaap-hoogenboezem,3,"The first 175 pages or so are wonderful: a well written, clear, at times funny history of genetics, from Mendel to modern times. After that the book loses some of its direction and speed. I found myself skipping parts that were not directly about genetics but about how big science works (the chapter on the Human Genome Project is a case in point: there is much on grant applications and money but in fact very little about genetics). A whole chapter on the use of DNA in criminal investigations was also a bit too much for my sake. The parts on disease and genetics in the latter chapters were again more interesting. The chapter on the philosophical ramifications of finding the DNA-code is long and empty. James Watson is an extreme reductionist who is convinced that with finding the DNA-code we have also found everything we need to know about our place in nature and the universe. He states his position clearly early on in the book in the chapter on discovering the structure of DNA, where he says that now we knew the secret of life - just a bunch of self-replicating molecules. I don't feel he has much more to say about it yet for some reason he tries to do this in this final chapter. "
10,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14946158-holly,4,"A genetics book, by the one of the co-discoverers of the double helix structure of DNA. There's a few chapters about the science, about the history of genetics and then a variety of topics, genetically modified foods and the controversy, DNA evidence in solving crimes, genetic diseases, ancient racial ancestry, ethical questions, bio-tech politics. He got preachy near the end, which I didn't mind, even though I didn't agree with everything he said. Parts of the book made me wish I had gone into genetics."
11,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4583998-tom-evans,5,"A great book by a brilliant mind. The only disappointment is that the author's mind seems to be closed to the metaphysical and spiritual angle and, as a result, in my opinion is missing what DNA is really about completely. You don't have to be a geneticist to know this by the way (and note I am an engineer not a woo-woo la-la screwball)Technically and scientifically, the author and the book is brilliant."
12,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15213777-c,4,"Very interesting, would recommend for anyone with even a casual interest in genetics or biology. For those who already have knowledge of biology, it might seem a little dumbed-down at first, but once you get past Mendel's pea plants and white-eyed fruit flies that are covered in every Bio 101 class, things start getting pretty interesting again. And it kind of drags in the middle when we get into all the academia and business politic, but it picks up again with the science soon enough. "
13,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5813283-rohini,5,"Every time I read this book, it brings me more insight and amazement into the intricacies of Life. It all boils down to the simple intertwined thread of molecules called the DNA. Simple, yet so complex. Elegant yet so savage. Also, in Watson's words, the journey of a scientist is depicted so vividly. I would definitely want to read this book again."
14,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97657365-steve-lim,3,"I looked forward to reading the book after being enticed to buy it based solely on the credentials of the author. I was excited with anticipation of being 'steepened' in the science of the subject matter. However, the book proved to be more an account of the history of firstly, the discovery of the structure of the hereditary information-carrying macromolecule, and the revolution the discovery brought to the world of genetics, with all its implications. I was quite disappointed with the book's lack of depth. My disappointment culminated in the uninformed quoting of Christian new testament scripture in the closing paragraphs of the book in the manner one drops names of famous people as one's acquaintances in conversations with friends one is trying to impress. As someone who had done an in-depth refutation of the divinity of the Christian doctrine by detailed technical exegesis of the scripture, I found the addition of an excerpt of the apostle Paul's letter to the Corinthians - a passage about love - to be a cheap attempt at bridging the philosophical gap between the anti-evolution, anti-genetics, right-wing, creationists and the empirically and scientifically biased secularists. This gap is best bridged by human intelligence and the embrace of technological discovery in the spirit of Copernicus and Galileo rather than our appeasing, albeit with love, the blind adherence to religious dogma such as that witnessed amongst the demographic that is under the powerful sway of the Roman Catholic Church. It has to be remembered that such sway was once effected through royal decree or military force, that is, non-adherence to the dogma was quite unceremoniously punished by death. We as a modern society should eradicate all vestiges of such a backward-looking way of life. It was as though Watson was trying to be nice to the creationists though he obviously did not accept what they believed in. He was trying to show a forgiving, accepting heart by implying their folly could be explained by genetics. I do not think all of man's folly can be explained by genetics."
15,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10218028-chris,4,"This book is a bit of a mix between good and bad. The good is that it was an interesting story of how DNA was discovered and how it is used today. It goes into chapters on agriculture/GM crops, crime, and healthcare pretty thoroughly. It isn't the best book to listen to as audio, because of some of the detail and the frequent use of acronyms. If I was reading it in print, I'm sure I would go back over some sections/sentences a couple times. The bad is when Watson's opinions come in real strong. He is for the pursuit of science at nearly any cost. He talks about how he was upset because of a delay in study of a simian virus and things because of the potential dangers of it passing on to humans. There was a 5 year delay or so and it ended up not being a danger, but he was angry that there was a delay. His opinion is the only one that matters, too, as he rips into people with different opinions on basically all the topics in the book. He not only defends Monsanto and GM crops, but claims it's better in every way that they had the ""terminator"" gene that forced farmers to buy all their seed from Monsanto, because the seed from their crops were non-germinating. He says it's better because then more money goes into research and better and better product. I can see his viewpoint, but not only is it an elitist viewpoint, but the way he says it in the book is a little extreme. I'm not against GM crops, but I am against his attitude toward everyone else. In addition he's angry about the religious right and their stances on abortion and and the politicians that bow to their 'draconian' will. He thinks that literally everyone should submit their DNA to the FBI because there is more benefit to the greater good than possible negatives. Among other complaints. All about that progress as fast as possible.So, besides those few passages that irritated me, I thought it was pretty good overall. The narrator did a good job, also."
16,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56579608-finlay-chedd,4,"This book was very interesting and compelling. However it does have two drawbacks, hence the 4/5 rating.First, there are some pictures in the book which would have been a great addition and would help clarify some of the tricky stuff, if it were not for the lack of color. The captions of the pictures would say something along the lines of “highlighted in red you see the enzyme attacking the protein, which is colorized blue”. This would app have been good and all, IF THE PICTURES WEREN’T BLACK AND WHITE!!!Secondly, and this is solely my opinion and I understand the problem might lie with me, but some parts of the book were too heavy. The author states at the start of the book that he has tried to phrase and explain everything in such a manner that all people could understand it. Now i’m not a professor or anything, but I’m about to enter university and am 18 years old, and I found some parts just too difficult to follow. A little more depth and explanation would have been appreciated in some instances. Or maybe I’m just stupid."
17,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2096885-jeffrey-williams,5,"Told by the co-discoverer of the double helix, James D. Watson traces the history of the discovery of DNA through modern day advances. While he does offer technical details, they are still aimed at teaching people who have little or no background in the science. Each chapter builds upon the concepts introduced in the previous one, and he brings in other scientists who have added their contributions. Additionally, he does show how political attitudes often interferes with looking at science for science. I had read his first book, ""Double Helix"" as a young undergraduate student thirty years ago. While I found the topic fascinating then, his earlier book did not capture me enough to want to pursue a career in genetics. If this book would have been written a couple decades earlier, I might have pursued a different career path. This book belongs in every General Science class in high school, and would also serve as a good introductory book in a survey collegiate class. "
18,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64484002-william-smith,3,"This palpable tome is a compendious evaluation of DNA stretching from history to biology, to the future benefits of genetic engineering. Within this work, there is ample sourced information, appositely constructing a foundation particularly for those without an academic background in biochemistry. Topics such as the history of eugenics, discovery of the structure of DNA and the early advent of biotechnology (insulin and human growth hormone) are cobbled-stones towards the latter portions which focus on the beneficially fruitful produce from genetics research: tackling disease. True to form, Watson does not shy away from some of the more noteworthy controversies in genetics research: GMO worries, ethics of genetic screening, nature versus nurture - in short, imparting worthwhile knowledge for those with little exposure to the field of genetics. "
19,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50839353-jessica-kennedy,5,"An essential read for those interested in, or studying, biological sciences. Watson charts the development of the fields of genetics and, in part, molecular biology, and their attendant controversies as discoveries were made. He also dispels many dangerous myths about what geneticists do, how genetic engineering works, and what it could mean for our future. Overall I found this to be an engaging and hopeful read, though I did see a few spots where there would be a benefit in releasing an updated edition to reflect new information (notably concerning Neanderthals)."
20,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42544023-chad-rexin,5,"While I don't agree with everything in the book, I found it fascinating. It is so amazing how much of who we are I in our DNA and genes. Scientists have discovered many things with DNA, but there are many areas and diseases like Alzheimer's and heart disease that likely have a genetic component to them where we don't know enough about what controls it. The book covers not only DNA and it's discovery, but the history and some of the key topics with GMOs, cloning, disease research, and all the ethical issues that go along with it. Some of it is a bit technical, but is a well worth reading."
21,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61043374-sayed-mustafa,5,"It all started when I was in the twelvth grade, I was passionate about genetics and DNA, Though I disagree with much of the authors' views about society and religion, I gained so much knowledge about the past history of eugenics, genetics, DNA, recombinant DNA, biotechnology, genetically modified products, and genetic diseases. Watson is a great scientist who I praise due to his passionate love for humanity and improving the lives of others."
22,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95878161-ardon-pillay,5,"James Watson’s “The Double Helix,” is by all accounts a brilliant book, but it is extremely anecdotal. His much meatier “DNA” is a more scientific exploration of not just the initial breakthroughs in the field of molecular biology, but also the subsequent advances in gene technology that it spurred. It covers events from the isolation of DNA to the current issues regarding the use of genetic technologies to produce designer babies."
23,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52713998-sunlogix,4,"Interesting account of the history of DNA research. The author sprinkles in some funny anecdotes and observations. Bit partisan on the topic of public funding and his belief that there should be no limitations on research. Which seems a bit naive, if designer babies were technically feasible, people would use it without batting an eye."
24,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74530500-alan-morgan,4,It was short and pretty funny. He basically told the story of the discovery of the structure of DNA. He clarified that this was entirely from his perspective. It was an enjoyable read and I gained respect for Watson and Crick.

The content is great and broad, from the fundamental building blocks of genetics and history of DNA research, through interesting applications such as GMO, tracing footsteps of our ancestors through the world or cancer, and finishing with a slightly philosophical touch of nature vs. nurture or implications of advancements in the area of prenatal DNA testing etc.First few chapters are a little dry and require some basic knowledge of organic chemistry, but rest of the book is not technical at all so consider skimming those instead of putting the book away. Especially the second half is full of interesting facts and insights while really well written and enjoyable."
36,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15651131-last-ranger,5,"Pieces of the Puzzle:At the heart of every cell lies a collection of molecules that hold the key to biology's incredible diversity: DNA. In his 2003 book ""DNA: The Secret of Life"" molecular biologist James D Watson gives the reader an in depth tour of genetics, it's history, where it stands today and where it's going tomorrow. In the early 1950s Watson, along with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins, codiscovered the hidden structure of DNA, for which they shared the 1962 Nobel Prize. That discovery is pretty well covered in ""The Double Helix"" so, if you've read that one, this book may be covering some familiar ground for you. But if you, like me, have not read TDH then DNA will serve as a good introduction to that era. Watson covers the early history of genetics starting in the early 19th century with Gregor Mendel and his work on heredity of the pea plants. The term ""genetics"" was coined about 1909 by a British biologist, William Bateson. But even before Mendel and Bateson people were thinking about heredity; theories like pangenesis and homunculus were popular for a time. Darwin proposed Natural Selection in 1859 but was troubled by not knowing a mechanism for his Theory of Evolution. Seven years later Mendel published his findings on pea plant heredity in an obscure Austrian/German journal but it took a long time before the two theories got together. The 20th century was a heady time for genetic research, competition between scientists reached an all time high as everyone searched for the correct molecular structure of DNA. Watson, having lived through those days, knew all those players in a professional, and sometimes personal, way. But when big business and the government got into the fray, things changed. With giant chemical companies investing millions into R&D, and expecting substantial profits in return, the days of free ""exchange of knowledge"" were over. Some scientists saw big business as an opportunity for unlimited research funding and for personal profit as well. Now the chemical companies, and some scientists, were seeking copyright patients on their discoveries so that anyone wishing to do additional research or even related research would have to pay-up first. Nowadays anything related to ""genetics"" is, for good or bad, in the public eye. Things like cloning, growth enhancement, GMO's in food and medicine are highly controversial for everyone; health care professionals, consumers, politicians and scientists as well. But no matter where you stand on these issues, you need to be well informed on the science involved and this book is a good starting point to that end. But there's more to genetics that the controversial issues mentioned above and Watson gives the reader an in depth look at the many different facets of this important science. Some of the topics covered are: the origin and evolution of life; medical research on human disease, genetic and otherwise; genetics in forensic law enforcement (like CSI); human evolution, how and when we came ""out of Africa"" and the Nature vs Nurture debate. Watson's writing is clear and informative, not to mention entertaining, and he gives a good overview of the history and workings of genetic research. You may not agree with everything the good professor has to say but after reading this book you'll have a clearer understanding of the issues. Filled with cutting edge science of the day DNA: The Secret of Life was scientifically up to date in 2003 but, like any science, a lot has changed since then. New findings and theories not withstanding this book is still as relevant and controversial as it was a decade ago. For the layperson reader DNA:SOL is a good jumping off place to newer publications and different authors in molecular biology and genetic research. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a open, but skeptical, mind with some experience in reading science. I had no technical or formatting problems with this Kindle edition and, as far as I could tell, all the illustrations, charts and photos are included.Last Ranger"

That man is James Watson, the author of ""DNA The Secret of Life"".Watson and Crick beat Chemistry's superstar, Linius Pauling, in the race to decipher DNA's chemical structure in 1953. Since then, science has made amazing progress in broading and applying that knowledge. Watson tells that story in this book. He, himself, played very important roles in pushing the scientific envelope, including his leadership of the Human Genome Project.In the last second, our bodies each produced millions of new cells. Watson explains how this process works, starting with the reading of the DNA code and the activities of messenger and transfer RNA in assembling a protein. We humans, were not content to merely understand this process. We audaciously put those tiny factories to work for us. We learned how to splice DNA at a point if our choosing. We learned how to insert a gene of our choosing into a bacteria's DNA. We put the cell's factories to work for us making medical products. If we only had a minute sample of DNA, we learned how to make millions of copies of it. In short, we created the biotechnology industry.Watson tells how Amgen and Genentech raced to be first to produce human insulin by recombinant DNA processing. It was another race against time.He tells about the Human Genome Project (HGP), which was perhaps more ambitious than putting a man on the moon. Consider that our DNA is billions of letters long. Enormous breakthrough were made in the chemical analysis techniques. The sequencing rate was made faster and faster by brilliant breakthroughs. The HGP, once thought to be impossible, was finished ahead of schedule.DNA technology will replace many of today's medical techniques in the years ahead. It allows us to understand the enemy and to attack it in a precise manner. The cure of cancers and AIDS will come from DNA technology. Heart disease too. Watson explains the hows and whys of future medical advances.Gene therapy is in its infancy. Imagine having all the cells in your body made more perfect.Tracing human origins, finding the ancestral paths of living things, fingerprinting with DNA, forecasting the health of a human embryo, and other topics are also covered in this book.James Watson: He be the man!!Reviewed by Ralph D. Hermansen, 12-01-07 "
39,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54958849-kelly-mcentee,4,"Great information and history as the reader would expect from James Watson, weighed down by Mr. Watson's opinion and hubris, as the reader should also anticipate (not a surprise to me)."
40,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215202-mark,4,"The man that characterized the shape of DNA with Crick delivers a very informative book about the genetic revolution with very good clarity that does not require a biology degree. He discusses early genetics, including genetic engineering along with an overview how molecular processes are affected by DNA. He continues this discussion to the present age where genetic mapping is extremely common and gene therapy will likely be the newest tool to fight human illness. Along the way he discusses tangent DNA technologies that have affected all humans including DNA forensic use in court and genetic engineering of crops. However, his most interesting contribution may be his emphasis on the social and ethical implications that affect scientists and lawmakers dealing with genetics. While in general he seems to favor fewer regulations with the belief that science and knowledge should be free and largely left alone by lawmakers. He seems to back somewhat liberal positions such as the choice of a free mother to abort a baby if early tests reveal major genetic flaws. He highly supports uninhibited stem cell research, a controversial subject now and in the future. Overall his ethical insights, especially as a famous scientist offer a refreshing point of view on a very powerful and hotly contested field, especially with his underlying belief that the promotion of science is itself the greater good."
41,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31463370-pawel-dolega,5,"My background: I read couple of books and did some courses on molecular biology and genetics specifically. I have no formal education neither in genetics nor in biology.This is definitely one of the best popular science books written on this subject. Suffice to say that the author, James Watson, is Nobel prize laureate in this exact field.Although some of the chapters were pretty boring to me (e.g. first and 1 or 2 others - mainly because I knew these particular information before) most of the book is extremely engaging. Technical information are on the one hand far deeper than trivial, on the other hand - it's relatively easy to follow even with some basic prior knowledge of the field (even very tiny one).Book covers (as for more interesting) topics like:- DNA structure- basics of heredity- GMO food (terrific chapter, especially as there is lots of misunderstanding and public fear of this technique)- human origins- defining and attempts to treat genetic diseases (extremely interesting and well written)- business world of biotech.As author lives and breaths this science field, there are also lots of interesting anecdotes about people, organizations and projects that took place in this area in the last half of the decade. Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in genetics and DNA (obviously on a hobby level - this book by no means tries to be university book)."
42,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237462-meredith,0,"Read by Dan Cashman. I can't decide what to rate this. I was listening in short batches in the car, so I probably missed a lot. This is a good review of what I learned in basic biology, plus an update of ramifications of research (well, a ten-years-old update). Even with its age, the book still talks about things that are still coming up today: BRCA1&2 testing (Angelina Jolie!) and GM crops. Watson approaches most of the issues surrounding this research from a purely scientific/biological standpoint - and has reasoned arguments from that perspective, but often ignores other sides of the issue (economic, social) or dismisses other views as ""moralistic"" or reactionary which really should not be so easily dismissed from a comprehensive portrayal of an issue. Overall: Very informative of the issues from the facts standpoint and a good reminder of all the ways in which genetics affect our lives; pay attention to when his personal views come in and realize it's a research scientist talking. "
43,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/160042-starry,3,"Hard to rate. Parts were very interesting to me as a former research scientist: gave me perspective on the history of molecular biology leading up to my entry and pulled together a lot of my knowledge of the scientists behind the work into one cohesive story. Fun to see names of people I knew or heard speak about their work. However, Watson is extremely opinionated about controversial topics (doesn't bother showing the other side of the argument) and doesn't mind dissing his enemies in print. So I value the book less in these areas, despite finding his opinions interesting (would have found them equally interesting in context of better overview/context of controversies). Knowing what I do about his career, I found it interesting how he used this book to defend his famously inflammatory statements about intelligence and ancestry. "
44,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2404888-daniel,3,"A good survey of the subject, although somewhat outdated for 2016. There's a certain glibness about the prose, though; Watson lacks the rigorous pedagogical skills needed to impart subtle molecular processes in a way that sticks. This makes for better skimming than careful reading. I learned a lot about the subject, although I used various aides to help me understand the various concepts Watson glosses over. This was most useful for helping me discern the contours of genomic history of the past fifty years or so. In other words, this book is better on a macro level (for the way it gives DNA history an orderly shape) than a micro level. This book could have been 100 pages shorter or so. Other than that, a fascinating read."
45,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,4,"Curiously, the first chapter in James Watson’s new book about the discovery of the double helix is entitled “Beginnings of Genetics: From Mendel to Hitler.” While the focus on the Nazi atrocities makes for fascinating reading in a voyeuristic way, it seems to diminish the impact of the discovery of the structure of DNA. What is really of great interest are the stories of how the paradigm-changing discoveries in molecular biology were made late in the previous century. The abuses of the Nazi regime seem irrelevant to the societal challenges of the DNA era. That the holocaust was somehow a prelude to the “assault on . . . what is the chemical nature of the gene” is somewhat obscure."
46,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/881752-heather,4,"I gave this book 4 stars because it really is an excellent history of genetics from one of the co-discovers of DNA, James Watson. I have used this book in some papers and in my Genetic Engineering talks because Watson is the quintessential reductionist. He truly believes that everything boils down to our chemistry; his language does not hide just how sacred this view it to him. The reductionist logic will always break down for many reasons, but as an apologist this book was very helpful in understanding how the history of genetic engineering reveals this awe for the chemical components."
47,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"A relatively easy book on a highly esoteric subject. Many great books are written on physical sciences, including complex topics like relativity and superstrings, for non-scientists. The same perhaps does not hold true for DNA and relatied fields, which are perhaps revolutionizing the world more than computer technologies and mobile communication. This book explains some of the topics relatively easily although it has not been sufficiently dumbified. But definitely a good start for anyone wanting to learn the basics of the subject."
48,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9388637-dave,4,"This book was a good crash course in genomics. James Watson has the ability to write in layman's terms well even though he is credited with the partial discovery of the DNA double helix. I liked the way he was able to write about many aspects of emerging DNA science with great knowledge of the peoples, actions and events such that it reads with more depth than a mere encyclopedia, even though at times, the author sounds a bit as if he feels that he can do no wrong...a possible by-product of a lack of humbleness."
49,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/947518-ben,3,"A full history of the discovery of DNA and the double helix, along with all the science behind it, as well as present and future potential applications. The first third was very dense science, kind of hard to get through. The last two thirds blended the human genome, patents and political/corporate interests, and treatments and prevention. As long as you don't go into this book expecting to be entertained, you will get out of it a decent well-rounded knowledge of how genes work. Sprinkled with a little too much slant towards the author's ethical agenda, but I still enjoyed it."
50,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,3,"Together with Crick, Watson famously figured out the structure of DNA molecules, back in 1953. In this book he goes through what happened then, and what happened in the field of genetics in the next half-century. Nice overview of all the small steps, discoveries and so on; also, the various controversies and ethical implications.Books is slightly dated in such a fast-moving field (ie., the Human Genome Project had not been completed yet, Watson still thinks there are ~50K genes in the human genome). Still, very interesting read."
51,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5900232-heather-browning,5,"A great exploration of the science of DNA and all that surrounds it. Watson's central place in DNA-based science makes him ideal for describing the people, methods and politics of the DNA discoveries of the past 50 years. He also covers applications in GM food, DNA profiling for crime-solving, and identification and treatment of genetic diseases. Although my own opinions don't always match his, I liked that there is someone intelligent and knowledgeable fighting for less fear and greater acceptance of genetic technologies."
52,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/667766-cindy,2,A history of genetics peppered throughout with the author's often condescending personal opinions on just about everything. Probably could have been half the length had he stuck to the facts and left his ego out of it. And just how many times do we need to hear about his white skin being at risk for cancer? Dude has issues. It's a thorough and fascinating history but I suspect you can get the same information from a much less biased book. 
53,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21460808-vish-wam,5,"A clean and comprehensive overview of the DNA revolution. A progressive account of every important discovery since the discovery of Double Helix structure of DNA.

54,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13504619-jack-r,5,"""DNA: The Secret of Life"" by the co-founder of the double helix himself, James D. Watson, is one of the best expository books I've read. This book is excellent at informing people who were ignorant of genetics prior to reading it, and does a amazing job of introducing people to the beautiful science that is genetics and its history. This book is also very satisfactory for the aspiring scientist. I can certainly say I now know more about genetics than I did prior to reading this excellent book."
55,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5531701-alyssa,2,"I really wanted to like this. I mean reading about DNA from the founder has to be amazing, right? But it wasn't for me. I was interested in the history, but I didn't enjoy it. Perhaps because it is also biased because of how closely intertwined he was with the discovery (particularly Rosalind Fraknlin's role). I'm a science person and found it to be explained complex, although he claims it is written for anyone to comprehend. You definitely need an exposure to genetics prior to reading. "
56,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/999637-joanna,3,"I guess when you are one of the discoverers of DNA, you can get away with being a bit of a know-it-all, and so far that attitude coming through a bit in his writing is the only thing that bugs me about this book. It is otherwise lucidly written, and I think it would be accessible even to readers without much of a biology background."
57,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3121503-karen,4,I found this really interesting and informative. I liked learning about the development of tests for different genetic diseasea and how the research for these is usually driven by the families most affected by the diseases. It was also an eye opener to find out just how common some of these diseases are.

60,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1144499-f-lix,3,"This book is full of Watson's explanations of the topic from the perspectives of the scientific/academic community. Interesting work, interesting people, and lots of things to know if one is so inclined. I found myself drifting through some parts, mostly due to the chemistry often being over my head, and sometimes due to his disdain for the concerns of common folk."

While the book itself doesn't draw a clear distinction between nurture and nature and if at all genetics plays a role in intelligence, I fail to understand why he says the things he does. The book is an OK read."
62,0375710078,http://goodreads.com/user/show/177252-ryan,4,James has captured the nature of why he chose genetics as his core work. He accounts the details as well as providing some context as the key investigators toward the world of biotechnology as we know it now.
