I was eating cheap red licorice at a frenzied pace while I read from sheer nerves. The idea of bleeding out through every bodily opening was terrifying. The next morning I went to the bathroom and discovered that cheep red licorice passes nearly untouched through the human digestive system. It goes in red and comes out red - blood red. I very nearly screamed before I realized what I was seeing.I will NEVER forget this book.

Both species, the human and the monkey, were in the presence of another life form, which was older and more powerful than either of them, and was a dweller in blood.
I read this book on the same days I was watching the Netflix adaptation of  The Haunting of Hill House, which had a curious effect on me. Because, well, the TV show might be very creepy, but I have to say it is nothing compared to the horror of this book.That's what The Hot Zone is: A true horror story.Preston uses interviews and first-hand accounts to tell the story of the Ebola virus and its various strains. I'd heard of Ebola, of course. I knew it was a disease and that it killed people. I knew I didn't want it. But I didn't really know. I didn't know that it liquidates your organs and turns your body into a walking corpse days before you ""bleed out"". I didn't know that it is one of the most infectious diseases that have likely ever existed on this planet.It acts like a predator, lying quietly in wait for a host so it can multiply and multiply to destructive effect. Reality can be so much more scary than fiction.Truly, this is a terrifying book. Preston definitely dramatizes the whole thing, but he's working with some pretty powerful material.
Imagine a virus with the infectiousness of influenza and the mortality rate of the black plague in the Middle Ages-- that's what we're talking about.
This is the third book about diseases and medicine that I've really enjoyed (though, yes, enjoyed seems like a poor choice of word) - the other two being  And the Band Played On and  The Emperor of All Maladies. I'll happily take recommendations for any others. In the hands of a skilled writer, these books are fascinating, educating and deeply unsettling. Also, despite the age of this book, it doesn't feel too dated. Maybe that is because Ebola remains a threat. Ebola outbreaks are ongoing in Africa, right now. One mistake, one oversight, one infected person taking a plane flight and we might not be able to stop it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
2,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"Imagine what else may lurk in monkeys, bats, and rodents, just waiting to unleash the next zoonosis, possibly in a country with an already severe health crisis in the Southern hemisphere, AIDS and multiresistant tuberculosis, and hepatitis epidemics. It wouldn´t even matter that Ebola can´t be transmitted by air. Still, looking at you, secret black biological warfare program project. It´s the way of dying that makes it even more horrible than other illnesses, being liquified with blood coming out of all your body and knowing what the virus does, that the chances of a normal life, if having the more or less luck of surviving, are minimal, as the long term damage and health problems are immense after having been literally goo(ed). Next to the black vomit and the more and more severe inner bleedings, there are the frightening final stages, being a zombie who turns in a living corpse with the skin changing color, before dying after series of epileptic shocks. What a convenient coincidence for the virus that dying persons covered in their own blood have epilepsy and spread the death by splattering the blood with their last moves, possibly infecting anyone who gets in direct contact with the blood. There are different sceneries described, each one with the potential to get zero patient started.„The Shadow of Mount Elgon“ lets one ask how easy a tourist, field scientist, biologist, or, most possible, a poor worker, may be infected by direct contact in nature without recognizing it. In the case of the privileged group, the malady will possibly soon be found and detected, but the rightless worker might carry it into slums where it can spread until it reaches the richer areas and travels all over the world from there. „The monkey house“ shows the problem of everything legal and illegal around trading animals, zoos, research, and conservation. It´s not as if any zoo or pet store might be the potential initiation point for the next armageddon, but with people having pets and millions visiting zoos, with all those different animals, especially birds, primates, and cats, not even mentioning the factor of pigs in agriculture, there are so endlessly many possible combinations for zoonosis that it blows one's mind.  „Smashdown“ comes closer to my favorite optimistic ending for such books, the ultimate bioweapon, as it describes the real life example of a virus spreading by air. I am not sure about this one, as Ebola is known to not be able to spread via air and there seems to be a misunderstanding in the descriptions in the book (or I misunderstood it), but just because it isn´t, that doesn´t mean that nature doesn´t find a way. Or the umbrella corporation. Fiction and reality are coming closer together, as both the good and bad technological options and the contact with the rest of the wildlife humankind still hasn´t exterminated are increasing and these 4 stories are just a tiny part of the possible ways it could happen, such as lab accidents, biological warfare secretly used in real life (harming the population of an enemy state without being detected), and the human factor of someone, let´s say a diplomat, billionaire, or a leading scientist, in a biohazard level 4 lab, becoming insane or extremist without others recognizing it and going on her/his last world cruise while seeding the pandemic.  Heck, it would already be enough if she/he just infects himself and walks around in the neuralgic points of a megacity such as airports, shopping centers, train stations, metro, and the one or other huge event, having used a genetically modified strain of a smallpox measles flu plague Eastern equine encephalitis SARS rabies ebola HIV hybrid with an extra long incubation period while already being infected, giving himself doses of a cure or too small shots of a vaccine (I absolutely don´t know if this is possible) that don´t kill the virus, but keep him contagious without showing symptoms for weeks or even month. Because nobody knows the DNA of the virus, it´s undetectable and because it´s flu season, nobody is alarmed about more and more cases that are engineered to have exactly the common cold and flu symptoms before killing everyone infected. If tech is far enough advanced in 10, 100, or 1000 years, I would deem nothing impossible anymore. We don´t have exact knowledge about the microbiological abilities of smallpox as there is no official research possible outside the Russian and US military, euphemistically called research, labs, except infection and replication rates extrapolated from old data, and measles is the closest real life example of immense destructive strength and potential. The best real life example are elevators, toilets, any small closed room with relatively less air circulation ( or air circulation, without filters because they would cost money, spreading it everywhere) where a person with measles could still passively and indirectly infect persons who enter the rooms up to half an hour after leaving thanks to the extremely high developed ability of measles to stay alive in the air. The only advantage is that ebola can´t spread like measles or influenza, but has the same extreme fatality as smallpox and biological warfare could do nothing more effective than creating an ebola smallpox measles, etc. hybrid that mutates so quickly that finding a vaccination is impossible.

Also, you may feel compelled to go out and purchase your own HAZMAT suit. Try not to read this book before bed. It may cause some unsettling dreams. Like... dreams about your internal organs liquifying and bleeding out of your eyeballs. I don't know, I found that kind of unsettling. This book has singlehandedly accomplished my vow to never visit Africa. Mostly because Africa is a giant continent filled with monkey pox and malarial insects. Does that make me a big namby pamby puddin head? That's okay. I'm comfortable with that. I'm fine with staying places on the globe where I'm less likely to scrape my hand on bat guano and die a horrible, convulsive, putrifying death 36 hours later. I'm funny that way.Also, in combination with the book 'The Coming Plague' by Laurie Garrett, with reading this I became convinced that our destruction as a species will come not at the tragedy of nuclear annihilation, which I had feared my entire conscious life... but instead through tiny, virulent microorganisms which will become eternally mutating flesh-eating death machines, ripping through our communities until there's nothing left but rotting jelly. I have felt much more relaxed about life since then.Pass the echinacea."

7,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez,3,"The first thing to know about The Hot Zone, the 1995 bestseller by Richard Preston, is that it is not a romance novel. While men, women, exotic getaways and showers are involved, they're not the type that would cue Sade on the soundtrack. The book is based on an article by Preston published by the New Yorker in 1992 as ""Crisis in the Hot Zone"" but by trying to hit two targets--journalism and the thriller/suspense genre--it misses both. The rudimentary style of Preston's writing dispels the material as satisfying non-fiction, while the lack of a strong central character or narrative limit it as a yarn.The material concerns the discovery of the Ebola virus in western Kenya in 1980 and efforts by the U.S. Army to neutralize it when the virus is discovered in a Reston, Virginia animal facility in November 1989. With a 90% fatality rate and no vaccine, meetings between Ebola virus and human beings proceed along the same lines as Jack the Ripper and his victims. The first half of the book sets up the infant rampages of Ebola in central Africa, documenting its effect on human beings and an averted outbreak in Kinsasha, while the second half of the book details the Army's hunt when the killer has the audacity to surface in the U.S.If the book has central characters, they'd be U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Nancy Jaax and her husband, Colonel Gerald ""Jerry"" Jaax, veterinary pathologists with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Derrick, Maryland. The Jaaxes treat service dogs and every other animal working for the Army (alas, Preston doesn't specify what the Army uses mules or rabbits for). The couple have three children, four dogs and a parrot. While Jerry has worked with monkeys, which can be dangerous and infectious, his wife has experience handling Ebola, putting her on par with a spearfisherman who has experience diving with great white sharks. When you begin working with biological agents, the Army starts you in Biosafety Level 2, and then you move up to Level 3. You don't go into Level 4 until you have a lot of experience, and the Army may never allow you to work there. In order to work in the lower levels, you must have a number of vaccinations. Nancy had vaccinations for yellow fever, Q fever, Rift Valley fever, the VEE, EEE, and WEE complex (brain viruses that live in horses), and tularemia, anthrax, and botulism. And, of course, she had had a series of shots for rabies, since she was a veterinarian. Her immune system reacted badly to all the shots; they made her sick. The Army therefore yanked her out of the vaccination program. At this point, Nancy Jaax was essentially washed up. She couldn't proceed with any kind of work with Level 3 agents, because she couldn't tolerate the vaccinations. There was only one way she could continue working with dangerous infectious agents. She had to get herself assigned to work in a space suit in Level 4 areas. There aren't any vaccines for Level 4 hot agents. A Level 4 hot agent is a lethal virus for which there is no vaccine and no cure.Another adversary of Ebola is Eugene Johnson, a civilian virus hunter contracted by the Army. In the spring of 1988, when a ten-year-old Danish boy visiting his parents in Kenya dies of a Level 4 hot agent known as Marburg virus, Johnson tracks the killer to Kitnum Cave in Mount Elgon in western Kenya, but his expedition is unable to isolate the virus, explain its origins or develop a vaccine. Peter Jahrling is a civilian virologist also employed by the Army who along with an eighteen year old intern named Tom Geisbert (who's an ace with an electron microscope) inhales tissue samples later testing positive for Ebola, putting both men on a self-imposed death watch.Ebola's predatory attacks on human beings in central Africa are like murder scenes. The onset of Ebola virus is a throbbing headache that typically occurs on the seventh day of incubation. Fever and nausea come next, with victims expelling a cocktail of tarry granules and red arterial blood known as ""black vomit."" Speckles break out all over the body and expand into bruises. The liver, kidneys, lungs, hands and feet become jammed with blood clots. Victims turn into passive automatons. Walking dead. They then hemorrhage in violent epileptic fits the Army calls ""crashing and bleeding out,"" Ebola's program for transmitting to a fresh host through infected blood.One of the hosts is a twenty-year old who Preston calls ""Nurse Mayinga."" She's infected at Ngaliema Hospital in Kinshasa in September 1976 caring for a nun stricken with an Ebola-like replicating agent. As she develops symptoms, Nurse Mayinga fears that her scholarship to study in Europe might be revoked. Rather than seek treatment, the nurse wanders the city of two million, setting up a species-threatening event. As news breaks out, President Mobutu, the notorious ruler of Zaire, dispatches his armed forces to quarantine the hospital and blockade the rural areas where infected have been reported. Through no effort by the regime, Ebola mysteriously fails to replicate and disappears.Preston visits with Karl Johnson, a retired C.D.C. doctor and one of Ebola's discoverers who was dispatched to Zaire in 1976. They discuss scenarios like the one introduced by Nurse Mayinga.""Are you worried about a species-threatening event?""He stared at me. ""What the hell do you mean by that?""""I mean a virus that wipes us out.""""Well, I think it could happen. Certainly it hasn't happened yet. I'm not worried. More likely it would be a virus that reduces us by some percentage. By thirty percent. By ninety percent.""""Nine out of ten humans killed? And you're not bothered.""A look of mysterious thoughtfulness crossed his face. ""A virus can be useful to a species by thinning us out,"" he said.On Wednesday, October 4, 1989, a shipment of one hundred wild monkeys from the Philippines arrive at Hazelton Research Products in Reston, Virginia. To prevent the spread of infectious disease, federal regulations require imported monkeys be quarantined for one month before being shipped elsewhere. Over three weeks, twenty-nine quarantined monkeys die in one room at the monkey house. Dan Dalgard, the consulting veterinarian, suspects SHF (simian hemorrhagic fever) which is deadly to monkeys but harmless to humans. Dalgard conducts autopsies and ships samples to USAMRIID at Fort Derrick.Armed with electron microscope photographs by intern Tom Geisbert, civilian virologist Peter Jahrling alerts his superior, Colonel Clarence James Peters, that they may have a filovirus outside Washington D.C. Fearing that Peters could quarantine both him and Geisbert in a biocontainment hospital known as the Slammer for thirty days over what could be nothing, Jahrling neglects to report that they handled and inhaled the Reston samples. They decide to test their own blood and self-monitor. Using a blood sample collected from Nurse Mayinga, Jahrling's analysis concludes that the Reston monkeys are infected with Ebola.Jahrling's analysis races up the chain of command. Among the experts assembled, Col. Peters invites Lt. Col. Nancy Jaax. Her work with Ebola leads her to believe that the virus can be infectious by air, enabling it to ""nuke"" an entire building should it get into an HVAC system. She also believes that even if Ebola is quarantined in the Reston monkey house, it won't stay there long. Col. Peters chooses Nancy's husband, Col. Jerry Jaax to lead a team of soldiers and civilians into the monkey house to euthanize the animals caged in the building. The Army had never mobilized a major field operation against a hot virus before.Obviously there were legal questions here. Lawyers were going to have to be consulted. Was this legal? Could the Army simply put together a biohazard SWAT team and move in on the monkey house? General Russell was afraid the Army's lawyers would tell him that it could not, and should not, be done, so he answered the legal doubts with these words: ""A policy of moving out and doing it, and asking forgiveness afterward, is much better than a policy of asking permission and having it denied. You never ask a lawyer for permission to do something. We are going to do the needful, and the lawyers are going to tell us why it's legal.""The Hot Zone (""Crisis in the Hot Zone"" would've been a superior title for the book) has the makings of a compelling nature run amok thriller. Like Jaws, Ebola is the hunter and we're the prey. Like a shark sighting, an outbreak of Ebola is scary enough to generate a widespread panic. Like the great white in Jaws, the virus is a natural born killer, a prehistoric predator whose hunters both respect and admire it. It does not discriminate, ripping apart a ten-year-old boy cavorting in nature, just like Jaws, and despite the microscopic size of the virus, seems to have the same cunning as the great white.What surprised me about the book was how rudimentary the writing was. I haven't read the article it was based on, but the book is pitched at a much less demanding audience than the average piece in the New Yorker. Preston repeats himself a lot and spares detail, which is rarely an experience I have with the magazine. There's solid character work, but the book takes two hundred pages to establish the Army mission and never locks in around a central character or two. It's as if trying to please everyone, Preston took the weakest elements of non-fiction and genre fiction and muddled them up. I recommend the book for those looking for information on killer viruses and the true life crime story of how an outbreak was averted in the U.S. While a virus doesn't have the cinematic menace of a great white shark, Preston's magazine article did inspire two competing killer virus projects in Hollywood in 1994. An adaptation of his book set to star Robert Redford and Jodie Foster under the direction of Ridley Scott fell apart, due in part to the grim reality that the story ends with the euthanization of hundreds of monkeys. A competing project titled Outbreak with Dustin Hoffman, Rene Russo and Morgan Freeman did make it to the screen in 1995, pumping up and dramatizing the events of Reston with the aid of at least eight different screenwriters."

Tension to the point of nauseating boredom. I think if I didn't hear about what kind of animal the intern likes hunting on the weekend, or what song someone's parrot at home likes to sing, the book would be a good 100pp shorter.-- Oh, and we need the word ""intern"" explained to us.-- I also need to have the concept of an Army ""mission"" explained. ""So when the Army decides it wants to do something, it's called a mission. And the mission has a leader. That leader is called a..."" oh god kill me now.-- Women are supposed to clean up after Thanksgiving.-- When the author discovers a phrase he likes and thinks it is funny, he will use it over and over again, even in inappropriate places.-- When the author thinks his terminology is better than the facts, he'll tell you what the fact is, but that he's just going to keep on calling it his word. Coz. Who needs facts?-- Apparently the author doesn't need facts. As I have now discovered that his account of Ebola is incredibly hyped up, exaggerated and borderline fanciful. Who needs facts when you can have people exploding into puddles of blood! What a waste of my time as that's why I was reading a ""non-fiction"" book on the subject.-- Stephen King is an idiot if he thinks this is the ""One of the most horrifying things I have ever read.""I'm angry. I'm angry and ranty. I feel mislead, manipulated. I was happy to accept that this guy wrote the book 20 years ago, and science hasn't been overly kind to this book. We've learn heaps and it does date the book somewhat. That's fair enough, and also exciting! Look at how much we have learnt and advanced in 20 years!But then, I found out that he is known to have exaggerated not only the effects of the disease, but the specific ""outbreak"" of Ebola he is recounting in the book. Why is this book marketed as non-fiction? It is almost negligent in it's aim to induce panic around Ebola.Do not get me wrong. Ebola is terrifying. It should be contained and treated quickly where it starts, and if we in the Western sphere didn't have our heads so far up our own arses we could have stopped it from getting so big at this point in time. I do not want it, I do not want any one I have ever met to catch it, and I am horrified it's spreading to other continents this week.HOWEVER, the bastard virus is terrifying enough, it doesn't need some dickhead wanting to sell books to make it sound like if you catch it you turn into the Wicked Witch of the West. I do not want ""true"" accounts of ""real"" events packaged to me like a bad American tv drama. Give me the facts, write them in an engaging and interesting way. You'll still sell books. Just maybe not as many to 14 year olds.Look, to be fair, I knew nothing about filoviruses. I had never heard of Marburg. I now have and it has made a lot more sense now when I've reading articles about Ebola in the news. But I am now questioning everything I have learnt through reading this book as I cannot trust this ""knowledge"". I've got the shits as even though it was an easy and accessible read, I cannot stand people lying to me about fucking science. There is one area we do not need any more misinformation and ignorance at the moment and that is in all our sciences. Our science literacy at the moment is dropping at an alarming rate, and books like this are not going to help.Bah. Angry and Ranty.For more reviews visit http://rusalkii.blogspot.com.au/"
9,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5702158-daniel-bastian,4,"The subtitle for Richard Preston's 1994 bestseller reads: ""The Terrifying True Story of the Origins of the Ebola Virus."" How much you enjoy The Hot Zone might just hinge on what you know about Ebola going in and, by extension, how seriously you take that subtitle. To say that Preston took artistic liberties is akin to saying Ayn Rand held only a little contempt for Marxism or that Memento had a tendency to confuse its viewers. There can be no doubt that Preston delivered a vivid and hair-raising thrill ride, a marvelously written if unevenly paced house of horrors, but on balance his book is about as accurate as a Stone age slide rule. It might have passed for harmless over-sensationalizing, except with the Ebola epidemic in-progress and tensions wound tighter than ever, the book has become the bane of disease experts and science communicators working to tamp down the mass hysteria. In this case, thankfully, the truth isn't scarier than fiction.The book is structured around four events: our first contact in the 1960s with Marburg virus (MARV)—a close cousin to Ebola—named for the German city in which it was discovered; the earliest recorded outbreak of Ebola Zaire (EBOZ) in Sudan and DRC (formerly Zaire) in 1976; the 1989 outbreak of Reston virus (RESTV) in Northern Virginia; and the final act sees Preston donning a biocontainment suit for a solo jaunt in a sub-Saharan cave in search of the cagey killer.Preston needs only the space of a few pages to subdue the reader into a state of trepidation. I was spooked almost immediately, even knowing it was all a bit light on fact. The characters, many of whom are given fictitious names, have blood spurting from every orifice, their insides ""liquefying,"" and at one point we read of a nurse ""weeping tears of blood."" Such descriptions seem to have more in common with the active imagination that goes hand in hand with storytelling than with any viral agent identified to date. Preston himself concedes as much in a NY Times interview last month: ""That almost certainly didn’t happen.""OK. So there's some exaggeration here and some embellishment there and the 3.5 million copies sold is probably responsible for some of the stateside hysteria. But let's not point too much of the blame in one direction. An invisible pest that moves from person to person and leaves a high mortality rate in its wake is bound to generate a level of fear, with or without The Hot Zone. And when you combine the low science literacy rates in America with its media's penchant for doom-mongering and narcissistic over-commentary, some version of collective psychosis is all but inevitable. Of course, the recent outbreak has sparked renewed interest in the book, and its infidelity to fact doesn't help the situation.In an effort to defuse some of this noise, let's get to know the real Ebola virus, at least what we've gleaned so far. First, some perspective. Yes, Ebola is deadly, and international aid groups should be throwing everything they've got at curbing this latest and greatest outbreak. As of 14 November 2014, there have been more than 14,000 reported cases and over 5,000 confirmed deaths (WHO updates this page weekly) since it emerged in Guinea one year ago. But as a matter of pure numbers, Ebola is a minor player on the pathogen roster. Compare those figures with seasonal flu—the reason many of your coworkers have been calling in sick recently—which infects hundreds of millions and causes 250-500,000 deaths every year (including 20,000 in the U.S. alone). Or norovirus, which infects 267 million people and kills 200,000 annually. Hepatitis C is a virus that currently infects 150 million people worldwide, while malaria kills more than 600,000 a year, or about 68 people per hour. Even rabies accounts for a steady 69,000 deaths per year. Any fear you might have of Ebola should be calibrated against the numbers, which tell us that we're far more likely to die from lightning, a car accident or a plane crash than we are from Ebola.Much of that has to do with Ebola's method of transmission. Contrary to what Preston repeatedly suggests in The Hot Zone, Ebola is not transmitted through the air or by respiratory secretions (i.e., coughing or sneezing), unlike influenza or SARS. Ebola can only be transmitted by direct physical contact with the blood, vomit or feces of an infected person. A cough or a sneeze from an Ebola host doesn't contain high enough concentrations of the virus to infect someone nearby because Ebola doesn't aerosolize in the way its airborne counterparts do. This explains why the reports keep flowing in of infected healthcare workers; they are at the highest risk of infection because they're the ones working with the patients after the incubation period is over and symptoms have surfaced. So unless you find yourself in contact with any of these three fluids of an Ebola victim, you have little to worry about.Many have frowned on science for not having a vaccine ready by the truckloads. This may sound brusque, but given the differential threat of the other viruses mentioned above, Ebola isn't a top priority. We've seen a total of 32 outbreaks over the last 40 years, and yet none have secured a lasting foothold in humans. In contrast, flu and malaria are perennial killers of titanic proportions. Moreover, vaccines and antivirals (like the experimental ZMapp, which co-opts tobacco plants to clone antibodies derived from mice) are painstakingly difficult and costly to produce and must be adapted to the rapid pace of evolution. In the triage of epidemiological exigency, Ebola's sporadic presence and short-fused temperament simply rank lower next to many other human scourges.Its tendency to play hopscotch with the human race is also why there is much we still don't know about Ebola. As Level 4 contagions go, it is deceptively simple. Were you to ogle it under a microscope, you'd see a single strand of RNA that codes for a mere seven proteins, one of which—VP24—has been identified as the key facilitator for disrupting the cell signaling processes involved in immune response. With the key communication lines cut, Ebola is allowed free rein and overwhelms the host system before antiviral reinforcements have time to interfere.The biochemistry is less opaque than Ebola's origins, however. One of the finer points we've yet to work out is zoonotic provenance: in which species did Ebola first arise, and from which host population did it make the jump to us? Was it in the direction of apes-to-humans like HIV, or did it spill over from some other creature whose environment overlaps with ours? The favored culprit is Egyptian fruit bats, which are known to carry not only the sister virus Marburg but antibodies to Ebola. Even so, it could lurk elsewhere in the wild, biding its time until local conditions pave the way for its reemergence. Learning how pathogens jump from one species to another is vitally important to preventing future outbreaks and is a hot topic among research communities today.Closing ThoughtsMuch like this review, the central character of Preston's fan favorite is the omnipresent virus. The human characters in the book are poorly developed and ultimately forgettable backdrops which fade in and out as Preston heightens the drama around his lurid replicator—that ""nonhuman other"" for which he prowls in Kitum Cave. You'll get a few interesting bits about life inside a biosafety facility, but for the most part any factual profile on Ebola is swallowed whole by the embroidery and myriad grotesqueries sprinkled in at the expense of navigating a more careful line between fiction and reality. Take The Hot Zone for what it is: a high-speed medical-mystery thriller meant to make you tremble at the raw power of nature. ""In a sense, the earth is mounting an immune response against the human species. It is beginning to react to the human parasite, the flooding infection of people, the dead spots of concrete all over the planet, the cancerous rot-outs in Europe, Japan, and the United States, thick with replicating primates, the colonies enlarging and spreading and threatening to shock the biosphere with mass extinctions. Perhaps the biosphere does not ""like"" the idea of five billion humans. Or it could also be said that the extreme amplification of the human race...has suddenly produced a very large quantity of meat, which is sitting everywhere in the biosphere and may not be able to defend itself against a life form that might want to consume it. Nature has interesting ways of balancing itself."" (pp. 310-311)Note: This review is republished from my official website. Click through for additional footnotes and imagery."

I remember hearing jokes about Kitum Cave and bat feces and the monkey house, and I even saw the movie ""Outbreak,"" which was loosely inspired by this book.But it took the world turning into an actual hot zone for me to commit to reading it, which has that punchy, hyped-up narrative non-fiction writing style that was popular a quarter of a century ago. The author wrote the book based on interviews with participants who were involved in a deadly viral outbreak in Reston, Virginia, in 1989. It's a fascinating story, and it also helped me understand the more recent ebola outbreak.I did appreciate learning more about these fatal viruses, and overall enjoyed listening to the book. However, the phrase ""hot zone"" was overused, and it didn't help that the audiobook narrator really liked to punch up his delivery on those lines. ""The hospital was a HOT ZONE."" ""The lab was now a HOT ZONE."" ""The monkey house was a HOT ZONE."" I get it already, it's the title of the book.In the end, I would recommend the book because of the good storytelling and how informative it is.

At the point where Monet starts to literally disintegrate on his plane trip, I got a kind of anxiety attack and had to stop reading. :(...so... it looks like I might literally not be able to read this book... UPDATE:I did it! ..and Preston did apparently later admit that he had slightly exaggerated here and there. I must admit that I found his visit to Kitum cave, towards the end of the book, to be a spot of melodrama, as was quite a bit of the rest of book, interspersed with unnecessary filler.I did find it very interesting indeed to read about the research and how virologists work.As a whole I found the book pretty readable when it wasn't scaring me out of my wits, so 3 and a half stars it gets. Since the book is quite dated by now, it is worthwhile reading Preston's update on the latest developments pointed to in the thread below by Sarah.Friends Sarah and Ted have both mentioned the aforementioned New Yorker article by Preston, and I myself am very impressed with it, so I'm going to link to it in the review itself; it is here: http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/201...What tends to impress me about Preston is that he goes to a lot of trouble with his research, and he then presents it in a form that is easy to understand for the most ignorant of laymen. On the other hand, one of the problems I have with him is that he can become a tad melodramatic which can be irritating when overdone, but in general, the way that he builds tension into his reportage does make for quite gripping reading."

A must read for anyone interested in potential biological time bombs.10/19/14 - I know, hardly a review at all. I was not writing reviews back then. But Richard Preston was interviewed by Alexandra Alter for the NY Times this week and it seems a particularly worthwhile read, given the content of the book and the current hysteria. Updating a Chronicle of Suffering: Author of ‘The Hot Zone’ Tracks Ebola’s Evolution "
14,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"If you suspect that you are not adequately scared of infectious diseases, I can heartily recommend this book to you.The Hot Zone opens with a description of what the Marburg virus (a member of the Ebola family) does to your body; and I can say, with confidence, that it is one of the most disgusting things I have ever read. After telling the story of a small outbreak in Kenya (which could be traced to Kitum Cave in the shadow of Mount Elgon), the narrative shifts to Reston, Virginia, where research monkeys began to die of a strange disease in 1989. The army identified it as Ebola, or something very much like Ebola, and went into action to put down the monkeys and disinfect the area.The emergency turned out to be something of a false alarm, since this virus—now called the Reston virus, closely related to Ebola—appeared harmless to humans. However, the Reston virus is still frightening, if only as a sign of what is possible. For it has a mortality as high as Ebola in monkeys (over 90%) and it can be transmitted through the air. The disease spread throughout the entire research compound, even though the monkeys were housed in different rooms, in individual cages. Obviously, if such a virus arose in humans, we would be in for a rough time. The book ends with a description of Preston’s own voyage to Kitum Cave, the source of one outbreak. He gives a vivid account of the many different species of animals that inhabit the cave, any one of which could have been the virus’s original host. (Since then, we have detected the Marburg virus in bat guano.) The more general point is that the animal world is full of germs, some of them potentially devastating. AIDS crossed over into humans in the same region, a disease that has claimed many millions of lives. What else is out there waiting for us? This book is written as a thriller—fast, easy, exhilarating—and so it does lack some depth and analysis that I had hoped to find. But Preston’s warning about Ebola proved prescient: the disease did return, and perhaps it will again."
15,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42292-christine,5,"I could say that this book changed my life. I could say that, although it's not quite true as I haven't passed my MCATs yet. But the study of disease and populations and epidemics was brought to a head the first time I read this book around 2003 (I think). Now with the H5N1 poised to jump species and AIDS still an ongoing problem and globalization, environmental and water shortages are present-day issues I think that it would be crazy to think that viruses vs. people is over. However I don't think it's crazy that the ""winner"" of viruses vs. people is a foregone conclusion. As for the book, it's pretty gripping. There's enough ""hard"" science to keep you understanding everything but told in an explanatory, easy to digest way. The people are painted richly for a book type of this, not as characters but profiles and even if you already know the outcome of the Reston incident there are moments you can still be on the edge of your seat. "
16,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,4,"*spoiler alert* This is a good chronology of the outbreak of Ebola Reston among monkeys in Virginia in the late 1980s. (Did not affect humans, although other strains of Ebola do.) There are points where it is very deliberately-paced and other points where it Preston is graphic (readers are warned) about the devastation Ebola wreaks on people. Because of its timing the author also made many parallels with AIDS. The end of the book kind of blames overpopulation, but in fact, much smaller populations of the Earth's people have been affected by plagues for millennia.The book is useful as a timeline but of course doesn't cover the current coronavirus outbreak (every reader will say ""Don't go in that bat cave"") or even the cases of Ebola that occurred more recently in the U.S. The concerns about lethality and particularly about whether or not a virus is airborne will be familiar to anyone who has followed the recent news."
17,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2741932-tiffany,5,"Oh, my. What a terrifying book.The Hot Zone documents the journey of filoviruses in the human race. Specifically, this book documents the time when Ebola snuck its way into Washington DC. Ebola is a highly contagious virus that slowly turns your body to mush. First you have a headache. Then your face freezes into a mask. You bleed from every pore. Essentially, Ebola liquefies people. Let me be the first one to say that this book scares me in the most fascinating way. I was like, wait. How can a microscopic thing kill people so savagely and efficiently? And how come we don't know enough about it?I don't know what to say. This book just made me so aware of everything. It gave me a new perspective on how I see the world. I didn't have to follow the book word by word, and it still managed to either fascinate or terrify me for the entirety of the book (which is no small feat).And all I mean to say by that rambling is: ""Scarier than fiction,"" indeed. "
18,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1788674-jill,3,"Since March 2014 an epidemic of Ebola virus—specifically the Ebola Zaire strain—has been ravaging West Africa. More than 800 people in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have died so far. Here’s what Richard Preston has to say about Ebola Zaire in The Hot Zone:
It attacks connective tissue with particular ferocity; it multiples in collagen, the chief constituent protein of the tissue that holds the organs together. In this way, collagen in the body turns to mush, and the underlayers of the skin die and liquefy. The skin bubbles up into a sea of tiny white blisters mixed with red spots known as a maculopapular rash. Spontaneous rips appear in the skin, and hemorrhagic blood pours from the rips. The red spots on the skin grow and spread and merge to become huge, spontaneous bruises, and the skin goes soft and pulpy, and can tear off if it is touched with any kind of pressure. Your mouth bleeds, and you bleed around your teeth, and you may have hemorrhages from the salivary glands—literally every opening in the body bleeds, no matter how small. The surface of the tongue turns brilliant red and then sloughs off, and is swallowed or spat out. It is said to be extraordinarily painful to lose the surface of one’s tongue. The tongue’s skin may be torn off during rushes of the black vomit. The back of the throat and the lining of the windpipe may also slough off, and the dead tissue slides down the windpipe into the lungs or is coughed up with sputum. Your heart bleeds into itself; the heart muscle softens and has hemorrhages into its chambers, and blood squeezes out of the heart muscle as the heart beats, and it floods the chest cavity. The brain becomes clogged with dead blood cells, a condition known as sludging of the brain. Ebola attacks the lining of the eyeball, and the eyeballs may fill up with blood: you may go blind. Droplets of blood stand out on the eyelids: you may weep blood. The blood runs from your eyes down your cheeks and refuses to coagulate…
 Preston continues in this manner for two more pages, describing clinically and carefully the devastation of a body wracked with Ebola. I will spare you most of the gory details but in The Hot Zone Preston doesn’t, so now I know this: Ebola Zaire ends with complete body liquefaction. I also know this: in one hospital room where a patient died from the virus, every surface in the room—walls, bed, floor—was covered with blood, which, of course, was covered in hundreds of millions of festering Ebola virus, waiting to hop to the next living host. This detailed look into Ebola inspires extreme reactions. I was awed. Terrified, undoubtedly. And, strangely, impressed, intoxicated by the beauty of such a deadly thing. Preston and some of the medical researchers he profiles are entranced by Ebola, obsessed by the “gorgeous” threadlike structure of the virus, its incredible simplicity and single-minded destruction. Can something that rips the skin, sludges the brain, sloughs off the intestines and tongues, hardens the spleen, mashes the liver, and stops the heart truly be beautiful? I guess it depends on whether you’re reading about it or whether you’re suffering from it. Preston loses his way at the midpoint of the book when he leaves Africa for Washington D.C., where a facility of lab monkeys start dying from another strain of the Ebola virus. The second half of the book is devoted to the military mission to contain this virus. It’s not terribly exciting. The strain found near D.C. is the Ebola Reston virus, which is a boring or “ugly” strain, being non-pathological in humans. Preventing an outbreak of Ebola Reston involves a lot of businesslike meetings discussing mission protocol and a lot of Hazmat suits. Preston also breaks the rules of nonfiction writing in this section, opting to write it like a piece of horror fiction instead of reporting the facts. Several times he includes pages of exposition where a scientist accidentally exposes himself to the virus, only to…not contract the virus. Here, it’s almost as if he realizes the staunched possibility of an American Ebola outbreak is rather dull, so he must create storylines even where there are none.Regardless, The Hot Zone is impressive mostly because Ebola itself is so impressive. Beautiful or not, it is a single strand of RNA that codes for a mere seven proteins that can, in the worst ever outbreak, kill 90% of those infected. We are fairly powerless against it. There is no vaccine. We’re not even sure where it comes from, though fruit bats are suspected to be the natural host. I think that in a cruel, sadomasochistic way, we humans—only those safely away from the African rainforest, curled up reading on their couches—like to be reminded that for all our complexity, for all our medicines and computers and precautions, there are still things that we cannot control, things that, rather, can possess our cells to control and destroy us. "
19,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"Richard Preston begins his story with an apocalyptic epigraph and ends with a metaphoric elegy. It's an effective literary device underscoring the necessity of placing this primal, elusive and deadly virus in a broader context, a context that incorporates historical and ecological considerations.Ebola is a deceptively simple life form. It is a filovirus made up of seven proteins. The subtypes that are known to affect humans are Marburg, Ebola Zaire, and Ebola Sudan. No one knows how the virus is transmitted, or what species serve as intermediary hosts. In humans the initial symptoms resemble the flu. Headache, muscle and joint pain, and fever are the first indications. The difficulty in early diagnosis of the disease is another problem. Many of the initial symptoms resemble malaria. Yet, the chance of a favorable outcome as well as containment depends on the earliest possible diagnosis. Preston begins his story at Kitum Cave, beneath Mt. Elgon which straddles the border between Uganda and Kenya. There are stories of native villages in the 1960's located on the north side of Mt. Elgon having been afflicted with a nameless disease with Ebola-like symptoms. In 1980 a French expatriot died from the Marburg strain. In 1987 a teen-aged boy visiting his parents in Africa died of the same strain. The two victims had only one thing in common — both had been inside of Kitum Cave a scant few days before presenting with the first symptoms. Preston provides a carefully researched account of Ebola between 1961 and 1993. The book's introductory pages resemble the ominous series of warnings and protocols for accessing a Level 4 Hot Zone lab. This is the world of Nancy Jaax, a Level 4 U.S. Army veterinary pathologist. Preston's detailed profile of her immerses the reader in her thought processes. He describes the feel of wearing the space suit needed to work in a Level 4 lab. He describes the hyper-vigilance needed to perform a hot lab dissection. One can only admire the incredible self-discipline and emotional grit she brings to the task.During the course of a mysterious outbreak among monkeys imported for medical research in 1989, he delineates the complex interplay of overlapping jurisdictions in a biocontainment operation. In addition to the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRID) that employs Nancy Jaax and her husband, the CDC, state and county health officials share both responsibilities and liabilities while deflecting media attention that might lead to panic. It is no surprise that personal antagonisms surface during such a crisis. Here, again, Preston brings various players to life. Gene Johnson, a civilian USAMRID researcher, had confirmed one of the fatal cases as Marburg, and conducted a detailed exploration of Kitum Cave in 1987. Joe McCormick is with the CDC and spent time in a hut full of Ebola-stricken African villagers without becoming infected. Both men are highly respected and experienced researchers with conflicting views on how the operation should be managed.The final chapter chronicles the journey Preston makes to Kitum Cave. He paints a picture of vast space, muted swatches of color and ancient clay and stone. “The mountain seemed like an empty cathedral. I tried to imagine what it must have been like when herds of elephants could have been seen moving through a forest of podo trees as large as sequoias: only ten years ago, before the trouble, Mount Elgon had been one of the earth's crown jewels.”Preston is a forceful writer. His prose is compelling. His characters are vividly drawn. Much of the story reads like a medical thriller. These are the qualities that made the book exciting. However, it should be noted that knowledgeable critics have claimed that his descriptions of the disease are exaggerated (see websites in NOTES). There are also passages in the description of Ebola Reston which suggest that the disease can be airborne, another assertion that has been disputed. These criticisms are problematic. Does the author stray too far from the facts in his attempt to tell a riveting story? Does this book contribute to the kind of mindless panic that the Reston biocontainment team feared when they diverted media attention from the site? I found the book thought-provoking. I liked Preston's attempt to contextualize not only Ebola, but other evolving viruses. It's the kind of emotion-packed story that will encourage readers to view the topic with fresh interest. It should not, however, be taken as an authoritative text on Ebola.NOTEShttp://io9.com/how-the-hot-zone-creat...http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda...http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/boo... "
20,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21372390-wayne-barrett,5,"I put this book on my list about a year ago because I had seen it on a list of what was considered the top scariest novels. I was surprised to see that it was a non-fiction story, but now that I have read it I must agree that it is one of the most frightening tales I have read. And isn't that usually the case with the true ones anyway?Like most others, I have heard the news concerning major viruses like Ebola and HIV and even the histories of events like the black plague of the Dark Ages, but I have never truly understood what these viruses actually do to an infected host.At the onset of the book, when one of the first victims becomes infected, I was staggered by the description of his symptoms and eventual death. Had I not read it here I think I would not have believed it possible for a humans body to revert to what was described in these pages. I would have truly believed it to be fictional horror.But no, it is real...and it is scarier than hell.I think another layer revealed as the book concluded was the idea that the true virus is us...and that mass casualties resulting from the likes of Ebola are Mother Natures way of combating mass population of a destructive organism...Yep, that would be us human primates. If we don't get our act together soon, Mother Nature will do it for us. She will release one of these deadly agents, and in today's world of mass, rapid transportation, it wouldn't take long for her to cleanse herself. "

The author did an excellent job juggling the scope of the story between the potentially-globe-wide-extinction-level-catastrophe stuff and then the smaller personal scale ""are-we-gonna-die-or-not"" stuff by letting the happenings unfold through the eyes of a handful of different characters who were there for it all. The depth of research is apparent and thorough and while I did feel like I was learning while being entertained it never felt textbook-y or lecture-y or not organic to the overall flow of things. Good fun, if your idea of fun is being scared shit-less by some close calls of some shit that almost went down that if it actually went down we would not be around to read about. Enjoy!"

24,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17825291-katie-ziegler-life-between-words,4,"About the time this book was published, I was in elementary school and first learning about Ebola. I have no memory of *where* I heard about Ebola. Was it a science textbook? The news? Who knows. All I know is that it left an impression. Mostly the impression that Ebola is probably one of the most unpleasant ways to die. An incurable virus that basically liquifies you from the inside out...ugh. Anyway, I read this book for a readathon, and the prompt was read a book about a childhood fear. CHECK.Well, I'm glad I didn't read this when I was a kid, because Ebola is even more horrifying than my little 12 year old mind could have conceived. It's awful. And this book gets graphic. It's also informative, engaging, and most of all chilling. It didn't help that I was burning up with a fever the majority of the time I was reading the book, but EVEN STILL. You can't help but contemplate the very thin line we tread between the perception of our impenetrable safety and a viral outbreak that has the potential to wipe out humanity. Written narratively, this book maps the first known outbreaks of filoviruses (Ebola and its sisters and cousins). The climax is an outbreak of Ebola on American soil - an occurrence I had no idea ever happened. Either because I was still very young, or because it was kept fairly quiet, I'm not sure? In any event, I know about it now. The last 1/4 of the book slows down significantly, which isn't necessarily a bad thing as that's when you really start to contemplate the implications of what we've learned in the book. However, that does mean it ended a little anticlimactically. If you're really sensitive about animals (the treatment of them, etc.) maybe give this book a pass. Or you're sensitive about really gruesome things in general, be they animal or human. But, if you have a strong stomach (because you'll need it), then this book was great. "
25,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3301814-james,1,"Ebola is a horrific disease and the holocaust such a virus could wreak is terrifying. Books on diseases like this usually conjure up existential dread which sits uncomfortably with the sense that one is gawking at a car crash.This is not one of the books. The first chapter is terrifying, and the story of monkeys imported from the Philippines who developed airborne infective strains could in the hands of a more restrained man have been genuinely sobering. However Mr. Preston is not a restrained man. He has an article to spin out to dramatic lengths, and does so by over egging a topic where further hysteria is not needed. If the man was in charge of an omelette station he would use a catapult and 300 ostrich eggs to make a scramble. There is a lot of scientists describing the cold beauty of the Ebola virus, people pound tables and say things like we must take those monkeys down, they then all get in their cars and tootle off. It all gets very silly indeed reaching the pinnacle when he lays out the idea that such viruses are natures revenge for the destruction of the rain forest. A level of anthropomorphism better suited to Winnie the Pooh. And all wrapped in gore.Which is a shame because there is an interesting story about readiness, ecological disruption and this horrible disease."

It gives a look at filoviruses, their history in human diseases (at least from the time they were recognized into the book's present. We take a look at AIDS but we also look at Ebola.This includes Ebola Reston a mutation of the Ebola virus that became extremely easy to transmit (it is air borne) released in a ""monkey house"" in Reston VA. The saving grace for us (humans) is that it turned out not to be deadly to humans. It did demonstrate the failings in lab safety however as the laboratory animals died one after another.One person realized that to check for a contaminated lab sample he had used his hand to ""waft"" the smell into his nose. Had the air borne virus been deadly to humans he would have been the vector.I'd think the book will give you pause. "

I had heard of Ebola many times but this really brought to home just how horrifying and deadly it really is. The day that virus mutates into an airborne pathogen is the day the human race faces extinction. And if you thought descriptions of the Black Plague were bad you ain't seen nothing yet. Death by filovirus would have to be one of the worst ways to go. Your body literally liquifies while you are still alive. Blood pours from every orifice. Every organ fails and half of them pass out of your body before you're gone. You end up a mess of slime and bone.We have close many times and it's getting more likely that we will soon face a serious pandemic. Let's just hope it's not something with a mortality rate like Ebola Zaire.

I never heard the first few minutes of any read nor all of that days reading. I thought I was hearing the latest Michael Crichton medical thriller. The parts I got to hear gave me far more chills than Andromeda Strain. My thing about science fiction is that I have to know how the monster is slain and how the good guys win. Still thinking it was fiction and by the wrong author, I spent years looking for copies of this book. Then I got all my misapprehensions corrected. I got and read a copy. Realizing it was not fiction, I read the scariest book. This was before many people had heard the word Ebola and before the nearly annual outbreaks including the recent one that brought a few cases to America. Yes this is history written in the style of journalism and therefor for popular consumption. But the reviewers who try to score it against some kind of technical or strict science bases are missing the point.Ebola is for real scary stuff. It is a horrible way to die and compared with even other fatal diseases it is hard to describe without being dramatic. As thrilling as the novel Andromeda Strain was- knowing what Ebola can and does do, and what extremes are necessary to study it make for way more than edge of the seat reading. The monster has not been slain and the good guys at best can regain some control.Otherwise well-meaning people; people smart enough to know that what was killing their monkeys in Reston, Virginia was serious, almost caused an outbreak in and around Washington DC. That is a simple statement and around it revolves the larger story.Mr. Preston has written the facts and with them comes drama. He style is not detached but it is what it needs to be to tell a story that- well take your pick, scares the willies outta ya, or reminds you to be humble in the face of what nature, bloody in tooth and claw and virus can do to mere humans."

30,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-leanne-geezermom,5,"UPDATE Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, a group of friends read this outstanding and terrifying work of nonfiction in March of 2020. Of course, I re-read it with them! It is obviously far more meaningful now in 2020 than it ever was before, but it will also hit you with how much governmental response to the risk of contagious illnesses has NOT changed since this real world incident occurred.Read this for the crystalline caves, mummified baby elephants if nothing else. Richard Preston is one of the few writers of nonfiction that tell their factual stories as if they were fairy tales. Dark ones. This guy could give Eric Larson a run for his money, he is that good._________________________If you have not watched the new National Geographic Channel mini series with Julianne Margueles (and the actors who played ""Davos"" from Game of Thrones plus ""Stan"" from The Americans), you have GOT to see it. The series is based off of just one section of this outstanding book. I read this terrifying and mesmerizing work of nonfiction the same year it was published and have never seen outbreaks of the flu the same way. The book is a collection of close calls with horrendous hemorrhagic fevers that have wiped out thousands overseas and come close to screaming through suburban USA. When the huge outbreak of Ebola hit various countries in western African in 2014, you'll remember that a man flew here without any signs of illness but became sick in Dallas. He died in hospital of Ebola, and two nurses were infected from caring for him. More infected health care workers flew home to the US, and most were saved. At least one worker, exposed but supposedly not ill, refused to be kept in quarantine.Having read this 20 years prior, I was FREAKED out. Ebola Zaire liquefies your entire body - you secrete blood from your orifices, vomit up blackened blood until you dry heave. The pain is like breaking bones. Pregnant women suddenly discharge liquefied babies. The muscles of your face dissolve so your skin just hangs like a mask. Your brain cells hemorrhage so you are no longer you - your brain stem keeps you alive, but you are in effect a zombie heaving up blood and stomach lining, sloughing off your intestines in your bloody mess of stool. This is real!Preston is a terrific writer who takes factual information and swirls it into the mind of the reader like a drop of infected blood, hot and loaded with virus, plopping into the bloodstream. From stories of giant caves where elephants chew on salt deposits amongst glittering crystals to a hospital where an upper story patient becomes ill from the second hand cigarette smoke puffed out of the room below, blowing up the exterior wall, your mind will boggle.Preston (his brother is that famous writer) also wrote a similar booked called The Demon in the Freezer which floored me. It came out right before 9/11 and was way more scary than terrorists flying planes into buildings. In the hands of maniacs, viruses are far more lethal than just about anything you can think of.Do yourself a sober and scary favor. Check out the National Geographic Channel's series. Better yet, get this highly readable and addictive book. It delivers way more than the series, but will change you forever."
31,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7526630-shelley,0,"I read this book almost 20 years ago, and to this day I still recall the chilling horror the authors predicted stats of what could happen to the worlds population if this disease where to spread beyond the confines of darkest, rural Africa. And now it has. Ebola is fucking real and it is spreading!Palestine, Israel, Russia, Ukraine, USA, the Taliban and whoever else is warring over petty shit, like land, religion or honor, killing innocents in the name of what-the-fuck-ever need to turn the other cheek and face the real cataclysmic threat facing them and their families along with the rest of the world. Ebola will not care who you are, what you are, or who your God is. It kills in the worst way, end of. If you believe the very plausible stats within this book you will realise that we are on the precipice of an apocalyptic population decimation if Ebola continues to spread like it is. All it takes is one infected person to board a plane to a major airport and it's done. We are done. Perhaps it's the way the author describes how it will happen that reads like a fiction story made more frightening by the fact that it's not. It's more than terrifying.Read this book and any others you can find about this disease and arm yourselves with the little bit of knowledge that there is about it. There is no cure. There is no knowledge, only speculation - and that after 20 years of research - of where this disease comes from. I for one am terrified! I do not want to bleed out of my pores and every orifice or know what it feels like to have my organs melt. Or to watch my children suffer and die thank you very fucking much! But the rest of the world don't seem to be too bothered right now. Sure, there are Cobra meetings about containment and such but seriously, a bad strain of the flu gets more coverage than this and I have to wonder why. The avoidance of mass hysteria perhaps? I urge everyone to arm themselves with knowledge as that is the very least we can do. That, and buy a hazmat suit and perhaps move to the outer fucking Hebrides. Good Luck! "
32,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67934812-alice,3,"3.5*It was ok. The ending was kind of a twist. I kind of got bored of Ebola after awhile. Ebola is a filovirus. It causes blood clots then fucks up the organs. It was kind of hard to enjoy this book when I keep hearing how inaccurate it is (over dramatized) and then in real life this guy I work with who is a scientist says he has read the book and it's not really realistic.I feel like this book is ""entertaining for non-fiction"". Also I think this book would be a lot of fun for people who are super visual readers and see scenarios clearly in their head. A lot of this book is people/monkeys getting fucked up by Ebola OR being in constant anticipation of being fucked up by Ebola. I don't feel like I learned a lot, but I did learn the basics of Ebola. See this is where the fun is ruined for me. I don't know how much I learned is true. The science in this book is very easy to understand. Much easier than a Wikipedia page.This is kinda random, but I like HIV more? So every once in a while there's a comparison between HIV and Ebola brought up because they emerged at around the same time. Pretty much Ebola is really crazy and HIV is also just as bad but in a less crazy way? I just love the concept of HIV more. So it's willing to very slowly kill the person, but have a guaranteed kill and I love that. The worst strain of Ebola is Zaire and it's a 9/10 shot, but after it went on it's rampage it faded back into the background.All throughout the story one of the big sources of Ebola that transferred to humans came from monkeys. So while I was discussing this book with people I was thinking about Curious George and what if The Man with the Yellow Hat brought him to America with Ebola. So Curious George would just show up in America and start wiping people out and it would be crazy. A concept.Then someone else suggested that Curious George would more likely have SIV (monkey version of HIV) instead of Ebola and then I thought of another concept where The Man in the Yellow Hat brings Curious George to America, fucks him, and then becomes the guy who originated HIV in humans."

“Sacrificing the monkeys had been a difficult, disgusting, and disheartening task. He knew there was a disease in this room, and yet these monkeys were beautiful, healthy animals, and he had just killed them.” 
 You’re not going to find stories of hundreds of people dying of Ebola, of tense movie drama outbreaks, more like villages in Africa depopulating and Westerners having close calls. The book is about the first research into Ebola.I’ve read several science mass markets that touch on how animals were treated by researchers as meat and machine - not this book.The Hot Zone is a testimonial, a eulogy, to the hundreds of monkeys that died during the research. These were modern doctors, veterinarians, and scientists that could look in an animals eyes and acknowledge pain, fear, and anger. They had heartrending moments, nightmares, and sometimes they couldn’t do it at all.Unlike in Hollywood movies, Ebola researchers don’t describe the virus as a potential species ender, more a “thinning of the herd.” True, possibly necessary, but a despair I doubt I could live through. This book was published in 1995 and Ebola is still here, in Africa (mostly), and angrier than ever."

And with THE Stephen King mentioned that the book gave him the creeps, it really stirred my curiosity.The book is about the reality of discovering viruses (Cue Big Bang Theory theme: Australopithecus would really have been sick of us Debating out while here they're catching deer (we're catching viruses). This tells the story of how scientist was able to discover three of the deadliest viruses that ravaged mankind during the 90s, Ebola and Marburg viruses. Sorry, it's not HIV.""Hot Zone"" detailed the story of some unsung heroes in the battle against these dreaded diseases. How these viruses were discovered, how they were spread, and how the experts were able to control the disease. What made this book scare the crap out of Stephen King is the fact that these things are real. Viruses can be used as weapons in mass destruction, if these viruses fell into the wrong hands. Up to this day, there are still no cure or vaccine to stop Ebola Zaire, Ebola Sudan and Marburg viruses.PS: The book also featured the Philippine Long-tailed macaques who also are carriers of another strain of Ebola, the Reston strain. Need not to worry, it's not fatal, yet."
35,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6017367-j,0,"The Hot Zone is an action packed page turner that leaves you feeling that you actually learned a fairly decent chunk of biology (and you did!). It can be understood from a layman's perspective, which is a beautiful effort in itself given how complex some of the information is. I am giving this book a high rating because of this and how well written it is. However, there are a few small points that I'm not overly fond of. It is written in a fairly confusing style I wanted at first to liken it to the writing of ""The Pushcart War"", a newspaper-y summative. But it's not. The best way I can explain it is that it has an extremely military feel. The details and facts are clearly laid out, but not journalistically as in ""The Pushcart War"". This brief yet thoroughness to the novelization of such a scenario does not lend itself to reading ease, or ""flow"". There is an abruptness which suits the the content, but does not give me a good impression of the writer's capabilities. Secondly, and this is what makes it the best thriller Stephen King has ever read, is the extreme brutal graphic quality of the writing. No details are spared in the description of the capabilities of the viruses described here. To give you an idea: dying in a pool of blood, being liquified from the inside out, itemization of the contents of a victim's vomit. This is not a pretty book. Lending itself to the unattractiveness is the American military conversation. Four letter words, God's name in vain and other profanities are scattered throughout the conversations of those who have to deal with outbreak control.My biology teacher recommended this as extra reading. When I got through the first few chapters I wondered why on earth he did. After finishing the book...yes, I consider this to be a quality use of your time and I would even read it again."
36,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5699299-terri-lynn,5,"I just did a reread of this book as I do from time to time and yes, it is still as scary and gruesome as ever. The scary thing is that it is a true story, a work of nonfiction even though it is written like an exciting novel, and the gruesome part is thinking of the poor victims of Ebola bleeding from every hole in their body. That first man, the Frenchman ""Charles Monet"" should never have gone into that cave in Africa. Should never had touched and handled wild monkeys. Picture a man with a mystery illness- actually a level 4 virus that is hot and highly contagious and will kill 9 out of every 10 humans who gets it- flying on a plane beside you on the way to a hospital in Nairobi , coughing and hacking blood and tissue into an airplane barf bag. Imagine him crashing in the emergency room waiting room, explosive infected bloody shit and parts of his intestines spewing out of his ass while other parts of his intestines splash their bloody way out of his mouth. Imagine being the doctor, doomed to die, because he puked Ebola into your mouth and eyes as you tried to examine him.Then imagine this deadly disease crashing into the USA. As the author says, this virus was no more than a plane trip from any city in the world. Our world is so small now, there is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. We, the human race, have dragged monkeys from their homes in Africa to other places so to kill them for their cells and in doing so we have unleashed a horror more deadly than the worst tsumani or hurricane. Read this book and learn. "

Horrifying and fascinating at the same time, it's akin to watching a shark attack. Unfortunately, halfway through, the book shifts it's attention to the Reston virus outbreak in Virginia and begins to lose steam.The book loses more stars for it's sensationalism and false information about the Ebola virus, a gaffe the author has been called out on and owned up to.As a work of semi-fiction though, the author has managed to tap into our inner fear of an absolutely horrifying death spreading rapidly and unchecked through the world. Someday, it might become a reality. Brrr!"
38,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,4,"This book….it horrified me with just one chapter ! My usual circumlocutory approach in talking about a book’s storyline has taken fright and flown off to hide among the rafters when I sat down to write this review. This book is major league scary and it talks about a very frightening organism. Let me diverge a bit, a few days ago while catching up on the trailers from comic-con I watched the trailer for ‘Kong : Skull Island’. It was perhaps a day or two after I finished reading the book and watching the huge ape marauding on the screen was laughable for I had not gotten over the chills of the book. One of the most dreaded killers of man will never be seen by the naked eye, there will not be massive firearms deployed against it and the toll exacted by this killer will rival anything that history has ever seen. Oh boy… that was a little melodramatic wasn’t it ? Well, the Ebola virus deserves all these accolades according to Richard Preston. How else would you refer to a virus that has the potential to wipe out 90% of the planet’s human population ? Richard Preston’s book reads like a thriller but is also a tense account of an Ebola outbreak among laboratory monkeys in the bustling heart of Washington D.C.There are two parts to the book : 1. Filoviruses : The story begins innocuously enough with a man and woman going vacationing to Mount Elgon in Kenya. The landscapes, occasional sightings of wildlife and occasional love making later they return and go back to their lives. A few days later the man feels the beginnings of a headache and then all hell breaks loose. The filovirus inside the man’s body soon replicates swiftly and makes him indistinguishable from a bloody pulp. His eventual descent into critical stages of the disease are extremely graphic and not the kind of torment which should befall on a human being. The viruses of this family while being endowed with the power to literally wipe out the human race have eluded all our quests to understand the and thereby find a cure. The virus appears and disappears at will from the heart of the rainforest. I must echo Stephen King’s comment from long ago that the first chapter of this book is one of the scariest things you will ever read. Preston comments later that viruses like the filovirus and the AIDS virus might be nature’s way of balancing things out. The human parasite has taken over any and all aspects of nature and converted into unrecognizable forms, what if nature decided to turn the tables on us ? Scary isn’t it ?2.The virus breakout at Washington D.C : In a monkey house in Reston, a shipment of monkeys from Indonesia get affected with a form of Ebola which later came to be called Ebola Reston. The second half of the book is about a concentrated effort by a group of professionals from the Army and the CDC to control this breakout before it escapes into the civilian population. The challenge with writing about any real life occurrence is that of course everyone knows the outcome of what you are talking about and then there is that nasty spoilsport called ‘Google’ who will otherwise spoil it for you. I wouldn’t rate the second half of this book and the efforts against the Reston breakout very highly and compared to the initial phases, this is slightly slow and damp. Yes, they finally control the contagion and that is that !The parts where Preston describes the virus and its effects on mankind are absolutely chilling in their effect and also from what I read later of the book, some of it has been a tad exaggerated. And so, I would recommend that you temper this book with a healthy reading on the actual science behind the filovirus and its effects. Preston also gets quite dramatic towards the end of the book and it does tend to get rather stale as the book ends. But none of this should discount the fact that this is an excellent thriller.Highly recommended ! "
39,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5931265-paloma,2,"Review in English | Reseña en EspañolAs the world currently faces the COVID-19 outbreak, I thought it was an appropriate time to learn of some other viruses, given that so little is yet known about the current disease in terms of its origin and how it passed to humans. Of the existing universe of viruses, I have always found ebola scary AF -based on the descriptions and reports of the outbreaks in Africa, that really traumatized me as a child and of which I have always wondered -how such a contagious disease has been kept under relative control in only one area of the world?Upon a bit of research, I found that Hot Zone is considered one of the best books in the subject and among the top 5 medical thrillers of all times, so I said, I need to read this! And the book is in fact, very interesting and scary... until the middle. The first chapters actually describe the origins of the virus among the human population in the early 1970s and the subsequent deadly outbreaks. All what happened, and the mystery that until this day remains with regard of the source of contagion to those first ‘patients zero’ is described in an implacable way, and as readers we just follow along fearing the worst. I was also surprised to learn that apparently, African communities have dealt with Ebola outbreaks probably for centuries, but for strange reasons, the disease has tend to disappear as abruptly as it begins, though leaving a trail of bloody deaths. Now... the second part I did not quite get it. From Africa, we move to the USA and learn from an Ebola outbreak that occurred in a quarantine facility for monkeys, which were imported from the Philippines, in the mid 1980s. The threat of a potential deadly virus became a reality and a team of veterinarians, epidemiologists and the military became involved in dealing with the virus -but after chapters and chapters, there was no real, how to say it, threat, real outbreak?, because it turned out that no humans got the disease. OK, I don’t mean to sound crazy and wanting humans beings to die, BUT if I am reading a book about a disease, about a deadly virus, I want facts and not assumptions or imaginary threats. I mean, I know any virus poses a real threat to humanity, but in the end nothing happened and I did not even felt there was a satisfactory explanation on how those monkeys who brought the disease got it, as not event he link between Africa and the Philippines was explained. Overall, I felt the book got lost in the end in a sort of paranoia about what could have happened specifically in the USA if an outbreak had actually occurred. I would have liked to learn more about the history of the virus, how it affected the African communities and other potential theories of its origin. Unfortunately this was not delivered by this book and in this aspect, I felt something was missing -it was like seeing a Hollywood movie were there is danger and drama, but everything turns ok in the end. I will say however, that some of the descriptions of the behavior of the virus were scary indeed and it’s amazing how, 20 years later after this book was written, humanity is dealing with a virus that al thought not as bloody and terrifying and Ebola, is highly contagious and can be transmitted, literally, through air, something that has not been proven for Ebola. ———Los seres humanos estamos enfrentando la pandemia de COVID-19 y en este contexto, pensé apropiado aprender algo sobre otros virus, considerando que al momento, todavía se conoce poco de la enfermedad actual, en términos de su origen y cómo se ha transmitido a los humanos. Del universo de virus, siempre he pensado que el Ebola es uno de los más espantosos y terribles que enfrenta la humanidad y cuyos brotes me dieron pesadillas cuando escuchaba de ellos en las noticias durante mi infancia. Asimismo, siempre me he preguntado cómo es que una enfermedad tan contagiosa ha permanecido bajo control relativo confinada a una sola región del mundo.Investigando un poco, descubrí que este texto de Richard Preston es considerado uno de los mejores libros en la materia y se encuentra siempre en el Top 5 de mejores thrillers médicos, así que pensé que debía leerlo. Y la verdad es que el libro es, de hecho, muy interesante... hasta que llegamos a la mitad. Los primeros capítulos describen los orígenes del virus y brotes en poblaciones humanas durante la década de 1970 en Africa. Todo lo que sucede durante esos brotes sangrientos, y el misterio que permanece hasta hoy en día sobre la fuente de contagio de los primeros pacientes cero es descrito de forma impecable, y el lector se siente sumergido en esas ciudades y hospitales en Africa en donde se presentaron los primeros casos, esperando siempre lo peor. De esta parte, me sorprendió saber que las comunidades africanas han enfrentado brotes de Ebola durante siglos, probablemente, aunque demasiado contenidos, y por razones inexplicables, es una epidemia que desaparece tan abruptamente como aparece, si bien dejando un camino, literal, de sangre. Ahora bien...honestamente no entendí el propósito de la segunda parte del libro. De Africa, nos trasladamos a los Estados Unidos, para un recuento de un brote que hubo en una instalación para cuarentena de animales, específicamente monos, que eran importados desde las Filipinas, a mediados de los 80. La amenaza de un virus potencialmente mortal se convirtió en una realidad y un grupo de especialistas, veterinarios y el propio ejército de los Estados Unidos, intervino para contener el virus. Pero, tras capítulos y capítulos, me pareció que no hubo ningún brote real, porque resultó que ningún humano fue contagiado. Y ok, no quiero sonar como una loca pensando que forzosamente se tenían que morir personas para que el libro fuera interesante, PERO, si estoy leyendo un libro sobre enfermedades reales y virus mortales, me hubiera gustado contar con hechos y no suposiciones o amenazas concretadas, y leer sobre cientos de protocolos para que al final, solo murieran animales. Es decir, soy consciente que cualquier virus es una amenaza real contra la humanidad pero, creo que al final de este libro, nada sucedió y esta parte no ofreció siquiera una explicación satisfactoria de cómo los monos contrajeron el virus y cual era el vínculo del virus entre Africa y las Filipinas. En general, me pareció que el libro divagó mucho al final en una especie de paranoia sobre lo que pudo haber sucedido en los Estados Unidos si un brote masivo entre humanos hubiera sucedido. En lo personal a mi me hubiera gustado que el texto ahondara más en la historia del virus, en cómo afectó a las comunidades africanas y otras teorías potenciales sobre su origen; es decir, que se nos hubiera dado mas información científica mezclada con un contexto social e histórico de la enfermedad. Al final, sentí que era como una película estadounidense en donde se pinta el peor escenario y hay mucho drama... pero todo termina saliendo bien. Sin embargo, reconozco que el libro es entretenido en un 70% y está bien escrito -las descripciones de esos brotes en Africa en verdad que transmiten el horror de una enfermedad tan violenta y horrorosa y no pude dejar de pensar en cómo, 20 años después de que este libro se escribiera, la humanidad está enfrentando un virus que si bien no es tan brutal como el Ebola, ha probado ser igual de contagioso y que puede transmitirse por el aire o en superficies, cosas que no ha sido probado para el Ebola."

Makes you think what kind of things are going around the world behind closed doors where people in Hazmat suits are handling viruses that will make you bleed out of every orifices in your body. Besides the obvious ones, it will also melt your organs, give you high temperature, make you bloated, separate skin from the muscles, make your testicles change color and peel (yikes, as a guy, this was painful to read), give you red eyes, make you throw up (A LOT). Seriously, these were just some of the symptoms of the filovirus and it just gets worse and worse. Organs even become hard as stone while in other patients they turn into jello like substance. If you ever get this virus, best thing to do is off yourself and be done with it because you sure as hell don't want to be alive once the virus takes control of your precious little body. Again, scary as shit. Some parts were highly dramatic while others were extremely frighting. I don't usually read these kinds of books but this one I enjoyed because it was not only scary at a nonfiction level, but also because with ever increasing populations and the unbalanced standards of living going around in the world, it is only a matter of time before a new virus emerges and wipes out 90% of us, leaving the other 10% who were strong enough to survive to scratch their heads and try to figure out how to repopulate the world left in the ruin.

It sets the tone and keeps you on the edge of your seat as you follow the many lives that the viruses have touched.The scariest part of it all, though, is the end.Life had established itself in the monkey house. Ebola had risen in these rooms, flashed its colors, fed, and subsided into the forest. It will be back.And he was rightIt was a good read nonetheless - I learned a lot about Ebola and her sister viruses, and the way the diseases were researched by USAMRIID.

This is a book about a nasty, nasty virus that does unimaginable things to the human body. If reading a book about something like that interests you, you will want to check this out.

46,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15820787-heather-goss,1,"Edited 10/23/14 to add: Apparently hardly any of this book is even TRUE. I retract my earlier statement about it being useful to read despite being hot garbage as a piece of written word.I'm glad I finally got around to reading this; it definitely has some fascinating information and gives you some good context for the current Ebola news (and I was only 11 when the Reston incident happened so that was especially interesting to read about in detail). So I'd recommend it even though it's some of the most atrocious writing I've consumed in awhile. It has all the linguistic creativity in sentence structure of a young children's book. (A Children's Treasury of Bleeding From Every Orifice.) I never realized how much I hated the phrase ""he saw it in his mind's eye"" until Preston used it in every chapter in the book, not to mention the adjective ""exquisitely"" (there are 2 pages of hits if you search for it on your kindle). Preston makes up for his lack of wordsmithing by shoving a deep backstory full of pointless details down the reader's throat on every single person and place in the book. Do I really need half a chapter on how Reston was a planned community before getting to the point there's an office park there that imports monkeys? Even the introduction that described a patient zero -- I get he was trying to establish he could have gotten the bug from anywhere, but I seriously found myself on the metro reading this and thinking ""is this fucker going to get SICK already?"" And less egregious but still annoying, he telegraphs potential horrors the way a low-budget slasher film would -- and a lot of times it's not even something that comes to pass -- and we're talking about the horrors of ebola, the writer doesn't really need to waste all that legwork for you to be pretty on the edge already.I've never read any of Preston's other work, but I know he regularly writes for The New Yorker and was the editor on one of those ""Best Nature & Science Writing"" anthologies, so I can only guess his editor checked out big time for this go around. Nevertheless, it's worth a read for the info, and it totally got me to rent Outbreak on Amazon for this rainy afternoon."

48,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3123067-elizabeth-a,3,"Narrative non-fiction is probably my favorite genre, so I was really looking forward to this one. An Ebola outbreak in Virginia? What? How did I not know about this? Where was the 24/7 media coverage on stuff that actually matters? Yes, I realize I'm getting of topic, so back to the book.This book starts in Kenya, and takes you along on the experience of a person who is infected and dies in such a horrible manner that you certainly do not, under any circumstances, want to catch this disease. We are talking about Marburg and Ebola. We are introduced to various people, doctors, military personnel, and ordinary people who were affected and infected both in Kenya and the US. There's a monkey facility in Reston VA, and the monkeys suddenly start dying. What happens next is the stuff of horror movies, and that we are all even alive to read this review (or book) is pure luck. This is a compelling story that is equal parts fascinating and horrifying. For the first several sections I thought I had found my next five star read, but then the author starts to meander. I didn't care about what people made for dinner, and learning about the pets they had at home didn't add to the story one bit. There were simply too many tangents that detracted from the urgency of the main event. The final sections where the author goes to Kenya to see for himself this cave which might be the source is simply gratuitous and annoyed me. This is still a worth while read, and with tighter editing I would have rated it five stars. If nothing else it gave me lots to think about in terms of pandemics and the experiments carried out on animals. This book was first published in 1994 and I can only hope that we have better processes and systems in place to handle the next pandemic, which denial aside we know is coming.I listened to the audiobook which is well narrated by Richard M. Davidson, and if you have not read about this event, this book would make an excellent entry point."

Journalistic writing tries to pass off as scientifically based but anecdotes are the main fare here and there is precious little science. The various plagues enumerated within: Anthrax, Ebola, West Nile, Bird Flu, etc. just have not shown an ability, in the 16 years since the book was written, to jump to a form that is going to become more epidemic for humans. In the process journalists like Mr. Preston red-herring us into taking our eyes off the real, largely preventable, Third World killers: good ol' Malaria, Cholera, HIV. The total fatal cases of all the diseases enumerated in The Hot Zone in 10 years only add up to a fraction of the Malaria deaths each year.The danger in this kind of reportage is it takes our eye off the real problems of things like breast cancer, HIV, car crashes, gun violence, substance abuse, diabetes, and other various things that need work to prevent the far more numerous fatalities."

I didn't ever need to sleep again without the haunting spectre of infectious disease tinged nightmares swinging slowly over my head like a languid scythe. This book provides an insight into the way that the human race avoids the stunning reality of near-extermination at regular intervals, mostly thanks to scientists who are far more on top of things than the rest of us will ever be. Ebola, and the viruses adjacent to it, are terrifying. The army and CDC's efforts in containing them are certainly admirable, and it is simply incredible to see the hair's breadth we come within in respect to containment and outbreak. Sure, it is a little exaggerated most likely- but the bones of this story remain extraordinarily concerning. I'm writing this review in the midst of a pandemic. It isn't the worst one the human race has faced, but it is certainly not benign, and I'm in one of the countries that, so far, has managed to be reasonably successful with containment. One of the big takeaways I took from this book is the caveat of 'so far'. It only takes one person, one infection, without anyone knowing, for a virus to get back out there and become increasingly virulent. At present, we know of one, maybe two (in non-peer reviewed studies) strains of SARS-COV2- but this book has shown that this number can multiply as the viruses evolve and we find more and more things that transmit it. This book has left me somewhat terrified. I wish an updated version of it had been written though, in the wake of more outbreaks (especially in 2014). Containment is in no sense an easy road, but we try to do the best we can with microscopic things that we cannot control. There is still so much we need to learn about our bodies and the things that are within our microbiology- and education is our first point of control. This book was gripping, fascinating, extraordinarily easy to read and tear through, and it's certainly something that, if you're the sort of person who faces matters head-on, should look into. We can't make our reality go away- but we can learn about it."

I would advise not reading the book right before bed - because I did, last night, and I took a while to drop off to sleep because I was wired thinking about the story, and then all night long my dreams were filled with ebola and safety precautions and space suits and double- and triple-bagging samples…! Having said that, I am not entirely sure of the accuracy of the story. I read this article here (thanks, Kara): http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-the-hot-zo... which seems to indicate that the author has taken some liberties with sensationalising (is that a word…?!) the story. I wouldn’t have had too much of an issue with this if it had been fiction based on a true story, and I think I’d have given it 5★ in that case, but I took a star off since it is meant to be non-fiction.It does read really well - gripping and easy to read - I’ve read some non-fiction books about really interesting subjects, but the authors make them so dry with their writing style. That is definitely not the case here. And whether he has taken some artistic licence with the facts of the case or not, Preston does make a good point about the possibility that at some point, if a virus with a high mortality rate becomes highly transmissible and crosses species to be able to infect humans, we could be in big trouble."

I find this stuff really fascinating. Working in emergency medicine we are always aware of the possibility that the next patient could be the one that is bringing back SARS or now MERS or Ebola, Marburg...or some yet undiscovered virus that will not only melt your liver but may kill your family and co-workers. I think that it is inevitable that eventually one of these viruses, probably one of the lethal new respiratory viruses will cause a pandemic. The current plan is to shut down hospitals if they encounter a single case of SARS for example. If there are 50,000 cases which is entirely within the realm of possibility, that's a lot of hospitals out of action. Not to mention that a lot of medical personnel will either be liquified already or too afraid to come to work for fear of same. I think this scenario is much more likely than a bioterrorist attack and this is what we should be preparing for. It;s a great book, still timely and a fast-paced thriller.

Because this book is actually true, the hypotheses within could actually happen. It doesn't take much imagination to envision the consequences of a contagious killer virus.Preston enumerates the initial case of Ebola and then traces forward to an outbreak of it in a monkey research facility in Reston, Virginia. Part horror, part medical mystery, and all true, The Hot Zone makes you realize how vulnerable the human race really could be. Imagine an illness that kills like the black plague and spreads like the flu. What happens if a virus like that gets out in the population?This book definitely is written with dramatic flair, and perhaps at points is a little over the top, but that is what makes it such a fantastic and accessible read.

A phrase that comes up often in the book is ""shit scared."" I think that's the best way to describe this read.It's a true story about Ebola and the scariest part is that it's still active to this day. I finished reading the book and then a news report came on the BBC about the latest outbreak. And there's nothing you can do about it.From start to finish, you'll have a hard time tearing yourself away from the pages. There's something almost embarrassing about eating up stories of people bleeding to death from every orifice of their body. I think it's a combination of intrigue and voyeurism. You want to know how it ends for the person infected, but the sad part is that you almost always know how it ends. Hint: it's not pretty."

I've lived through the news reports on Ebola over the years, but Preston makes it real with the same level of detail used in good fiction. He added insights into inner dialogue through interviews with folks from doctors to military personnel-- all seemed very authentic. Therefore, the accidents, misjudgements, etc, give an accurate view of humans under stress operating under denial, then panic. This is a fascinating, and gruesome read. One has to wonder how our species has survived with vulnerabilities to shark-like viruses that adapt, and re-emerge. It is as though the dying down of epidemics is a bit of grace that we do not understand nor fully appreciate. I also have a new appreciation for the brave service personnel who run into the fray to help, instead of away from danger. "

This is a better book than the two stars I am rating it with. But I am angry at the author of this bestseller for using cheap literary devices and for being coy with the readers: titillating with purposefully gory language and phrasing. I am angry at the author for blatantly selling pornography of illness, suffering, and death under the guise of medical objectivity. Richard Preston's Hot Zone (1994), which became a world-wide bestseller, is a non-fiction book about the extremely lethal Ebola virus. This is not Covid-19 whose lethality is in low-teen percentage range even for vulnerable people. Ebola has the death rate of about 90%, and its effects on the human body are terrifying: the author is truly enthusiastic about describing human bodies - still alive - dissolving in the hospital beds, with the accuracy and clarity of detail rivaling the anatomical precision in triple-X movies. Now that I have vented, let me try to be objective. If we remove all the porn of gore and all patently irrelevant passages (see later) - the volume of this extraneous text amounts to well over 100 pages - we will have a truly great book telling stories of human fight against viruses. And it is not just Ebola. We also have stories about the Marburg and AIDS viruses.It begins with a captivating tale of one Charles Monet who lived near Mount Elgon in Western Kenya. He might have gotten infected with Ebola-like Marburg virus when he was walking in the Kitum Cave. He died in the hospital but not before infecting Dr. Musoke, who miraculously survived. The gratuitous and excruciatingly gory details of Mr. Monet's last hours and particularly the vivid description of how the doctor became infected will provide a captivating read for the fetishists of death.The narration moves to the USAMRID at Fort Detrick where we meet a cast of characters among the medical and military personnel. The focus is on Major Nancy Jaax and her family as well as on Col. C. J. Peters, MD (by the way, these are real people, if this makes any difference for the readers). Ms. Jaax works in the Biosafety Level 4 areas, the highest biohazard areas in existence. Areas like this are designed for dealing with lethal agents (viruses) for which there is no vaccine and no cure. The narrative about work in the labs is riveting.Then comes the chapter about the emergence in 1976 of Sudan strain of the Ebola virus. We read about the first known victim, Mr. Yu G., and then a moving story of nurse Mayinga who contracted Ebola while she was caring for a dying nun, Sister M.E. Nurse Mayinga's blood has since been studied in numerous medical institutes all over the world.Finally, we have the story of the Ebola outbreak in Reston, Virginia, where monkeys imported from Philippines began developing a highly lethal disease. This would be a totally fascinating story if the author did not do whatever possible to stretch the narrative material to artificially create the tension. Meandering plot threads made me almost lose patience with the book. There is an incredible amount of completely irrelevant detail in the book. Can anyone enlighten me what purpose does the following information serve:  ""Usually he wore faded blue jeans with a flaming Hawaiian shirt, along with sandals and dweebish white socks, [...]. His excuse for his lack of uniform was that he suffered from athlete's foot [...]""  I understand that authors of fiction books provide details about their characters to make them seem more real. But this is a real person - what is the purpose of telling us that he suffers from athlete's foot? There are hundreds of immaterial passages like that, whose only purpose is to pump up the volume of the text.The author knows how to write well. It is so clear from the last chapter, with its accomplished prose, deep wisdom, perspective, and even a degree of lyricism. Why then does he stoop to the cheapest literary tricks in the rest of the book? Well, I have a theory, and it relates to readers' preferences, but I am not courageous enough to divulge it... So, instead of four solid stars that the book would deserve if it were thoroughly rewritten and condensed to one-third its length, the rating isTwo stars"

We are the ultimate predators capable of dispensing with anything that gets in our way. Our biggest threat is really only to each other. Right? In a word…wrong. There are predators that have been around since long before we came out of the trees – predators that we can’t fight, can’t stop – can’t even see. And they have been right on our doorstep and we didn’t even know it.“In biology, nothing is clear, everything is too complicated, everything is a mess, and just when you think you understand something, you peel off a layer and find deeper complications beneath. Nature is anything but simple.” The Hot Zone reads like a fiction thriller. In fact, Richard Preston is a best-selling fiction writer. He is also a journalist who has traveled to where the nastiest viruses on earth have originated. However, The Hot Zone isn’t fiction. It is an unnerving account of how one of the deadliest viruses on earth – Ebola – which kills up to 90% of the individuals infected with it, in a unimaginably gruesome way, ended up finding its way in to a monkey house in a suburb of Washington D.C.The Hot Zone is very well written and chilling in how it relates two things. First, how viruses such as Ebola and Marburg can evolve and mutate entirely on their own, disappear from view and reappear when we least expect it. The second – and most unsettling to me – is how powerless and ill-prepared we are to deal with something like this. It can be spread around the world in a day and infect large numbers of people killing most and there is no cure. In this era of jet travel, something like this represents nature’s ultimate doomsday device.Any nonfiction book that can make Stephen King call it “one of the most horrifying things I’ve ever read,” and Suzanne Collins say “I just read it a few weeks ago. Still recovering,” is something that needs to be read. It will certainly give you pause – if not the creepy-crawlies – after reading it."
69,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45795394-will-true,1,"Above all else, this is a horribly written book. Preston relies on sensationalizing the already sensational, proposing a series of hypothetical scenarios (none grounded in fact) to build suspense, and is generally obsessed with his own importance.Ebola is a very deadly virus. We know this. It causes horrible symptoms, and has wreaked havoc across an entire continent. The author, however, is not content with what is already one of the most gruesome infections in recorded history, second only to perhaps the bubonic plague. He feels the need to exaggerate symptoms, to turn the horrifying into the laughably grotesque. Your testicles do not melt. Your organs do not liquefy. You do not hemorrhage black vomit from your mouth. You do not swim in the blood of an infected patient. These are patent falsehoods that demonstrate the author's fundamental disservice to the subject he covers. By causing panic, he does harm.Most infuriating to me was the opening chapter of the book, in which Preston discusses the possible Patient Zero of the Marburg virus, a ""Charles Monet."" What follows is dozens of pages of theoretical ways in which Monet could have contracted the virus. Maybe he pricked his finger on a stalagmite. Maybe he had sex with an animal. Maybe he ate some guano. None of these things are verifiable, and by introducing a pseudonymous character as the agent, he throws wild speculation around like it means anything. It's horrifyingly bad prose, a style borne of desperation for a catchy beginning.That this book is so poorly written and conceived is truly a shame, given how fascinating and important the subject is. Preston threw any journalistic integrity and credibility out of the window within 20 pages, and does nothing to gain it back."

The writing was descriptive and the author personalized the main characters. So many non-fiction books are dry, scholarly works-- fine if you need a reference for a college paper, but not so interesting to read. This book read like fiction, except that it was all true.Reminded me of when I was a kid, and I read a book about a girl getting polio. I went to bed for weeks afterwards convinced that I was going to wake up in the morning paralyzed (obviously not realizing that I had zero chance of having polio, as I had been vaccinated...) If anyone is prone to hypochondria and has any chance of being around monkeys, or going to Africa, good advice would be to pass on this book.However, if you are not a hypochondriac, working with monkeys, or traveling to Africa, and you want to see just how easily the human species could be wiped out (and might have come very close to zero hour in Virginia in 1990), then this is a fascinating book to read. The author also did a great job of personalizing the monkeys. I felt so sad for these creatures who are so much like us and yet we treat sometimes treat so badly. All of the monkeys involved in the Virginia outbreak had been living in the wild until they were captured by monkey hunters and sold to US labs for research. I'm not a PETA nut, but I love animals and it seems wrong in many ways to use animals that are so intelligent. Chimpanzees are, after all, only a couple of genes away from us.This book will give you a lot to think about. And it's a quick read because you get so totally caught up in the story."

The animals were infected with Ebola and soon after arrival in the US the animals began to die. Originally from Africa, the monkeys were shipped to Manila and then on to the US. Once the animals became sick it was discovered that they were suffering from Ebola which would kill 90% of them. The Army, the CDC and the research center worked together to contain the virus before it could spread to the human population. Not knowing if contact with the virus would infect people, extreme high-level bio-containment measures were followed including the wearing of space suits, decontamination showers and air locks within the building.This is quite a horror story and is frighteningly true. What Ebola does to a body, animal or human, is beyond imagining. I had no idea and now I will never forget it. The author does an outstanding job of tracing the spread of AIDS and Ebola, which are similar in some ways. Probably the scariest message from the book is that no one knows what the original carrier of Ebola might be. It could be anything and it is still out there."

I was super excited to be able to read this since it has been on my list for quite some time. But what an utter disappointment. Please, if you are not well versed in science and microbiology do NOT read this book. Preston uses fear-mongering to further a narrative that doesn't exist. Information used in this book isn't factual and his bias is glaringly obvious. He leaves out important perspectives and facts and only cares about 'scaring' his readers. It reads much more like a horror or thriller novel than it does a work of non-fiction. Ebola is a horrible disease but Preston writes as if a massive worldwide Ebola outbreak is just around the corner (which it isn't). If you do read this book, I strongly suggest you check out the CDC and WHO webpages on the topic to get a real understanding of Ebola. Preston's writing is very nice but he lacks all scientific and journalistic integrity. The whole point of having us read this in my class was so we could write a 10 page paper on how incorrect Preston is lol . Definitely do NOT recommend."

The book should be classified as fictional non-fiction, especially with the author's admittance that he had added something extra to make the book more grasping and more intriguing. I define it as a basic cashing in and selling hot cupcakes on a fair day. The people who are described in the book use the language and the thought process that can appeal to a middle class suburban no college degree readers. Somehow, domestic issues play an important role in the allegedly scientific narrative. In his book, top scientists are concerned with mundane issues of giving bath to children and eating lunch from Styrofoam boxes. The language they use is similar to the ones hillbillies are using and the manners are of the farm boys. Plus, the overused suspense made the matters even worth ....

78,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64621419-dennis,4,"In his 1994 book The Hot Zone Richard Preston gives an account of several outbreaks of the filoviruses Marburg and Ebola. It all starts in 1980 with Charles Monet (a pseudonym), who possibly caught Marburg virus during a visit to Kitum Cave on Mount Elgon in Kenya. We follow him while his condition is getting worse and worse. It’s … frigthening. Then we move back and forth a bit, as we learn about the origins of Ebola virus (the first known case in 1976 is covered) and the handling of hot agents under different biosafety levels and BSL-4 (the highest level) in particular.In this first part of the book Preston makes it absolutely clear how deadly a virus Ebola and Marburg are. And also that there are certainly better ways to die than from one of those. Frankly, it’s pretty terrifying.In the second part of the book Ebola then moves into a monkey house in Reston, Virginia, fifteen miles outside of Washington D.C. This was in 1989. We witness the discovery of the virus by the veterianarian for the facility and the subsequent actions taken by the U.S. Army and the CDC. If you don’t know the particulars of the Reston case, then this will be pretty suspenseful as well.Generally one could certainly call this book a nonfiction-thriller. Preston’s writing is very effective in building up tension and keeping it at a high level. He definitely nailed the thriller part. I had more questions about the nonfiction part, to be honest. Those are real cases of Ebola and Marburg outbreaks, certainly. But the author describes in a lot of detail what these viruses do to the body. And after I repeatedly read about organs liquifying and people hemorrhaging from basically all orifices of their bodies, I felt inclined to visit the WHO website to look a few things up. And while case fatality rates are obviously very high and the symptoms are bad, and I mean real bad, I couldn’t find anything about organs turning to goo. And further research also showed that Preston had been criticized for this by the CDC. Also, there’s some speculation towards the end of the book as to whether Ebola can be transmitted through the air. Which it can’t.Now, I don’t want to be too critical. This book was written in 1994. There were 637 confirmed cases of Ebola at the time (of which 454 were fatal). It’s probably unfair to compare this book to what is known today about the disease. And in any case, I did not delve too deeply into this, as I plan to read Preston‘s more recent book  Crisis in the Red Zone as well, and this here basically only functioned as a primer for me.Still, my rating is perhaps more in line with how I see the entertainment value of this book (yeah, I know how that sounds), than it is with how confident I feel about the things that I've learned. The short last part of the book, which was somewhat anticlimactic and, yes, also the things I layed out in the previous two paragraphs makes me go with a 4 instead of a 5 here. I’m curious about the second book now."
79,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam-cooks-the-books--,4,"WARNING: The Hot Zone is not for the squeamish but should be considered a 'must-read' for anyone who wants to be better informed about the deadly Ebola virus--where it orginated from, what its symptoms are, how it spreads, mutates, jumps species, and most importantly, what, if anything, can be done to stop the spread of this often deadly disease. I would like to ask the author to publish a sequel, bringing the information up-to-date, since a lot more has happened with Ebola since this book was published in 1994. In this book, Preston writes about some of the earliest known cases of the various strains of the virus and how they were handled, treated, investigated. It appears that a lot of bungling went on, mostly because of ignorance, so we are damn lucky the disease has not caused a worldwide pandemic up to this point but, in each case, it has seemed to fade away on its own volition. Unfortunately, like most viruses, it has shown the ability to mutate quickly and come back more deadly than ever. At the time The Hot Zone was written, there were four known Ebola-type viruses: Marburg, Ebola Sudan, Ebola Zaire, Ebola Reston. Chapter One begins with a horrifying account of a deadly case of Marburg infection. In January, 1980, Charles Monet, a fifty-six-year-old Frenchman, who lived and worked in the shadow of Mount Elgon in Kenya, spent the New Year’s holiday exploring Kitum Cave with a friend. Eight days later, Monet began to feel ill, with his symptoms worsening rapidly until he ended up in intensive care in Nairobi Hospital where he later bled out; all his organs had dissolved. The doctor who treated him there became covered in Monet's vomit and blood in the process and, a few days later, developed the disease himself. Samples of the deadly virus were sent to the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, and identified as the Marburg virus, which had erupted in Marburg, Germany in 1967. In that outbreak, the filovirus jumped species from infected and dying Ugandan monkeys in a lab to workers and townspeople, killing many. Preston calls the Marburg virus ‘the gentle sister’ of the three filoviruses because it only kills about 25% of its victims, whereas ninety percent of the people who come down with Ebola Zaire die from it--he calls it 'a slate wiper.'Preston spends a large part of the book covering the first known occurrence of the Ebola virus in the United States—at the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit in Virginia, not far from Washington D.C. There, in October, 1989, crab-eating monkeys imported from Southeast Asia began growing ill and dying. Doctors from USAMRIID (the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease) were called in to help identify the cause and began to suspect some form of filovirus. The interesting thing was that it soon became apparent that in this case the disease was being spread through some sort of airborne transmission, rather than solely through the exchange of bodily fluids, as was expected. It was thought that perhaps when workers cleaned cages, the water spray atomized the virus into water droplets that were inhaled by healthy monkeys. There was potential here for a major human epidemic if the virus jumped species and spread to the community outside the building. Fortunately, none of the human handlers came down with the disease but all the monkeys had to be euthanized and the building decontaminated. After finishing the book, I did some follow-up reading online to find information about the 2014 outbreak, now called the worst in history, and learned that this particular strain is considered 'new' even though it is 97% similar to the Zaire strain, and is being referred to as Guinean EBOV (Ebolavirus.) It has seemed harder to contain this time around and some sources speculate that there is the possiblity of airborne transmission through large droplets in this new form.Preston ends his book on a pessimistic note, “The emergence of AIDS, Ebola and any number of rain forest agents (viruses) appears to be a natural consequence of the ruin of the tropical biosphere…Perhaps the biosphere does not ‘like’ the idea of 5 billion humans (here)…The Earth’s immune system, so to speak, has recognized the presence of the human species and is starting to kick in. The Earth is attempting to rid itself of an infection by the human parasite.”"

I didn't expect it to open with a vivid description of an ebola patient zero's journey from poking at bat poop in a cave in Africa, to trying to make it to a hospital alive while essentially turning into a walking corpse. Ugh. Book's terrifying, as it describes an air-borne outbreak in a Monkey Lab near D.C. I generally enjoyed it, nothing remarkable, but if nothing else, tells you how much worse a virus can be."
81,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"I would have given this a five, but I thought the return of the author to the Zaire Ebola source cave at the end, was a melodramatic telling for self-serving effect, and redundant to the musings about possible vectors that he had already detailed.But regardless of it now being 20 years down the line, the aging of this story is negligible. When the Reston filovirus event was happening, I remember reading about the sick monkey problem in a 3 paragraph length newspaper article. How that was downplayed is beyond any accountability, looking back. And with the 2014 cases of Ebola coming for treatment in the USA, plus the travel that occurred of victims with dire future path in this recent disease, I would think this is just a must read now. And that despite the age of the book.Why? Because this gives some excellent description and definitive physical context to both the filovirus itself and the progression of the middle and end stages of Ebola illness.But much more than that, it denotes the uncertainty in vector sources, and the potential in air travel era for the demise of homo sapiens.The one point that will not leave my head is the fact that the paving of Kahasi trail to Kahasi Highway has now caused more deaths than all the violence in both World Wars, civilian and military. Because it enabled AIDS and virus diseases for easy access out of the rain forest.For millennia humans in Africa have had eruptions of diseases from this group but they were limited in scale from location transfers alone. Not true for some time now. Having read at least 3 or 4 other books with Ebola being a central cast member, I still think this one is the must read for all. This is doubly horrifying as we observe right now in 2014 the current ""expert"" assumptions made that this can not be transmitted in airborne situation. There's still more unknown than known as to levels of vectors or sequence of vectors or resistance factors beyond the airborne question. As little as 5 virus attached to a eyeball when 100,000 fit on the end of a period in a sentence! What a horrid death and they still know less than they don't know. You can not make those assumptions or let individuals decide their own quarantine criteria. It's the equivalent of letting a 3 year old drive a 60 person loaded bus. The other one aspect that I did think detracted for me from this book was the way this author anthropomorphized the Filovirus group. Nature is cold, it progresses from simple to more complex and it is NOT about homo sapiens. He muses about the revenge plan of nature against our species. LOL! That's exactly like putting Earth in the center of the solar system for 10,000 years of human history and denying that the Sun was the center and Earth a mere one of many on the outskirts. It is not about ""us"" at all. "
82,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/908968-ryan,5,"San Jose Book Club, January 2015When Peter chose this book as our next book club selection I was skeptical. I'm not a big fan of non-fiction and this was a 20 year old book. However, the topic was prescient and relevant to today and it was a best seller.I read this book in a day. This book reads like a thriller. The book starts out like a Michael Crichton book where a doctor deep in Africa visits a cave with his lover and seven days later becomes ill. The book is structured so that it slowly build and gives the reader context and information while the whole time it feels like it's telling a story. We learn about Marburg virus and how and where it first emerged. We learn about Ebola Sudan and Ebola Zaire and how these have emerged in Africa and how there is much we still don't know about these diseases. This is all background which builds to the story of a virus found in a monkey house outside of Washington DC and the response to contain it.I thought this book was so well written and interesting. I was enthralled and horrified through the entire book. My only criticism is that it is a bit sensationalized in parts. The author throws in sentences at the end of sections of the story where he is describing a person. Then he writes something like ""What Gene did not realize was that there was another way into the back rooms. You could get there without breaking the sticky tape on the door."" Some of these were never followed up on and implied something worse happened than actually did happen. I think the author is trying to show that there are all these ways something can go wrong. However, most of these are too sensational and seem to be fear mongering. But I think one of the strengths of the book is that is shows how easy it is to get infected when exposed.Overall, this is an amazing book. It doesn't feel dated. This is a true story but could be fiction it's so suspenseful. I have a new appreciation for the danger of these viruses."
83,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10452789-elizabeth,5,"I was captivated almost immediately by the terrifying story, especially knowing it is a TRUE story. It was fascinating and beyond scary to learn about the filoviruses and how they seemed to pop up out of nowhere and annialte almost every human they touch. It brought to light just how much we do share with random strangers and people we pass in the grocery store and on the street. Sneezes, germs, and whatever other bodily fluids that aren't completely washed from hands that touch everything we do. And how our now almost effortless and easy world travel has only exasperated the infection rate of any disease--creating easy pandemics. The unknown origin and original host makes the virus spectacularly terrifying. But reading that Ebola has most likely been around since the beginning of time was almost a relief--somehow knowing it wasnt a brand new threat made me feel better. Overall I hope it never turns into the epidemic that wipes out most of or all of the human race, but it also gives an interesting perspective on our ever growing population of humans and how the earth's other beings are evolving to fight and keep their species alive as well."

This current unknown strain also can be passed from human to human, but the mortality rate is less than 10%. Still, people are wary – sometimes even panicky. 2009 was not the best year to read Hot Zone. I’m not fond of terror or horror tales. The thing that makes this book frightening is that it is non-fiction.The book begins in Kitum Cave, Kenya, where some theorize the Marburg virus originated. Devastating in its effects on humans, Marburg is one of only a few filoviruses known to man – the others being several strains of Ebola. Descriptively graphic explanation of Marburg’s effect on a French expatriate is similarly compared to Ebola, segueing into the events beginning on October 4, 1989 in Reston, Virginia, the day the monkeys arrived.This book is thought provoking, not only about our ecosystem, but also of the fragility of the life that exists in it. Everyone should read this gripping account."
85,0385495226,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36603555-katherine-addison,5,"This is a terrific and also terrifying book about Ebola. It's severely out of date (1994), but is a great snapshot of the epidemiology of Ebola at that particular time. Preston is an amazing writer (much better than his more famous brother Douglas) and manages to write vivid and compelling descriptions of, for instance, putting on a bio-hazard suit.Nothing that he says has been contradicted by Ebola's career since 1994.This book is specifically about a dodged bullet: research monkeys shipped from the Philippines to Washington D.C. brought with them a strain of Ebola that, as it turns out, doesn't affect Homo sapiens. Or as Preston chillingly puts it, the disease knows the difference between humans and monkeys. Preston is a fantastic storyteller; he writes amazing exposition, both about the Army's work in containing Ebola Reston (this being before they knew it didn't affect humans) and about what was known about the provenance of Ebola and its filovirus ""sisters."" Even outdated as it is, I am hard-pressed to imagine someone writing a better book about Ebola."
