0,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"Lee Smolin presents an interesting hypothesis that attempts to explain why the fundamental physical constants seem to be ""tuned"" perfectly to allow stars, planets, and life to evolve. The best aspect of his hypothesis is that it is ""falsifiable"". This means that Smolin proposes a number of tests that if they fail, would mean that his hypothesis is wrong. And, the tests are not incredibly difficult. He includes observational tests--like measuring the masses of additional neutron stars--and theoretical tests; calculating the consequences of changing the values of certain physical ""constants"". So, Smolin's hypothesis is quite engaging, and should be considered seriously.But most of the book is not about Smolin's hypothesis at all. It is really about reconciling various quantum theories and cosmology. The book is deeply philosophical, and the book makes clear which parts are pure speculation. Smolin mentions that he met Richard Feynman a few times. Each time he described his work to Feynman, he was criticized because Smolin's ideas were not sufficiently crazy!So, much of the book contains some crazy ideas, and it is full of philosophical speculation. The book is not easy to read--not because of heavy technical explanations, but because the philosophical viewpoints are often quite subtle. "
1,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15888596-shane,4,"The importance of this book comes not from the proposed cosmological theory itself, but from its understanding of relational cosmology and the philosophical ramifications of relativity and that a natural mechanism _is_ possible to explain the complexity of the universe.Lee Smolin proposes a thought-provoking cosmological theory of cosmic natural selection to explain the complexity of the universe. In doing so, he dives into the discussion of self-organized complex physical systems and relativity. This is where the heart of the book lies, the life of such a cosmos.The book is very fun to read and is packed with information, both physics and philosophy, on the very basic, most abstract properties of the world. The ending is absolutely beautiful as well. The passages on relativity & relational cosmology, complex systems, and art and science places this book at the center of my thoughts as of late. I feel that this book will be very important in the future, although it is viewed as a mere popular science book right now. Highly influential. I highly recommend it."
2,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57518342-krish-sanghvi,4,"Although his theory (more of a hypothesis really), seems testable, it has too many assumptions, and the assumptions are what lie to be falsifiable, not the theory itself. Still, this is a great book because it delves into questions rarely addressed by proper scientists like- why are the parameters of the universe the way they are and not otherwise; is there an absolute truth and does this lie beyond the reaches of the scientific method; the difference between absolute and relative etc. This book is more philosophy of science than science, which is what differentiates it from other popular books on cosmology. It also uses principles of biology (natural selection, niche, competition etc) to infer hypotheses about the universe, although i disagree with him and feel his case for cosmic Darwinism is very weak and doesn't test that hypothesis directly. Physics today has reached a dead end, with all big questions still left unanswered and no new evidence being accumulated about stuff like dark energy, dark matter, multiverses, Gravity etc. We also don't understand why quantum theory is true and what it describes. Also, two distinct and equally true theories: gen rel and QM describe nature very differently. Hence, we may need a paradigm shift in physics, something which is quite taboo among physicists. Everybody is trying to unify the two, but very few actually go beyond this unification, and discuss the implications of it happening/ not. Smolin gets this discussion started through his book and points out the limitations of current physics. It also questions the scientific method and its assumptions, which science books rarely do. Smolin emphasises why this paradigm shift is important if we wish to have a better theory that describes the universe. On the other hand, biology has been the most progressive and complete of all sciences. This is because natural selection has stood the test of time and has immense evidence and predictive/ explanatory power. It also acts as a self referencing system, and can self organise and spontaneously occur (probably), and smolin tries to apply these principle of biology to cosmology, and gives us a new hypothesis for the universe which doesn't need any external truth, and which relies on the history of a self referencing and self forming universe. This book also has some fantastic interpretations of general relativity and natural selection, which themselves make it worth reading. It also provides a fantastic critique of reductionism, absolutism, radical atomism and why these ideas are redundant today, in a universe where things are nothing but interactions. I'm yet to read a good, proper science book which discusses how science itself requires some level of faith in the scientific method and in evidence and in reality, but this book is the closest I have come so far. These aren't discussed directly, but can be inferred. I also like the book because it addresses the philosophical origins and implications of Newtonian physics (the absolute), gen rel (the relational), and QM (the observational and probabilistic), rather than merely describing what these theories are. Also, it acknowledges that there are many interpretations of QM (which physics books rarely do!). It also wonderfully illustrates quantum uncertainty and entanglement, which often seem very counterintuitive. This book has finally helped me appreciate quantum mechanics, something I didn't understand properly prior to reading it. Is quantum mechanics the end of the road for physics? The author certainly thinks otherwise- that there exists a better theory somewhere in the future, that will explain the universe more coherently. I don't. I think the weirdness of the quantum world won't be explained by anything other than QM. Of course, I wish I'll be proved wrong. One of the main objectives of this book is to explain why the universe is what it is. Why is there life, complexity, organisation, stars etc, when all these things seem so improbable to arose, were the laws for a universe chosen randomly. Most people would either use the weaker anthropocentric principle to justify their answer, or succumb to the concept of a god. But neither answer seems satisfactory or testable. This book discusses these ideas and introduces another one- of cosmic natural selection to answer the question above. The first part of the book is very descriptive and goes through the history of science and has many definitions (some of which, like the gauge principle, I couldn't understand). The second part deals with his hypothesis of cosmic natural selection (which may seem interesting at first, but then gets very speculative and repetitive). The third part, which is also the best (5/5) talks about the philosophical underpinnings of Newtonian physics, gen rel, and QM. The fourth part, which is equally interesting, tells us what the universe would have to be like, if observers were to describe it in a quantum way. It talks about how there can never be an absolute description of the universe, because that would require an observer outside our own universe. It also explains how different observers may relate to each other to describe the universe precisely, but not accurately. It also discusses what gravity, space time, and time would be like at a quantum level, and why there are so many inconsistencies in physics and in reality itself. The take home message of the book is this- we may never know truth because the universe isn't absolute, yet, our theories can be improved so that we describe the universe as a self organising, relational, non absolute, complex, out of equilibrium system. 4.5 stars because a lot of the book gets repetitive and many parts seem redundant or too anecdotal, and because he treats a hypothesis as a theory. Also the book isn't very succinct, and ideas are scattered all over the place which makes it less coherent to read. But maybe I feel this way coz I took a really long time to finish it (7 months!!)."
3,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"Smolin starts by describing how what he calls ""Radical Atomism"" conflicts with unification.His argument is that, under Radical Atomism, particles have fundamental properties, independent from their environment.But for unification to reach it's ultimate goal, the variety of particles must emerge from one fundamental element.This is the first of many weak, philosophical arguments in the book.I'm interested in the formation and evolution of stars.In this book I found a fascinating and enlightening (pun intended) survey of this complex and sensitive phenomena.I was particularly interested to learn that Cellular Automata have been used to model galactic star formation.The book's thesis is Smolin's own theory of Cosmological Natural Selection.In this theory, the apparently fine-tuned parameters in physics are a result of a sort of natural selection.This evolution of the fundamental constants occurs via black hole reproduction.As the theory goes, formation of new black holes in a universe give rise to child universes, etc.He concludes that we can test this theory by examination of the parameters of physics.If a parameter can be changed to increase the rate of black hole formation, it would refute the theory.But what if we vary several constants and all changes serve to decrease black hole formation in our universe?This sounds a little bit like anthropic reasoning: If the constants of nature weren't fine tuned as they are, we wouldn't be here to worry about the problem of fine tuning.Put another way: If any physical constant is changed from its observed value, OBJECT becomes less likely, therefore THEORY which predicts our universe must have OBJECT is upheld.Replace OBJECT with ""black holes"" or ""intelligent life"", and THEORY with ""Cosmological Natural Selection"" or ""The Anthropic Principle"", respectively. Unsettling!However, the real difference between Cosmological Natural Selection and Anthropic reasoning is that the former gives a mechanism to explain the relationship between possible configurations of the constants of nature, while the later does not.Smolin does examine the consequences of varying a handful of constants, and their support for his pet theory is intriguing.That's the fun part!The not-so-fun part is Smolin's constant, painful, digressions into philosophy.It's enough to make Feynman weep!Philosophical Digression #1: NoveltyTo be honest, I have no idea what Smolin was getting at with this one.All I can gather from this inscrutable section is that Smolin is capable of writing shameful nonsense with impunity. For example: ""...to exist something must be created by processes that act in time to create the novel out of what existed before."" It's fucking nonsense! For like 10 pages!Philosophical Digression #2: GodSmolin uses the word ""god"" 74 times in this book.It really gets annoying when, you're trying to follow his arguments, only to be distracted by some the arbitrary mysticism of long-dead control freaks. For example: ""There is thus a danger that the need for such a theory of initial conditions leaves the door open for a return of religion."" The danger is people like YOU, Smolin, who feed the trolls! Just give me my science, leave the whining imbeciles out of it.Philosophical Digression #3: SystemsSmolin makes a big deal about complex, self-organizing, stable, and non-equilibrium systems. This involves characterization of various objects and phenomena based on their properties and internal behavior. It's a nice way of dropping things into differently labeled buckets, but I fail to see how it ties in with the thesis of the book. It seems like so much padding, and philosophical rambling, to me. He makes some analogy between life and the cosmos, apparently in attempt to determine whether or not the cosmos is literally alive. He defines life following a sort of rip-off of What Is Life by Schrödinger. Then he uses his bullshit philosophy to define the cosmos in the same vein. He finds them both ""non-equilibrium self-organized systems"", but doesn't classify the cosmos as being ""alive"". I don't feel like I learned anything from this.Philosophical Digression #4: LeibnizSmolin is obsessed with Leibniz! He talks a lot about Libniz's principle of sufficient reason, which he ties (unconvincingly) with Weyl's gauge theory. He also uses this principle to justify lots of rational ideas, like relativity over a fixed background. It seems superfluous to me.Philosophical Digression #5: MysticismLike the word ""god"", this is another red flag; and it appears 25 times...The little Feynman in my ear yells, ""Hooey!"" every time I hear this word.Smolin actually writes: ""perhaps there must remain a place for mysticism""!That little gem came in a discussion of why there is something rather than nothing. Smolin seems to have fallen victim to the siren song of infinite regress. I can empathize, but there is no excuse for resorting to poetry like this in a science book:""Is there any reason we might not conceive of the world as made up as a network of relationships, of which our appearances are true examples, rather than as made up of some imagined absolute existing things, of which our appearances are mere shadows?""Smolin, please tell me you aren't writing this way just to get chicks.Not that it wouldn't work, those rhetorical questions are totally angst!I just wish this book had stayed away from these mere shadows of intelligent thought."
4,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5896715-dave,5,"I'm no stranger to pop-science books but this book opened my mind to some amazing possibilities. How is it that the universe we inhabit has just the right properties for us to exist? The Anthropic principle says it must because we are here to observe it. Smolin suggests that, in a nutshell, in the beginning there was random nothing, then out of that came blind iteration - universes forming and collapsing again, until finally evolution emerged by chance (it had all the time in the world after all to do so) and one (or more) universes 'stuck', ie were just stable enough to give rise to offspring (in black holes). Each child universe inherits the properties of its parent, with some random mutation, and eventually one (or more) universe formed that is stable enough to give rise to us. This is the theory of cosmological natural selection. The idea that inside every black hole is another daughter universe of our own, and ours is, in turn, the guts of a black hole in some parent universe, is deeply attractive. This book expounds on this thought experiment in an highly accessible manner."
5,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10837-nader,4,"It gives a good overview of big picture and current fundamental problems in physics and cosmology with some emphasis on the philosophical aspects of the discussions. Then it presents some very interesting ideas on how to extend or improve the theory of relativity and quantum mechanic so they can coexist under a more logical framework based on the original ideas first presented by Leibniz. It is interesting to see how the battle between Newton and Leibniz's physics develops throughout the book, which eventually Leibniz comes out as the winner!My only complain is about the format of book. It has very small fonts and each chapter is not divided into subsection which makes it difficult to follow and digest at times. Also the book could have used more pictures to facilitates the understanding of some of the concepts. "
6,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31604947-neil-mcfarlane,5,"There are two books that I've read in my 48 years so far on this Earth which have blown my mind and completely changed my whole way of looking at things, and this is one of them. (FYI the other is ""The Selfish Gene"")First of all, Smolin has some crazy-sounding things to say, but he uses tight, scientific arguments, and he's the real deal, a professor at a Canadian University with a team of researchers working under him. So try to repress your inclination to dismiss him as a crackpot when you first start understanding what he's saying. If you're not too physics-minded, you can just read and enjoy the part (in the first half of the book) where Smolin describes his theory that a big bang and a black hole are like reverse mirror images of each other. In conclusion, the big bang was actually a ""bounce"" at the centre of a black hole in a ""prior"" universe which created a new region of space and time - our universe.So in effect, universes are like trees and black holes are like cherries on the trees which in turn give rise to more universes which in turn give rise to more black holes/cherries etc. etc.It makes our previous conception of this universe seem a paltry thing.Of course there's no way to presently know if this is all true, but it's a fascinating theory which has stood the test of time (Smolin first came up with it about 15 years ago). It also makes the universe into a kind of organic thing.Which brings us on to the second revolutionary idea of the book which is to link the cosmos - and the physical laws under which it operates - to Darwinian natural selection.To find out how Smolin does that, you'll have to read the book, but for me, this is an incredibly important book, the influence of which will grow and grow over the coming years."

8,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8360313-nathan,3,"All of the different ideas are interesting and plausible enough, but they don't come together into a cohesive picture--which is a theme of the book, but for that reason the book is quite meandering and feels like little more than a bunch of questions with shallow indications of potential directions in which an answer might be found. Too much time is spent disparaging old general philosophical problems like, ""Why?,"" as I don't think the author succeeds in solving them or making them irrelevant to the degree that he believes he has. The theory of cosmological natural selection doesn't answer the universe's deepest questions, it just pushes them back in time (or...""not-time,"" or whatever) to the abiogenesis of cosmological ""life"". It carries the same unresolved issue that biological natural selection does, which is that we don't actually know how or why the process began. Why is the universe self-organizing, rather than not? Why is a process of selection and evolution fundamental, when it could hypothetically be otherwise (chaos, equilibrium, nothingness, etc)? Cosmological natural selection seems to carry with it the necessity of some kind of impetus, or ""prime mover,"" to start the cosmological reaction.The author makes a big deal of Leibniz's ""principle of sufficient reason,"" which states that any question about why the world is one way rather than another must have an answer--but I don't see how the author's own theory satisfies the principle. Also, the idea that each black hole is a new universe, which itself spawns more universes ad infinitum carries with it a problem (in my mind) that the author doesn't address. How can you create infinite universes from one universe? If a star turns into a black hole, and that black hole becomes a new universe, isn't that new universe necessarily going to have less matter than the universe in which it was created? Doesn't this process imply that--if not the starting universe--at least each successive universe is increasingly finite? Biological natural selection depends on outside fuel, such that in order to make a human being via evolution from a single cell, you need to take materials from the environment. A cell can't create a human being using only the matter in itself. So, where would the universe get the material to create infinite new universes from itself? Or do the universes get successively smaller and eventually run out of ""fuel"" causing the entire multiverse to collapse in on itself in a reversal of all existence? I have no idea if it's a good question, but would have liked if it were addressed."
9,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26895953-ken-doggett,2,"The version I read had a few typos, but this is the least of the problem with a book purportedly written for the general public. Smolin writes in complex sentences, compounded by a generous sprinkling of grammatical errors, all of which conspire to make it a hard, slow, tedious read. Often the sentences have to be read twice to unravel exactly what is meant, and even then the reader still can't be sure. To make it even worse, the epilogue degenerates into some of the peculiar politics he hinted at within the body of the book.Admittedly, Lee Smolin is at or near the genius level when it comes to physics. He is certainly way beyond my understanding of it, as a layman, and I don't doubt that he has put forward a genuinely valid alternative mode of understanding the world in which we live. I don't question any of it. I just wish he could have illuminated it with a little more clarity. My rating is two out of five stars."
10,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5344627-sarah,4,"As usual I didn't manage to follow all of it - and as usual it didn't matter to my satisfaction with the book. I learned a lot here and there and although I'm not a convert yet, I love the ideas of self-organization and natural selection. My biggest failing is maybe not understanding the guage principle but there were a lot of other brilliant ideas I did grasp a bit. Rotation forces (or the lack of them) in an otherwise empty universe, inertia and energy flows. And I've fallen in love with galaxies.... got to find out more."
11,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56197936-zahwa,4,"one of the best science books i have read so far, it's really enlightening and influential. i have learned alot through it not only about physics and cosmology but also philosophy and even biology!, it was kind of dense so i wouldn't recommend it to a reader with no background in classical physics, relativity and quantum theory. i am really glad i picked it up and i can't wait to see what the future brings regarding the cosmological natural selection theory."
12,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113631786-luke-stannard,5,"Pretty sure this is one of the most underrated physics books of all time. Now that everyone is giving Smolin some love for his progress with quantum theory, people should go back and read this thing. It's long, and it takes a little imagination, but he's really not extrapolating too much. If we want to find a theory of everything or a new kind of scientific physics this century, we need to take books like this more seriously. "
13,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19210016-nadim,4,"In my opinion, the best argument to date, against a ""designed universe"" wherein, if any of the physical constants were even a billionth part different, the ramifications would affect the viability of chemistry, star formation and hence, life as we know it. "
14,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44580278-theshrike,4,This was a bit of a challenging read as some of the concepts are obtuse and challenging. However the basic premise is that Smolin applies the idea of Evolution to universe. Survival of the fittest Universes.Very interesting.
15,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92431023-michael-karpusas,2,"Although the basic idea presented in this book is fascinating, the writing is extremely tedious, repetitive and boring."
16,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,3,"I skimmed this book. I felt like it was a bit underwhelming. It applies the Gaia hypothesis to the Universe, pointing out that the large-scale processes forming stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters, resemble a self-regulating lifeform. Then Smolin applies the concept of evolution to the Universe. He suggests that black holes can create new singularities that spawn more Universes. He says that the Universe may seem to have been designed, since certain parameters are finely tuned to support star formation and therefore life itself. But if the Universe were a living thing that spawned copies of itself, then eventually the copies would be selected for their ability to generate stars.The weak point is the idea that black holes spawn new Universes because...for some reason or other. Something about how a contradiction in the way time operates in a black hole would violate the rules of our Universe and so this MUST therefore spawn a new Universe.The other weak point is how the author applies familiar metaphors like evolution to the Universe. I mean, might as well say the Universe is a clock, or a giant computer. Fun to think about but a bit lazy to re-use a metaphor."
17,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"While most physicists ignore philosophy, apart from an occasional pop version of Thomas Kuhn's paradigms, or even attack each other for doing ""philosophy"" instead of ""science"", Smolin in this book argues that there is a crisis in modern physics which needs to be met by explicitly considering the philosophical presuppositions of current theory. What he has in mind is the problem that modern particle theory, including string theory (which was the last word when this was written seventeen years ago), have many free parameters such as the values of the forces and masses of the particles which are not constrained by the theories, or could be different and still give rise to consistent interpretations, and which in fact have improbable values. He is unsatisfied with this situation, as with the so-called Anthropic Principle as an explanation; he proposes a theory he calls ""cosmological natural selection"", by analogy with biological natural selection, which postulates that the collapse of stars into black holes produces new universes, each of which differs very slightly in the values of the parameters from the parent universe in which the black holes originate, and thus that those parameters are selected for which produce the most black holes. In addition to this theory, or in justification of it, he discusses many other philosophical issues of relativity, quantum theory, and quantum gravity, and considers the origins of galaxies and other questions. I am skeptical of his theory, but it is refreshing to me as a former philosophy major that he takes seriously figures from Leibniz through Feyerabend and Popper; and I learned much from this book about the issues in modern physics and cosmogony. This is a much higher level book than I have been reading, although it is not technical or mathematical."
18,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4262636-john-michael-strubhart,5,"In this book, Lee Smolin proposes that universes can be naturally selected for based on their production of black holes. He calls it ""Cosmological Natural Selection."" It's an interesting idea and Smolin is careful to point out that it is more speculation than established science, although his theory is testable and he proposes tests for the theory. Smolin is good at acknowledging criticism of the theory and does his best to defend it. Once I got the hang of the idea, I was ready to be done with the book as Smolin repeatedly beats dead horses and reiterates his points. I don't blame him. He has to be careful, but it doesn't make for easy reading. My favorite part of the book was the appendices where he gives background information on physics necessary for understanding the ideas presented. While mathematical ideas are discussed, there is not a shred of mathematical formalism in the book, although Smolin points carefully to excellent sources if the reader wants such material. That said, this is not a book for the average layperson who is mildly curious about cosmology. There are more appropriate survey books on the subject written by well known authors. My compliments to Smolin for clearly distinguishing what is science and what is speculation in this lengthy discussion. My impression is that he truly cares about his audience's understanding. I recommend this book if you are a serious fan of physics. "
19,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1076961-scotchneat,4,"I love Lee Smolin - he never seems to be afraid to push past assumption, to seek lines of inquiry outside of the narrow bounds of physics specialties and he doesn't lose his wonder in the world.Right from the start, Smolin says this book is speculative. Not that it's founded on no science or bad science, but that he pushes ""what if"" into some areas that might blow our minds (my words).Without giving too much away, he wonders whether or not the constants that we assume to be unchanging might actually be parameters that have changed slightly over time in a universe (universes) that actually is more like an ecosystem that evolves. Pretty cool stuff and lots of brain food.Since we can't see what happens on the other side of a event horizon of a black hole, what if what actually happens is that a new universe is born there, and ours is just one in an evolutionary chain and our black holes are birthing others?And how is it that our place, Earth, stays in a perpetual state that denies the law of entropy such that it can support life? i.e. non-equilibrium? Ultimately this is also a book about how we might jump start our next inquiries into the Grand Unified Theory by rejecting that our assumptions that things like constants and atomic interactions have always been as they are.Neat!"
20,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10453388-roland-allnach,4,"I first read this soon after it was released, and though I would not consider myself an expert by any means on the topics of astrophysics, I did feel comfortable to dive into Smolin's book. For those who are wary of 'science' books, I feel comfortable to say that the science curve is not daunting at all, and there are several symbolic examples, which seem to revolve around cats- so for feline fans, maybe add half a star. Nevertheless the book drifts more to the philosophical rather than the physical, and I for one enjoyed this transition, as concepts such as string theory and nitty-gritty astrophysical ruminations require a thought pattern somewhat 'alien' to what we normally encounter in everyday life. Given as well that much of these concepts are in fact theory, the trend toward the philosophical is more understandable. But what I found perhaps more interesting was the feel one gets for the way in which men such as Smolin construct their thoughts, and it gives a more humanist perspective on the theories rather than just numbers and equations. And yes, given the time that has passed since its first printing, I'm sure there are more scientific critiques that could be formulated for 'Life of the Cosmos', but it is still a very educational read, and quite enjoyable."
21,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/181139-lynn,4,"Review to come when I have more time, but quick impressions: I generally like Lee Smolin's books, and this one is no exception. The first four parts of the book are very good and thought-provoking. The last part (mostly about quantum mechanics and attempts at quantum gravity theories) is a bit more hand-waving and weaker in my opinion, though there are interesting chapters in this part, too. The book is not overly technical -- e.g., I don't remember any equations -- while presenting interesting topics in physics and cosmology and a good read for those not already immersed in the subjects. Smolin has since come out to be far more skeptical of string theory and certain other theories that are en vogue -- this book is from the late 90's -- so he probably doesn't agree with everything contained in the book any longer. It's still a valuable read, though, taken in conjunction with his more recent writings. There's plenty more to say about this book and I might do so later, but that's good for now."
22,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7201264-anthony,4,"I thought this was a very well written scientific piece of work by Smolin. He proposes an alternative hypothesis to the ”multiple universes” answer to the question of why the universe appears to be fine-tuned to life. I found Smolin’s suggestion to be slightly more believable and credible to the multiple universes theory, based primarily on the impression that the latter appears to be irrefutable as a theory given our existing scientific methods . In fact, Smolin makes painstaking efforts throughout the book to adhere to the scientific method and stay away from speculations bordering on mysticism and other irresponsible speculations. As a reader, I could occasionally glimpse his passion and awe for the nature (which I also sympathize with) wanting to “take him there” , but his brain and the training as a scientist are strong enough to hold him back for well controlled shots within the fairway, which I like very much. Being audacious within the boundary of rules – a very disciplined book on the nature of the universe from a very disciplined mind."
23,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95178-eric-k,2,"So Lee Smolin is like really fucking smart. Here he tries to explain Newton, Liebniz, Einstein, relativity, grand unification, &c &c to the interested non-physicist and.... fails. I really wanted to like this book. Lots of brilliant people I know recommend it highly. But it's a convoluted hyper-abstract snoozer, too philosophical for the scientist yet still too esoteric for the layman. This book reminds me of why, despite pseudo-deep 3am geek bull sessions freshman year of college about time travel and the speed of light and black holes, I never took physics again after high school. Smolin sets out to write just for that kind of person, just for ME, but only irritates me into remembering why I turned from that path."
24,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35876-jonathan,4,"This book will blow your mind. I thought that I was pretty well caught up on the state of theoretical physics today, but I was apparently very wrong. Smolin does a great job of getting the reader up to speed on the current ""crisis"" in theoretical physics; the lack of a unifying theory between general relativity and quantum theory. He then presents his own arguments for some pretty radical frameworks that we might use to bridge the gap between the two. This book was not an easy read at all, but it is well worth the effort, because it is as much a philosophical journey as it is scientific, and the ideas are pretty astounding. "
25,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1330476-kev,5,"I don't want to give too much away. Just read this. The one thing I learned is that my instincts are really finely attuned & I should just trust them. Relativity, Quantum & Chaotic Complexity Theories are linked & taken together change the face of our understanding of reality. Theology & philosophy must be fundamentally rethought as a result. The Continental Post-Modernists were on the right track. A particular Post-Post Modernist of my aquainence is very much on the right track. I'm honored to know him. And, I agree 100%."
26,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289106-alex,5,"this book was mesmerizing. Smolin does an excellent job describing the beauty and scale of order in the universe.In doing so, it takes one through the entire history of astronomy and astrophysics in an engaging manner.and it's all done to support a severely plausible darwinian evolution of physics using singularies as the 'cycle' of the fabric of space time, a' la rees '7 things about physics' suspect physical constants.Even with such a wild conclusion, I didn't spoil a thing!This should also be an approachable book to those that don't follow regularly but are interested."
27,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5361322-ivan-vukovi,5,"One of the most illuminating books on theoretical physics I've ever read. I think every theoretician should read it, the ideas are very provocative and you can see how carefully Smolin thought about them by the manner in which he explains it.I have to admit that I AM a physicist and I am obviously biased because topics in this book are exactly what I find most interesting, but I have to say that I'm surprised at how much I actually learned from a book without a single equation. That takes real skill and Smolin has it. I'm looking forward to reading his other books!"
28,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12180-krischelle,0,"I was right there with him, devouring the pages, but he lost me near the end when either it got too technical or I got too tired of reading on the metro for 2 hours on the way to and from work... I'm not sure which."
29,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2670200-rodney-gitzel,4,"I bought this after reading his more recent 'The Trouble with Physics' and... seems he grew as a writer between the two. :(This is also thicker with physics, making it a slower go. I've put it down, for now."

31,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22810670-gary,5,Wow. A plausible hypothesis for a cosmological natural selection. In addition a very informative lesson in the construct of the physical universe and clear explanation of a relational vs absolute universe. A GREAT read.

Smolin brings fresh ideas to the table, offers a lot of unique ways of looking at something, and does a lot of my favorite thing: getting you all excited about an idea, just to kill it. The first novel I picked up on the cosmos, and it's still one of my favorites. "
134,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21295041-william-ash,5,"This is a really great read. This covers the current thinking in cosmology today. Yes, it is speculative, but is just fascinating. Smolin writes in a great style that takes complex ideas and makes them accessible without dumbing them down. "
135,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22810670-gary,5,Wow. A plausible hypothesis for a cosmological natural selection. In addition a very informative lesson in the construct of the physical universe and clear explanation of a relational vs absolute universe. A GREAT read.
136,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31104786-dave-peticolas,4,"A wide-ranging work of science and philosophy, centered around the idea that further progress in physics and cosmology will require the abandonment, already initiated by general relativity, of any conception of absolute space or time. Fantastic. "
137,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7291786-alexi-parizeau,5,"I'm amazed by how clearly this book manages to interweave philosophy, cosmology and theoretical physics. And that this was accomplished entirely using non-technical prose is astounding. I found the whole book incredibly stimulating. Really looking forward to his more recent work now!"
138,0195126645,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82832-sean-garrett,4,Interesting look at theoretical physics; for anyone who wants to have their ego shattered by complex questions of existence.
